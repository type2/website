Subject: Re: [T2] NLA license plate lens seal

Have you tried Bus Depot? Ron lists it here:
http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=211943131D

Although it is NLA in ETKA for a long time and there
are none in the USA at dealers, he may have a repro
seal.

If not, then your choices are limited to a good used
one or making one. Since it fits 72-79, good used is a
good possibility.
