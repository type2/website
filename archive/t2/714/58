It's harder to tell in person, especially if you aren't looking for it. If 
you had the patience, and if the shop didn't mind, you could probably dig 
through there stock and find a closer grain pattern. That is if they have 
any on hand. The shop I used had to order a sheet of that color first so I 
was stuck with it. The sample piece that I got from Formica was much closer 
in pattern.
