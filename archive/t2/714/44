Hi again, guys and gals.  I'm slowly working on
restoring my '76 Campmobile.  I just got in my new
seat padding from Wolfsburg West.  Looks fantastic! 
Can't wait to get them redone.

The wood-looking veneer is starting to peel on a
couple of my cabinet doors.  Any suggestions?  Can I
just buy the veneer and re-do everything?  Can you
still get the same veneer?  

The old bus is still, as one of you so aptly put it,
purring like a Messerschmitt. I've got to replace
those stupid connectors on the starter.  They keep
popping off.  Why didn't those ingenious Germans use
screw-type connectors like everybody else?  What a
privilege to drive a bus, though.  Thanks...KR
