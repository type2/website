Unfortunately, a couple of pieces are gone.  Maybe I
can find a couple of doors or a section with a good
piece that I can take off.  Mine are still in good
condition except for about 5 square inches in two
places.  But I'd have to replace the whole section. 
It's on the two doors.  I'm no freak about originality
and thought that it might be neat to find a
cedar-looking veneer or something to be different. 
But then I'd have to do it all.  I know, some of you
won't approve.  :(  Thanks...KR
