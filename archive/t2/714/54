In that shot http://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/172836.jpg  the small 
cabinet door and drawer are redone and also the sink/stove cover. I also had 
the spare tire cover done as well. I had a local cabinet shop do all pieces 
for about $150, that includes one sheet of the Formica. Here you can see the 
spare cover.
