Thanks. The sticker on the spare cover is a stock item. It is also suppose 
to have a silver foil sticker right above it that says Campmobile. The only 
place that I have seen carry it is www.aircooled.net

The spare on the late Bay Westies was in the cabinet behind the driver from 
the factory. The front nose mount was usually a dealer add on/option. On the 
early Bay's it was in the rear wheel well.
