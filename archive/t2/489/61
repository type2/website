From the way I understand it there is a flap, which ever fan is pushing more
air pushes that flap open.  Unless at idle the engine fan is much more
powerful.  The above the engine fan does run as long as it is on but does
nothing other than waste electricity at anything over idle speed.

I do not know the CFM's of the engine itself so don't know if a bilge blower
could overtake the engine fan.  Anyone???
