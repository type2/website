Subject: door handles

A crazy thing has happened to my 71 Weekender. Suddenly neither the driver nor passenger door will open from the inside. Admittedly I only open the passenger door very infrequently from the inside. The driver door became disabled over a period of a few days, then I noticed the passenger side having the same problem. Both will open readily from the outside. As yet I have done nothing due to time constraints, but when I pull the door panels off, what should I look for ?  It's a bit awkward to roll down the window to open my door from the outside. Suggestions?
