Subject: transmission sounds

Hey'all,

Something weird has begun, and this has started since it's been getting
pretty cold here in central BC ... well first I start the van with the
clutch in ... habit I guess, then I make sure it's in neutral, and then I
let the clutch out.  Only lately, when I let the clutch out, I can HEAR my
tranmission turning.  It's like ... an unpleasant grinding sound ... almost
like the sound a hoola hoop makes when you spin it on the ground.  So uh ...
yeah, is this related to the cold, or what is it?  The sound goes away after
the engine is warm, and does not act up again upon succesive warm starts.

Also related to this, around the time I noticed this sound I also noticed
that when I let the clutch out in neutral, the van lurches forward ever so
slightly.  This normal?  ... It's just that the original engine from my girl
went a while ago, so now I'm fearing the trans will expire soon.

peace increase,
 - Ian
