Jason, really a neat setup, that should work well and with less noise since
you've taken one blower and put it outside.  You are going to love the
amount of heat you'll get out of that setup!!  Thanks for sharing the pics.

Where might I be able to mount a Stewart Warner Model 8332-12 Bus heater??
I am guessing the orig spot was the aux battery tray but I use that.  Any
other good places?  Is it one I could mount under front floorboard?

I haven't finished it completely yet. Basically I have the heater
section in the cab under the seat. the pump/comb air fan sits in the
engine bay. I have enough room this way to keep my aux battery as well
as to get to the spark plug. I haven't pulled the engine with it
 installed yet, but it looks like not much would get in the way. I plan
on putting together a bit of sheet metal and make a supply air plenum
to distribute the air comming out of the bottom of the bus. HTH.
