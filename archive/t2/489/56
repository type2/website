stock Bus switch -- the dome light switch from a '71 -- to a convenient 
ground at one of the belly pan bolts. The switch is a very simple one, 
and it looks stock. I haven't gotten around to getting one of those 
little "fan icon" inserts for it, but that's a bonus item that can 
trick out your installation. If you have a stock headlight switch, you 
could try the dimmer for the gauge illumination to control fan speed, 
but I think the little wire inside is too thin to carry the load.<<

Jason,

i very much like this setup that you are describing. do you have any 
pictures of your setup that you can share?

also, i think that Chris Mills brought up some very good points about 
the location of the fan in regards to the CO issue.  my question is - 
could a setup like Jason's negatively affect the system in the way that 
Chris describes on a Type 1 motor, where the squirrel cage fan never 
existed in the first place (at least not that i know of).

the reason i am asking is b/c i would like to explore the possibilities 
of using a setup like Jason's on my 69 Single Cab.

thanks,
