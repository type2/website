%interestingly enough, IIRC, they were all for the same
temperature(260

That's interesting.

The heat tabs on my engine were attached to the heads just beside the
spark plug holes.

Any idea what the normal operating temperatures are on the heads?

I did a search on google and the folks at ramva were talking about 350
deg F.
