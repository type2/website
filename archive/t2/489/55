Which is why mine is going into the spare wheel well in the back of my '77
bay.  I'll have it sucking fresh air from inside the bus and blowing into
the stock fan housing (with the fan removed, mine is shot anyway) via a
cutout and ducted through the wall of the wheel well.

With the well insulated and the blower covered with an insulated cover, I
hope to reduce the noise from the blower a bit.  I also plan on a "speed"
switch to govern the blower's output.
