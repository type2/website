Subject: Re: [T2] Heat: Atwood Bilge Blower?

Hi Joel,

The system I set up is very similar to the one that J.C. Wh*tney sells, and 
could very easily be retrofitted to either a T1 or a T4.  Unfortunately I 
don't have pictures of the setup.  However, it was pretty easy for me to 
just hold the blower up to the flex duct, mark off the length of the blower 
minus 2", make the cuts, and put the blower in place.  I got the 3" Detmar 
blower, and the ends of the flex duct fit right over it and secured with 
hose clamps.  The key to my whole setup is the hole in the frame member 
where the flex duct passes through -- be sure to leave enough duct that the 
blower gets pressed against the frame member.  There should be enough of the 
blower sticking thru the frame that you can clamp the flex duct on the other 
side.  Once in place, wire and use!

I've thought about CO trouble, but my HE's are pretty new (25k since new 
engine), and I don't suspect I'm poisoning myself too badly.  Since my Westy 
windows still leak pretty badly, I figure I'm getting fresh air in there 
whether I want it or not.  Still, a CO sensor is probably a good safety...

Good luck!
