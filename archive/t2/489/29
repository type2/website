They sell it to a reprocessing plant, or at the very least have a contract

I've been told by some straight veggie oil (SVO) burners that restaurants 
typically pay to have it taken away.  Whatever you remove for "free" reduces 
either the volume of grease or the frequency with which they have to pay to pay 
someone to remove it.  

I'm guessing (and hoping) that if you don't create a hassle or a mess, they 
(particularly non-franchise restaurants) don't mind much.
