There is a fellow around here that has done this conversion,,Subaru engine
in Late Bay, and it required a lot of modification to his gas tank.

So, if your willing to put a BIG notch in the center of your gas tank to
clear the injection intake housing on the subaru engine, go for it!

You could relocate you fuel tank I guess that might be another option,
when he was done the original fuel tank looked like a "C"

he also grafted the subaru gas tank sender and fuel pump into the original
bus tank.
