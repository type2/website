Subject: Heat: Atwood Bilge Blower?

Greetings,

'78 Westy

I've just read the archives and have a few questions.

How well do these work? I would love to hear from people who have tried one. 
I am thinking of installing one. How did you install yours? Wires, location? 
ect. Could a switch be installed that controls the speed of the fan? 
Archives suggest a headlight switch? Would a bus headlight switch work? Does 
it need a relay? If so what kind and is there already one on a bus? (I have 
a spare bus)

How noisy are they really? What about installing it in place of the stock 
blower with a "y" to go to both heat exchangers? Or install it on one 
exchanger and the stock blower (with one side closed) blow to the other?

Seems like by mounting it in the engine compartment you address the noise 
issue and the issue of running heated air through a plastic fan.

I also thought about getting another stock blower fan, say out of a junk 
yard, and having a blower for each heat exchanger. But how to wire? Splice 
off of existing blower or new system? I'm no wire expert, yet.

Many Thanks,
Brandt
