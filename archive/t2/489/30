Subject: What I use for big oil pressure relief cover screw

For that giant slot in the oil presssure relief valve screw-
I used a small metal working hammer (flea market toolbins) that came to
a sort of long point at one end the hammer while the other end was
around 3/4" square- remove the handle (this one was cracked, what gave
me the inspiration)- I ground the last 1/4" to parallel sides- to use,
stick a screwdriver into the handle slot, giving you nice leverage as
you push up with your outher hand on the square end.  Works perfectly7
and no slipping out.
