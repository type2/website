David,

On a stock standard 78 bus, I have 2 blacks on the positive side of coil.

The other side should have a green wire from the points and the "white"
wire that tells the ecu what the rpm is.

If you are getting a 1/2 inch spark then you have half the battle....now 
for the ecu knowing when spark occurs.....

If the ecu sees no rpm then no gas ever gets injected.

You *need* a flashlight!

Cheers, dave
