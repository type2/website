Subject: ice on the inside

Sometimes.. if I had driven the van inside a garage for say an oil change or 
something. The humid air gets in the van and ice happens when it cools.  Or 
if there are alot of people in the van breathing hard ;)

Or even when there are just two.. ;)

I plug my van in when I can.. I have a 900 w car warmer on the inside. It 
keeps the van perfect for eliminating most buildup.
