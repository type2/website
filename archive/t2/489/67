Subject: Heat: Recirculated Air

Hi Folks,

All this talk of blowers and recirculated air has me wondering: where does 
the "other" end of an air recirculating duct go?  I currently have a hose 
going from under my Westy icebox, through the firewall where a gas heater 
duct would go [planning ahead], and into the engine compartment just past 
the firewall.

Should a hose then go to the tin near the engine fan to take advantage of 
the fan's intake?  Will the engine run hotter if it's constantly breathing 
warmer cabin air?  Is there another, better, spot (other than the intake 
fan) that can be used to recirculate air from?

If anybody has a good "san-o" setup for this, I'd like to hear about it.

Thanks in advance!
