Subject: Re: [T2] TDC Sensor electrical information

I am not sure about your vans, but the flywheel on mine is indexed by a pin. Looking at one of my flywheels, it looks
like the TDC (variable reluctance) sensor will pick up two roll pins that look like they bracket TDC. From looking into
the top of #1 cylinder, it looks as if the first roll pin is passed as the piston is still moving up almost at the end of
its travel, while the second roll pin is passed when the pistons start traveling back down.

It should generate a signal that looks something like:  ____|--|_______|--|______, i.e., a pulse whenever one of the roll
pins pass. I am not sure that one could use this to statically find TDC (which is how I wanted to use it), but you could
use it to accurately determine/set ignition timing when the engine is running, if you had the rpm information. Which is
what I guess VW used it for.

National Semiconductor sells a variable reluctance amp, LM1815. The data sheet can be found at
http://www.national.com/pf/LM/LM1815.html

Now a simple solution to finding TDC without always looking inside the engine or relying upon the fan pulley (which has
more slop than the flywheel with regard to rotational indexing), is to just mark the flywheel, through the hole for the
automatic transmission tube if standard or through the TDC hole. Of course this must be done before the engine is
installed (luck for me as mine is still in the living room).
