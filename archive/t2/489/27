Subject: Distributor rebuild questions?

Hi All:

I have some questions on the rebuild of my distributor (VW 0220905-205S
Vanagon Federal 80-83):

1. What is the endplay spec for the distributor drive shaft?
Minimum/maximum. Any idea where I could find this or other information
on Bosch distributors?
2. Bus Depot sells a rebuild kit for the shims, but does anyone know of
a kit that carries the plastic parts that hold the centrifugal advance
springs? Bosch number and supplier?
3. I want to remove the centrifugal advance cam from the main drive
shaft. It seems to be held by a wire spring clip (under the felt oil
plug?). Any suggestion on how to remove and install this clip?

Regards,
