Chris,

Does the needle move a bit when the gauge is energized? (i.e. When the key
is turned to run). If so, it is working and wired correctly. It should go
from below the lowest number, to just at the lowest number when it is
powered on.

How long have your trips been, and what is the code of your engine case?

If you have a hydraulic engine case the sump plate sender can be extremely
slow to react, to the point of looking like it does not work. I have
experienced this first hand and done some empirical tests.
