I'm a big fan of the stock system for this year range, as it is very
durable, relatively non-restrictive, fits properly, and is not
expensive. A complete stock system (complete with OEM European made
muffler, tailpipe, and install kit) is only $152, with your 5%
listmember discount. That's the way to go.  Link:
