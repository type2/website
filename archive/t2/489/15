You're working on the wrong end of the bus.

Go back and remove/clean the ground strap from the battery where it
connects to the body.

Now, crawl underneath (maybe jack up the passenger side a bit for easier
access) and check the tightness of all the wires on the starter solenoid.
If they're loose, remove them, clean them, put them back on. Use a spider
washer under them to hel get good contact.

**DO NOT** over tighten the nut on the starter solenoid. It is not attached
to anything inside the cap as it is just a contactor point. It is simply
embedded in the bakelite cap. The cap WILL break if you wrench on that nut
too hard. Then you get to pull the starter and replace it.
