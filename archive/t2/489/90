Doug,

The two things that can help move a heavy bus are an increase in
stroke and a high torque cam.

Go with a mild stroker crank (74 or 76mm) with 85.5 pistons or larger
strokes (up to 82mm) with 90.5. You would want to avoid 92 and 94
pistons/cylinders.

Then choose a cam that improves low end torque. Aircooled.net can
probably provide some advice. Crower is cam manufacturer that
classifies cams according to the expected operating rpms. So you might
want to add a tach to your bus to figure that out, then choose the cam
that focuses on those ranges.

For cooling, an oil sump helps. I use CB Performance's thinline filter
sump in the 2276 in my bug. It provides an oil filter as well. Oil
temperatures don't go above 190 deg F.  You might also want to add
full flow plumbing. I've seen a picture of someone with an external
oil cooler mounted on the engine cover of a bus cooled by a couple of
fans.

You might also want to consider a vacuum advance distributor too.
Again, aircooled.net might have a solution.

Hope this helps.
