Subject: Re: [T2] Routing gas heater into stock heating system

Hi Ted,

Once upon a time (1986) I had a 72 westy that had very lame heat. I 
bought a BN-2 beetle gas heater from a local VW shop and installed it 
inline under the bus. I just removed a section of the dorsal heat pipe 
and plumbed the BN-2 inline. I ran a cable from the reset relay up to 
the dash of the bus and then boxed in the frame with 1/4" plywood.

It worked well enough, the air supply coming out of the dash was a LOT 
hotter after it was installed. The BN-2 didn't seem to impede the 
airflow much when the heater was off, either.

Funny thing was, I didn't find out about the BA-6 until 1998.

Happy trails,
