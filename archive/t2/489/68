Subject: TDC Sensor electrical information

Hi All:

There used to be a web page with information on the TDC sensors in our
vans (see the type2 mail archives) but it looks as if it has long since
vanished. I am looking for information so that I can get mine working
and actually use it to find TDC in the future.

Any sources or wisdom from the group?

Regards,
