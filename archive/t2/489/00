This is for display purposes only...So you get an idea of the way the
tool works...But it here, buy it there, but this is what I use to drill
a straight hole if I can't get the piece to my drill press...Mine says
Craftsman, but the Portalign Tool Company makes it...It works quite
well with left handed drill bits i.e. the thread is reversed on the bit and
it drills in counter clockwise. I've taken a broken stud out, starting with 
a pin bit and stepping up the bit sizes with each pass...Sometimes I've
gotten lucky and the bit "catches" as it's drilling backwards and the 
stud unscrews with the bit...YMMV, of course, and if the head is off and
you've got the wherewithal to take it to a machine shop, that'd be my
first best recommendation...
