You say you have a 1970 bus. In that year the bus
still had a Switch on the dashboard to operate the
windshieldwipers. The switch on the steering column
was introduced with modelyear 1972 (august 1971).

This might indicate a bad contact between wires. Check
if the big red wires on your solenoid are making good
contact. I had one of them loose last summer, I had
the same symptoms (no electricity in the car
whatsoever).

If the contact is weak then you can get power when you
turn the key the key to 'contact' but as soon as you
ask more by starting the engine the contact gets too
much power I guess and doesn't pass on any electricity
anymore.

Also check the battery contacts.

I see your name is 'Van Tassel', are you from The
Netherlands?
