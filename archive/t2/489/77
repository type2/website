Richard,

The question is whether the coil functions on *all* tdc's or just number 
one....if just number one, does that imply that everyone put their 
flywheel back on a rebuilt engine correctly?  Mine is still there on my 
original engine...like you though, just haven't had time to look yet...
and the windchill here this morning is 11 degrees!


I would have installed it on my new avp engine, but didn't have the
time to figure out how to get it out of the case without tearing it up!

Did it just have 2 wires on the plug end?

Cheers, dave
