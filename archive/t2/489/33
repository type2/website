%"Rock hard" is a relative term.  You shouldn't be able to compress a
good
%lifter by hand but it'll still do it's job properly when subjected to
the
%forces existing in a running engine.   If you look in your Bentley
you'll
%see that one way suggested to compress a lifter outside the engine is
to put
%it (horizontally) in a vice and use the vice as a press.

If you were to look at a catalog like Jegs or Summit, you will find
lifters with anti-pump up mechanisms.

Pumped up lifters are those which are unable to bleed down and
therefore remain "rock hard" i.e. act like solid lifters.

A pumped up lifter should be replaced during a rebuild and I believe
that that is what I found in my rebuilt engine.

As someone kindly pointed out, 1200 miles over 1 year means that the
Vanagon was sitting a lot. That means that the lifters would have time
to bleed down. If you have 7 bled down lifters (partially or
otherwise) and one that is still "rock hard" you have to suspect that
there is something wrong with that "rock hard" one, especially if it
was on a cylinder with 60 psi compression.

I'll be bringing that one lifter to a VW shop over the next couple of
days to get an opinion. We'll see what happens.

Anyway, the important thing now is to get that Vanagon running again.
Anyone know of a dance that brings fair weather? :-)
