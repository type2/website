I've wondered if the sensor fires only when the engine is running rather than when it's aligned with the flywheel.

Something I've wanted to do for a long time is hook up that sensor and the coil to a scope and compare the difference in angle between the spark and the sensor to accurately set the advance if the sensor is cooperative.
