Had one of these on the Silver Bullet 66 westfalia bus we had once.  5 minutes was 
maximum run time if there was a passenger!!!! it even had a flat vent that routed 
back under the floor and vented to the rear area.  Actually has been only the 2nd 
fully functioning heater I've owned.  the other was a BN-4 in a (originally) 
passenger 65 hardtop we converted to a westfakia deluxe.

unfortunately now i 'possess' about 4-5 heaters installed and not but none in 
'operating' condition.  i have saved ALL the posts lately and might actually take one 
of them on since everyone has been so successful lately.  :-))
