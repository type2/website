Subject: RE: [T2] door handles

I had a similar problem once. I took the door panels off to do something and
when I put them back on, neither door would open from the inside. Turns out
that if I over tighten the screw that holds the black plastic "finger guard"
thing under the actual handle, it hits something inside and stops the handle
from opening all the way. Something like that. I just loosened the screw about
a 1/2 turn and it has worked fine ever since. Not sure if this is your
problem, but it is an easy check.
