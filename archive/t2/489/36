Subject: Routing gas heater into stock heating system

Has anyone ever routed their gas heater into the stock heating system?  I'm
wondering what the pro's and con's are in doing something like this.  If
this was done, how would one block off the heater boxes?  Would the defrost
work better?

Any ideas or concerns would be greatly appreciated,
