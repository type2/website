Guys,

They came on my avp rebuild and two of them fell off while sitting on the 
engine stand.....I put them back on with jb-weld.

If you go and look them up, they are not supposed to "fall off", but 
simply change color once the temperature that they are reated for is 
exceeded....

interestingly enough, IIRC, they were all for the same temperature(260 
degrees farenheit)....regardless of the engine...water or air.

Cheers, dave
