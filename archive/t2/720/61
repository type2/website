Subject: Re: [T2] Parts availability

It's really funny Kevin because I was about to post the exact same 
thing. you were 5 minutes faster !! ;-)
not only the list should contains obsoletes part but also parts from 
other manufacters that people have found which could fit the original 
one with a few modifications.

I can help you on this Kevin, when you'll have a list ready, I'll be 
willing to put it on my website and upgrade the list regularly
