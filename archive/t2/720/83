Someone once suggested - that if you sit in the driver's seat - put both 
knees under the steering wheel and push up as hard as you can - then take 
the biggest hammer you can find - and give the center thing that the 
steering wheel attached to (under the horn button of course) - the biggest 
whack you can - and keep whackin' - you should be able to get the steeing 
wheel off undamaged - Kahuna tells me it worked for him.
