This is really one of those calls. The very best advice is, "if it's
out of tollerance pull it and rebuild" period! Now that asside if you
don't mind driving knowing that something "could" break due to out of
wackness of the engine, lots of people have for a lot of miles. It's
the movement in the main bearing that I would worry over. Could just
be a set pin, but sure doesn't sound good.
