Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum advance

From Kevin:

 I don't know what carburator I have.  I'm sure it's a
 Weber.  Does anyone know how I can tell what model
 without taking it off?  And what year did they go to
 vacuum advance on the distributor?  My Haynes (idiot)
 book says that they would have had it in '72.  Mine's
 a 76 that used to be fuel injected, I guess.  Hey,
 that's why no vacuum advance!  Never mind that
 question.  All the earlier ones probably had it.  OK,
 so should I put one on it?  Will it require a new
 distributor?  Is it even worth it?   I'm going to
 re-time the engine when I get around to it and can
 borrow a timing light.  Maybe that will solve it.  So
 many questions, so little time...KR

ALL factory 72-79 buses with the typeIV engine came with a centrifugal advance dist WITH a vacuum advance. FI
or carbs had nothing to do with it. Some had dual vacuum units: retard and advance, others had just advance.
Your 76 is the prime example of either one.
Up to vin: 2x6 2077583 had the dual unit
From vin: 2x6 2077584 had the single unit

Your bus with a Weber and a 009 must really run ...... I won't finish the thought.

Timing it with a light won't help much until you throw away that dist!

72 had two Solex carbs. If you have one carb in the middle, it is 99 out of 100 a Weber.

You also mentioned 'rumbling after you turn it off'. This is commonly known as 'dieseling'.
It comes from diesel engines that are shut off by cutting the fuel supply from the cylinders.
The engine runs on because the idle speed is too high.
Diesels do NOT have distributors to adjust timing. [the injection pump is timed to inject]

On cars, the run-on affect is corrected by the idle solenoid on the side of the carb. It shuts
off fuel to the idle circuit. If you do not have a idle solenoid, lower your idle speed!
This is why there are factory specs for idle speed. But you have a problem..... you don't have any specs for
timing or idle speed because you are not using factory parts.

For the best choice of factory distributors, find a mid 76-78 bus dist.

You can spend more on a SVDA dist from one of the vendors, but this is a cheaper way to go.
