Subject: Re: [T2] Parts availability

I suspect that the after-market manufacturers have
already looked into it and would make the additional
parts if demand warranted it.  So many of the parts
have such a long life-span that not enough people are
looking for one specific part at any given time to
make it worth-while to manufacture.  But they are
available used.  I'm just amazed by how many parts are
available after-market!  

I have thought about a re-designed campmobile with all
the modern conveniences. Re-designed cabinets and such
to accomodate Satellite TV, good fridge, microwave,
laptop, etc.  That might be a kit that would sell. 
But then many have done that on their own, as will I. 


Cheers...KR
