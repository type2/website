Subject: Stuck in Princeton BC

Hi All,

Was driving from BC to Manitoba.

Am stuck in BC, between Princeton & Hope, nearer to Hope.  Had oil spraying
over the engine from something open on the side of the oil filler. Wiped
down the oil, Stopped it up and carried on.  Before long smell of burning so
stopped again, looked inside to find smoke coming from the crankcase.  So.
What do I do now?  Am almost too scared to start the motor again incase I
blow it.  1600 in a 71 bus.  Have just picked it up from being repainted.
Think maybe engine was not reinstalled properly.  Any ideas?  Have to get it
off side of the road otherwise RCMP will tow it.
