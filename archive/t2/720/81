Subject: Re: [T2] Steering wheel

From Gerald V. Livingston II

Grant has some *NICE* 17.5" wheels but they list adapters for every VW
*EXCEPT* late bay buses. If one of the other adapters would work I might go
that route in the future and just use one of my busted ones for now.

Well, your 73 is NOT a late bay :)  So maybe they have an adapter......

The split for early and late bay steering wheels/columns is:

68 to Early 74 to Vin 2x4 2164 059
Late 74 to 79 from Vin 2x4 2164 060

Good luck removing it without some kind of puller. I never get them off at the yards. They 
self-destruct looking at them. I like the later ones better, they have a spline not a taper.
