OK I'm coming in late here, so If I missed something let me know. The
type4 cases tend to last quite a while before needing to be rebuilt. A
good indicator for this is to measure the crankshaft endplay. This
sure will not tell you the entire story, but if it's tight the chances
of the bottom end lasting go up. Might be worth looking into.

Now as far as a rebuild, I can say that I still have the longblock I
got from Dolan years ago all machined with new parts waiting for me to
assemble it. Making time for the rebuild has been my problem. I spared
no expense getting the best I could afford with my budget, but alas it
still sits in my garage waiting. I'll eventually get to it, but I
drive the holy (-at-)#$% out of my 66 w/ a stock 1600, so I have not been
motivated to do finish the project. I would recommend just shelling
out the cash for the rebuilt and enjoy driving the bus.
