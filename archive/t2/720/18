Subject: Re: [T2] I need new heads! (advice?)

 I will not replace just heads on a customers bus. Ron is right on the AVP 
heads they are such a nice treat and we are lucky to have them available. 
My take on rebuilt engines is this;

buying a rebuilt engine because it is cheap, is like buying food because its 
cheap. Sure it cures the hunger, but you're going to pay for it down the 
road.
