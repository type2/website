Amen to that.  Lockhart Volkswagon in Chattanooga, TN
looks like a junkyard.  But they know what they're
doing.  And the guy that works on my Jags is
unbelievable.  But whatever he touches ends up with
grease on it. Naturally, he doesn't use paper in the
floorboards.   Once I heard a customer ream him out
because of grease on the seats.  He said,
nonchalantly, "They're Conolly leather, wipe it off." 
I'll take a dirty expert over a neatnic half-ass any
day of the week.  JMOH....KR
