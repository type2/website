Subject: Leaky Carb-Need Advice

Hey Folks,
    Well this week ain't been too kind to me. In addition to coming down with
the flu, my right side carb started leaking('75 Westy with a '74 dual carb
engine). I had a pair of spare carbs that I rebuilt using the Royze (sp?)
kits, and then I heard the gaskets in those kits are crap, so I took them
apart again and reassembled them using gaskets I made from Felpro heat/fuel
resistant gasket material. Despite being sicker than a dog, I put these carbs
on Thursday, and the bus fired right up, took some minor tweaking, but got it
running smoothly and took it out for a test drive-all is well and Everybus is
a GO! Today I go out and find a huge puddle of gas under the left side of the
bus. Left carb is leaking fuel all over the place, can't really see where it's
coming from. Pull the air cleaner off and look down the throat of the carb and
it's a constant drip. I pull the carb off and take it apart again-my guess is
that the float is not hitting the needle valve and shutting off the flow of
gas. As I said, I cut my own gaskets, but I made 100% sure the float has full
range of travel, and isn't hanging up on the gasket. I bent the float arm down
slightly and put everything back together-bus fired up, but now making a
muffled backfire from the left side exhaust-looking into the carb (engine off)
still see an occasional drip-what have I got wrong here?? Damn, I wish I still
had a fuel injected bus!!     Jeff
