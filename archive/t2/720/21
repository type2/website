Kevin,

Listen to your "best VW" guy.  After my Dad's ordeal and listening to 
people on the list and trying both Gunk penetrant  and PB, I only use what 
little wd40 i have left for wiping tools off.

There are much better things than wd40 for getting stuck nuts and bolts 
loose.

There are also much better lubricants than WD40...I believe most of us on 
the list have "graduated" from WD40....Don't get me wrong, that used to be 
the only thing I bought...LOL!

The big thing is *don't* spray your spark plugs with anything!  i got the 
idea that there are probably lots of things that can "poison" the ceramic 
in the plugs...

Cheers, dave
