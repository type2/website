I've been using the same interstate battery for 9 
years now and its been in a 71 squareback, 72 super,
66 bug, 78 westy, and after sitting for a year its now
in my freshly restored 68 bug. Besides the dry cells,
I think interstate batteries are top notch. I also 
tend to put bigger batteries with higher CCA than
stock. Do you do maintain your battery?
