Hi,

Thanks for the links.

I did not  use any WD-40, however Colin and I did use Gum-Out carb
cleaner spray to clean the plugs. So, perhaps that was the culprit. No
more things sprayed on the plugs for me.

Perhaps we can add gum-out carb cleaner to the list of things to keep
away from your plugs. When I get some new plugs maybe I'll have some
time to experiment with the old ones.

Thanks!
peace
