Interestingly enough, we had really good results using a product not 
exactly designed to do what we used it for.

AVBLEND was a consistently good performer in short/long-term tests in 
certain applications, and when I consulted with a few of my ex-Navy 
pilots who still flew, they swore by the stuff.

We also liked Kroil, Howes Lubricator, and (don't laugh) Ballistol.

Ballistol seemed to be a favorite of the wrench wranglers who had used 
it before, as it had plenty of alternative applications. Plus, the 
general consensus was that since it was non-toxic and biodegradable, it 
was a better choice for the environment.

Your mileage may vary, of course.
