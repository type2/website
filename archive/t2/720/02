Rob, and anyone else traveling through the Delmarva peninsula,
I'm heading out of Ocean City, MD Friday to head down to Everybus, so 
p-mail me with your contact info. If you need any help/parts/whatever, 
give me a call and I'll see what I can do. Also, if anyone is passing 
through later than Rob, perhaps we could meet up and carabus.

Later,
Dan Dypsky
