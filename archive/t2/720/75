This is going to sound primitive, but a hatchet and hammer will slice

vintage OG steel will part like the Red Sea did for Moses once you get 
the technique mastered. I hammered a hatchet through the sheet-metal 
around the tail-light housings when I harvested the parts to create the 
westfakia; it was not difficult at all, but you will want a pair of 
snips or a hacksaw if you plan to cut through a seam.

Practice on a less critical area of the vehicle, and leave some room 
around the part you plan to keep so as to not stretch it.

Happy trails,

Very primitive but... it worked out great! Thanks for the advice.  Uesed a 
mallet and an old hatchet I had. I sharpened it the other night and sliced 
though the rear hatch in no time.  I made the cut extra wide.  The hardest part was 
chisling through the spot welds.  Thanks for the advice. 
FYI, I looked at a Vanagon rear hatch.  It was much too large.  It would not 
work with my camper rear cabinets.  I'll save this hatch and look for a type 3 
hatch to see which might work best.  Thanks to all for all the helpful advice.
