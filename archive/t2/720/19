Excellent oil debate: http://p083.ezboard.com/ffjr1300ownersassociationfrm12.showMessage?topicID=536.topic

Addresses synth vs. dino oil, aircooled engines, old vs new engine designs, oil change interval, Amsoil vs. the rest of the world, etc.

'78 Westy - Corvair implanted

Corvair implant update: new garage is almost in order. Going to tear down my spare engiens so they are light enough to store abov ethe floor. My spares are smaller displacement Corvair engines and I want to save only the evternal accesories (cooling, charging systems) and engine block. Internals like pistons/cylinders/crank/rods - all smaller than the 2.7L engines go to a friend.
