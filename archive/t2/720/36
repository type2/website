Have you guys ever heard of Ballistol Oil.  It's from Germany and was
developed in WW1 for metal and wood protection (and wound dressing) but I
have found it to be much better than anything else on the market for
loosening rusty parts like bolts and whatnot.  I used it on a 1960 Cadillac
motor that wouldn't turn.  I sprayed it in the sparkplug holes once a day
for 3 weeks and was finally able to turn the motor then hooked up a battery
and started it.  I swear by it.  I use it on all the tractors I restore as
well as my '82 and my '66 Type 2's.
They now sell it here in the USA.
Check it out.  http://www.ballistol.com
and no I don't work for them I just think it works the best!

Hi,

I just went through something similar. In my case the problem was spark
(lack thereof). After much hair pulling I decided to pull the plugs and
check them by "turn[ing] over the engine with the plug base earthed" as
Stephan suggested you do.
