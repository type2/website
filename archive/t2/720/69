Subject: interstate batteries

I think it is me cause since i have owned my bus for
about 6 years i have gone through 2 interstate
batteries. Luckly they have had 72 month guantrees on
them is it me or am i getting bacd ones. Just today
sat i had to pull my second one out of my bus luckly
last year i installed a aux battery one of thoses dry
cell cost you a arm and leg batteries. I hooked my
charger up to it and by tomorrow i will have a frestly
charged battery ok i feel better now i had to vent.
