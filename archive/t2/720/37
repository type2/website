I remember standing there the first time I pulled a Beetle engine wondering HOW that engine would fit through the opening if I pulled it out the top - the obvious method to me for a short time. 

Went and got my Muir's "Compleat Idiot" and began to laugh when I realized the CORRECT answer. <grin!>

I took the deck lid off and pulled it out the top with a come-along.>
