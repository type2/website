Subject: Fuse box mounting location and orientation - 70 Bus

Hello,  Does anyone have a pic showing how the fuse box is mounted to the
body?  I have the box and the mounting frame but cannot figure out the
mounting location and orientation.  The mounting holes in the fuse box
bracket do not seem to line up with the existing holes in the body.

Thanks!

Scott
