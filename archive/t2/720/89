That's what I was thinking. My first reaction was to put in more
shims, but the mechanic who is helping me said that would put more
pressure on the main bearing and make it fail faster. He is the one
who thought the main might be loose and checked for and found that.
But he thought it could still run for years like that. We are not
tearing down because the engine really warrants a complete rebuild.
Compression is down to 107/8 on the left bank, and valve guide wear
causes occasional plumes of blue smoke on startup. Not having the
funds to completely recondition, we are going to see if he might be
right about this engine still possibly having years left in it. I just
wonder what to expect in terms of what will happen when it finally
goes bad. How will I know when it has failed and is time to pull it
again? Will it be catastrophic or gradual, and how will I tell?

Thanks,

John

 This is really one of those calls. The very best advice is, "if it's
 out of tollerance pull it and rebuild" period! Now that asside if you
 don't mind driving knowing that something "could" break due to out of
 wackness of the engine, lots of people have for a lot of miles. It's
 the movement in the main bearing that I would worry over. Could just
 be a set pin, but sure doesn't sound good.
