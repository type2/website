Subject: Steering wheel

Does anyone have a good steering wheel that will fit a '73? I have 2 with
busted up bakelite around the hub and I *THINK* I have 1 good one in the
other storage unit. I need to have 2 good ones.

Do the splines on late bays match with any other VW's? Ie. will a steering
wheel from some other model work?

Grant has some *NICE* 17.5" wheels but they list adapters for every VW
*EXCEPT* late bay buses. If one of the other adapters would work I might go
that route in the future and just use one of my busted ones for now.

Trying to get the steering wheel off of the Riviera now to get it "out of
my way" for wiring and I haven't found a puller to fit. I'm afraid if I try
to tap it up with a mallet I'll completely destroy the bakelite around the
hub. Looks like that's what someone tried in the past. Suggestions?
