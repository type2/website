I pulled the motor on my 72 for pilot bearing repair, and found my
endplay too great (0.014) and  due to movement in the main bearing.
What can I expect if I keep the engine in service?

Thanks,

John

 OK I'm coming in late here, so If I missed something let me know. The
 type4 cases tend to last quite a while before needing to be rebuilt. A
 good indicator for this is to measure the crankshaft endplay. This
 sure will not tell you the entire story, but if it's tight the chances
 of the bottom end lasting go up. Might be worth looking into.
