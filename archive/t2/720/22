I agree. Look at the MSDS of the two and the WD-40 is basically solvents with a little oil. The other is light oil with a bit of solvents.

I have replaced WD-40 with another rusty bolt spray that has more oil in it (name escaped me as usual). Seems to do a better job at keeping the rust on my tools away too.
