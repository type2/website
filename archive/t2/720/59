make sure engine is cold,
can you turn the engine by hand, make sure ignition is off,  then
disconect coil and try cranking it with the starter. just a little, make
two complete revolutions of the engine,
  make absolutely sure the engine has sufficient oil.
  make sure the oil light comes on when ignition is turned.
  if all is well at this point you could probably start it long enough to
get off the road. but watch it closely.

good luck...if the engine is any good might be better to just call for a
tow CAA or similar if you got it.  not sure how far your trying to go..
