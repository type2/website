Subject: PCV Valve Replacement?

It looks like the PCV Valve for my "CV" engine is no longer available.

Part Number: 030-115-327A

I guess that I will have to use one from a different make and hook it up
with hoses.  Has anyone done this or do you have any recomendations as to
which PCV valve to use?

My Timesert kit for the oil drain plug still has not arrived, so my Bus will
be down for another week.
