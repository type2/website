Subject: manual trans fluid

Hey everyone,



I changed the fluid in my transmission. Man, it stunk big time. I know the
stink means it was well due for the change. I also had a yellow foam come out,
a good = quart, what is that, and what does it mean? Anyways, very glad I
changed it. Smoother shifting here I come! (fingers crossed)

Also, when I was looking at my tranny, I couldn't figure out what kind it was,
how do you tell? Mine had 3 ribs towards the back and one rib towards the cab,
is this a 3 rib transmission?



Thanks,



Max Bronsema
