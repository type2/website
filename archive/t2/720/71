Subject: Bed for '70 Campmobile Bus

I am looking for a Z Bed for my '70 Campmobile, & have found one at a  VW 
artist? [wants $250.00] also found several yet un priced at salvage  yards &  I'm 
wondering what is the going cost?  So I know if this  guy is really artistic 
or what I can face to face offer the salvage yard.   I do understand that it's 
worth what I'm willing to pay, but since I won't be  putting it in for a few 
months I have time to shop for the best price.  Is  there a fair & reasonable 
price on these things?
