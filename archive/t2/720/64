Hi Ginny,

Here's what I would do:
(1) Check the oil.  If low or empty, add oil until it reaches the "full"
mark.
(2) Make sure that the thermostat isn't stuck in the closed position.
(3) Reach around the fan shroud behind the generator and make sure there
aren't any plastic bags etc. stuck in the fan.
(4) For that matter, I also would verify that the fan belt is in place...

Turn the key to the "on" position but don't start the engine yet.  Are the OIL
and GEN lights (two red lights under the fuel gauge) on?  If they're on,
that's good!  Now start the engine.  Do both of the lights turn off?  Perfect!
At that point, I would drive gently to the next exit and find a longer-term
place to stop for further investigation and/or assistance.
