Subject: Re: [T2] Parts availability

Joe at BustedBus seems to think it would number in the
thousands (NLA parts).  Might be too much work.  I
like the idea of a list of suppliers by part, though. 
Let me know if you want to collaborate.  Of course,
we'ld need assitance from the whole list, especially
Karl and some of the others who know every part on
them.  I've done a lot of Googling myself to find what
supplier has what part.  Not easy as you get so much
crap on their lists.  But I'm game.  Thanks....KR
