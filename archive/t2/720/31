I heard a story about ingenuity during the Great Depression when people
were migrating to California to escape the dust bowl. During that time it
was not uncommon for fan belts to be replaced with belts or ropes. But one
of the most unusual cases was when someone needed to fix the crankshaft
and not having a jack or a cherry picker available they tipped their car
on its side to do the work.
