Where do you find this stuff, Karl??  I got lost on
that page for a while.  Thought surely that 'GAP'
meant 'Gay and Proud' for sure.  I was wrong on that
one.

WD-40 has it's uses.  It's great in door locks.  I had
a buddy ready to call a locksmith and I doused 'em
with it and they work fine now.  But I won't be using
it to try to loosen anything.  Three-in-One would
probably do just as well.  

What do you think about electrical contact cleaners? 
Some people say don't waste your money.  Thanks...KR
