Subject: Spinnin' Seat

So .. the passenger seat in my 78 isn't spinning right (OK - maybe spinning 
is the wrong word).  Anyway - pulled it off and cleaned it all up - what 
were they lubed with?  Sure does NOT seem like grease - I'm betting it was 
some sort of wax - likely the same wax the Bentley says to use on the 
pop-top hinges.  Anyway - what should I be usin'.
