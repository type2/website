Subject: Re: [T2] 411/412 engine into a late bay

Hi Barry,

YES to the engine. I DUNNO to the tranny. The engine is a direct 
bolt-up; but I would bet against the tranny being compatible.

I know for certain that Access Bob has used a 1.7L 411 engine as a 
spare on his bus during rebuilds. The Potts clan is currently 
refurbishing a 411 engine for use in a 1975 westy.

You could use the original D-jet FI if you have *everything*, but in 
both cases mentioned above the L-Jet FI from the bus was used instead.

ISSUES:
The 411 engine has the oil filler/dipstick in an awkward location, 
(integrated into the case breather) and the D-jet heads have case 
pressure relief hoses that will need to be capped off (our plan) or 
integrated into the L-Jet plumbing. You may also have to change the 
flywheel. Ours came to us from an Automatic 411 so the flywheel had to 
be changed out anyway.

A good idea if a 411 engine is readily available.

Happy trails,
