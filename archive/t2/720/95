Subject: vacuum advance

Hi guys and gals.  I was toying around yesterday and
decided to retard my timing just a hair.  If the
engine is hot, it'll rumble a bit after you cut it off
and I've had to run leaner than normal to prevent
back-firing.  Well, I got to looking at the
distributor and it does not have vacuum advance at
all.  I don't know if it has been removed or if that
distributor never had one.  But that would certainly
affect how the engine runs.  

My engine runs like a clock.  Always starts strong
(now that I put on a new S-87 starter), idles fine,
etc.  But after you turn it off, it might surge a bit,
or even a small back-fire.  It had a nasty back-fire
before I leaned it out.  Still runs good, though.

I don't know what carburator I have.  I'm sure it's a
Weber.  Does anyone know how I can tell what model
without taking it off?  And what year did they go to
vacuum advance on the distributor?  My Haynes (idiot)
book says that they would have had it in '72.  Mine's
a 76 that used to be fuel injected, I guess.  Hey,
that's why no vacuum advance!  Never mind that
question.  All the earlier ones probably had it.  OK,
so should I put one on it?  Will it require a new
distributor?  Is it even worth it?   I'm going to
re-time the engine when I get around to it and can
borrow a timing light.  Maybe that will solve it.  So
many questions, so little time...KR
