Subject: WD40 thread

If any of the mechanics (as in, your "real" job) receive Professional 
Tool & Equipment News, they might remember an article done a few years 
back (1998-99 I think) that explored all the various penetrants (quick 
giggling, you guys) on the market at the time.

We'd just come back from the AAIW/SEMA show in Vegas, and had bags full 
of stuff.

WD40 was deemed pretty much worthless by the test panel, which included 
writers/editors, as well as wrench wranglers.

I wrote the article. (I was the Editor in Chief back then)

Good times...
