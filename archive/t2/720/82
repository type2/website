OK (oops). How about no Grant adapter/install kit for buses period.

AVAIL      YEAR                     MAKE                                    MODEL
No        1960 - 1979        VOLKSWAGEN VW        TYPE II TRANSP.

I'll bet the one "good" one I have is from my '74. I recall it coming off
with a wiggle and pull by hand. I didn't realize there was no taper on it
at all and there is on the '73. <sigh>

So, will a steering wheel from any other model fit? I seem to recall people
with bugs being able to install early Rabbit wheels or some such.

Here's a list of the Grant VW adapters that ARE available:

They're sorted however the Grant site search engine sorted them. I just
copy/pasted the info then went through and removed the ones that had NO in
the AVAIL column.
