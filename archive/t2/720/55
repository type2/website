Subject: Re: [T2] Parts availability

Sounds like a great thing you guys are doing.  I'm
sure I'll be buying some things from you as I get into
my project.  Thanks...KR

<Kevin,

As far as new parts go the list is huge. There are
tons of parts that are not available new. It would be
impossible to say how many (hundreds? thousands?).

However, what is not available can and is in most
cases available used.

Not to say anything bad about new parts venders, which
we are, that is, we sell new parts just like everyone
else out there but, .....here's a little story for
you.

BUStedBUS.com AKA Mitchellmotorworks.com started 5
years ago with just that in mind. I purchased a 20
year old VW and Porsche recycler. Every salvage bus
that comes or came through here was and is dismantled
completely. Every part is made available to you. Not
just the parts that aren't available new either. Those
used parts which are also available new are sold a big
saving to you. As far as quality goes? A lot of the
parts that are available new are, how do I put this
lightly,...worse then the one that you are replacing
it with.?

We differ from a standard pick and pull. We have
already removed the part cleaned it, inspected it,
repaired and painted it.(if applicable).>
