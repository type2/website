Subject: Re: [T2] shocks & tires..!!oh my

well just got back from getting new tires. and while the tires were off
put on the new Koni shocks...nice....but $$$$$$$$ yikes..

and of course when I need tire the Hankooks are backordered weeks....so
had to use the Michelins Agilis 81 tires.  now that is some serious tread.

so far only driven about 5 miles home from the tire shop..noticable
difference.  couldn't get the 205/70R14 tires anymore had to go stock
185R14 so they do look skinny to me but the steering is much lighter.

we shall see.

Bob
