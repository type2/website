Hi Volks,

EveryBus shirts, etc.

RED CUP!!!

</Greg>

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



Hi Everyone,
If you have visited the Everybus website recently, you will have
noticed that Suburban is proudly sponsoring this 4 day carnival of red
cup carnage.
As such, I thought rather than hoping to bring you to the "suburbs"
someday, we are bringing the suburbs, to you. Yes, we are that evil.
Here's the zoning plan for the suburban invasion.
 
SDC Shirt Shoppe:
In the past I have done shirts on site. Well, not this time. The
thought of bringing a screen printing system across the border is
intimidating at best, so this time around I am leaving it at home. (all
the better, that means more time behind the controls of a red cup). I
am however bringing a fresh supply of fabric fun. I will have a limited
quantity of Red Cup Ale shirts, some old event shirts, and a few "Ben
Pon" art shirts.
   
Belle's Tattoo Shop:
The only thing better and longer lasting than an event shirt, is an
event tattoo. Pending any last minute issues, we hope to bring the
Belle's Mobile Tattoo Studio down to you. Yes, even kids in the suburbs
have tattoo's. Damn punx. Here's your chance to get a permanent
reminder of Everybus05. We already have a couple of appointments
booked, so at this point it will be a first come, first bleed. For
those less adventurous, we will also likely have the henna sets with
us, to safely, and non-permanently fill that inky need.
 
Fuzionart Glass works:
This is heather's day job. She makes glass art. So for this year she
has come up with some pretty cool sun T2 Suncatchers. In various
colours to match your bus! Each suncatcher is cut from various pieces
of glass. Each piece of glass is then assembled and colour dusted. They
are then "fired" at temperatures higher than a 1500 sp going through
West Virginia. The result is amazing. If only I could cook dinner as
well as she cooks glass!
 
Doom's Garage:
Once again I'll have my pinstriping paints and brushes with me. Tonight
I was out practising on tractor trailers. Nothing whips you into shape
quite like a $200,000 tractor, and a driver who makes you feel like
"lunch".
   
Red Cup Ale;
I am lucky enough to have a friend who has a clue when it come to
making beer. He also has the patience to show me how to do
it...okay...he let me hand him the tools and wash the bottles.
Anyway, Mr. Greg has produced a batch of true Canadian Ale. It's even
red! Stop by the Canadian Pavilion, you can't miss it, and ask for it
by name, "Red Cup Ale". A beer by any other name, just ain't the same.
(Hey Greg, I just made that up)  
 
So that's about all folks. See you in LESS than a week. (my gosh, I
better get the bus running).
