Subject: Parts availability

You know, it occured to me the other day how fortunate
we are that there are more after-market parts
available for our vehicles than just about any other
vehicle on the road.  I'm amazed that you can get
anything from a fender well to a trash can, either
from VW or one of hundreds of after-market
manufacturers.

Seems to me it might be beneficial to have a list of
unavailable parts.  I know there are quite a few, but
a small number compared to what is available.

Does anyone have a list?  Or would anyone be
interested in having me compile one?  If everyone
submits to me the ones they know of, I'd be glad to
put it together and post it here.  Or would it be more
trouble than it's worth?  

Thoughts?   KR
