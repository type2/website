I've been using it for years on my guns,  It actually mixes with water
which is quite cool for an oil.  I like the fact that I can use it to both
clean and lube my guns and have used it on the bus on occasion.  It is also
non-toxic and has a nice smell which goes away after a while.  I started
using it when a gun dealer told me about it back in 93 in VA and I'm just
now starting to see it on the west coast.

Have you guys ever heard of Ballistol Oil.  It's from Germany and was
developed in WW1 for metal and wood protection (and wound dressing) but I
have found it to be much better than anything else on the market for
loosening rusty parts like bolts and whatnot.  I used it on a 1960 Cadillac
motor that wouldn't turn.  I sprayed it in the sparkplug holes once a day
for 3 weeks and was finally able to turn the motor then hooked up a battery
and started it.  I swear by it.  I use it on all the tractors I restore as
well as my '82 and my '66 Type 2's.
They now sell it here in the USA.
Check it out.  http://www.ballistol.com
and no I don't work for them I just think it works the best!
