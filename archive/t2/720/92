Subject: Tent trivia

I have two westie side tents. One is from 1969 and the other from the mid
1970s. I use the latter model tent, as the 69 canvas is so nice I am saving
it. Anyway, three of the four the top corner parts are broken on the 70s
poles, so I got out the 69 poles and they were ok. They did seem stronger
all around though less attractive as the paint is scratched up. I weighed
both sets, the poles from the 69 weighed 33 pounds, and the poles from the
later model weighed 27 pounds, so they are made of heavier material.
Assuming the alloy is the same, the earlier model has 20% more of it.

Good info to have when shopping for a tent.
