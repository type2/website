Subject: Re: [T2] Bed for '70 Campmobile Bus

Not sure if you are looking for a full width bed or the original 3/4 bed for your 70 camper?

Depends where you are and the availabilty affects price. I have no idea where you are:)

But here in Fresno, Calif I can get you an original 68 - 72 Westy bench/bed for less than $50.
The 74/75 full width Westy bed is a little tougher to find. But I just sold one for $75.

> I am looking for a Z Bed for my '70 Campmobile, & have found one at a  VW 
 artist? [wants $250.00] also found several yet un priced at salvage  yards &  I'm 
 wondering what is the going cost?  So I know if this  guy is really artistic 
 or what I can face to face offer the salvage yard.   I do understand that it's 
 worth what I'm willing to pay, but since I won't be  putting it in for a few 
 months I have time to shop for the best price.  Is  there a fair & reasonable 
 price on these things?
