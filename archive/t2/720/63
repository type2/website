Subject: Koni shock settings

All,
I'm hoping to install the group buy Koni shocks this weekend and I'm 
looking for some pointers as to a good initial setting.
Ithaca's roads are a bit rutty at this point, as is the driveway of the 
house I'm building, and I'm not really doing much highway driving 
either.
Any suggestions?

Thanks
