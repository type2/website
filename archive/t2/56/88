I'm sure George has noticed that most of the motorcycle rags write to
impress themselves much more than they do to actually inform people. With as
many years in motorcycles as I do in VW's they have always been to me little
more than comic books, more so than the rags for VW's. At least in Hot babes
and dune buggies, if there's not a useful article, there's at least the
babes.
