Subject: 1980 Vanagon for Sale in St. Louis


Regretfully, I have to sell Bluebird my 1980 air-cooled Vanagon camper.  It has
a rebuilt engine, stove, sink, refrigerator and minimal rust on the body (came
from California).  Please e-mail me privately if seriously interested and I will
send you a photo as attachment.
