Pure mechanical 25=B0 advance dizzy, set initial at 5=B0 BTDC and you will h=
ave
something like 30=B0 total, which can't hurt your engine. You won't get as
good of gas milage with the 050 as you would with a stock dizzy set up
advance vac only, no retard vac. Can testify that the 050 works not at all
bad on Porsche 356/912, but that is considerably something different that a
T-IV.

Those Weber Progressives can be set up to run decently, at least better
than worn out stock carbs, but the jets have to be right for the motors
demand so must be tested upon first install, and perhaps find that jets and
emulsion tubes will be required to make it run properly and not harm the
life by either too lean or too rich throughout the rpm range.=20
