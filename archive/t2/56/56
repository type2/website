The article shows a lack of care that causes me to take it with a grain of
salt.  The early reference to BMEP makes me think that the author is
writing to impress, not to inform,  Brake (not "Break") Mean Effective
Pressure is a value used to calculate engine output and efficiency, not
ring sealing.  What the author really wants to use here is simply cylinder
pressure.

Also, keep in mind that this article is written with motorcycles in mind
and most motorcycles use different materials for their rings and
cylinders than our ancient VWs.

I'll stick with the 2000/20 breakin myself.
