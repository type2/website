Subject: Re: [T2] valves-from hydraulic to manual OK? 

I do it all the time on bus engines. The pushrods are the same length
but the material is different. Hydraulics are steel. Solids are fat
aluminum. Also there is a difference in the spacers between each pair of
rocker arms. Solids have springs, hydraulics have spacers and wave
washers. Any other car but VW, you can't put hydraulic lifters on a
solid cam. The solid cam has a faster ramp speed on the closing side.
Having a fast ramp speed causes the lifter body to move faster than the
piston inside then the lifter pumps up solid and holds the valve open.
Bus cams are cut the same between solid and hydraulic.

Karl, 
You layed some hydralic lifter's on a solid cam? Are the push rods a
different length? 
I never could figure out why in the heck hydralics couldn't be put in an
engine with a solid lifter cam. 
Both cams are hardened. 
The face of the lifter regardless of what type it is is hardened, so it
shouldn't wear out. 
What is the big deal?
Sounds llike a reasonable set-up to me.
