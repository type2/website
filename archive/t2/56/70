Quite an entertaining article.  It is obvious to me that the "Seinfeld"
episode with "The Maestro" is taken directly from this interchange.

All this banter about cams and used lifters has enlightened me.  I have
always thought that my 76 Bus had hydraulic lifters, so I never thought
twice about them.  Come to find out, it doesn't.  I guess I'll have to pull
out the Bentleys and figure out how to adjust the whole mess, and maybe I'll
get more than 9 mpg out of the tired, but still well running engine.
