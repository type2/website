That's probably enough pressure to rip a CV boot right off'un there.
Probably blow the grease out of a Cat D-9 link pin. Very dangerous
procedure. Keep an ear out for your bearings starting to rumble what with
the grit and water/steam forced into the rear hubs. More than garden hose
sprayer force is a bad idea for lots of places on a vehicle. Even that is
too much directed at shaft seals unless a soft low pressure spray is
employed.
