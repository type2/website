Well said.
As an additional FYI:
Only the pushrods/lifters were choice used. I only mentioned those since that
was the topic.
The bus itself had at least 192,000 miles on it. The reason I say 'at least' is
because that is what the odometer showed when I bought the Westy. However, the
bus lost 1/10th of a mile for each mile I drove it because of a cracked gear in
the speedo. I did not know how long it was that way before I bought it.
It used a quart of oil every 100 miles. So I pulled the engine and disassembled
it. I found no damage to the bottom end. The main and rod journals were still
standard, the cam lobes were still like new. I only needed all new bearings. The
pistons and cylinders were junk, so I replaced them. I questioned the list about
NPR P & C's.... just about everyone pooh-poohed those. Well, I am VERY happy
with them also. The heads were fine. No guide wear. All I had to do was remove
carbon. The valve seats and valve faces were fine. After lapping them with fine
compound, nothing else was needed.
