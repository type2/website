You'll need a Shaman for that, too. Low level skills won't do, and the
spray can stuff is only sold by charletans.

I'm not saying it can't be done, just that it takes much more than middlin'
skills to do a functional job that will last. Even if done well, the market
value will then depend upon a much smaller segment of T-II wannabuys.
