Plated crap has no smell, the plating process seals the terd forever. it is
definately worth the added money..

Don't bother going into the hills, I'm there now, the terds go up hill too.

I never stated anything to offend anyone, I could care less if people want
to take risks with patching things up, it does not and will not have my name
on it so in reality I posted here and got in trouble, as always.
