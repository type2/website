Stan, Jake:
Actually, there are 3 profiles.
1.The original 411 profile, which was used in all Porsche 914's and 912E's as
well as 72 and 73 type 2's with manual transmissions(can't remember about the
74 and 75)
2.The softer mechanical cam developed for the automatic 73 type 2's. This
engine developed 62 hp as compared to the 66 hp developed by the stick
camshaft in 73.
This cam was also used in all 76 and 77 engines.
3.The hydraulic lifter camshaft , which has the same basic timing specs as
#2, and was fitted to type 4 engines in 77-83 type 2's and Vanagons.
All hot rodders probably have had it drummed into their heads (since Hector
was a pup) that mechanical lifter cams are ground with clearance ramps built
in to take up the clearance. Hydraulic lifter cams do not have this feature.
Having said all this, apparently it works just fine to run the hydraulic
lifters on the mechanical cam. (It is not tested to do the opposite). The
hydraulic lifter does not seem to object to the clearance ramps.
The Chevy crowd also has access to something called Rhoads lifters, that vary
the duration according to the oil pressure, I believe. I also believe that
they are made to be used on mechinal lifter camshafts, as well.
Karl (who is a real Mercedes mechanic and gold prospector, and genuinely
exists, according to Steve Dolan and others) has tested this combination MORE
THAN ONCE. And for many tens of thousands of miles. (Re his own hooey posting
earlier today.)
