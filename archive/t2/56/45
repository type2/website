Some good info here. I do a quick break-in drive to get things started for
a client, and it includes starting from a stop on a steep grade and
accelerate under medium throttle through the first two or three gears, then
idling or light loads long enough to evacuate the heat. This loads the
rings and shaves off the ridges in the crosshatch. About three iterations
and typically you can feel the horsepower come up in the seat of your
pants. Proof of instant improvement of seal. Only after this first run can
you make the final "initial" adjustments to the valves after cooldown and
mixture after running to operating temps again.
