My mistake, I guess I never understood YOUR problem.

Your whole 'mismatched hardness' opinion is based on aftermarket CRAP you buy.
You put together how many engines in a 13 month period that would not last more
than 100 miles using 'mismatched hardness' aftermarket parts?
I put together 2 engines over 6 years ago that have a combined mileage on them
of over 175,000 miles using Original Equipment good used parts that have matched
hardness....
And then you say I must have LUCK??

End of discussion.
