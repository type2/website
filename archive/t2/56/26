Tim is exactly right on with his procedures. So many people trash their
heads with "Chevy knowledge"

The guides must first be milled down to the spring seats, then the heads
heated to 180°C/300°F+-???, then the guides driven out through the
combustion chambers, and the guide bore brushed and cleaned and measured
and recorded. All 4 of them before the head cools. Then back in the oven
while you either turn each guide custom for the actual measure of the
particular bore or cool the head and bore all bores to new oversize for
standard overside guides, then back in the oven to return to install temp.
Then you drive them in with a drift that provides perfect depth or risk a
bit too far, with the heads at proper temp and some tallow for lube. (Hint:
for even easier insertion, chill the guides)

New heads are very popular for surer results, as the few with the
skills/tools to do this right charge what it costs to actually get good,
reliable results, and that typically is not much less than new heads.
Competition Engineering does proper Porsche air cooled heads, and the
procedure is much the same. They have the equipment to do this work right,
but may or may not respond for similar service to VW heads. They probably
would do T-IV Porsche heads, so a Bus T-IV head wouldn't be a stranger on
their jigs.

You can easily break these heads into chunks with Chevy procedures. A great
many have been trashed by ignorance of spezial procedures.
