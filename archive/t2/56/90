Subject: 73-75 Auto trans vacuum source

On my 73 1700cc bus Auto trans the Primaty Throttle Pressure is controlled
by a vacuum unit. Does anyone with a 73-75 Automatic know where this vacuum
source is?  Along my brake servo vacuum line ~13mm hose just after the check
valve is a "Y" with about a 3mm branch not connected at this time.  Could
this be for the trans?  the connection to the trrans is about10mm, so I am
left wondering? The trans needs either manifold vacuum or throttle vaccum,
but this tap after the check valve is intriuging.  Oh yea i put in fuel
injection so any connections to carbs I will have to convert.

Automatics from 75 on were basically from the rabbit so they may not have
this at all.
