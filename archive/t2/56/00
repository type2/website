Subject: 76 teardown

listers:

got the heads off the 76 engine today to see why this baby was parked 10(?) years ago. bad news. #3 exhaust valve broke at the valve stem and the business end of the valve did unspeakable damage to the head & piston. Also, the back (inside) of the piston cracked and some small pieces are likely in the case.

questions:

should all cylinders/pistons be replaced?

should both heads be replaced if I do one, and is used okay?

I'm 10 minutes from CB perfomance. Should I have them split this case to inspect cam/crank/innerds? Anyone ever used them for this with a t4?

this engine had a factory(?) a/c compressor mounted to it which I will not reuse. makes "air" noises when you spin the drive pulley, so I assume it functions. what would it's value be and if anyone's interested, let me know.

thanks y'all

Billy
