Subject: 76 teardown and ignition lock removal

Been out of town for a couple days.  Having recently
corrupted both my daughters into believing that the VW
van is the world's most perfect (and most fun) vehicle
and "camping out" in the driveway in our "new" 74
westy, I returned to check my inbox stuffed full of
digests.  

And I have to thank you all.  That 76 teardown thread
is a wealth of information from some of the best minds
in the business!  And the thorough pictures on the
lock teardown website!  I don't know how I could hope
to maintain a 30 year old vehicle without this list. 
Thanks all!
