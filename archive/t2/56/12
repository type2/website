Yeah....Change those components and mis match hardnesses and find yourself
walking!

Cams and lifters must start and end life toghether, they are an inseperable
set, unless machined and then the process starts all over again.

FYI the Hydro and solid cams have 2 different profiles.

Keep it solid, adjust the valves and drive it.
