Know that these won't mate up properly to the bus tin.  I ran a set for a 
year or so because I was excited by the prospect of significantly less 
weight hanging from the under-engineered exhaust studs.  They also give you 
a bit more ground clearance and if I remember they make valve cover R&R 
much easier.

The drawbacks are that they don't put out nearly the heat that the bus 
exchangers do, and as I said they do not meet up properly with the bus 
tin.  You need the 411-specific  cover plates (which connect the bottom of 
the exchangers to the case), the front (FIF) left side tin piece, and 
possibly even the 411 top cylinder cover on the left side (not sure on that 
one - I didn't get that far).  They are not a "straight swap".
