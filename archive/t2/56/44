Some people have better "LUCK" with junk engines than others. Mechanical
things are all about luck, there is always something that will break, the
question of when and how is alwasy tough to think about.

Before I started this as a profession I played for years, I can honestly say
that I have built good engine from junk, old parts. For years I never had
cam problems, mismatched lifters and etc were just fine, then all of a
sudden it all changed. for 13 months straight we were absolutely plagued
with cam failures, from every suplier except web cam.

Old cams, with old lifters sometimes will work, I'm not a gambling man,
especially on customers engines, being shipped all over the world.

Try the swap, drive for 100 miles and remove the oil filter, cut it open and
see what you find.if it is magnetic particles, then hold on you are in for a
ride!
