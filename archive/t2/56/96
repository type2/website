Or to look at it another way, how much of your money would you get back had
you bought the $20-30k mini van. I buy in to the philosophy that if I own my
vehicles, I'm paying myself, not the finance co, ins co, et al., i.e. if I
don't have to make that monthly payment I can put that $2-500 payment in a
repair account and if I don't have any repairs, I'm money to the good. In my
case, I paid 10k for a late model astro,(got to have a tow vehicle) have had
no payments for 5 years. Finally had to put a tranny in, hmm $600 for trans
repair equals about 2 months of payment, works for me. On the other hand, if
I was making a monthly payment, maybe there wouldn't be so many buses around
and I'd have more room.
