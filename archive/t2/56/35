Hi all,
  two summers ago I made a trip out to our local VW
dealership.  If anyone here knows of the Toledo Ohio
area, you will know that there is only one VW dealer
left in town.  Well I made a trip out to Perrysburg
where it is located and the only guy that saw me was
the one at the gate... Driving up in my 1970 Westy.
  I parked next to some new beetles and got out and
walked the long way around so it looked like I had
parked somewhere else.  I was not there too long
before a salesman came up to me to toss out his
line.... When he asked, I replied "I want one of
those" and pointed at my green westy.  Dude about laid
an egg trying to say that they didn't get many of
those in and he could look for one.  After a while of
him hemming and hawing... I fessed up that it was my
bus and I wanted to look around at the VW's and see if
there was anything nice around.  I even offered that
he could take my bus out for a test drive, but he
declined and gave a nice excuse.  
  That was the most fun I could have in one afternoon
looking at cars.  Then I took off to the Army Surplus
store down the street and bought some cool stuff for
my bus.  
  Wavin from Michigan, still chuckling over the
salesman's stammer.
