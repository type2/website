The reason for this: They are only pre-heaters for the BA 4 gas heater. The 411
used a bus-style blower motor up top in the air intake. This blew air thru the
mini boxes into the BA 4 mounted above the transaxle.
The BA 4 gas heater was an option. On 411's and 412's without it, they ran full
size 72-74 style heater boxes.
There is also a difference in the 2 fresh air pipes that go thru the upper
cylinder tin.
