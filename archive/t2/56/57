Shawn,

Internal or external?  Sears sells a *beautiful* pair of large *external*
snap ring pliers...  I have 'em, I love 'em, I used mine an hour or so ago
to take the ring off the CV's.  Alas, I have never seen an equivalent for
*internal* snap rings.  If you have, *PLEASE* let me know!!!  Especially
post the Sears part/tool number!!!!

The ring I am removing, BTW, is ~72mm or near to 3" in diameter.  A BIG
murphy.
