Al,
There are actually 14 different profiles of stock cams for the TIV engines.

They range from the automatic trannied vehicles, to smogged 914s. The cam
for a very rare automatic 91`4 was also it's own. Web cam located all the
cam cards for us, the differences in the cams are not much, mostly lift and
lobe center changes.

 There were only 4 of these really used in busses. The automatic cams have
two raised lines just outside the center journal that go all the way around
the cam. The non autos do not have this.

Getting back to the root of the conversation, if you change lifters you must
change cams, no matter what the profiles. The hardness of each must match or
you WILL have troubles. I have 4 pages almost done for my site that shows
the disasters of non matched cams.

Of all the things I had to get bitten by when learning, the cams were the
worst. Since we have changed to WEB CAM for AL our cams and matching lifters
the problems have been ZERO. next month will make 4 years since we swapped
to them the extra cost of the product is more than worth it.
