??? huh, I bought my wife a 412 from the dealer way back when and there
was no mention of it as being an option, it was just there....at least in
the USA I have yet to see a 411/412 without one

the Chilton manual which is the only one that mentions it says "the Type
4, which also comes standard with an auxilliary gas heating system"  later
it says "the gas heater runs on gasoline from the fuel tank and is
avaliable as an option on type 2 and type 3 models  (section 6-12)

maybe you are thinking about the type 3??
or maybe non USA models?
or maybe the Chilton is wrong, wouldn't be the first time
