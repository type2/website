You're bringing back some old memories here!
Strangely, VW's don't always have the same size of OD on the valve guides. Try
hammering in a new guide and it may drop right in, or it might go in really hard
and break the boss (part of the head).
You are completely correct in that the valve guides need to be measured  and
custom turned to provide the correct interference fit.
