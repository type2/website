Apparently maybe something is amiss with the link I sent? Maybe this will
work. Go to my site and click on repairs/scans on the front page. Then click
on the link entitled Ignition switch repair. If this doesn't work I am
sorry. It works on both of my computers (different ip addresses). Just
trying to help!!
