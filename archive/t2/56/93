Subject: Re: [T2] Breaking in an engine (really long :-)

Thanks for thorough comparison!  I didn't know about that article on the
t2 site so I'll go find it.  Also, I found an article on the
aircooled.net site that says the engine should be run at 2500-4000 on
the initial run because 2000 rpms don't properly oil the cam.  hmm..
here's the link:

http://www.aircooled.net/gnrlsite/resource/articles/engnbrkn.htm

Another difference that I noticed between the aircooled and the
motorcycle procedures is that the motorcycle one says never to lug the
engine, and the aircooled.net one says it's ok to lug the engine. 
hmm....
