Subject: Back into Bays

Hi Volks
I am back into Bays after a brief absence of one in my life.  I sold my 70 
westy in August.  I recently got a '71 Deluxe locally.  I never had disk 
brakes on a bus.  All I can say is WOW!  I'm trying to sort out my bus 
herd.  I might use the '71 as my commuter and just keep on of my splits.  I 
was hoping to out a type 4 motor into a split then thought about putting it 
into my '71.  I hear it's a nightmare to do.  Any suggestions?  It's good 
to be back on the list!

Joy thru Air,
