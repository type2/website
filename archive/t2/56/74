Subject: Re: [T2] Breaking in an engine

This is how I've broken in street engines for years.  Vanagon motor has
210k on it so far. Race engines you break in like you're gonna run
them... (of course, the race engines were torn down every couple hundred miles.)

The paragraph:

"An engine's initial run should be used to bring oil and coolant (air,
oil, and/or water) up to operating temperature only, with little or no
load, then shut down and allowed to cool to ambient temperature." 

is your 2000/20.  Beds the cam and lifters. The rest of it is road stuff
and the usual recommendation. Moderate speeds, no lugging, occasional
short bursts of full throttle acceleration, CHANGE OIL.  typical
break-in stuff...  

The BMEP comments are fluff to stretch the article. (Getting paid by the
word?)  The meat is in the last few paragraphs.
