I must say that we here in the Charlotte area have a cool dealership,
Carolina VW. When you walk into the front room there are enlarged Vintage
ads in frames all over the walls. When you sit in the waiting area you can
thumb through a VW trends , Hot VW or VW power.  Every time I go there in
one of my air cooleds the sales men always walk over to check them out and
ask questions about them .
The main manager is also cool, he likes the old vws and is seems
knowledgeable about them.
Unfortunately the parts department has yet to find anything I need for my
cars although they still have the info on hand.
Every spring they have a small show and shine with all VWs

Each dealership is run a different way . Some are cool and some are not.
