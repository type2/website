Subject: Timing issues

Hi volks,
Recently purchased a Bosch 050 distributor and am planning on installing it
soon.  I plan on installing a petronix unit in it.  What should I time it at?
I have a 73 with an 1800 and a Weber Progressive.  So nothing close to stock.
So Bentley and Muir are no help.

Any help would be appreciated..

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
