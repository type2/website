Hi,

VW Dealerships do not all come from the same mold. Black VW, the 
local dealer in Greensboro, does not have any air-cooled VWs for sale 
on the lot but none do :)

The VW parts manager, Steve Rogers, grew up in a 71 Westfalia and can 
even pronounce it correctly. Steve has all the old air-cooled parts 
books still on the shelf for reference and will gladly hunt through 
the VW nationwide online inventory searching for parts. Steve has 
even scrounged up odds and ends for my 67 bus.

I pulled up in front of the sales office one day and was greeted by 
an older salesman who immediately started telling me stories about 
his days driving a 1965 21 window. Meanwhile in the parts department, 
Steve quietly waits for someone to drop by so he show them his stash 
of NOS 6 volt type III gauges.

The service department really cannot do anything with your air-cooled 
vw but will happily keep your Vanagon running.

Granted, this is not what you are likely to experience at a lot of VW 
dealers but I am glad that there is at least one left that has a 
local level that still respects its roots.
