Subject: New seals new draft question

I have replaced the seals in both front doors, the slider, and the pop top. 
It is now very quiet, but at highway speed I seem to have a blast of cold air 
coming from the rear of the bus. 

Is it possible all this tight sealing would cause cold air to coming in the 
rear hatch that still has the old seal? Did I create some sort of vaccum or 
vortex?

Your thoughts would be appreciated.
