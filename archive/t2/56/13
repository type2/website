I'm not going to disagree with any of the other advice that you've had
but I'd like to add.
Out of six type four engines all CV prefix that I've taken apart the
mains have all been good and rare as it might seem all rods and mains
were standard and only the crank needed to be polished to run standard
bearings again.
The hook........... every engine had *a* bad cam bearing next to the
timing gear. This could be caused by many things but the cause is
unimportant. Split the case.
