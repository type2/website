Subject: Re: [T2] Breaking in an engine (really long :-)

First off, you need to break in the cam, lifters, and bearings. The VW cam
doesn't receive MUCH oil below 2000 since it's splash lubed off the
con-rods. So, that's why I recommend 2500 and up (I like 3500) for 15-20
minutes. Most other engines have better oiling of the cam/lifter area, and
they don't have the RPM window we need for this reason. Also, the engine
will NOT overheat, since you are simply reving it with no load; this is a
good thing because a new engine has tighter clearances than it will ever
have in it's lifetime (we hope), and clearances loosen a little as the
engine breaks in.

The second break in procedure after oil/filter change, is done to break in
the rings and cylinders. BTW, if you don't have a thermostat and operational
flaps, this is a SOB (if not impossible) in the winterttime. A hot engine
breaks the glaze on the cylinders and allows the parts to break in. So, this
is what I meant by LOAD the engine (it's been a while since I wrote that
article, but I don't particularly remember using the term LUG the engine) to
load the rings and break em' in.
