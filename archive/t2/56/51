OEM components are not any different. each cam and lifter set matches to
it's self during break in. I have had more cam failures when using OEM
components than any other (bought directly from the dealer) These days OEM
genuine parts means nothing. The old cams and lifters have no problems if
they stay together as a set..

If you build enough engines you will have a cam failure. We use the WEB CAM
products in some engines with close to 300 PSI of spring tension on some
engines for race apps, they live with that. The stock spring tension barely
will control the valves at 5,600 RPM, it is so light.
 We build over 85 engines in a 13 month period.
