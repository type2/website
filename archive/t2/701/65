Subject: Hacked deflectors

I went down to the junkyard this morning to get a complete deflector 
plate/tin for the 3 and 4 cylinders. The easy one, out of the bus and 
with heads removed, was just exactly like the two I already have; the 
final section under the #3 cylinder was hacked off. So I spent more 
than an hour in six inches of mud getting one out of another bus,

Anyway, the upshot is this. The two bad deflectors I have could be a 
coincidence. But three is a trend. Somewhere along the line, there 
seems to have been a Muir-esque opinion that hacking these deflectors 
improves cooling at the #3 cylinder.

Every list member who doesn't know whether they have a complete 
deflector up there should check, maybe with the next valve adjustment 
or oil change. Just drop that bottom tin piece and shine a flashlight 
up there. It'll take you five minutes.
