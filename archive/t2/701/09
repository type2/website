I've emailed him and he doesn't seemed
interested.  He wants a group order and maybe
some money up front before he tries to jig
something.  

I'm still interested if anyone else is.  I may
just get it done locally if he continues to be
resistant.  There are lotsa buggy shops in
Arizona with experience bending tubing.
