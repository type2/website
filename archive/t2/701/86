Subject: Engine install update

My engine is back in the Vanagon for the secobnd time. Pulled it out yesterday
to fix my goof on the oil cooler. I don't think I'll ever look at a Chilton
manual again. If it aint in the Bentley it just aint true! After r&r of the
cooler I primed the engine oil, NO LEAKS! :~) So happy.

I installed the engine but haven't connected anything too it yet. Geting
toooooo cold to work outside after dark. I'm telling myself that I will
connect everything up a little at a time after work and crank her up next
saturday. We will see.

For those of you who like to pull engines without the transmission:
I learned something this weekend. The use of a tape measure sppeds the
instalation of the engine. I measured the height of the transmission to engine
mount off the floor and the tip of the exhaust pipe before seperating the
engine from the tranny. I used these measurements to line the engine back up
during install and things went so smooth. The tranny input shaft slipped right
through the clutch and hung up on the pilot bushing. Eyeballed the bell
housing to engine gap, moved the engine to the left 1/4" and pushed the engine
home. So much easier than last week end.

So now I'm back to where I was last Sunday. Engine in but still haven't turned
it over. I'm excited to see it running but I'm dedicated to taking my time and
doing it right or is it that I'm getting older and just don't have the energy
to do as much in a day? Maybe a little of both.

Thanks to all of you for your advice and encouragement,
Tom
