Subject: Re: [T2] Late Westy Stool Question

Eric asked:

After searching the achives and a few sites (special thanks to Karl for
pointing me to http://john-perry.com/vw ) I have a couple questions.
 
On the original stool, what were the bottom and the lid made from?
From the pics I have seen, it doesnt look like the same wood as the sides.
 
Also, does anyone repro the white straps?
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Those stools pictured on John's site are mine......

Here are the dimensions of the tall late one:
Sides:  W 31cm x L 36.3cm, 3 layer plywood, 10mm thick
Front/back: W 29.5cm x L 36.3cm, 5 layer plywood, 15mm thick
Bottom: 31.7cm x 28.8cm, 5mm thick, at least 3 plys,  [rabbit cut in sides] 
Top: 30.5cm x 36.5cm, 3 layer plywood, 10mm thick 

The thickness of the sides do not include the added thickness of the veneer.

The front and rear have a rabbit cut in each edge where the sides interconnect.
The total width of the sides are 33cm..
