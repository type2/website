Gerald,
	I like to finish up the, "Pull up to the wall and hit brakes at the last
possible moment", by pointing at the windshield and saying, "Look, No Hood".
Ya' know the other move that I've found to make non-Bus folks act like
Chinese gymnasts is a left hand U-turn.
Ah, the simple joys of Bus ownership!

C'mon guys. Spare on the front is no fun when you have a passenger. What is
one of the GREAT joys of having non-VW friends ride in the passenger seat
of your bus?

Parking spots next to walls and the backs of other vehicles at stop lights
and signs.
