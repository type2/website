Subject: CHT revisited

Guys,

I finally got out my new CHT gauge and sender over the weekend and did
some comparisons on the temperatures using the oven and the freezer.

Here is wht I found out.

First of all, the sender was "mis-wired", red went to the negative
terminal on the gauge  rather than the positive one.

The major thing that I noticed was that the gauge reads about 20 degrees 
difference(higher) when tilted upward at an angle like it might be mounted 
in a dash(rather than horizontal).

Placing the gauge in the freezer for 15 minutes while the sender was held 
at a steady temp raised the temp shown on the gauge by about 20 degrees.

The senders were placed between two pieces of sheet metal in the oven 
I set a pyrex dish on top of the sheetmetal pieces in order make sure 
nothing moved.  Gauge temps based on "house" ambient temperature(70 degrees).

All temps are in farenheit, and numbers that aren't "on the mark" on the 
cht gauge are approximate.

The meter I used was a fairly expensive METEX with a type k thermocouple 
probe.  The meter probe in boiling water reads about 210 at 1100 feet 
above sea level.....which is pretty much exact.  The probe for the digital 
meter was ordered with the meter when I bought it.

Meter	VDO/CHT  

400	460
358	405
300	340	
280	300
250	270
235	250	
201	210
188	200


So, if you graph these, what becomes apparent is that the difference
between "real" temps and CHT shown temps becomes wider and wider, untill
at a true 400 degrees, the CHT gauge is off 60 degrees.

I don't know if this is representative of all the CHT gauge/senders, but 
surely someone can come up with something that is as cheap(or cheaper) 
that uses a thermister rather than the standard CHT sender.

My gauge actually had a tiny little sticker on one side that looked to 
have inspection initials on it.

Oh, and BTW, the digital display on the oven for the temperature was 
**way** off for a long time....after about 20 minutes is got to be pretty 
close.  Ran the tests for about 45 minutes after the temps stabilized.  I 
read a lot of the comparisons whilethe oven cooled down slowly...the gauge 
and the meter tracked very well with each other as the temperature 
dropped.

Cheers, dave
