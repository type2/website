Subject: Re: [T2] Paper Air Filter Has Oil in It

You sure it's a "paper" air filter and not oiled gauze?  Unless there's
a breather hose connected to it, there's absolutely no way for the
engine oil to get there.

If it is oiled gauze, wash it out with simple green. or super clean.
and rinse with water.  Dry it and re-oil.
