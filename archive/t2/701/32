Subject: Update on my tires... It's good!

Ok. I'm sooooo embarrassed....

I went back to America's Tire Store this morning to complain about my
"sub-spec" tires. Kelly Pathfinder Trail AP's 27x8.5x14.

The counter guy was super nice when I explained my concerns. He pulled
the spec sheet for the tires up on his computer. PR6, load C. I asked
then why I couldn't find a "C" anywhere and why the tires had a 2 ply
sidewall label.

He went out to the bus with me and pointed out the "C" that I had missed. Sigh. 

The spec sheet shows the 2 ply marking is equal to the ply rating of
6. As I said before, as I drove and broke the tires in they stiffened
up considerably. Seems bass-akward to me, but it happened, so I'm
going to shut my mouth about these tires now.

(And next week I'm going to put mates on the rears... heh)
