Beware the black electrical tape... Most of the basic stuff if vinyl and
in my experience on of it that gets hot or sometimes due to age - it will
simply fail. The times I have used it, it got gooey and the adhesive
failed. On the other hand I have some on the cord of my circular saw that
is 7+ years old (the tape, the saw is 20+) and it is holding up fine. I
use good shrink tubing ANYTIME I can and reserve the electrical tape for
the rare occasion when I can't use the shrink tubing.

if your going to use tape spring for the good stuff 3M 33 plus.  its
pricey but its the only tape worth using in my opinion.
