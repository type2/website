Subject: New Fuel Pump and Pushrod Question (1600 DP) 

I changed out the generator on my 1600 DP way back to a Bosch Alternator. When
the guy rebuilt the engine a few months ago he mentioned that I had the wrong
fuel pump amd pushrod . He said it was for the Generator setup. He said I
should change it

Any truth to this?

The bus runs ok , lacks a little power, maybe this is an issue.....

Thanks....
