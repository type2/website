Subject: wiring or rewiring

Go to your local junkyard and find a newer VW (jetta,gti,golf)
WHATEVER.
Strike a deal on the wireing harness(s).. extract it  and you will have
a
great supply of color coded wireing for future projects.
  Its also worth it to solder all of your splices instead of the crimp
splices.. covering them with shrink tube. IMHO

should not interrupt the person doing it.
