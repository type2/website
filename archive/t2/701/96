Richard,

I had the gauge on the kitchen counter.  Once I realized what was going 
on, I squatted to read it.

Hard to get parallax when the gauge needle is on a vertical at 400C and 
you tilt it upward to read it, and it jumps 20 or so degrees.....I 
couldn't believe it would do it!

I sat it back down(cradled at horizontal) and reread it...tilted it again, 
and my mouth fell open....LOL!  Didn't shake it up or down to see what 
happened...that was enough!

Cheers, dave
