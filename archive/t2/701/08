Hey Joe,

    I've bought a bunch of stuff from your store. I love Busted Bus. I got
my Sliding Windows for my 73 Bus from you... they were in perfect shape. And
I only paid like $75 bucks!!!

Anyway, the kit that I'm using is from a place called "It's a Snap". There
are other companies like "Painless Wiring" which are also very good
(probably better than the one I'm using).

Each wire is specifically labelled. When you buy the kit, it's actually
pre-wired to a brand new fuse block. To be honest, this fuse block is
actually a 21 circuit Fuse.

I have NO IDEA where I would ever need 21 seperate circuits.....

But it's already wired to handle an electric fuel pump, headlights, turn
signals, all of that.

It even comes with the majority of the relays.

I just took a quick picture of a section of the wiring harness. Every 8
inches, they actually PRINT on the wire, what it's purpose is.

Go to this link:

I didn't want to attach the picture because I figured that would probably be
against list policy.

However, it's pretty easy to figure out, they even have them labelled by
positive or negative.


The one thing that bothers me is that the fuse block is NOT factory OEM
looking. I always prefer all of my cars to look factory original. What I am
possibly considering doing is... once I get everything wired up properly....
I may try to recondition the old fuse block, and just transfer the wires
over 1 at a time (while using the NEW relays of course).

That way it'll more or less look stock.


Thanks,

Todd
