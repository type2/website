Subject: Re: [T2] Question about spare tire holder

Yeah Arizona was beautiful.I didnt have enough time to really enjoy  it
though.I was just trying to get my bus home in one piece.Im going back this
august though with my Dad.Were taking a mule ride to the bottom of the Grand
Canyon.Gonna spend the night and come back up the next day.We're not taking
the bus though.;^(  Ill take the bus back with my daughter the following
summer and Ill plan more time.To get reservations for the mule ride less
than a year ahead of time,you gotta take what they have.We will have time
after the Grand Canyon to see some sights in Arizona.Is there any must see
places in the Flagstaff area or close to I 40?

> Nice bus, too. Arizona is killer, isn't it?
