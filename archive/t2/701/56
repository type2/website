Subject: Brake Servo Check Valve

I see where the

Brake Servo Check Valve

fits 68-79 Bus; 74-77 Dasher; 75-79 Rabbit; and 75-83 Sciocco.

Is there any other popular vehicle that I can get one from in the yards, 
like Mercedes Benz??

If so, where would they be in the Benz, and what years should I look for..

I don't need one right now, I just want to stock my stash for the future.
