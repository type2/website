Subject: 78 Transporter, Auto, A/C $500 w/del. to or on the way to

I wil be up in the Philly area on the weekend of March 19 and can bring my
extra bus if anyone is interested in it. DC or Baltimore are also
acceptable stop over points on the way there, Gettysburg or Harrisburg PA
or Winchester VA are acceptable on the way home.

It is a 78 7 passenger transporter with factory overhead A/C, auto
transmission, no engine, but very little rust, none of it being rust
through.  It would be a great body to swap your project into.

I am the second owner and I even have the original dealer sticker for it.

I am asking $500 for it and the delivery if it works out.

some pictures can be found at: http://www.LostWater.com/78_bus.htm

Thanks!
