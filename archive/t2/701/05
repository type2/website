Subject: Re: [T2] Pulling out all the wiring!!!

Thanks Chris, I appreciate the info..

    I acutally just went out and bought some stuff per your recommendation.
1 - a voltage tester (beeping kind), 2 - Wire shrink wrap, and 3 - LOTS of
black electrical tape! (and some other great stuff from the auto parts
store).

I really badly wanted to keep the original wiring harness, both because I
thought it would be easier, but also because it would look factory.
Unfortunately, nearly half the wires are cut up. I have entire wire looms in
the engine bay that have been cut just before the firewall. When I got the
bus, there was a paper clip holding a glow-stick... that was apparently the
Dome light. There is no wiring for the door ajar switches (to control the
dome light), there's a bracket built into the ceiling for the dome light,
but no dome light! hehe...

There's wires everywhere... it's basically a huge rat's nest... and
unfortunately, the wiring harness is soo damaged, that it's not even worth
it.

When I first got the Bus... it barely started. The previous owner had a
bunch of stuff hooked up directly to the battery (like the BugPac electric
fuel pump, among other things). There was just a big switch to turn it
off... and then I could start the car with the key... but nothing worked...
the windshield wipers aren't even hooked up, there's nothing! hehe...

This is a complete kit that I'll be replacing it with... the only thing that
I think I'll need to do is fabricate a mount for the fuse block (which it
does come with, already pre-wired and labelled), and I'll need to extend the
main power cable.


Thanks!

Todd

Is the replacement harness 1 for 1 with the old harness (in other words a
plug and play solution?).
