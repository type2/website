Subject: Re: [T2] Pulling out all the wiring!!!

Beware the black electrical tape... Most of the basic stuff if vinyl and in 
my experience on of it that gets hot or sometimes due to age - it will 
simply fail. The times I have used it, it got gooey and the adhesive 
failed. On the other hand I have some on the cord of my circular saw that 
is 7+ years old (the tape, the saw is 20+) and it is holding up fine. I use 
good shrink tubing ANYTIME I can and reserve the electrical tape for the 
rare occasion when I can't use the shrink tubing.

Good luck to ya! Holler if I can help!

Chris
