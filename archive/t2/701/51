Hi Don,

At least temporarily use the idle adjusting screws on the throttle
levers to boost your idle speed. You may have had them set too low
because your vacuum leaks may have boosted the idle speed last time
they were set.

You might also install a remote starter switch so you can work the
throttle while you start it. Or for temporary use, just run a wire
from the solenoid that you can touch to the battery to start.

Still, I can't time it until I get the idle worked out. I've been
trying to perfect the necessary
 method: Start the bus. Find a way for it to idle long enough for me to
 run to the back. Hold the linkage with one hand. Hold the timing light
 with the other. And with my third hand, turn the distributor.

 Those hoses are sealing tight.
 
 The throttle response is crisper than ever before. Possibly crisper
 than my fuel injected Volvo  (which makes me wonder about vacuum
 leaks...). I did some minor tweaking to the levers on the carbs to
 perfectly syncronize the opening moment. Very nice feel there now.
 
 BUT IT STILL WON'T IDLE!!!!
 
 Everything should be close enough to get an idle out of the bus. I
 even opened the air screw all the way. Nada. Played with the mixture,
 a half turn at a time. Zip. Timing tweaks. Zilch.
