I'm the partner Paul speaks of.  Everything went together just fine,
"flat" side of the disc to the flywheel, greased the pilot bearing,
centered the disc & tightened the pressure plate bolts.  Also 
cleaned & greased the T/O guide sleeve and the points on the 
fork arms where the bearing sits before installing the TOB.

Tightened? From where it was?  I think that's the problem -- we put in a 
new clutch, which is thicker than the old clutch.  You need to *loosen* 
the adjustment.  

.. shoulda made a "to do" list before I left and put that on there.  My bad.
