The guys on the DIY FI list talked about soldering the connections and
concluded that no manufacurer does it because it is a bad thing to do in
a vibrating environment.

i have been doing this for years and have never had a problem.  mostly
your problem would occur if you didn't leave loops in your wire or if you
had a board that wasn't properly dampened.  the inside of the afm is
soldered as well as the connections internally on the thermo time sensor.
