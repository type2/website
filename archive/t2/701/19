Subject: Re: [T2] Question about spare tire holder

Those are my busses horn,cant you tell?They will fold down and stick
straight forward to hold a bike or two.I think a bike would block the
headlights,though.I dont have any idea who made it but it looks very similar
to a kangaroo bar excepyt for without the horns and its missing the tubing
that protects the headlights.

> Nice, John. What are the dinglies sticking up.
