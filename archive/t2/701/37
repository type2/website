Subject: fuel ventilation hoses

When I start tearing out fuel ventilation hoses for
replacement tomorrow 
should I expect there to be much gasoline in them?  I
have a 3/4 full gas tank. I don't want gas pouring out
all over 
everything.  I plan to do it when the engine is
over-night cold.  In 
fact it will be two oover-nights cold as I didn't
drive it today!   
Thanks...KR
