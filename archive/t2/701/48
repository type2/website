Subject: RE: [T2] wiring or rewiring

Jonathan, and the List,

The American Boat & Yacht Council (the organization that specifies the
"building code" of the boating industry) specifies that connections NOT be
soldered for this very reason.

The specific problem is that when a solder joint is made in a stranded
copper wire, the solder wicks up under the insulation, stiffening the end of
the wire. The flex area then moves to an area that is not visible (under the
insulation), and vibration or flexing of the wire will cause strands of the
wire to begin breaking and separating where it can't be seen. Eventually,
when enough of the strands break and separate and the remaining strands
carry an ever increasing load, they heat up and fail, or worse, the
insulation catches on fire. On a boat, that could mean an explosion.

Electrically, solder joints are best, IMHO. Physically, they are a disaster
waiting to happen. Good quality crimp on connectors, properly crimped, are
plenty good. Best is with a length of shrink tube utilized as a strain
relief.

The guys on the DIY FI list talked about soldering the connections and
concluded that no manufacurer does it because it is a bad thing to do in
a vibrating environment.

i have been doing this for years and have never had a problem.
