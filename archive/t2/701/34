OK, guys thanks for all of the advice, public and
private, about my fire hazard.  I assumed that I was
getting fumes from the engine compartment forwarded
through the ventilation hoses.  I didn't know that a
little gas smell in the engine compartment of a
caburated vehicle was not normal.  I just never
thought much about it since my other cars are
fuel-infected.  I will study the diagram and try to
find the leak.  My bus has been on fire sometime
before I got it.  The right rear quarter panel is
still a little charred.  I do carry a fire
extinguisher.  I have had the tank removed and
de-rusted a while back.  You would think they would
have checked all of that.  Thanks..Kevin
