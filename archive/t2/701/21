Subject: The REAL reason the spare needs to not be on the front of a

C'mon guys. Spare on the front is no fun when you have a passenger. What is
one of the GREAT joys of having non-VW friends ride in the passenger seat
of your bus?

Parking spots next to walls and the backs of other vehicles at stop lights
and signs.

We *all* have our brakes in great condition, right? So you get a buddy up
front and for the first few times that you have to pull up to an object you
get as close as possible, as fast as possible, before actually stopping.

With someone accustomed to 6 feet of hood in front of them riding in the
shotgun seat you can wrench out anything from a muffled yelp to an
unabashed "Oh SH**!" (accompanied by a vision of the friend seemingly
levitating as they attempt to 'scoot' up over the seat back with the
seatbelt holding them down).

The true joys of the cab-forward, rear engine design.
