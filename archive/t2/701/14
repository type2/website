Subject: Re: [T2] Question about spare tire holder

I found an ORIGINAL spare in the closet of the 74 parts bus I still 
have- blew it up carefully and it instantly developed a million deep 
cracks in the very dry rubber- Now I have a perfect rim!
For a while I did carry one of these inflatable tires with a home-made 
cover on my 78 Westy Roof rack.  As I put a pod up there, the tire is 
now on the front.  I put spacers behind the rim so the tire can drain 
water and dirt beneath it.
