Subject: Pulling out all the wiring!!!

Hi

Can I just add my 2 cents and agree.  I have an old harness from a VW 
Rabbit (Very reasonable on a certain auction site).  As well as lots of 
coloured wire it also came with lots of plastic clips, covers, 
connectors and lengths of  tubing (same as the stuff in the bus) which 
have proved invaluable for undoing the PO "specials".

I also have an auxilary blade type fuse box in the engine compartment 
which allows me to tie thing up back there.  If I were to start again 
and couldn't get a bus harness I think I would start with something 
similar but newer such as the wiring from a Vanagon and then modify it.

John
