Subject: Paper Air Filter Has Oil in It

Volks,

The 69 Westy we're restoring has an aftermarket paper air filter setup 
that
is radically different from OEM.

It looks similar to what I replaced my 57 Met's OEM Oil Bath Cleaner.
It is basically a round plate on the bottom, attached to the carb, and
one on top (with a bolt/nut through it), with a little round air filter 
sandwiched in-between.

The paper air filter is CHOCK FULL of oil.

Of note is that under acceleration a quick puff of black (not blue or
bluish/gray) smoke shoots out of the left tailpipe, and when
downshifting the smoke puffs out of the right side. I had my wife
verify this while driving behind me.

I suspect that this is a very bad thing. Any help/pointers would be
most helpful.

Anton
69 Westy - Konrad
