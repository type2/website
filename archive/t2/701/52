Subject: Late Westy Stool Question

After searching the achives and a few sites (special thanks to Karl for
pointing me to http://john-perry.com/vw ) I have a couple questions.

On the original stool, what were the bottom and the lid made from?
From the pics I have seen, it doesnt look like the same wood as the sides.

Also, does anyone repro the white straps?

Thanks
