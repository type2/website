Subject: Defrost/Heat Ventilation Ducts - Re-post

I received no replies - so I thought I'd post the question one more time.

I've got a '79 Westy. somewhere along the way, all the heat/defrost/vent
flex duct work behind the dash got trashed (it's missing) and I'd like to
put it back.  I think I have all the hard pieces:  two defroster (flat
funnel looking things), two round dash vents and the metal heating "T" front
& center.  My bus does not have the door style ducts.

Can someone direct me to a diagram/description/set of pictures that show how
these ducts look and where they're hooked up?  

My next challenge is to then integrate my under dash A/C unit with these
ducts.  I think I need to understand the stock setup before I try to hooking
up the A/C ducts - but that info would also be helpful.

TIA

Wayne
