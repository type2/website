Right, those are the ones Don, as Stevie said. 

Also, after I wrote to you last night, I remembered something else
that happened to my bus the other day and made me lose idle. At the
far edge of the left carburetor next to the firewall on the vertical
surface where the central idling hose connects there are two plugs. I
was late to work one day and pushing the bus pretty hard when one of
the plugs popped out. I put it back in with Permatex motorcycle carb
gasket sealer and it has been holding fine since. So I thought since
you pushed your bus hard like I did, you might have popped the plug
too.
