Subject: Re: [T2] Question about spare tire holder

Maybe I can suggest something
for a rear mounted spare tire,, you could use a receiver style trailer hitch,,
and put in a fold down style bicycle holder,, mount your spare tire on the
opposite side of the bike carrier,, and carry bikes too!

The tire would be on the front of the bike rack,, between the rack and the rear
door.. licence plate.. and the bikes go in the normal place on the rear of the
rack.

They have a pin you pull, and the rack folds down away from the rear doors,, to
check your oil..,,.or get in the rear door
Or you can remove the entire rack by sliding it out of the receiver .

You might follow these links to find what you want!
