Wow, those carbs need some loving Don !

	If I am seeing it clearly that is indeed the Throttle Opening 
Adjustment screw, giving that an equal twist (or three)  inward on each 
carb will open the throttle slightly bringing your revs up. You'll see 
that it has the same effect of the throttle cable pull on the linkage. 
If you give it throttle you will see the little screw lift. You can 
check your balance too at this point just to make sure your carbs are 
still balanced.
