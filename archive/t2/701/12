My sisters' S10 was the same way.  In fact, the
sheetmetal rattled when the door was shut.  And
before 60,000 miles, she had replaced the tranny
twice, alternators galore, a fuel pump, a water
pump, and some very expensive piece of ABS
equipment.   They were manufactured in a
very..... uhmmmmm.... economical way.  

That being said, I've used many other rear spare
holders that were fine.  The stuff on the website
looks very strong.  Did you see the motorcycle on
the rear bumper???  

Also, let me say that I was interested in the
wide rear hatch contraption more than the spare
tire carrier.  I forgot that he listed several
things on that site.
