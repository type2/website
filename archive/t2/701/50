The 6 ply load bearing capacity must have been set when plys were
weaker. To equal it, 2 plys these days must be stronger.

 The spec sheet shows the 2 ply marking is equal to the ply rating of
 6. As I said before, as I drove and broke the tires in they stiffened
 up considerably. Seems bass-akward to me, but it happened, so I'm
 going to shut my mouth about these tires now.
