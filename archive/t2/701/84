Subject: Re: [T2] wiring or rewiring

 From the Electrical Standards & Recommended Practices For Small Craft:

E-9.17.12.8 Solder shall not be the sole means of mechanical connection 
in any circuit. If soldered, the connection shall be so located or 
supported as to minimize flexing of the conductor where the solder 
changes the flexible conductor into a solid conductor.

I don't know much about Type 2s, but I have spent a lifetime with 
sailboats, and was the former Editor of The Log Newspaper in San 
Diego...and I know how to rewire a boat. And it NEVER involves solder. 
Boats bump and grind and move about and flex...and this will kill wires 
that have only been soldered. I've seen it firsthand on a few sailboats 
I have worked on...including my own!

Electrical tape that I used in the past includes Scotch 35, and Tommy 
Tape (this stuff is silicon based, and self sealing) to good effect. I 
wrote a few articles about our tests...I'll see if I can dig them up if 
anyone wants.

Long and short of it is...solder is ok, but there are much better ways 
to marry two wires.

Just my 2.67 nautical centavos.
