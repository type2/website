Subject: T4 fan housing fan removal

Hi,

I'm trying to pull the fan from a type 4 fan housing. I removed the 3 
bolts and have tried using a harmonic puller, but the fan will not come 
off. Now, I applied some moderate torque on the puller, not too much 
for fear of breaking something. Before I try harder, can someone tell 
me if I'm missing something?

TIA,

Sami
