Subject: Deflector tins -- hacked?

I've never seen a complete, symmetrical deflector tin for the 3/4 
cylinders. I have seen two that appear to have been hacked at the #3 
cylinder. Previously, I just got a 1/2 deflector and put it on the 3/4 
side with the center screw only.

Now it looks like I'll be doing that again, or maybe making a 
Frankenstein out of one 1/2 and one 3/4.

But before I do, I wanted to be certain: it's a coincidence that I've 
never seen a complete one, isn't it? That's not the way they are 
supposed to be, or a change made after some tech bulletin?
