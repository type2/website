Subject: Re: [T2] wiring or rewiring

The guys on the DIY FI list talked about soldering the connections and 
concluded that no manufacurer does it because it is a bad thing to do in 
a vibrating environment.

I don't think I have ever seen soldered connections on any 
vehicles...except maybe where bare wire was "tinned" so that it could go 
into one of the old screw clamp connectors.

Crimp, and then use shrink wrap to spread the "strain" of the connection 
over a wider area

When I used to do electronics design, some of the manufacturers of sockets 
for digital chips claimed that their push in connections were better than 
solder as they were "gas" tight.

YMMV!
