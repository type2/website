No this stuff can come in any color. Feeling like a thin rubber sheath and 
you should pick the 1st larger than your wire so it fits properly. Then run 
a lighter under it or a hot air blower (hair dryer) and it shrinks into a 
new layer of watertight insulation. Heat it, don't burn it. I get just the 
tip of the flame on the shrink tubing and then roll the wire/tubing around 
so it heats evenly. Takes 5-8 seconds. You'll know if you've heated it too 
much as it will look charred. Practice 3-4 times and you'll have it mastered.

Stop by an electrical supply store and ask about it. They can explain and 
show you. The FLAPS variety seems to be made of a cheaper material 
approaching vinyl. The good stuff is a material that seems much more like 
rubber. I prefer the 2nd version. Seems to shrink better, seal better, and 
last longer. I STILL have a big spool I bought in 1995. Dad and I share it. 
All black. I usually shrink the last 3" of a connection. Also nice when I 
want to pretty up a wire and the color doesn't matter.

The corrugated stuff you mentioned is good for bundling wires. It doesn't 
seal anything but on things like trailers and such it groups the wires and 
protects them from minor hazards like gravel.
