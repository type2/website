That seems to be a problem of late if your brand is VDO.

Is it parallax or does the needle actually move?

Expected. The gauge lacks CJC (cold junction compensation).

Those numbers are even more horrible that I could have imagined.

Thermocouples are fast enough; thermistors are not. The problem is that the circuitry in the gauge is too simplistic at this price point of $90-100.

I've finally located an affordable CHT gauge with CJC. It's pretty nifty but I haven't compared it to my Fluke in the oven yet. I'll do it and report back to the list...
