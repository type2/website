The Berg unit has a 'T' so that the idiot light is used for both purposes.
As a practical matter what I do if the light comes on is when it starts
flickering to first assume that its heat related and slow down. If the
light doesn't start to go out within a mile I stop and check the oil. The
heat flicker is usually only at speed while the pressure flicker is
usually in a turn or at idle coming off of a long run.
