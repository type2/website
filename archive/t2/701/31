Yep Two of four very bad goats.  They like to lick the side of all our
cars.  We live on a dirt road and they like the salt off of the road.

They run free on the farm, BTW.  Thats why there are only four left, I had
been up to over 20, and unless you spend bunches of money on fencing,
goats will find anyway through, so I said f*** it and sold the baddest
ones and kept the best ones.

I have been thinking about getting into the goat business more fully and
using that extra bus as a goat hauler.

BTW, that bus is still for sale.  No rust through, some surface rust, no
engine, great auto tranny, a/c(w/ compressor) 78 passenger bus w/ original
dealer sticker. I am 2nd owner.
