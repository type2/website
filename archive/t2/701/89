I totally agree. The ATV Jack was huge for a 2 person pull, couldn't
imagine 1-person without 1.

Nah, I get to put the rear way into the air like you do. Fun stuff.

I don't think this is true for the older transmissions. I have 4 bolts
holding the trany to the engine (2 upper, 2 lower). Thanks for the
advice on a solo pull. I'm not sure I or should I say my wife is up for
it. Bentley isn't clear about what happens if this is left in its
current "noisy" state. I presume it will lead to premature wear and
failure of the bearing :( Has anyone out there done the transmission
drill method of resolving this noise? Bentley describes drilling a 10mm
hole and threading a molyb grease hose through the hole to the bearing.
It seems so destructive when pulling the engine, though somewhat time
consuming, doesn't destroy anything in the process.
