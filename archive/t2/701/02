Subject: Clutch trouble

Hey. I dropped my engine last weekend (with the generous assistance of
a fellow listee) to fix a scrape-y sound when the pedal was depressed
at speed. Found a faulty throw-out bearing and replaced it. While I
worked on the backside of the engine (fan housing, dipstick boot), my
partner replaced the clutch, and pressure plate with new items from
BusDepot. Since I wasn't directly involved in that install, I can't say
what was or wasn't done for certain so I won't be able to answer
questions about that. The engine is now back in and runs. The clutch,
though, doesn't seem to engage when the engine is running. I can move
from gear to gear with the engine off, but if I start that thing up I
can't get it into gear. At first, the bus would move slightly when the
clutch was depressed and in gear (assuming I started it while in gear
instead of nuetral). This had me suspecting the cable. So I adjusted it
as tight as I could go, that didn't do it, but the bus stopped moving
while in gear with clutch depressed. This has me thinking the clutch
cable is stretched(?). Rather than start changing parts around, I hoped
someone out there in listee-land could easily identify what went
sideways. 

I'd really like to get this fixed this weekend, before my wife starts
saying things like "maybe you should get another car"... I gotta admit
the 2 hour one-way metro-bus ride to work and back is getting tiresome.
