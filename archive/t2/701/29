Go to your local junkyard and find a newer VW (jetta,gti,golf)
WHATEVER.  Strike a deal on the wiring harness(s).. extract it  and you
will have a great supply of color coded wiring for future projects.
  Its also worth it to solder all of your splices instead of the crimp
splices.. covering them with shrink tube. IMHO
----------------------------------------

this is almost exactly what i do except i keep a 2'x 2' box of wire around
from cars that i part out.  that way i always tend to have wire on hand.
when i solder lengths of wire back into the harness this is how i do it.
cut the burned section off of the wire and strip it where its fresh.  then
prepare your new piece by stripping it.  then slip you precut length of
shrink tub up the wire.  next spread the strands of both pieces and poke
the ends into each other.

once you have them together push them down on each other and smooth them
out.  the next step involves using a tool that i made, it similar to a
pair of helping hands its a piece of wire bent into a U with alligator
clips on each end of the U.  affix the helping hands to each side of the
wire so that your push together connection stays together then pre-heat
the wire and solder it up.  after that you can push your heat shrink over
and heat it up.  i usually use a another soldering iron for this part.
you could just stop there but i usually put fiberglass sheathing over the
wire to protect if from the heat that destroyed it in the first place.
