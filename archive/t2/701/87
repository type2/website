Subject: Re: [T2] PDSIT linkage pic?

Thanks!

I know I don't have the bracket from the coil that the spring attaches
to, but I've got a workaround there (the seal lip for the top hatch
holds the far end of the spring).

I have the swivel pin and the end of the throttle cable is there. But
in your pic you can see that the throttle cable end has the hole for
the spring. How does it catch the swivel pin to turn the linkage?

In mine there are washers and big nuts and stuff...
