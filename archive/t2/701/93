I use a low transmissin jack.  it seems to have the advantages the ATV
jack doesn't in that it has wheels and it also has some adjustments for
positioning once raised. allows angle to be changed and some minor side
to side adjusting.  I have a small harbor freight one that needs to be
cranked up works ok (even have a seat that fits on top and when not
dropping engine I have variable height rolling seat to work in engine
compartment more comfortably)
  however I think I would prefer the hydraulic version over the crank
version and in the near future I plan on getting a better version at a few
more $$$ but the Harbor Freight one I have that I got for about $50 has
made removing those  big type4 engines so much easier, and I'm usually
working alone so I gotta have that thing under control.  I made an engine
support that I bolt to the top of the jack for a more solid base for the
engine to sit on.
