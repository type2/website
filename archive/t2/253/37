Subject: Anyone  in Columbus Ohio?

I maybe purchasing a 73 Thing in Columbus and was wondering if anyone there, 
or close to Columbus off 71 heading south could help me tune the Thing up 
before I attempt driving it to Nashville TN.

The Things runs good and I'll adjust the valves before the trip but was 
hoping someone might be cool enough to help me set the timing etc.....I 
think it will make it but it would be good VW karma to give it some 
attention before the trip.

Thanks in advance and just email directly if you could help me out.

Daniel
