David -

Those pulleys without the notch are for 411/412 Sedans & Wagens (and maybe
914?).  There is usually a red paint mark on these pulleys which line up to
a notch inside the viewing hole on the center top of the fan housing when
timing these ala Type 3 style.  Considering their possible age and wear,
I'm not surprised the paint mark is gone on those pulleys you have.
