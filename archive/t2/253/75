Hi Janice,

Personally, I wonder what these additives are doing to combustion 
chamber temperatures. Up here in the Great White North, one of the 
larger fuel chains is selling "Cleaner burning" fuel with an additive 
called "Tactrol". They advertise their higher octane blends as having 
more of that stuff than the lower octane grades. When I'm forced to buy 
fuel there I always buy the lower octane.

With the number of burned valves that my bus-friends and I have seen in 
the recent past, I wouldn't be surprised to find that modern fuels are 
far from "air-cooled friendly". But getting a fuel vendor to admit to 
that won't be easy. Imagine the number of valve seats they'd be held 
liable for!

Happy trails,
