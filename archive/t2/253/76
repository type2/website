First of all, the bumpers from every vendor will be identical. There is but
one source, Wolff of Brazil, so all that will vary if you shop around will
be the price.  (There is one exception: Wolff does make a low-end
budget-priced chromed bumper - lower end than the "show chrome" one that we,
Motorworks, etc. sell.  We don't sell that one, and I'm not sure who does;
the wholesale price difference is only about $12 so I don't see the point in
bothering with it)

The primered replacement is actually quite good for Brazilian aftermarket. I
had a set on my last bus for several years and was happy with them. The
chrome plating on the chrome ones could be better, however, as has been
noted.  Of course, one benefit of primered bumpers is that it's not hard to
sand and repaint if a touch of rust does show up, as compared to refinishing
chrome ones.  Needless to say, neither bumper is quite as good as the
original German ones, but I suppose if you had original ones that weren't
rusty or dented you wouldn't be looking for new ones!
