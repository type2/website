You need to remove the battery, remove the cables and clean everything with 
a wirebrush. Then reassemble. Coat everything with the red colored sealant 
available in a spray can at the FLAPS or coat with vaseline or grease to 
seal the corrosion out. You need to do this from time to time. Also clean 
the places where the cables fasten to the VW. I was the in charge of the 
batteries on my ship when I was in the Navy.

You can power wash the engine if it is not scalding hot. If you dump cold 
water on a hot engine you risk cracking it. Expect starting troubles if you 
get the ignition really wet.

I would recommend you pull the engine, strip off the tin and power 
wash/clean everything. I'll bet the fins are covered in junk and grease 
that will leave your engine running hot or create hot spots.

Reassemble everything replacing any missing seals or tin. I usually paint 
the tin piece by piece during this cleaning and I always replace all of the 
fuel lines.

Reinstall. Your total cost will probably be less than $50 and your bus will 
be much better for it.
