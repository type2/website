Subject: Side Step and Ice Box Ice Holder/Rack For Sale

Hey All. Thought I'd give the List first dibs on these things before I put 
'em on Ebarf. The side step is a Bus Boys reproduction, has been painted 
gloss white (to match my wheels) and comes with all mounting hardware. In 
prefect shape. I'll take the first 90.00 offer (these things go for 139.99 
new). The ice rack/holder fits in the cooler of non-delux Westys from ' 76-' 
79. Comes with the drip tray and drain hose. Also in perfect shape. I'll take 
the first 35.00 for it. Buyer pays actual shipping from Raleigh, NC. or I can 
deliver to Oktober Bus. I take Postal MO's and Pay-Pal. P-mail if interested.
Thanks,
Robb
