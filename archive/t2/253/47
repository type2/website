Oh yeah? Does it have the plate installed by Westphailia that says its a 
home? Some do some dont. If it does argue.

You could try calling AIG but they usually contact you. Given your 
(presuming sorry) age over 40 you should be able to convince them you 
deserve coverage. With no claims or accidents you could plead your case. 
They have the lowest rates, and insure most anything, IF and only IF you are 
a good driver.
Confusing website, but its AIG.com or google it. Look for auto insurance.

Good luck, I hate that kind of news, it really is tough.

I got a honda scooter in trade for a really crappy bug, and put it in my 
companies name, and use that for work. The rest of my vehicles are insured 
as low mileage recreational vehicles. Heh.
