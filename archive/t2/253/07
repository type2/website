You can import them, but the process of getting them legal for street use
is prohibative.  The honest way involves buying a few buses for
crash-testing, engineering improvements if they don't pass, buying a few
more buses for emissions testing, engineering improvements if they don't
pass, etc. etc.  For the same cost, you could hire the best people to
completly refurbish a vintage bus with that killer Porsche drivetrain
everyone lusts after.

That said, there are under-the-table methods for getting a brazil bus
legal.  Swap VINs, declare it a "kit car", bribe the DMV guy, and other
creative methods.  I still think that it is easier to restore an oldie.
