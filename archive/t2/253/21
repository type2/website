First, I love the sage green campers. I really do miss my 78
sometimes. Obnoxious is not a good word for it. It's not as easy on
the eyes as some of the other plaid, but it's definitely a 70's
color. The brown plaid in my 79 seems a little too "normal" for me.

Second, I know that http://john-perry.com/vw/plaid.html isn't a
source for plaid material (I know, 'cause that's me ;) The page was
developed w/ help from Steve D. and Karl V.S. (who provided the pics
and info for the page) to provide INFO about plaid. I don't have any
plaid, but from the pics, it's easy to assume that I do .

Here's my standard answer to the "where can I get plaid??" email I
get:

<cut>
Unfortunely, nobody that I know of reproduces the plaid fabric that
was installed in westfalia campers.

The best place to get the fabric is from old westy campers that are
being parted out. I got some brown plaid for my 79 camper on
http://www.ebay.com . Different color plaids comes up for auction
every so often. You'll have to check often and bid against other
westy owners.

Another place is from local junkyards. The best fabric comes from the
top bunk. Also look at the online classifeds and email anyone that is
parting out a camper. Ask them if they have the plaid fabric (color)
that you're looking for. Might not hurt to place a few want ads
yourself. Best sites are the http://www.type2.com buy and sell page
(direct link is http://home.graphics.uwaterloo.ca/vwbuysell/ )
and the vwplanet at http://www.thesamba.com/vw .

Like I said, I've scored peices of plaid from ebay (and some other
places before) so the plaid is out there, it just takes a little
searching. I've paid up to $25 per section for my brown plaid,
but I've seen prices of up to $100 (I think that $20-50 per is a fair
price [edit: for everything other then the blue/green plaid]).

FYI: Blue green is the rarest. Brown is the second hardest to find.
Then the orange (2 different shades). The green is the most common.

Thanks for reminding me that I need to take a pic of my brown plaid
to include on the page.

Hope this helps,
