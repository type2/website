Subject: brake booster and/or MC trouble?? (I think)

ok. i think that my brakes are bad somewhere in the system. they have been 
adjusted and bled and they still seem to be too soft. i have a 72 with the 
disc brakes up front. i would like to know if there is a way that i can 
check if my MC and/or brake booster are bad. or if anyone else knows what 
might be wrong. the brakes do grab hold but they take a lot of pressure for 
that to happen. the brake lines are fine and have just been replaced and i 
have no leaks in the system that i have been able to find. maybe someone can 
help me and point me in the right direction. thanks
