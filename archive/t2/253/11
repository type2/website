Subject: Re: [T2] Imported Mexican Busses

[...]
Asked a  guy that regularly imports stuff from brazil to look into 
possible parts import on the bus.  Idea being to try and get a body  
minus suspension and engine.  you could still buy and refurbish an old 
bus cheaper.  he would have to buy a minimum of a batch  which  looks 
like about 20.  then  sea  ship to new orleans,  and then customs 
import fees, and then shipping by numerous trucks to his albequerque or 
denver warehouse.  I checked with  CO  motor vehicle people about 
getting it called a kit car.  Inspection  said straight out that here 
in CO  extremely  difficult but could be done.  He suggested using 
states with less stringent rules to get the initial origin registration 
which most states except CA usually honor.  Then the next trick is that 
all VW emblems would have to come  off and be called something else so 
that it would not fall into "production vehicle" classification.  here 
in CO he said that the easiest way to do it would be to have  a good  
valid chassis with all of the proper VIN stuff and receipts  showing 
its origin  then drop a new body on it.  The rules have really 
tightened since the days of the PUMA.
