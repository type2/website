Puebla, southeast of Mexico City. You can arrange a tour of the factory. =
View the old Beetle online (it's called the Sedan):

exchange rates (10 to 1).

Here are some of the Beetle's specs:

I've seen a number of gray-market Mexican Beetles driving around New =
Mexico and Texas.

VW de Mexico sells the Eurovan in Mexico; the Kombi (Baywindow bus) is =
no longer officially available there.

The bus, or Kombi, is produced only in Brazil now (in the western =
hemisphere, anyway; it may be being produced still in South Africa).
