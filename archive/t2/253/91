Subject: oil leaking pretty bad suddenly

its coming out and pouring down over the left (drivers) side heater box. 
Pushrod tube seals gone very bad I guess?

I scheduled an appointment with Tassi in Daly City tomorrow to have them as 
well as the exhaust manifold gaskets, as a friend mentioned that my motor 
sounded as though those were going bad/already bad as well.
