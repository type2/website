Hey, y'all...

...about 3 weeks ago I got a letter from my insurance carrier, Allstate, 
telling me that they weren't going to renew my policy with Allstate Property 
and Casualty "because Property and Casualty has been losing money in Texas 
and we can't raise our rates because of the awful regulators", blah blah blah 
 - 

...so, to show their appreciation, they're wanting to throw me and the rest 
of their "valued customers" into their (unregulated/high risk) county mutual, 
and, in my case, bend me over to the tune of a 43% rate increase on my two 
vehicles, with no more defensive driving discount...  and this after I've 
given them my business for 20+ years...  Both my partner and I are 50, with 
no accidents/violations on our records. 

I've been trying to find insurance with other carriers, and while I've gotten 
quotes on my '89 S-10 Blazer (significantly lower than Allstate), I'm having 
trouble getting quotes on our '76 T2 Westy, and I'm afraid if I can't insure 
both together I'll end up paying as much as I would pay Allstate due to not 
being able to take a multiple vehicle discount.   One agent told me yesterday 
that our Westy didn't qualify as a personal auto because it has a sink, 
stove, refrigerator, etc., but it also doesn't qualify as an RV because it 
doesn't have a permanently installed, plumbed toilet - she advised me to stay 
with Allstate and take the reaming.

Can any of you (preferably in Texas - we live in Austin) tell me how you have 
your Westies insured, and (again, preferably in Texas), can any of you refer 
me to a decent company that won't gouge me?
