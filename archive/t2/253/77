Subject: Troy's engine problem of the day.....Another Update

More like "Troy's engine problem of the week."  Ok, first of
all....thanks to VanagonMan for sending me a dist to swap in and to
everyone who gave their input.  It didn't work though.  Still the same
issue.  So somewhere along the line I have missed something.  I am
heading to FLAPS right now to get remote starter switch to make
troubleshooting easier from the engine bay.  While I am there, I am
going to get plugs, rotor, and fuel filter.  A couple of the plugs were
slightly darkened and the rotor and fuel filter could use a replacement
about now.  When I get back, I am going to start the troubleshooting
again.  Let me know if I have left something out please...

Compression
Spark (all the way to the plug)
Fuel (Good spray from the injectors)
Check that dist is installed correctly to the drive shaft and not 180
out
Confirm TDC by following intake valve on #1 and not just the mark on the
pulley and dist.
Check plug wire sequence (duh)
Check that all valves are in motion while cranking
Check that all valves are adjusted properly
Check sensors again
Check double relay again
Check all vacuum lines

Anything missing?  Also...just because I get spark at the plugs...does
that immediately rule out any possible issue with the coil?
Thanks again for everyone's help.
