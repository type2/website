Uh, what if we played with it?  I specifically remember monkeying with
these tube collars when removing/replacing my engine to work on the heads.
I also remember that is was a pain to get back together... lots of
wriggling and dust.  I also remember a lot of banging around on the heat
exchangers when trying to reassemble these, too.  So, this asbestos is
gonna be blowing in the heating system of the bus I've been fixing for
the past three months?  A bus that will be used as a camper for my 4 month
old, 5 year old, and wife?

Seriously, how much of a concern is this?
