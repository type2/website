Subject: 72 Westy Pop-top camper-$3000 in LosAngeles area

Solid pop-top bus with new paint, too many projects so this one must
          go...... painted a year ago and
          parked, bought it without a motor, got one from another 72 with a
          single center mount carb but never
          installed it.... its sitting in Santa Ana,......

a couple pics here, and I will put more up later today......
