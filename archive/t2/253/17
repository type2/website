Well, we got the first offer back for the bus. They want to give
us $3800 for the bus.  Not done the stuff in the bus.  Seems a little
low to me.  Especially compared to the prices I have seen for other
late model bay campers.  Not sure about this.  I got about 8
different camper prices & faxed it to them.  Now we wait some more. 
God, I hate this kind of stuff.  Thanks for letting vent.

Hey there Pat,

Good boy. NEVER accept the ins. co's first offer. Sending them the
pricesof available campers should bring up their offer. I know it did
when I went thru this w/ my bus (but that was in the days when bay
buses were cheap - 4 years ago :)

Check out : http://www3.nadaguides.com/ and feel free to pass it
along to the ins. co. too.
