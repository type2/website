Hi everyone,
Me: the Canadian guy 72 van.

For anyone that may have signal light trouble.
The relay on the fuse box for signals - VW part # 111953 227A
Mine was melted on the side abit.
Also brake light troubles could be related to the "screw in" switches on =
the master cylinder.
Just thought i would provide any information that may be helpful in the =
future for somebody.

Darren
