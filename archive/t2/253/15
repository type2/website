Hi all,

On occassion the starter in my 79 dual cab has stayed engaged even after I
turn the ignition off (and I mean all the way to off). It usually takes 5 or
6 cycles of the ignition sequence before the starter (or more correctly the
solenoid) drops out. All this time the starter is cranking the engine :( 

Even if I drive off up the road a bit, the starter will still keep on
cranking away. 

The problem is getting worse, and I'm sure the day will come when the
starter will just keep on running until the battery goes flat. Maybe I need
a big knife switch connected to the battery for these occasions? Or a
remote-controlled mallet to give the solenoid a gentle tap on the head? The
problem only seems to happen on the first start of the day when everything
is cold.

Anyone had similar a experience? Anyone got some hints on what the problem
is? I suspect a couple of things (maybe there's a return spring in the
solenoid that aint doing its job, maybe the gear is binding on the flywheel,
maybe the throwout mechanism is cactus), but I'd like to see what y'all
think I should be looking for when I pull the starter out tomorrow.


Best regards,
