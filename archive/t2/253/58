On the other hand, the bug exhaust with "straight" tips sounds really nice
(and sets off car alarms in parking garages)  The volume is not really
socially acceptable, so quickly went to the bus exhaust.

Interesting question comes up, though.  The 1600dp bus engine was rated at
slightly less power than the 1600dp bug engine.  Was it the muffler that
was used to "detune" the engine?  Most of the other engine parts were
identical (don't know about compression, though).
