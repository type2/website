Subject: Re: [T2] Question about bleeding

Richard brought up an excellent point on the lower caliper bleed screw in
p-mail.  If you are changing brake fluid (Which VW says to do every other
year (yeah, right... like *that* ever happens :-)) then the lower bleed
screw is the only way to get *all* the fluid out of the caliper and
replaced with new.  So if you are being anal about your maintainance (and
we all *ought* to be, tho few of us are), then you will need to use the
lower caliper bleed screw during fluid replacment.  It is, however, not
used for bleeding.
