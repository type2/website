Subject: Re: [T2] Imported Brazillian Busses

Down here, customs doesn't seem to care. Thousands of Mexican vehicles cross 
the river everyday. Fifteen miles north at the Border Patrol checkpoint, 
they don't seem to care either. The Mexican government is another story when 
I venture south of their checkpoint...

AFAIK, Brazilian busses were air-cooled up until they stopped making them 
last year.
