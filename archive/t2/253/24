Rob,

You might try Farmers Insurance or the whoever you have your house? policy 
with.

Went thru the same thing when I was growing up in Texas and they made 
insurance madatory(waaaay back).  Farmers took care of me and I've been 
with them ever since.

Won't *ever* do business with Geico or Allstate.

Cheers, dave
