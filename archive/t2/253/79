Note that the people who developed problems with asbestos were the workers 
at the asbestos manufacturers who breathed the fibers for years and 
accumulated massive quantities. Studies showed if you packed a rats lungs 
with fibers, they would die. It is reasonable to be cautious about over 
exposure, but the reality is a few particles here and there will not 
overwhelm the body's protective mechanisms.

What is the end result of regulation overkill. Rather than $2000 to remove 
and dispose of asbestos tiles on a house, it will cost you $25,000 to meet 
the regs, all to reduce risk from 99.8% to 99.9% safety for the homeowner 
and neighbors. This is your liberal based politically correct tax dollars 
at work, folks.
