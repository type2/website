I'll consider thinning my 40w with Marvel (isn't it
sweet smelling diesel?) and thickening my fuel with it
when it gets seriously chilly here and hard to crank.
In 1,500 to 2,000 miles, when I change the oil, I'll
ponder what comes out and go to multigrade Rototella
for the cold season.

The Marvel claims always remind me of when they ask
the 100 year-old guy his secret to longevity. "Fifth
of Jack Daniels and a cigar every day!"

But who knows? Maybe it keeps the tank from rusting,
if nothing else.
