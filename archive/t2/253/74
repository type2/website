Subject: Re: [T2] 73-79 New bumper Quality?

I bought a pair of chrome bumpers from Bus Depot in 1998. They still look 
good but require regular polishing to keep the rust at bay. My OEM bumpers 
looked good after 20 years and they seldom got any polish. BIG difference 
between a good quality chrome job and the junk I most often see. New stuff 
is flash chromed I was told. Just enough to give it a shine and some color. 
The old stuff was chromed in several layers which locked out rust for a 
long, long time.

The chrome quality was poor at best on my replacements. The bumpers had 
been sanded with what looks like a 60 grit sander wheel before they were 
chromed. Much of the bumpers looks good and then in certain places they 
look AWFUL with a rough texture!

To the credit of Bus Depot when I called stinking mad they said they would 
swap them out for me but I decided to keep them as a motivator to get my 
OEM bumpers fixed up and rechromed.

The new bumpers have metal that is lighter gauge. My OEM bumpers were stout 
things, these are rather sad and probably would not fend off SUV bumpers on 
a parking lot very well.

Keep your OEM bumpers if you've got them as they are much better stuff. 
These are decent replacements though. A good compromise would be to have 
these replacements properly triple chromed.
