And it's the same product.  There's only one major supplier these days of
poptop canvas.  So whether you buy it from me, them, Motorworks, West Coast
Metric, or almost anyone else, you will get the identical product.

However, my prices are a bit lower on some years, and at worst the same
price (with listmember discount).  Plus, I generally keep them in stock,
rather than having them made to order.

'68-73 canvas:  Both of us charge $189
'74-79 canvas:  My price $208, theirs $226.
