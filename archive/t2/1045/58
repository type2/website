I went home for lunch and looked at my handles.  I couldn't find anything on
the door handles but didn't know to look on the paddles.  However, when I
looked at the rear hatch I found an "R" code as you all described... "12R345"
(Not the actual number).  I assume that is what I need to get a key made?

Who is "Steve" and how do I get in touch with him?  I call around here to see
what I can get but most "locksmiths" around here only deal, or know how to
deal, with the new stuff.  :-)


Thank you all for your help,
