Hi Karl,

I gave that thread a quick read and didn't notice any mention of the 
font "Continuum Bold. C/B is a VERY close match to the original font 
used for the westfalia logo. It's not a perfect match, as there have 
been mofifications made to the W and the A.

If people would like a vector file for the westfalia logo it can be 
easily downloaded from www.brandsoftheworld.com.
