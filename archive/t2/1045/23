Sounds like you have two issues...

1) Starter: This problem could be caused by:
- Old starter wiring: this is extremely common, you could try replacing the long wires that run to the cab.
- Old corroded wire connectors: Also extremely common, clean all starter connectors and replace chassis ground strap.
- Bad Starter: If it clicks or clunks but does not crank, then it's likely the starter.  Get a rebuild, you might be able to refurb it yourself if the windings are good.
- Tired Solenoid:  This is probably most likely, although old wires usually contribute to this as well. You can obtain a rebuilt starter/solenoid assembly, or you can remove the solenoid from the starter and just replace it.

When the solenoid or starter windings get old, they stop working when hot...after driving for a while engine block heat soaks into the starter assembly and often the only way to get started is to wait 1+ hours for it to cool off.  A fan would help if you have one.

A common (and easy) solution to old wiring is to install a hot-start relay near the starter.  This will not fix a bad starter/solenoid, but it will make a tired one last a lot longer, and will bypass the old wiring to the cab. See the type2 archives. 



2) Some other FI or ignition problem...one started it should not have died after 45 secs. Maybe needs a tune-up?
