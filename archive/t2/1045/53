Subject: brake light woes

I am unable to get my brake lights to work. I swapped the brake bulbs on
both sides to the tail lights and both bulbs worked fine so I know the
brake bulbs are good. I'm just having a hard time figuring out what to
do next. I've checked all my fuses and they are fine. Does anybody have
any ideas or past experience with a similar issue?
