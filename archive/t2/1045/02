Hello,

I have had this problem before. Every time, I was able to fix the problem by lubricating all of the moving parts. Penetrating oil like PB blaster works or W-D 40 will do to unstick everthing. Soak the entire latch assembly good, making sure to squirt plenty inside while you are working the handle. It is worth trying before you take it apart.

Good Luck

When I get out of my 71 bus, I have to nudge the door with my shoulder;  the inside door release lever doesn't
seem to release the door lock anymore... Also When I open the door getting into the bus the little lever inside the door handle just barley seems to engage the internal mechanism to pop the door open..... seems hanging by a tread.
