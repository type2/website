Subject: Swapping Out Key Locks

I have a 1971 Westy for which I picked-up a while back from a guy who had lost
his keys a while back and had just by-passed the ignition switch.  I also have
a 1976 Transporter which I have been using for parts to get this Westy on the
road.

To make long story short, I want to put the door handles, sliding door, and
back hatch key sets on the 1976 Transporter on the 1971 Westy.  The doors are
no problem and look identical.  The rear hatch on the 76 is a smaller very
plain release and I would like to swap out the key inserts.  The sliding door
handle on the 76 is totally different than the 71.  The 71 has the key in the
handle and the 76 has the key separate.

Questions:
...How do I swap-out key tumbler in the rear latch?
...Can I swap out the key tumbler on the sliding door?

Thanks,

Michael Martin
