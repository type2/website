Subject: Re: Swapping Out Key Locks

Michael asked: I have a 1971 Westy for which I picked-up a while back from a
guy who had losthis keys a while back and had just by-passed the ignition
switch. I also havea 1976 Transporter which I have been using for parts to get
this Westy on theroad. To make long story short, I want to put the door
handles, sliding door, andback hatch key sets on the 1976 Transporter on the
1971 Westy. The doors areno problem and look identical. The rear hatch on the
76 is a smaller veryplain release and I would like to swap out the key
inserts. The sliding doorhandle on the 76 is totally different than the 71.
The 71 has the key in thehandle and the 76 has the key separate.
Questions:...How do I swap-out key tumbler in the rear latch?...Can I swap out
the key tumbler on the sliding door? Thanks, Michael MartinMontevallo,
Alabama

No to both questions.

The 71 is L code, the 76 is R code.

The 76 rear hatch is black plastic and does not come apart.

The 76 tumbler in the sliding will not fit in any other lock.

You need 68-71 L code tumblers.
