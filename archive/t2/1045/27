Subject: Battery cables

Replacing my battery cables.  Is there any reason I cannot go out and by
some to the right length (generic and cheap) and put them in or does the
'72 T2 need "special" cables.  The ones currently in it are in horrible
shape and are not original. I can't find any real part numbers or
instructions, but before I assume......



Thanks as always.



Paul
