Subject: Shift Coupler

I think my new shift coupler is defective but I didn't keep the old one to compare it to.  The main part of the coupler is a kind of box shaped cage with a round sleeve coming out of it.  The round sleeve fits over the shaft coming out of the transmission.  Sorry about my terminology.

The problem is that the sleeve can rotate about 15 or 20 degrees relative to the box.  It looks like the sleeve and the box should one rigid piece but it's not.  Am I correct?  Should there not be any play?

Assuming I am, I'm going to ask the vendor for a replacement but, in the mean time I wonder if I can use a punch to stake the sleeve so it doesn't rotate.  Good idea? bad idea?

Thanks for your help.  It's a '74 Westfalia with a stock manual transmission.

Jim
