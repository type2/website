Subject: Memo to the File - 34PICT-3/1600DP vacuum ports

Volks,

This is an outgrowth of my work on a couple of 1600DP  engines ('69 bus, '70
vert, '74 autostick) and their associated 34PICT-3 carburetors in the last
couple of weeks.  I just had a chat with Jim Thompson (oldvolks) about my
specific application, but I thought it would have a more general application
so I am posting what I got from him as well as what I knew in hopes that you
all will add to it.  I have a box of carbs in my basement.  28s, 34s, and a
couple wierdies.  This deals only with the 34s.  On various models (all
labeled 34PICT-3) there are anywhere from one to four vacuum ports.  In
addition, on the intake manifold of a 1600DP engine there are anywhere from
none to three vacuum ports.  This is what I know combined with what I got
from Jim:

Manifold:
Location:                                                     Uses:
Left end casting vacuum port                     Beetle - Throttle
positioner
Center tube small vacuum port                  Beetle -  Paper air cleaner
left rear port
Center tube large vacuum port                  Bus - Disc Brake booster
                                                                   Beetle -
Autostick clutch

Carb:

Left side vacuum port                                All - Vacuum advance
Rear enter left vacuum port                       All - Vacuum retard
Rear center right vacuum port                   Beetle - Clutch solenoid
Bottom left angle vacuum port                   All - EGR

I *think* some buses came with throttle positioners, and I know there were
some vacuum accesories I have not seen, so if anyone knows another original
use for one or more of the ports (or of a port I have not seen/described),
please let me know.
