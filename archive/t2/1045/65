In the recent "Keeping your legend alive" magazine published by Volksworld, 
they show a tool called a Torque Master.

It looks pretty nifty - I hate the scafolding pole and socket game - but I 
can't find out where to buy one. Can anyone help - UK supplier please ?

Also, if you own one, is it any good ?
Can you fit different sockets ?  - I have a Bug and  bus which both need 
brake work occasionally.
Is it limited to wheel nuts or can it do others ?

Thanks
