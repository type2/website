O.K., the battery is good, I figure I have two problems;
 
1. Hot start is most likely the solenoid cause it takes time, fueling, hitting
the head, more than a 5 minute stop. Heat moving thru the engine after a long
freeway run. No sense changing the solenoid and not the starter in my humble
opinion.
 
2. She always started immediately after I found the bad plug on the cold start
injector, now I have to crank several times before she starts, any ideas?
 
And thank you all for your previous help.
 
Mike
