Seems that mobil 1 has a differing stance on the subject:

Wow. There must be a record number of non-sequiturs up there!

_You_ said not to use syn for break-in. Now you're citing some obscure 
third party, claiming to be quoting Road & Track, quoting Mobil Oil 
(among others), which disagrees with your statement.

BTW, note that since those articles were apparently written (2000 and 
2001), Mobil 1 has changed from a synthetic (primarily PAO, usually 
synthesized from ethylene gas, one of the simplest hydrocarbons) 
basestock to a mineral oil (Group III - hydrocracked petroleum) one. 
Some oil industry advertising board decided that they should be able to 
call Group III oils "synthetic," so they do.

It can't hurt to use mineral oil? Are you claiming that mineral oil is 
just as good as synthetic? Given your statement, and the citation 
above, which is "taking a chance," using mineral oil or using 
synthetic? Why?
