Subject: Main jet too large?? - Solex 34 PICT 3

I just installed a rebuilt Solex 34PICT-3 and am having difficulty 
getting it to idle at a low rpm - it will run unattended but at probably 
1500 rpm or higher.

The main jet and is marked 127.5 BUT it has been drilled out - a 1.4mm 
bit passes through with quite a bit of clearance.  Could the enlarged 
jet be the problem?  If so, can I silver solder it closed and drill it 
to a more appropriate size?

Valves, points, timing, etc. have been correctly adjusted - several 
times :-)

No vacuum leaks around ,manifold boots, brake booster line , 
head/manifold gaskets, carb base, etc. although there is a small amount 
of leakage around the butterfly shaft.

Dual port heads with case marked AH
Old Bosch 009 or new EMPI  9442-B - same performance
