Subject: Swapping engines between a manual and automatic

I am contemplating a swap between Buster (a '78 manual transmission)  
and Vandejo (a '74 automatic.)  The drive plate, and vacuum lines for  
the transmission immediately come to mind in regards to the swap, but  
I want to make sure there is something else that I may be missing.   
Both engines are 2.0 FI.
