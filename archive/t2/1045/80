The next morning I cranked and it wouldn't start, I think I ran down the
battery the night before cranking. I jumped it from my friends car and it
fired right up as normal. I drove the 1 hour home and she ran great. Tuesday I
didn't even start her, so when I tried Wed the battery seemed low, the starter
seemed to drag a little and she wouldn't start right up, I threw on the
charger for about half hour and she started right up. This morning same thing,
this time I put the volt meter on the battery, 12.5 volts, I then got a friend
to crank while I watched the volt meter, it never got below 11.5. I cranked a
little more and she started. She idles pretty smooth for the first minute or
so then starts almost dying, then overspeeding, back and forth like something
is slow to pick up when the idle drops and then over compensates to catch up
before she stalls, after she warms up she idles normally.
 
I was thinking of installing the "hot start relay" but have been talked out of
that bandaid approach so I guess I'm going to bite the bullet and get a
rebuilt starter and solenoid, redo the connections and start replacing some of
the old wires.
 
The F.I. is another matter, that seems to escape me, I don't know where to
start.
