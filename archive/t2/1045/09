Subject: brake switches

getting ready in the next week or two to put in two new brake switches
in my '77 bus.  bently is a bit vague on this and says to simply take
out the old ones and put in the new ones.  from the archives i gather
i should fill the little switches with brake fluid prior to threading
them in.  will i need to bleed the entire brake system?  any tips,
tricks, or advice?


thanks,

jeremiah
