Of the time period and as per Mark Dearing said it was a M520 Option.  Who
took advantage of that option here in North America?  Mostly Airport
Shuttle/Limo services of the time period, though these were more common in
Europe for this purpose.  The same option carried over for the Vanagon for
basically the same reason.
