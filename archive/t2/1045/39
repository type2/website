'72 T2 need "special" cables.

AFAIK there is nothing special about the cables. As well as the right
length you need to get the right thickness or thicker. The stock cables
were probably the minimum thickness required so thicker wouldn't hurt!

While you're in there replacing them make sure you clean up where the
cables join to the van and coat them with battery terminal protector or
similar. Corrosion at these points can significantly reduce the system
voltage.
