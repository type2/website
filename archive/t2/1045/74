Subject: What size triple square bit for the drive plate?

The archives deny me.  What size triple square bit do I need to remove  
the M12 bolts that attached the drive plate to the crank on a 2.0 FI?   
I'm having to (at minimum) replace it after our got tore up.  The  
bolts holding the torque converter (auto tranny here) to the drive  
plate back out and ended up tearing the drive late apart, as well as  
shaving some metal off the case.  I'm hoping all I have to do it  
replace the drive plate and that there isn't too much damage to the  
case.

Pics of the damage are here: http://calivw78.com/v/projects/repair_drive_plate
