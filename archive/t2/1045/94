Subject: Re: [T2] Can an engine lose compression from sitting?

Compression losses will occur past the rings.
You can do nasty damage from allowing rust
to be removed from the bores and loosening
up the rings by turning the engine.
Losses can also come from poor valve seat contact.
Do yourself a favor and pull the heads to make
a proper repair. Then you will know what you have.
