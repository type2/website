I don't know if this would be necessarily "appropriate" since the list is
mainly for people in trouble along the way... but I would check-out the
Aircooled Interstate Rescue Squad (AIRS) at
http://www.type2.com/~airswork/rescue/index.html.  This list is on the Type2
website and has a map of the country with people willing to help.  It would
probably be a good idea to figure out where you would be stopping each night
along the way and check-out people in that area and give them a call (or
email) first.

I might would offer but Alabama is not along your route.  :-)

Hope this helps,

Michael Martin in Montevallo
