 In the recent "Keeping your legend alive" magazine published by Volksworld,
they show a tool called a Torque Master. Picture:

I hate the scafolding pole and socket game - but I can't find out where to buy
one. Can anyone help - UK supplier please ? Also, if you own one, is it any
good ?Can you fit different sockets ? - I have a Bug and bus which both need
brake work occasionally.Is it limited to wheel nuts or can it do others ?

It only does 36mm nuts, i.e. the type 1 gland and 36mm axle nuts.

You would need to cut and weld a 46mm socket and a gland nut to make it work
on bay axle nuts. And then you will need to cut a flywheel to make an arbor
for the 5 x 112 bolt pattern.

It works great on type 1 gland nuts!
