   I can't see why not...Except
   you'd hafta find someone
   in England to send you the
   complete rig - everything
   you've got on the passenger
   side of your bus but mirror-
   imaged. Might get a bit pricey
   with shipping... ?-(
   Might also need some reen-
   forcing...I've seen pics of
   European ambulance buses
   with double doors but have
   no idea what mods the con-
   vertors did to have doors on
   both sides...
