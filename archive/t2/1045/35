Hey Jon. Yeah, the bus is in very good condition and we would like to  
keep it.  Just to make sure everyone is on the same page here, both  
engine are the same 2.0 FI engine.  Both engines are from a '78.   
Also, I am not looking to swap the transmission.  I'd like to keep the  
automatic in the '74 and use my practically new engine out of my other  
'78.  Keep in mind, both engine are from a '78 and the transmissions  
are not being swapped.
