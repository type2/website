Subject: key codes

OK, I've got the door handle off and there's a number
stamped on the inside

XXX XXX XXX N/P
u 1

Is this the key code?

If I take the cylinder out of the handle is/should there be another
number on it that my locksmith needs to cut a new key?

My ignition needs work and I'd like to first try a new key cut from the
code rather than another key cut from all my worn keys...Smooth
as a baby's bottom... ;-(
