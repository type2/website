Uhh.. yeah?  So I can't go and do some more research on the subject and 
show what I've learned?  Also, if you notice, I put "(if it is even that 
risky)", meaning that it might actually be a non-issue.

Even more I didn't know!

No, I was saying that from what I've seen, the general consensus was 
that non-synthetic oil is a better option for breakin and that you're 
taking a chance using synthetic.  Therefore, it can't hurt to start with 
a mineral oil and not run the risk of hurting things with the 
synthetic.. nothing more.  This was actually what I had seen on 
wikipedia in the disadvantages section:

"The lower friction may make them unsuitable for break-in (i.e. the 
initial run-in period of the vehicle) where friction is desirable to 
cause wear. Improved engine part machining has made break-in less 
critical than it once was though. Many modern cars now come with 
synthetic oil as a factory fill."

So, it's either a complete myth (which I would be happy to know), or 
there is some merit to this statement.  And, if you feel that your VW 
engine has "improved engine part machining", then by all means, go for 
it.  However, I don't think my bus has particularly improved engine part 
machining compared to modern cars so I'd rather not run the risk of 
causing any damage when breaking engine in.  Seems like it would make 
more sense to go for the safer option (if that is truly the case)... and 
it's cheaper.. win win!
