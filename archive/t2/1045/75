Subject: Montana to South Carolina

My name is Taylor and I'm relatively new to the list so I'm not sure if this is appropriate use but I thought I would ask anyway... If it is inappropriate would someone please let me know!

In about two weeks I'll be driving/moving from western Montana to upstate South Carolina on a tight budget. I thought there might be some hospitable and generous VW folks along my route that could offer a driveway and some soft grass for a tent? Maybe a bathroom to freshen up as well?

Right now I'm thinking a night in the vicinity of Rapid City, SD and another around Kansas City, MO.

I would certainly appreciate any help!

Please and thanks,
