Subject: Re: Swapping Out Key Locks - Plan B

Michael said:

 OK... Since there appears to be so many issues about swapping out
thehandles/locks between the 71 and 76... How about a plan B? Can a key be
made from the door locks (side, sliding, rear hatch) on the 71? The ignition
switch on the 71 is useless. It was butchered by the PO and hasno retrievable
key codes. Where would the key codes be located on the door locks (side,
sliding, rearhatch)? I looked at the locks last night and did not see
anything. Do I need toremove the lock mechanism somehow from the handle and,
if so, how? Thanks, Michael in Montevallo ------------------------------

Take off either 71 front door handle. Look either on the paddle [the little
arm that sticks out from the end of the tumbler] OR on the side of the round
section that holds the tumbler after you press the lever. You are looking for
the key code. It will look like this but the numbers will be different:
12L345

Here is an example [it is R code, 72 up]

Hopefully, the code is correct.....
