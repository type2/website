Subject: question about r&r bay window doors

Hello All;
 
I have a question, probably a silly one, but I'm going to ask it anyway.  
 
My 75 is an Ohio bus, which means it was in salt and it has rust.  The
passenger side rockers are in amazingly good condition but the bottom of the
sliding door is rusty.  On the drivers side, the rockers and the bottom of
the fixed "sliding door" area are both rusty.  I've seen reference to walk
through buses, where both side doors open, so there should be driver's side
sliding doors available.  Is it possible to remove a fixed side door and
replace it with a good sliding door fixed in location by welding?  
 
I've never seen a rust repair last very long, the only way I've stopped rust
is by replacing the rusted part with one that is rust free and undercoating
the heck out of it.  If I can find and install a set of rust free sliding
doors, it would solve a lot of problems.  I just don't know if replacing the
fixed side door is possible.  
 
Thanks in advance
 
Joe
