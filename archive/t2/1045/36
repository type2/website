Thanks for the reply. I don't want the door to open, only want to use thedoor

I thought some stateside buses were walkthroughs, I didn'tthink it would
require a UK/RHD bus as a donor. That would be way morethan my bus is worth.
Oh well.Joe ------------------------------

Joe,

You are confusing two different things:

A walk thru bus is one that only seats two people in the front. It has 2
bucket
seats and a 'walk thru' area between them.

A non-walk thru bus in a bay body will have a drivers bucket seat and a 2/3
pass seat with a solid bulkhead across the back of the seats.

A bus with sliding doors on both sides is a double door bus.
