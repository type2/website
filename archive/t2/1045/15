I ended up waiting as my partner called her friend who invited us to eat:)
After an hour and a half went back and she cranked and started right up,
sounded normal, I was all smiles unlocking doors, but with my foot on the
throttle just in case, after 45 seconds mavbe a minute she died, I added
throttle but couldn't catch her. After that I cranked several times but she
didn't even try to start, I didn't want to kill the battery, my friends friend
had to go so I've left her for the night, will take a spare battery and jumper
cables in the morning and hope she thinks it's another day. ????
