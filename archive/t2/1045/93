Well, I can't speak with a lot of authority, but I will say that I just did
compression tests on my engine and found that testing with a little oil
inject into the cylinders is a quick and super-simple way to diagnose a
problem with piston rings. I also found a helpful article on (where else?!)
the Type2.com library. It's called "Diagnosing Engine Trouble" by David
Schwarze. Good luck, a little systematic troubleshooting will fill in the
details that perhaps the PO forgot to mention.
