This is a stupid question from me, but will the dealer no longer cut 70's
vintage keys from code?  Our local dealer in WV did up into the very late 90s
at least (the old parts lady who had done it for 25+ years then, cut them.)  I
know she was still there about 4-5 years ago, though I hadn't had her cut one
in about 5 years at the time.  If she is still there and I provided the
blanks, I'm sure she still would/could.  At that time she was telling me how
she could still do any vintage-90s one but could not cut the then new style
Audi/VW keys with the little groove in the side of key as they weren't going
to buy a machine to do it and would have to order those keys in.  Food for
thought anyway folks, sometimes at least worth calling and asking I figure
if there is a 60s vintage dealership in your town.  I had her make 5-6 over
the years from the codes off the locks and they always worked fine.
