Subject: Rubber stops under luggage rack 69 Westy?

Howdy all,

Has anyone seen the rubber standoffs for sale that I might have missed?  
Mine are rock hard ( the ones I still have ) and I was hoping to replace 
them.  If they aren't forsale has anyone come up with a good way to 
replace them?

Thanks,

Stephen
