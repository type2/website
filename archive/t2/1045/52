Subject: Re: Swapping Out Key Locks - Plan B

OK... Since there appears to be so many issues about swapping out the
handles/locks between the 71 and 76... How about a plan B?

Can a key be made from the door locks (side, sliding, rear hatch) on the 71?

The ignition switch on the 71 is useless.  It was butchered by the PO and has
no retrievable key codes.

Where would the key codes be located on the door locks (side, sliding, rear
hatch)?

I looked at the locks last night and did not see anything.  Do I need to
remove the lock mechanism somehow from the handle and, if so, how?

Thanks,

Michael in Montevallo
