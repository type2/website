Subject: RE:  Swapping locks

The R code series is used from '71-'79 and all locks are rekeyable.  On the
side door with the seperate lock as opposed to the lock within the handle, It
CAN be done, but is difficult because the stainless facecap must be ground
off.  We've done them, though.  The code number on the door handles is on the
tailpiece, which is the "L" shaped piece on the end of the lock.  The
ignitions should be interchangeable between them all.  From what I can tell,
it would be simplest to code cut a key to the existing locks, then rekey the
ignition out of the parts bus to that code so a single key fits everything.  I
doubt your local locksmith has the parts.  Please email if there are any
questions.
