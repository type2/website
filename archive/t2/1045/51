Subject: Re- Fuel Pump testing

Hi Richard, et al- saw the link to testing Fuel pump/pressure regulator, 
etc on your site.  I test regulators by blowing compressed air into 
them. I always wondered why the 12mm hose between filter and pump- when 
I had the blocked tank snafu last Aug causing a burned out pump, I had 
to settle for a FLAPS bought similar looking Ford F-150 truck pump by 
Bosch, but the inlet nib was the same size as the outlet so I bought a 
clear plastic filter along with the pump.  Cool to actually see into the 
filter.  Anyone else use a different pump and standard filter?
    Can anyone explain why the difference in size on the T2 filter?
It worked fine, but that pump got noisy as the tank was still blocked 
(had to blow air up it) and it was noisy when I later unblocked the 
tank.  It's now the "spare" pump.
