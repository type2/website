Subject: nudging the front door to get out

When I get out of my 71 bus, I have to nudge the door with my shoulder;  the inside door release lever doesn't seem to release the door lock anymore... this sounds like the little spring in the door lock might need to be replaced?

Also When I open the door getting into the bus the little lever inside the door handle just barley seems to engage the internal mechanism to pop the door open..... seems hanging by a tread. 

I dont see any kind of adjustment in the bentley for the front door handle / lock..... 

Does this sound like the little spring lock is going going gone..... 

Thanks,
