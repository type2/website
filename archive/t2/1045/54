Tyler,

The brake light senders which screw into the master cylinder could be shot.

Pull the wires off them (carefully, as they're probably really old), clean
the spade terminals, put your multimeter on them, turn the key to the
"on" position, and have someone step on the brake pedal.  If you see a voltage
(12v, i suspect), your senders are good and you can look elsewhere.  

I've had to do this before on my '71...

Cheers,
   Tom
