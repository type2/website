Subject: RE: [T2] Swapping engines between a manual and automatic

Hey Troy,

From what I recall, it would be better to sell your Automatic and buy a
similar one with a manual. Anything can be done, but it may end up costing
you far too much in time and effort. There are very few similar parts in the
swap and both require substantial fabrication to the chassis.

I am sure you would find a flatlander buyer who would be happy with your
automatic '74. Chopping it up would just seem like a crime on such a nice
original bus.

I am contemplating a swap between Buster (a '78 manual transmission)  
and Vandejo (a '74 automatic.)  The drive plate, and vacuum lines for  
the transmission immediately come to mind in regards to the swap, but  
I want to make sure there is something else that I may be missing.   
Both engines are 2.0 FI.
