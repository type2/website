Subject: Westfalia Font

Anyone out there know of a source for a Westfalia style font?  Specifically, I
am looking for lettering like the WESTFALIA sticker that goes on the poptop
fiberglass.  I know I can get replacement Westfalia stickers but that would be
a good location and style to put the name of my bus.

Thanks,

Michael in Montevallo
