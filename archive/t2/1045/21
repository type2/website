   I can't see why not...Except
   you'd hafta find someone
   in England to send you the
   complete rig - everything
   you've got on the passenger
   side of your bus but mirror-
   imaged.

Thanks for the reply.  I don't want the door to open, only want to use the
door panel itself as a repair panel for my bad door.  Based on the Samba
classifieds, I thought some stateside buses were walkthroughs, I didn't
think it would require a UK/RHD bus as a donor.  That would be way more than
my bus is worth.  Oh well.
