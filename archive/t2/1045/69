Subject: Removing Engine Covers

I have a 1700 flat 4 motor, and I wonder what is the easiest way to pull the
cylinder covers? On first glance this seems like a trivial and
straightforward operation. I was astounded at how difficult it was. I must
be doing something wrong. Any help greatly appreciated.

Just to clarify, this is what I did:

Pulled everything that seemed to be in the way:
  -Carbs
  -Distributor
  -Vaccum lines/wiring

Also, I have seen a number of engines without the cylinder covers, aren't
they part of the cooling system - it's bad to not have them installed isn't
it?


Cheers,
