Subject: Can an engine lose compression from sitting?

I am working on a 77 Westfalia Automatic with the stock engine and it does not
have compression on two cylinders and around 50 on the other two.  It's been
sitting for several years.  When I did my compression check I did not squirt
oil in the cylinders. I was thinking of trying that.  The engine was out of
the Westfalia when I bought it because the guy was going to put carbs on it
but now am wondering if there is more to his story that I wasn't told. So what
do you think?  Any and all help will be appreciated.
Thanks,
Kevin
