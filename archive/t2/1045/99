Hi Volks,

It's that time again... if you want one of the 2008 limited-edition
t-shirts you will have to get your order in by July 28th. Paypal will be
gratefully accepted.

Note also that for 2008 I am offering up reusable cups and mugs. These
items are adorned with a durable solvent-free dishwasher-safe decal to
forever remind you of the great time you had at BOTC 2008. These items
will be available for on-site pickup only, at a cost of a mere $4 each,
which will include a $.50 donation to both type2.com and
fullmoonbusclub.com.

Images of the cup and mug are posted on the
merchandise page.

Also... It'd be great if you could drop me a line if you're planning on 
attending. Even if you're not sure yet and it's just a maybe thing, it'd 
help to know what the count is going to be like this year.


Happy Trails,
