Subject: 1974 Transporter that tipped

I have a 74 that tipped over on its right side. Since the roof got pushed
in, I'm being told that the entire roof, nose and right side must be
replaced or the bus will never be straight and line up properly. It's so
expensive. Does anyone have experience with or is it even possible to pull
out the roof line and re-align the vehicle so it can be put back together?
Can anyone help?
