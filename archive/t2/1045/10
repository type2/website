Remember you need to bleed the whole system after you're done. And
filling the switches just saves bleeding time and avoids mystery
problems. (Like, "Why do my brake lights only come on when I'm really
standing on the brake pedal?" I had that symptom when I replaced the
switches on my 73.)

This is a great time to flush the system's fluid, check and replace
any iffy hoses, etc.
