Subject: 82 Vanagon Westy upholstery fabric

Sorry if I posted this before on this list. 

I am looking for upholstery fabric for an 82 medium blue Vanagon Westy .. I
need to redo the front seats .. I'm thinking that the cover off of the over
the engine bay cushion would likely be enough ... anyone have any they are
looking to part with?
