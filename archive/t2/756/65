Subject: lights for vdo gauges and clocks?

Hi all,

Does anyone know where to find replacement bulbs and bulb sockets for VDO
gauges? I have an oil temp gauge that has never had a light, but there is a
metal socket about 3/8" in diameter on the back of the gauge that I assume can
be used for a light.

I also have an above-the-dash-mounted VDO clock that has a burnt bulb, but the
bulb is soldered into the circuit board inside the clock. The bulb seems to be
permanently attached to the socket, and the bulb and socket together form a
small cylinder. At the base of the socket are two wire leads that are meant to
be soldered into place in the circuit board of the clock. The numbers 7382 are
printed on the side of the socket, which is black. The length of the
bulb/socket combination is 5/8", and the diameter is approx. 7/32".

Any ideas?

Thanks!!
