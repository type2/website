Subject: Replacing the '69-79 Bus Front Door Lock Spring

I just used this article by Ron Van Ness for the second time. The little 
coil spring from hell broke in the passenger side door mechanism recently 
and i got around to doing it again yesterday. I had done the driver's side 3 
years ago.  Getting the door apart and the mechanism out takes only about 10 
minutes or so, but replacing that spring in that intricate lock mechanism is 
something else. Ron tells you to get your wife to do it for you, that was 
very helpful because she normally will not help me but did due to that 
sentence. She's a dentist and had to use about 6 little tools to coax that 
new VW dealer spring into place. The door now works like buttah...that tiny 
little coil spring being broken is a major issue, very very annoying. The 
new spring appears to be a redesign,  thicker and heavier, so hopefully it 
won't break again. I've got to wonder how many people have gotten fed up 
with their Bay buses due to the cranky door locks.

I highly recommend this to anyone suffering from Bay Window door lock 
syndrome- read this article and do it.
