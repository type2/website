Almost every vehicle (yes, sadly many filled with water as a coolant) 
I've owned has had a charcoal filled canister to deal with fuel vapour, 
and each manual I had said the same thing about how they worked. 
Basically the charcoal is there to absorb the fuel vapour (mostly 
produced whilst the car is parked) , and hold on to it until the engine 
is running, when it is drawn back for combustion. The charcoal is in 
effect a sponge, not a filter. Which is why we give it to patients  in 
the emergency department to absorb certain poisons from their stomachs. 
What did vary in the cars was the plumbing arrangements to get the 
vapour from the charcoal to the cylinders.
