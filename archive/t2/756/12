I'm also a ham and I've got a great ladder rack on the
top of mine.  I had to drill extra holes, so I have
holes available.  I'm going to get a simple L-bracket
and mount mine right on the rack.  It's a great rack
for around $150.  If anybody's interested, email me
and I'll send pics.  I'm quite proud of it.  I use it
to haul my hang glider.  Dig...KR
