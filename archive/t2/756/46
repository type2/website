Hey Guys  That is the ticket but be sure to face it flat side up towards the 
gears . If you do it the other way it will mess the teeth on the gears up. 
Also be sure to remove the big cerclip on top of the gears  .  I think that these 
type of tools from harbor  frieght arent near as good as what would come from 
Snap-on but if you dont use it everyday it will work OK. .Later and have fun
