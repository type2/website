Subject: YAIT (Yet Another Insurance Thread)

I finally got insurance yesterday. I know, I've been bad driving
without, but with the move and everything it just never made it to the
top of the pile.

Because it's a daily driver and gets lots of miles put on it, I didn't
bother with "collectable" or "classic" insurance programs.

Found something that really amazed me... My Volvo was cheaper!

6 month policy with upgraded amounts and a $300 deductable for 6 months:

1984 Volvo 244 GL = $204
1973 Volkswagen Transporter = $397

WTF?

Wife and I have no tickets or accidents. Bizarre...
