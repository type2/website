Subject: [T2] crankshaft--removing dist. drive gear

This must be nostalgia week... ages ago I made a distributor drive installing 
tool.  It turned up in the box with the pulling-collar for the timing gear, 
subject of earlier posts.  Basically the idea was to engage an inside surface 
at the top of the dist. drive shaft, locking an extension onto the dist. drive 
shaft, so you could hold on to the tool and drop in the shaft+tool, to get the 
orientation just right.  If you missed by a tooth or two, you just pulled the 
shaft+tool up and tried again.  Think of the handy screwdrivers that lock onto 
the head of a slotted-head screw... you will get the idea.  Clearly a PITA if 
you don't have a tool for the job.

Just a quick note to anyone considering a new replacement for their 
Type 1 motor...it would appear that VW Mexico does NOT include the 
dizzy drive gear installed in their new long blocks, and unless you 
REALLY know what you're doing and/or have the right tools, they are a 
PIA to install.
