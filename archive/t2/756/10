Boy does this sound familiar!

Similar situation.

Recently pulled the DC motor to find a brush spring lost while replacing 
generator brushes.  I also did torque the heads while it was out.

Anyway, the next day I had to drive a T3 motor up to the valley for some 
work and I headed off from OC.  Every thing was fine until I got to the 
Commerce Casino when she started to cut out...a quick pull over and a check 
of the fuel filter and ignition wires.  All was fine.  She idled and revved 
perfectly.  I jumped back in and continued on.  After getting on the freeway 
again and accelerating under load it started cutting out...damn!  Stop to 
check...again everything in order.

Well to make this short, over the course of the next 10 hours (the trip 
should have taken 2) I stopped at least 10 times! I did everything and 
checked everything.  I replaced the condenser, fuel filter, did a  complete 
carb teardown( checked jets and inlet/needle valve), distributor change 
(robbed form the T3 motor sitting in the bed), timing check, points check, 
hot wire check, lead to dist. check...blah blah blah!

On my final stop (I was about ready to hang the for sale sign BTW) it was 
getting dark.  I lifted the engine lid for the umpteenth time and crouched 
down and revved the motor in total frustration.  Wait what was that flash 
back behind the carb near the gen.  One more big rev and the spark showed 
itself again.  FINALLY
I realized what was happening.  The hot wire from the ing.. switch has a 
factory connector (small rectangle plastic insulated coupler) that usually 
hangs off to the right of the fan shroud.  In my cleanup I had taken the 
excess wire and coiled it up on a small screwdriver (to make the wire look 
nice and neat).  This had pulled the female end of that wire connector out 
of its insulation.  The bare end hanging out of the connector was just far 
enough away from the generator body that it would NOT short at idle.  But 
when a load was put on it, the thing would arc across the gap and short out 
the ignition.  DOH!

Its always the small things.  It is now logged in the memory banks as one 
more possible thing to check!
