Richard/John,

Thank you both for your reply and info!  Both numbers are key for me... I
think that 4200 is a good number to work with as an orange-line - an RPM not
to normally exceed... it's good to know that I'm "safe" to 5400 if needed.
Now to find some orange and red tape for the tach so I (and the wife) don't
forget.

The stock Type 4 engine doesn't really want to accelerate much after that
RPM so 4200 would be better redline to keep the engine to rather than the
factory spec I listed.
