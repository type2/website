Well, when I changed out my spark plugs a couple weeks ago to install my
CHT sender, they looked fine. I'm going to go ahead and attempt to remove
that screw from the #3 location and install a new sensor there. If I can't
I'll stick with the #2 location. I think what is in my engine is the
original sensor from April 1979!
