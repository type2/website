Actually, I'm the second owner of the bus. I bought it in 1985, it had
14000 miles on it and sat under a tree for a long time. The PO didn't
work on the bus. I think I paid 4K for it.

I'm afraid to say, it might have been my mechanic that altered the
location. I consider him a great mechanic. Whenever I get my bus
back from him, it runs like a brand new vehicle. He's well known
in this area and respected as a good VW mechanic. The only thing
I don't like, is sometimes I come back with some parts missing.
Nothing major though. Like, the plastic tab that goes into the
sheet metal where you adjust the belt tension. I just made a
cover out of some roof flashing and is held in place with existing
engine tin screws...works great.  The other thing I'm missing that
I would really like back..there were metal tubes, one on each side,
that takes the heat from the heat exchanges and sends it to the
outside rear of the engine when the heat is not going to the cabin.
I wonder if others have this and how important it is. I could
probably rig up something myself if I have to. I'd rather the tubes
though.
