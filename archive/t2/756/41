Subject: Re: [T2] crankshaft--removing dist. drive gear

I have done what Glenn talked about, but you need some really heavy plate or you
might bend it.. depending on how stuck that bearing is....  A mfg tool is
hardened and can be thinner and stronger....

Here is the tool that you can put behind the gears, and use a threaded puller,,
or put it in a press.

Hope that helps
