Subject: where to get a "taco plate"?

I am wanting to buy a Porsche-style "taco plate" oil
sump plate. I understand that most places no longer
have them and they are apparently out of production.
Any ideas?

Barring getting my hands on that, I would need to
obtain a regular type4 oil sump plate. Any ideas
there? TIA.
