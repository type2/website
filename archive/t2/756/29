Subject: Yellow type 2 Baltimore beltway Tues 6/14

Around 10:00a Tuesday, 6/14, I noticed a bright yellow type 2, perhaps 1965 
vintage (judging by the tail lights), on the inner loop of the Baltimore 
beltway near exit 3 or 4 or 5 -- presumably broken down, since the vehicle was 
on the shoulder.  I slowed to take a look and offer help, but saw no one.  Had 
to continue without waiting since I was barely on time for an appointment.

Does this yellow type 2 belong to anyone on the type 2 list??
