Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 oil cooler in a doghouse

Hello Arnaud    I have been making my own. you can do this with rivits but a 
welder works better  the type 4 cooler is 3 3/8  inches wide  the type 1 is 2 
1/2 inches wide . I havent seen any aftermarket ones . but it isnt too hard to 
make one  later and have fun  mark dearing
