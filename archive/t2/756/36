I like the big island, though it can be very humid at
times.  Are you in Hilo, Kona, or out in the country? 
Either Hilo or Kona would be a very small town
stateside.  But then so would Juneau, Alaska (the
capitol).  I think it rained every time I was in Hilo.
 I guess that's the wet side of the island.  But I
like it.  I like Mauii a lot.  But I'd probably live
on Oahu if I could.  I'm a jazz musician and it's rare
to find jazz in small towns.  And I'm a big WWII buff.
 I operated from the radio room of the USS Missouri
all afternoon one day.  That was a blast!  Talked to
people all over the world. (Didn't mean to make you
ham operators jealous) 

I'm going to plug my vent tube.  I don't give a crap
about reburning the stuff.  And the carbon filter has
been gone for a long time.  I've owned a lot of old
cars that haven't had a vent for the tank and have
never had a problem.  My engine is just old enough
that I don't have to worry about inspections.  So I've
made up my mind....

And the only thing better than half-naked hula girls
are naked hula girls.  But then those grass skirts are
somewhat appealing, ha.  I need to be there long
enough to learn to surf.  Looks like it'd be a blast. 
More fun than the hula girls?  Hmmm....

Mahalo, Timo....KR
