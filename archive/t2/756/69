Subject: Re: [T2] YAIT (Yet Another Insurance Thread)

I use Bear River Mutual Insurance here in Utah. Both my 71 Volvo p1800
and the 78 Bus run $275.82/year. I don't have collision and need to make
a call regarding how much comprehensive will cost to add. I did add 
Uninsured Motorist Property Damage for $30/each vehicle, in the event I'm 
hit by someone not presently insured. My wife's 99 Pathfinder runs about 
$530 for full coverage for the year.

The caveat with Bear River is, they wouldn't insure a truck I had
registered in Colorado a few years ago, and I have to certify I don't
smoke, drink, or use other illegal, mind altering substances. Not a big
deal for me, but it was a deal killer for my younger brother.
