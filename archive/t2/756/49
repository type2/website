Kevin, I would think twice about plugging that vent. Older cars didn't
have them because they were designed to vent out the gas cap (before
emissions control). On my 1977 the cap has a very tight seal. Pressure
has to go somewhere, with no vent it seems like it would pressurize the
fuel system, maybe pop off a hoze? Then you'd have liquid gas spraying
around the engine compartment!.........................................
Meanwhile, back in Hawaii, I live just down the road from Kamuela on the
dry side. Nice and breezy, gets down in the 50's in the winter
sometimes, but lots cooler than Hilo in the summer. The trick is to have
the hula girl waiting on the beach so when you finish your surfing
session you can both hop in the van and cruise!  B^)   Timo
