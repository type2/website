hey everyone. In a few hours we will be taking the newly painted bus
on a westward journey. We will be going to yellowstone in a round
about way through S Dakota, Iowa and other exotic places. Leaving from
Dickson, TN and our way back will find us going through the Denver
area. If you see us honk or wave. We have the airs list and are
planning on having a fantastic time.
