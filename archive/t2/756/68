Subject: Why I drive my Van

Scott,

Well, I discovered why I drive my van. I was reminded.

For one thing, it is fun.

Even with the hitch on it, it still handles the same, which is poorly. 
It does not like to corner and you need lots of room to brake. This is 
all normal, so I drive the speed that I would like to end up in the 
ditch at.

While driving at 80, I notice I am looking at more scenery and enjoying 
the touring.

Also, people love to follow me as they are always there when I look in 
the rear view mirror.

Cheers,

Alan
