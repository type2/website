Subject: spark plug seal 

Hi Volks

I have been very dissatisfied with the seals that come with Bosch wire sets, in a few month period time , they shrink and harden and don't seal anymore.
I am looking for suggestions for ways to effectively seal around the spark plug wires where they go through the cooling tin. 

I've seen in the type2 archive that the boots from the chevy corvair style spark plug seals could make it,  but was unable to find them over Internet.

Any  idea ?

Thanks a lot.

Have a great WE !!!
