Subject: Re [T2] burning bus on COPS

Kevin, I live on the Big Island and I do know how good I got it! B^)
Split window busss are getting scarce on this island, rust never sleeps.
A clean bay goes for $3-$5,000 on average. I saw a very clean 1971
Westfalia advertised for $3,500. I picked my 1977 Kombi, with a fried
top end, together with a crusty parts bus with a running 1600 for $500.
Shipping a bus here from California runs  about $900. I have heard that
shipping a Westfalia with the propane tank is a hassle now, since 9/11,
but I've never tried. Housing here is VERY expensive, we joke: "VW vans
are the only affordable housng". I always encourage anyone coming here
to bring a van along, camp in it while your here and sell it when you
go. Very doable, most public parks have fresh water and showers, some
even have free electricity!  The last van I sold: 1970, back taxes owed,
no engine, $300. I got over 20 calls!  By the way...I got the starter
working in the '71, a good solenoid cleaning was all it took! Thanks to
all the replies and suggestions off the list, Type2.com RULES....right
after surfing and half-naked hula girls!  B^)  Timo
