Here are a few sound files for the engine noise archives. -

73 1700 single holley (same as weber).

Feedback on the tock-tock-tock would be much appreciated.

Direct links:
http://nomad.freezope.org/bus/StartingIdle.wav - first try ruined by
narration while moving recorder.
http://nomad.freezope.org/bus/enginenoise.wav - second try.  Idling
then a few revs.

Running on last winter's StaBIL gas.  Started a few times.  Driving
around the block before these recordings.

Heading out for camping 30 miles away.
