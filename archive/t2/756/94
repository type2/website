Subject: loss of horsepower and is overheating

After grad night my buddies and I decided to go to eat at ihop. I filled my 
tank up all the way.(first time since i bought the bus) I got on the freeway 
and my bus started losing power. i finally pulled off the road and it was 
steaming. I let it cool and then put some oil in ti. After i continued to ihop on 
the streets. My bus went so slow but i got there. I finally got home I changed 
the fuel filter which was very dirty because of the new rust i got which was 
from the top of the tank. I had trouble starting it in the morning but then 
finally did after a while of tinkering and a new filter. but it is still very 
slow. I can get it to rev. but it takes a while. I have a pretty good engine but 
recently it started acting up. There is an oil leak that i have been ignoring. 
It is coming from the plates that cover the cooling tins under the engine. Im 
sure it is not coming from there but rather dropping from somewhere higher and 
finally dripping lower at the tins. I am also missing the seal around the 
engine which conects it to the body and helps keep the heat from the bottom of 
the engine getting to the top half. Im not sure if this is what is causing the 
over heating or not. one more thing it just started making a  rattling noise 
when i start the engine. and when i turn it off. It sounds like a can being 
dragged on the floor. if anyone has any idea on how to fix any of these problems 
that just are overwhelming me all at once. please please give me some advice. 
thanks.
