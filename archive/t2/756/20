Subject: vapor line paranoia

As a good buser I checked my fuel lines before heading off on our
camping trip 30 milies away.
We're going without the bus tonight, maybe take it tomorow depending
on the feedback from the list.
Gas to carb is a new line, all well.
Carb to vent lines gallery here:

 I see
* The connection from the carb is pathetic, but dangerous? (

* the rusted firewall hole has taken a number of nibbles out of the
line (  FirewallScores.jpg ), sorry, slightly out of focus.
* The hose at the other connection has a number of odd hairline rings
around it ( ventSidetube.jpg)

**Would you drive this bus to an in-county campground?**

Thanks,
