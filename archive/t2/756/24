Subject: RE: [T2] 78 Bay Drum Brake Q?

Special thanks. 

I got the brakes done, the van stops on a dime.

The trick was to disconnect the parking brake by pulling the pin at the base
of the brake lever.  Once the parking brake was loose, then I re adjusted
the drum shoes again and then re connected the park break.

No its done.

Whew...

Thanks to all for your comments and support. 

David..
