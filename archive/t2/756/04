Subject: Re: [T2] CB Radio Antenna install

A general rule of thumb for CB is that the antenna should be:

a) Longer than 40"
b) mounted on a good ground
c) the tallest thing on you vehicle.

with a pop-top you have a whole bunch of challenges to deal with.  For my Ham radios, I have the antennas mounted to the rear load-bar on my Thule rack.  The rack is mounted to the gutters using their hi-lift risers.  I have also run a seperate ground wire from the body under the luggage rack to the antenna bases.

The other solution is to find a 1/2 wave antenna (sometimes sold as a "no-ground plane" or "marine" antenna) and mount that to the gutter.

Avoid folding mounts, or anything overly clever.  A CB has very little output power, and any "clever tricks" in the antenna mount could cost you some serious range.

Good Luck!
