You can cut wholes in the type 4 cylinder covers for the plugs in 914 heads 
and then cover the old holes with grommets. We did this on a 914 engine that 
we put bus tin on for a customer just a few months back. We used a nice 
metal whole drill bit thingy and then found some really nice grommets and it 
looked clean. Measure eight times, cut once then break out the dremel. Oh 
yeah then paint.

This engine went in a '72 which makes the dipstick issue a bigger problem?? 
I think you can get a flexy dipstick and go home happy.
