Emissions equipment was the regulation IIRC. Since ignition is part of
the emissions, it was necessary.

What I've never figured out was how they were supposed to get 50k
before platinum plugs. If the plugs had to be replaced every 12k miles
why not just leave the points?

Bleh. Cali laws have always been confusing...
