Subject: Fun with carbs (never assume!)

Yes, where it gets tricky is when two (2) things are wrong at once, or close
to the same time !!  In my case recently it was a dead battery AND a
disconnected wire at the ignition. I got it fixed but was stumped for a good
half-hour.



Those loose wires will trick you every time.



Thx,

Shawn
