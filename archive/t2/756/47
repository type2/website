Subject: Re: [T2] vapor^HVACUUM line paranoia

After removing the hose, including the metal endthe second part of the
hose (after the check valve) ...I found that that metal end traveled
right up to that big round jobby the master cylinder is hooked to.
In taking the braided line off of the metal line I broke off the
portion of the metal line.  There's still about an inch on this side
of this support pass through, so I may be able to connect to it
without replacing that tube.

Of course ran the bus without that line connected and it barely ran
due to the major vacuum leak. Bus will stay cozy at home and no
attempts to lock close that off and run as is.  I'll record it for the
archives later.

The rubber tubing did split at the hairline crack.

Should've gotten holistic...

Wonder if that crappy tubing is a source of my acceleration "flat
spot". Of course weber factor and and tune-up pending...   You ask
what I've been doing all spring?  Family and work stuff..
