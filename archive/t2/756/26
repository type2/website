Subject: vapor line paranoia

I would change those hoses within 48 hours.  If anything you could drive to
parts store, buy new hoses and change them while camping.



For info I wrote a procedure for changing the fuel hoses on carbed busses.

The change is quite easy and really does take about 15 mins.





Best regards,

Shawn



P.S. The type2 library also has an article by Billy Price for changing hoses
on fuel injected busses







>> **Would you drive this bus to an in-county campground?**
