Dear Don,

Good, the tubing you're was what I thought about going for..... You
EGR looks lovely and clean. Mine has been re welded and I am missing
the pipe heading south next to the vaccum pipe that goes via rubber to
the air thermostat......... It's good to see another one in an image
and not on a fiche.

yours

Charles
