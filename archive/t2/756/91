Subject: Type 4 oil cooler in a doghouse

There has to be a website with infos on how it is done but I'm still
looking for it. Anyone ?

In particular, is it "bolt on" for a type 1 doghouse as far as oil
cooler goes ?
Can i do it with a hacksaw and pop rivets ? I mean without a welder.
Can I buy a doghouse new that is modified for type 4 ?
Anyone has dimensions of a type1 and type4 coolers ?
Thanks !
