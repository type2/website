Subject: Re: [T2] crankshaft--removing dist. drive gear

Absolutely right... remove the circlip, heat in oil bath, and don't mess up the 
teeth of the gear you are pulling!  Ditto for the end of the crank if you use a 
puller.

FYI... I went through my old files this morning and found photos of all my VW 
tools EXCEPT the pulling-collar for the timing gear :-((  Murphy's Law at work.
