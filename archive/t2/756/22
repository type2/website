Subject: Brittle wire in engine bay

Dear All,

I have quite a few brittle wires in my engine bay and it seems that
any that do not have an extra shrouding are the ones that are
suffering. Can anyone suggest a suitable shroud / conduit for the
wires? I can use conduit from a hardware shop but ......?!?

yours

Charles
