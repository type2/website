Subject: Americans going to BOTC?

Hi,

Is anyone from the eastern seaboard of the US heading to Buses of the 
Corn the first weekend of August? The event takes place outside of 
Toronto. BOTC is very much like EB in the spirit of the event although 
I must admit Greg is a little more organized!

The web site is here http://www.busesofthecorn.com/

We are planning to cross the border on Wednesday the 3rd of August, do 
Toronto on the 4th and arrive at the campground Thursday night.
