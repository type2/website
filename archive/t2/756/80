Subject: Tach-> Red-Line/Idle/Wiring

Dear Group,

 

As you can see, based on my subject line, I've got some questions.  I
installed a tach today in my, what I believe to be a, stock 1979 Federal
Westy (90K on the odometer).  I've perused the owner's manual and Bentley
looking for a statement regarding motor red-line and didn't see any mention
- I also did a search in the archives and didn't find what I was looking for
either.  I do remember this topic coming up many times, but I didn't have a
tach then so I didn't take note of details.  I don't usually drive the bus
hard & I know that its 25 years old (hey my MGA is 45 years old. but it has
a tach with a pretty red line on it) so I would like to know where/when I
reach a 'bad' engine speed.

 

Second, now that I've got a tach, I notice that I'm idling a bit high ~1200
rpm.  I'm guessing that I'm going to have to read up on tuning.  Any pearls
of wisdom before I begin?

 

Oh yes, one more thing. I am new to busses and, boy is it far from the motor
to the dash (wire wise that is).  As I am planning to get a CHT gauge and I
know that wire length could very well be an issue. what is the preferred
path one takes to run wires from engine gauges (CHT, Oil Pressure, Oil Temp)
to dash?

 

Thanks in advance for your help!
