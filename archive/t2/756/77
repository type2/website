It's been over 10 years since I had the engine rebuilt. I don't know
if the heads were swapped or not. It looks like both heads have some
threaded opening on the outside of each air intake port. According to
the picture Richard has, I have that opening on my left hand head.
It's just that a screw is there instead of the temp sensor.

Don't know. Maybe one of his mechanics left it off...or maybe he
personally feels its not necessary. I dunno.

I'm going to try to get some from him. He's got a bunch of beetles/buses
in the back of his shop.  Everything on my heating system appears
intact..inclusing the flapper valves. I just dont have the tubes.
