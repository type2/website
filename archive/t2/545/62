It still creates a non-porous seal though.

I have to wonder about that because the paint in the body cavities still allowed the rust to fester. The painter put in the POR15 to permanently seal it up and prevent future rusting. Hopefully I won't be able to report how long it lasted...

A gallon coats 350 sq. ft. and costs $95/gal but I get your point although automotive paint isn't cheap either and why use a cheapo paint in the dark places only.

I'm not a painter or a marketer but their FAQ is worth reading:
