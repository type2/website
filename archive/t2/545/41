I would recommend that instead of bondo you use fiberglass resin. Bondo
will just soak up the water as soon as it cracks (which its guaranteed to
do). Fiberglass resin will seal the area in question for many years (from
personal experience). Just clean up the rusted area really well before
hand. I usually start with a screwdriver to scrape off all the scale and
then go after it with 36 grit paper. Then, before you put the resin on
scuff up the entire area you'll be repairing. If you have any holes more
than 1/4 inch you'll need a way to cover them so the resin doen't flow
right through and I've used just a piece of masking tape to fill over the
small holes.
