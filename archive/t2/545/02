James,
I wasen't deeming anything correct.
I was explaining  was what is correct from a  professional standpoint.

I have found out in life one person's quest to get the job done "right"
isn't always the proper way.

As an example--it's just like the one man's definition of the word
"Mint".

I've seen a bunch of advertised "mint" vehicles--that belonged in a bone
yard--
 
So--with this in mint--the Slick 50 of the body work profession is just
a temporary band aide--and not the final solution.

If this stuff worked out for your quest for an OK quick fix job --great.

The stuff is just a back yard cave and pave job, and I wouldn't never
use it on any client's vehicles--nor would any other body shop--

( Not that I am aware of anyway )

This says a bunch---
