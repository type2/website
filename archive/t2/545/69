Wait---!!

I thought I was just hosing the paint on---

Now I'm into the sheet metal end of it too?

4 cases of the Captain--and some dancing girls would coerce me
--possibly--:>)

Ok, two cases of Morgan, start with welding original metal into my front
floor, and lead her everywhere she needs after some panel loving to my
dents, and a nice job over my original paint on my 66, ok? Hell, I'll
make it 3 cases. I'll be nice and detail paint my undercarriage myself.
Oh, and I need the front windshield surrounds repair right, so more
leading there... :)
