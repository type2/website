"I wasn't doubting its quality as a physical barrier. Like I said, I
liked how it applied.
But the metal would still require proper preparation."

Your absolutley correct Don---

Prep the heck outa the bare metal, prior to laying anything on top of
it--just as if you were going to paint it--

This bed liner material is almost bullet proof stuff---

And I'd almost bet that if ya put enough of it on any surface it would
also be a good sound deadner too.
