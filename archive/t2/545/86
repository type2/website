I have one to top that--

At the local Ryno Hyde dealer he has picture's of a F-150 PU tuck that a
guy who worked in the woods had them cover the whole outside of the
truck in it--

Red Ryno Hyde--

The truck was a late model unit too--

Yeowza--

And I'd thought I'd seen it all--(????)


I'd really have to some thinking about putting this stuff on my boots
though--:>)

You guys might think I'm telling a tale but my friend who waorked at the
local Rhino Liner shop told me about a hiker guy that would come by and
have them coat his boots! No the whole thing, just some portion b/c they
were wearing out and he did not have the $$$ for new ones yet.
Apparently they were doing it for free.
