Yep - going to have to look for that 1000 deg rated Phoenix edition water noodle. Wait - - - can't have water to play in in Phoenix with 1000 deg summer days... <grin> 

Sure wish I was a measure twice, cut once guy. Then I'd feel confident about cutting up the proper part... <grin>

Thanks!

Forget the hardware aisle and head over to "Sports". I was thinking 
about trying a poly-urethane foam "Swim noodle" in this application. 
Buy a 3" diameter noodle and slit it lengthwise almost to the centre on 
both sides.
