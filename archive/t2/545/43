Richard,

Not so!  

Take another look at that engine!

I didn't pay top $$$ for new boxes and *not* powder coat them!

Eastwood..from the page on Hi-temp powders.

"These high silicone content powders withstand temperatures up to 1000 
degrees F and offer superior durability when compared to brush and 
spray-on coatings. Must be applied to clean bare metal."

So far, they really do look just like the day I powder coated them!

So there, there *really* is a Santa Claus, Virginia<grin>.

Cheers, dave
