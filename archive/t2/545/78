Subject: WTB - westy rear seat belts

list,

i need a set of rear seatbelts from a late westy. they are for our VW Thing
project, it seems like they are the same part. the ones in the Thing are in
grim shape.

anyone know what years have these same rear belts (i know our '79 belts are
the same as what i need)

anyone on the list have a set of rear belts from a 76 onwards westy in good
to very good condition?
