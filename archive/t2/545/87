<  Hey when we having this painting festival??? 
Wouldn't be a bad idea seriously - for a half dozen bus folks to get
together and paint a bunch of busses together at one time. Prob work
really good for driver buses. Those show guys are a bit pickier of
course!!! <grin!>

I'm in.

I think this would be a neat idea--

Who's supplying the bake booth??

God?

If ya could get enough bodies moving at once this could be a neat
thing--

Bus painting en-mass--

Someone will have to supply a big load of Paruvian marching dust---this
could be a long affair--:>)

LOL !!

I think this one would make World News Tonight--Peter Jennings reporting
the EPA crashing an outdoor paintfest cult happening in Tennessee.

I can see it all now--
