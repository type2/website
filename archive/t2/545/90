Subject: Re: [T2] 1971 bay vs 1969 bay

The only way to tell a '68 from a '69 on the exterior is the different door
handles.  Other than that, they're identical from the outside.  Although I
do think there are a few other small differences overall, I once heard
mention of no firewall in the engine compartments of '68s, is this true?

On a semi-related note, does anyone know what years they used the door locks
down next to the interior handle on the front doors rather than the more
standard top-pull position?  And does anyone know why they changed?

"'69-
-manual drum brakes all the way 'round
-small circular side reflectors
-4-prong turn signal flasher
-singleport 1600
-spring-actuated clutch"

I thought only the '68s had round reflectors...
