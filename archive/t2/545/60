Subject: EB04 - Long Distance Apology

Hi,

EveryBus was fantastic this year and a little hectic for me. Among 
the awards that is given each year is a long distance driving award. 
This award is usually offered up to the person who makes the longest 
specific to EB drive. This year, on the fly, I decided to give it to 
Larry Chase http://www.roadhaus.com/ in celebration of his fantastic 
journey around the continent and for the wonderful fellowship he 
brought to EB.

It did not occur me at the time that I should also recognize folks 
that drove straight to EveryBus only for the purpose of being there. 
I has been pointed out that I have done a disservice by not 
recognizing those folks for their tremendous commitment and efforts 
to get to EB. I am very sorry and I hope you will all forgive me.  I 
would like to recognize folks publicly in this forum.

The hands down winner is
Leo, 1982 Vanagon,  Tulsa OK, 1120 miles driven straight in less than 22 hours.
Way to go Leo!!!!!!!

I spent some time going through the registration book for EB04 and 
starting compiling a list of anyone who drove more than 500 miles to 
get to EB. The distances are estimated using the postal code for EB 
and the postal code for the bus owner as entered in the EB04 book. I 
hope I did not miss anyone.
