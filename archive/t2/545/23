Check fuel flow to the pump:
 
Remove the hose from the bottom of the tank. Any flow? I had a foriegn object blocking the tank outlet once.
 
Then remove the hose from the filter to the pump. Any flow from the filter? I got a tank of gas full of crap once that clogged the filter.

checked for spark, have that, fuel pump runs while
cranking and manually pushing the flap open on AFM. 
My diagnosis is that fuel pump, althought running is
not actually pumping.  any other suggestions on the
cause before i order a new one.  any way of testing
old one?
