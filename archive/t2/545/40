Richard,

Yeah! and mine makes Kazoo sounds when I get it over about 50mph.

Guys, the reason that I used open cell was that it just didn't look like
anything but open cell was going to be able to compress enough to even try 
to seal against the "uneven" top and bottom distances.

Please someone, tell us what it's called!

Cheers, dave
