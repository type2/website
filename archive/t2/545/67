You caught the double ended sword here--your on the ball--


Yep --even the weakest places on earth to get anything done don't use
it--

But--I forgot something really big here--
(Let me slap myself on the forehead once)

This is the first place I ever actually saw anyone admit to brushing and
rolling their vehicles and were proud of it---

Wh even bother with priming it with anything?

The Dutch Boy has 30 year house paint available-

I do believe I'm talking to something brick in nature--

"Hello Wall"---:>)

Ok--lets talk about tire's or something new  and refreshing, and awe
inspiring now---

Take Care--

Terry, And your point is that professional shops don't use it? Last time
I checked nobody ever thought the likes of Maaco, Earl Shieb etc, are
"professional" shops... In fact I'd be more concerned about using POR 15
if these outfits actually DO use it... LOL 
And no I'm not taking a position on POR, never used it, don't even own a
bus. But after reading your posts re POR over the past 2 years I'm
really surprised you would mention these companies in your ongoing
crusade to convince people that using POR to stop / slow rust is just
wrong, wrong, wrong...
