Subject: RE: [T2] fresh air foam seals

My father is certified as an HVAC repairman, and he brought home a roll of 
foam that was perfect for this application.  I did all of my flaps and they 
seal beautifully.  Look in the yellowpages and find your nearest HVAC 
wholesaler.  Walk in and ask him if he'll sell you a strip.
