Phil,

Go back and read their FAQ...I think they say that heat will *not* cause 
it to dry faster, only a high humidity environment.

Phil,  they do say that the fumes are DANGEROUS!  This is one of the
few things that I *always* put on my organic vapor mask for.

The powder coat folks say that you should *never* cook your powder coat in 
the same oven that you cook food in...I suspect that por15 vapors in a 
food oven would be worse...

please think it over...

Cheers, dave
