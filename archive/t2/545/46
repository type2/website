"what is it called?"

I believe it is called plenum sealing foam-tape.  The roll I got was about 
four inches wide, and 1/8" thick.  I think if you describe what you are 
looking to do, the supplier can offer a reasonable solution.  Much like 
facial tissue, not all manufacturers call it Kleenex.  It did not have a 
label on the roll when it was given to me.
