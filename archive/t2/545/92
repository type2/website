Subject: Re: [T2] More foam seals - engine compartment

This is just a temp fix. With this Corvair implant I'm going to cut the foam up into a dozen pieces until I figure out just how I'm going to make it work best. Don't want to do it to a $30 seal. Apparently I'm not "Junkyard Wars" material as I'm neither fast nor do I make things that fit right the FIRST time... <grin> 

Want to make something expendable and then once the bugs are worked out, I'll buy the RIGHT VW part and put it to work.
