Subject: tranny suggestions?

I have a '71 westy, and I'm replacing the stock motor with a ~2000cc (90.5 x
78.8) engine.  I'm thinking about investing in a tranny with a taller 4th
gear, but I'm unsure what this will do to the motor (cooling, etc).  Does
anyone have experience with a similar scenario or have any general advice?
I know I'm being overly brief about the engine specs, but I'm sorta just
fishin for advice...

Thanks!
