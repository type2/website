Subject: Another request to check out a bus

Hello list,

First, thanks to the bus community in Houston for offering
to check out a bus down there in the heart of Texas.  Too
much rust, too bad....

OK, any listees in the Santa Monica area?  There's a bus
for sale that I'm hoping someone can inspect for me.
I will more than gladly compensate you for your time
and expertise.

P-mail me off list if you are available in the next week or
so:

Thanks,

James
