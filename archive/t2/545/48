Gotta love this FART. Seems everyone tends to get a bit testy when we
use terms like proper and correct. The TRADITIONAL body and rust
repair procedure is as Terry talks about. Advances in chemicals have
allowed many products onto the market that allow the same final
outcome. Only time will tell if things like POR15 actually will stop
the spread of rust, but someone has to put it on their vehicles for
everyone to find out :)
