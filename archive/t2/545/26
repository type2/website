Did this to the 68 bus when the core was hooped.

You need all the tin, need the oil cooler off the upright. The hold down
bolt for the oil cooler has to be drilled and tapped for a larger bolt. A
hole needs to be drilled and tapped in the case for the oil pressure sender.
The hole in the case where the oil filler went in the type 3 can be blocked
with a combo cover/dipstick availible at a parts store or you can buy a
cover and drill for a dipstick. The holes for the moustache bar are in the
same place as the type three, cant remember if I had to tap them larger but
I think it was a bolt in. If memory serves me right I used the same heads
off the type 3 and replaced the valves. Like I said going off memory here,
but it wasnt a real big deal to do if you've got a core type 1 engine.
