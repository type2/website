Subject: Re: [VB] powder coating in phoenix

The ABC has used Arizona Powder Coat on Eash Washington to sandblast raffle bus wheels in the past.  This year we even had the wheels powdercoated.  No complants.  $100 for the 4 wheels.  Don't know if that is good or bad price, but it was close and easy. 

At work I need to get molds coated with a mold release grade teflon and use High Performance Coatings in Chandler.  They specialize in the fancy high end ceramic and other coatings.  Might be better for exhaust items.

I have seen that Competition Engeineering uses both places for some of their vehicles, for whatever that's worth.

I'm not affiliated with any of these places other than mentioned.
