Subject: Aux battery size / rating?

Hey folks...

What is the appropriate physical size of a Bus battery (or aux battery, 
though they look the same to me).  I'm looking for a "size code" that I 
can use when pricing new batteries.

I looked in my glovebox manual, and it didn't say.  Archives / Library 
check didn't turn up anything, either.

Thanks!
