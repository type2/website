Hartmut,

you have a European market 1600 engine ... Which muffler parts do you
need? I will be in Germany next week and can try to help you with them.
On another note: try to find a good 2L engine soon as a backup. The
Vanagon 1600 engines have a horrible cooling setup and are known drop
valve seats faster than any other air cooled VW.

Check out this listing and find the part numbers you need (it is a
zipped PDF file): http://www.wagenteile.org/pdf/t3lbx16.zip

Hi list,

I have a real problem with my 80 Vanagon/L. I can't find a muffler.
Frank
Condelli looked for the motor # CT 131429 and he can't find one. I was
at
OWASCO one of the biggest VW dealers in Ontario Canada and they didn't
found
the motor # at all and think that this a 1600cc singel carb engine used
for
industrial purpose like the ice sweeper for a hockey arene.
Is there anyone out there who can help me?
The muffler is rather special. No cross member and has the pipes from
the
heater boxes going to the muffler unit on the right and left outside.
The
endpipe is on the left side that means there eare two oval flanges om
the left
and one on the right side. I could go for a coustom made uint but the
price is
very high and it would be the last step. The muffler ist the hurdle to
get her
certyfied.

Hartmut
