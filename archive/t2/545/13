Subject: RE: [T2] Re: POR 15 Corrosion Control Process

Ok, two cases of Morgan, start with welding original metal into my front
floor, and lead her everywhere she needs after some panel loving to my
dents, and a nice job over my original paint on my 66, ok? Hell, I'll
make it 3 cases. I'll be nice and detail paint my undercarriage myself.
Oh, and I need the front windshield surrounds repair right, so more
leading there... :)

Bring a case of Captain Morgan--and I'm on the job--

Can't say how bizarre the paint jobs will be--

You guys like Flames and Scallops?

How bout some Pearl Flip-Flop jobs?

Yea baby---cosmic Buses--:>)

No guarantee's on the paint if I have to blow over POR 87-- LOL--!! 

 
<Ive got the solution to make everyone happy. Since terry is a
professional and hates paint jobs done wrong... He can derust and paint
everybodys bus and well never use a drop of por again. of course he
would volunteer his services because he cares so strongly about it....:)
