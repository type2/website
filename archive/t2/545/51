for goodness sakes, the original seal is 30 dollars. i can understand making
the part if it is either very expensive or NLA, but this seal is neither,
and it is a critical part. it is available at any vendor that sell bus
parts.

hey, i am all for fabricating parts, on my thing restoration project i have
"cheaped out" in many places where taking apart and rebuilding or even
making from scratch was more cost-effective than buying a new part, but this
is not the place for this sort of experimentation.
