Hi Chris,

Forget the hardware aisle and head over to "Sports". I was thinking 
about trying a poly-urethane foam "Swim noodle" in this application. 
Buy a 3" diameter noodle and slit it lengthwise almost to the centre on 
both sides.

They're waterproof, but I have no idea how they'll hold up to high heat 
applications. Strangely enough, the manufacture does not list this 
quality in the specs. You got to admit they're a lot more colorful than 
the stock part.

Happy trails,
