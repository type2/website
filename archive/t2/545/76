I often cure small painted parts in the oven at 200 degrees for about 30
minutes. This hardens/ages the paint considerably and I don't have to wait
for overnight drying.

Recently, I POR 15'ed some small parts and after baking them for 30 minutes
I found that the POR 15 was wetter (flowed more) than when freshly applied.
So am I correct in assuming that POR 15 does not cure with heat or at least
as in the oven at 200 degrees as does normal spray can paint? Anyone else
have this experience?
