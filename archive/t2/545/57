Subject: trans fix. 75' stuck in 2nd

a NON-VW driver power shifted a friends 75 bus into
2nd gear, and wondering if any of the Techs out there
have a shortcut short of dropping the engine and
tranny. There seems to be a little room in the front
if you unbolted the nosecone. We already tried thru
the reverse light switch hole.

Thanks Shaggy
