Thanks. I have a friend that used to work at Rhino Liner franchise. I think their's was a two part mix. Dunno if it is any different (better or worse) than the rattle can version. 

I know I can buy a different brand at the local auto body shop supply store. 

Thinking it might be good to protect the floor from above but I'm concerned about problems from below. 

I think we've discussed this before but I always seek out new voices and perspectives on old topics. 

Thanks! 

Chris
