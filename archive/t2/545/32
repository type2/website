Subject: More foam seals - engine compartment

Anyone find a locally available (hardware store sourced) engine to body foam seal for a late bay? 

Don't mind ordering the right one from one of the online vendors but I need one "right now"... 

I'm going to check the weatherstripping and plumbing insulation departments tonight...
