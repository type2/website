Subject: Re: [T2] POR 15 yes or no

I'm going to weigh into the debate with some photos. My painter was a professional, took the entire body down to metal on the outside, cut out all the rusty metal and still protected the body cavities from future rusting with POR-15. Check back with me in 25 years for an update...
