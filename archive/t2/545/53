Isn't there *some* benefit to having a rust inhibiting covering under 
and other wise 'proper' repair job?

The whole "POR-15 is snake oil" thing is real bitchy I think.

Maybe it's not the greatest, and I have not used it directly, but have 
used another brand.

What I found was if you clean the metal down to shiny but with a little 
discoloration left, apply a thin coat and after it hardens coat with a 
proper paint then I have yet to see further leak though of rust from 
there areas.

Main location I used it in is the battery tray area.

Before dismissing something, find out more about it, and it's proper 
application.
