Subject: Bedliner Sprays (Was:POR 15 Corrosion Control Process)

I picked up a rattle can of bedliner to experiment with on my bus in the 
same way... As a mass addition to panels, insulation, etc.

I've only used it on a scrap of wood to play with. I like how it goes on, 
but it feels rather rigid... I doubt it would be very good as a sound 
insulation.

From what I've read about Rhino and other bedliners, it protects PAINT. Not 
metal.
