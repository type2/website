Subject: fresh air foam seals

Has anyone found a *good* replacement for this?  The "open cell" stuff I 
was using just is not doing a good job.  The closed cell foam I have found 
just did not seem to llook like it would work well against all of the 
surfaces.

I remember someone talking about using some kind of calk and saran wrap to 
make new ones(sort of), but haven't had good luck with that method either.

Did I miss some method?

Looked in the library, but "fresh" did not pop up.
The closest I found there was just duct taping over them(in the 
winter)....I want mine to work properly *all* the time.


Thanks, dave
