Terry, And your point is that professional shops don't use it? Last time I
checked nobody ever thought the likes of Maaco, Earl Shieb etc, are
"professional" shops... In fact I'd be more concerned about using POR 15 if
these outfits actually DO use it... LOL

And no I'm not taking a position on POR, never used it, don't even own a
bus. But after reading your posts re POR over the past 2 years I'm really
surprised you would mention these companies in your ongoing crusade to
convince people that using POR to stop / slow rust is just wrong, wrong,
wrong...
