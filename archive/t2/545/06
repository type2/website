Yes, manifold vacuum will definately change at different engine speeds, 
especially if the engine is on a decel with the throttle plate closed 
(highest vacuum).  That is how MAP (manifold pressure) based EFI systems 
measure the amount of air flowing into the engine.

Now, interestingly enoungh the system used by the vacuum advance is also 
a primitive way of sensing load on the engine.  Whenever you're opening 
up the throttle plate, you're most likely going to load up the engine 
and therefore you need to advance timing.  Pretty smart design.

I'm *really* looking forward to the UltraMegasquirt.  It's going to 
support EFI, electronic ignition, and WB02.  Now, you'll have a totally 
electronic distributor with fully customizable ignition curves.  No more 
dizzy, no more points, aw yeah!  I believe that it's even going to have 
idle-control timing to bring those high idle rpms down.  How cool would 
that be... but that's only a rumor ;)

later,
Mike
