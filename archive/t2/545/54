Subject: Re: [T2] POR 15 yes or no

Hi Volks,

My understanding of POR and related products is that they do two things:

1. they convert rust to an inert compound.
2. They seal the surface against further corrosion.

If you read the label carefully you will find that the product does not 
react with bare metal, only with rust. If you apply POR to paint it 
just coats the surface, and when it cures it loses its ability to 
convert rust.

In other words, POR applied to bare metal offers no better protection 
than a comparable paint. At a MUCH higher price.

POR does create a good coating, but its price point makes more sense 
for rust treatment than as a sealant for bare metal.  Equivalent or 
superior sealant products have to be available for less than 
$200/gallon.

I used Mar-Hyde's "One-Step" product to prep the westfakia, and I have 
been very happy with the results. Previously undetected (and untreated) 
bondo repairs have bubbled up since it was repainted but the "One-Step" 
has held up fine for three full seasons. YMMV.

Happy trails,
