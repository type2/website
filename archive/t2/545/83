You guys might think I'm telling a tale but my friend who waorked at the local Rhino Liner shop told me about a hiker guy that would come by and have them coat his boots! No the whole thing, just some portion b/c they were wearing out and he did not have the $$$ for new ones yet. Apparently they were doing it for free.
