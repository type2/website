41 is the standard battery size but the smaller 42 fits also. There is often
only a $10 price difference between the two but the larger battery has
significantly more starting capacity (45%). If you plan on going or living
anywhere where it gets cold the bigger battery is worth it. Being an
erstwhile Canadian I'll let the real Canadians vouch for the usefulness of
the larger battery.

The important thing is to get a battery with "reversed terminals" so the
battery isn't installed backwards.

All it says is 45Ah or 54Ah.
