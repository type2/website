I don't think my first email went through, so here goes again:

However, you should still test for total mechanical advance, and for 
that you take your vacuum line off.  This will tell you if the mech adv 
is working correctly.  Then you can put the vacuum line back on and 
measure for total advance.  I think the generally accepted value for T4 
engines is around 40 then backing off.  For mech, I think it's around 
28-32 (according to Jake Raby).  This is also a way of controlling your 
head temps... more advance, more heat.

The advance system used on the bus is a primative way of sensing the 
load on the engine.  When you add a load, you want to advance timing, 
and usually when you open the throttle, load is increasing.  Now, MAP 
systems use manifold vaccuum to detect the amount of air flowing into 
the engine, however they're somewhat opposite.  The bus senses load when 
there IS a vacuum, the MAP based systems sense a load when the manifold 
vaccuum drops.. kinda counter-intuitive.. but they're two separate 
systems anyways, not to be confused.

I also found recently that cheap gas causes high temps and stumbly idle. 
  I was messing with my advance to get cooler head temps and had also 
switched gas types in the mean time.  I switched to mobil and my engine 
idle purrs like a kitten and runs cooler.

I'm really anticipating the UltraMegasquirt.  Fully customizable EFI and 
Electronic Ignition with WB02 support.  That's going to rock!  I even 
hear that they're going to work on idle-control timing.  How cool would 
that be to bring those idle rpms back down!
