You need to set the regulator to the tool psi requirement. Sounds like you inherited a lot of tools with the compressor?

Air tool oil. Normally you add a few drops in the air inlet of the tool before use.

Don't run it constantly. This depends on the task but it's usually the high CFM requirement tasks that are hard on the compressor: HVLP painting, sandblasting etc.
 
The pressure condenses the moisture in the air that the compressor inhales. You must use the drain valve everytime.

Everytime, make sure there is oil visible in the glass sight before you turn it on.

It's often advertizing to get you to buy the tool for your tool small compressor. Only later do you discover you have terrible duty cycle because the tool requires so much CFM to run full time.
