CFM, & Recovery.

A two stage compresssor will regroup faster than a single stage.

Look for a cast iron head on what your looking at.
The aluminum steel sleeved units don't last long.

Then look for tank capacity.
A 80 gallon tank usually will keep up with just about anything with
capacity.
It's just what kind of compressor head you have on top of it.

A rotery compressor regroups the fastest.
