   Well, it's not just Harbor Freight, BTW...There's a "boutique" auto 
accessories
store and catalog in England, that makes a point of claiming that each of its
products is the "best, finest, smoothest, slickest, etc." in each 
category...What
someone finally figured is that the boutique isn't above taking off the shelf 

products and repackaging them under the boutique name...and pricing... ;-(
