<<I changed the oil before I fired it up. I used stuff from Lowe's
called "Synthetic Air Compressor Oil". Was that a bad thing? Can I go
back to regular oil? Should I swtch to straight 30 weight?>>

Jay,

I have no clue if it was a bad or good move.

I bought my Curtis from an industial Air Compressor dealer, the
instructions in my manual sez to run straight weight 30 weight non
detergent in it.

Now that was 30 years ago, and the compressor runs every day, for
12---14 hours, and has fed up to 4 guys on 4 air lines in that time
span.

You be the judge on this one.

I have the regulator set at 150 psi., and have so for 30 years.

Buy the time the air gets to the end of the hoses the 50 ft. air hoses
the pressure isn't the same as the regulator is set at---

To run a 3/4 or 1" impact I run it up to 225 psi.

My DA's, and smaller air rachets, drills, etc. run fine at 150, and have
done so for a long time.

I can't elabortae on the sythetic air compressor oil.
Never used it, I just change the oil in the ole Curtis bi--annually.

Get a decent air dryer at the compressor, and make a manifold to
occomadatae several air lines--

Buy good air line--you'll be happy you did.
I have some Goodyear Industrail hose that is as old as the comrpessor.

Just don't go feeding it with an oiler--it get spongey real quick--
