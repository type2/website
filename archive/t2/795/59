   When George was running for election, he gave a campaign speech at a
warehouse in an (IIRC) Ohio warehouse. The background for the speech was
a huge pile of boxes proudly wearing "Made in USA" stickers...What wasn't
in the speech, was that the campaign volunteers had spent the previous
nite pasting them over the "Made in China" stickers... ;-(
