I do that some too. However I watch the clearance table. Got a nice Milwaukee router that was a return for $100 off at Sears, DeWalt cordless drill on sale, etc. I buy the known good tools when I can but usually I buy a lower cost item and then when I wear it out (confirming a real need for it) I buy better.
