THANKS! Have used under-sized (2 HP) and over-sized compressors (diesel power jack hammer compressors). Have tried sandblasting with the little version and the big version. Bigger is nice!!! I suggest either hiring out sand blasting (cemetary monument companies) or renting a diesel powered compressor and sand blaster kit if you have a suitable work area - back yards with picky neighbors need not apply! <grin!> Makes a WORLD of difference. 

Also used an air powered palm sander back in the 80's when that was all I had access to. The electric versions (mine is a $60 Porter Cable) are nice because I don't have to wait for the recharge. Tried the air version (and only with a medium sized compressor) to strip a '66 Mustang in the mid-80's when I was in high school. Took AGES... Nice with enough air though...

My goals are only air-ratchets, impact wrenches, and paint guns... 

EXCELLENT write-up Richard!
