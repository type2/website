<<<That sounds like a reasonable plan (It's what I did) ... BUT.... 
....Talk to the bodyshop before you prime it. Some paints won't adhere
properly to rattle-can primers. If that is the case, the body shop may
be able to supply you with a more appropriate primer for the paint they
are using.>>> 

Let me say this ( again ) on priming.

The object of priming the metal prior to painting has two purposes.

(1) to seal the bare metal.

(2) to fill any conspicuous divots in the metal so you won't see them
when the ride is finally painted.

The big problem with the shake, rattle, and spray can garbage is this;

It doesn't really seal anything.
It has no etching properties, and just lays on top of the metal.

And here's the big one--

It has so thin of a viscosity to get out of the tiny nozzle of the can
it's filling properties are NADA, ZIP, FINITO.

So--with this info all in mind, you might as well just strip the Bus and
paint it.
Forget the spray bomb water thin primer.

It offer's no advantage at all other than taking up some of your time,
and wasting some money on a step that isn't of any real worth, as far as
prepping the metal for paint.
