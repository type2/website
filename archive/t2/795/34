Subject: Vanagon exhaust Cal. to Federal

Hello list,
My California '82 Vanagon Westy's exhaust is in none too good shape 
(muffler, tailpipe, crossover pipe..) so I thought I would take the 
opportunity to simplify and switch to the federal system, since I am in 
Canada, and not California anyway.

I understand the passenger side HE is identical, but the driver's side 
is different, along with the crossover pipe leading out to the muffler.  
I can get a new driver's HE from the usual sources, including CIP or the 
busdepot.

1. If I get the federal driver's side HE does the intake for the heated 
air still line up with the fresh air tube coming from the 
alternator/fan, or is that different?  If it is moved much then there 
must be a difference in the tin on the driver's side too (location of 
hole for the air tube)?

2. If I manage to switch to federal, the busdepot sells a complete 
exhaust system: "European spec Vanagon exhaust system. High quality OEM 
European made components, far superior quality to aftermarket extractor 
exhaust systems. Replaces everything behind heater boxes; includes 
gaskets and bolts."   
Anybody use this one?
Quality and longevity?
Is there a place to put an oxygen sensor bung if I buy this one?

Thank-you very much,

GG
