For what it's worth, you can buy a mini in-line oiler that plugs into the end of your hose. It's no more than maybe 2 inches long and using quick connects, you can attach it on to the end of your hose and to the inlet of the air tool.

I wish I had a picture, but it's been very useful. I've never had any oil get into my hose.

The only down side is you pretty much have to fill it up after every other use, but that's not really much of a pain. 

The most important thing though is to make sure you get a GOOD water seperator. Not all of them work as well as you might like... 


And to answer the other question I saw there... 

Most tools function at 85-90 PSI.. that goes for things like grinding tools, cutting wheels, rachets, etc...
So... you'll need an adjustable pressure regulator that goes inline.
