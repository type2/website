Adam,

You seem to be off to a good start. A few suggestions:

1. Get a dial caliper to measure tolerances. You will want to measure 
the parts of your clutch, for instance, to see that they are well 
within tolerances (unless you plan to replace these outright). Using 
Bentley, especially, is a matter of measuring, measuring, measuring.

2. Do a full set of diagnostics before you drop the engine. Test your 
compression, measure your fuel pressure.

3. Some components either work or do not work, with no warning and no 
way to fix other than to replace parts. Your fuel pump is one of these. 
The best way to keep your bus dependable (with minimum down time) is to 
carry a spare of each of these parts.

4. Read over the pages at ratwell.com on gas tank resto. Corroded 
tanks, some full of varnish, are a major source of failure.

5. On reassembly, be ready to measure the vacuum in your FI system. Get 
a vacuum gauge.

6. Eighty percent of the work you'll actually be doing will be 
cleaning. Be prepared for that.

Mark
