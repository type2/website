At the shop I worked at the compressor was set to 100 (as I recall). 
We put a couple drops of Marvel Mystery oil in before we used the 
tool first time in the day.
Buster's air tools never died.

I use a drop or two of air tool oil before I use my tools. I figure 
if it worked for Buster for over 30 years it would work for me.

These were not painting tools.
