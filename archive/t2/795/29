<<This was the "last stage of the transition" from vehicles that could
be maintained by farmers in the barn to vehicles that required attention
from fellows named "Manfred", "Karl" or "Otto" in the spotless VW
dealership.>> 

Manfred, Karl, Otto, Wolfgang, Fritz, as well as Ferdinand, Hermann, and
Adolf all run when any air cooled shows up at the local VW store.

They are all ready to sprint out the door, now that I think of it, when
any Wasserleaker shows up too.
