Thanks all

I will return to my engine and try everything suggested, including 
contacting other local airheads.  The carbs arn't balanced, I guess 
thats the next obvious step. 

And

Do I adjust my timing for the 009  - or the engine code as laid out in 
the manual  - or rebuild my 205 using the bits from the 009
(The 009 has only done a few hundred miles, the 205 has done more)

Thanks again
John
