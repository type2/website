yes. one goes on the large lug that is connected to the battery. The
other goes to the small terminal which is connected to your key
switch. IIRC it will be the small spade terminal very near the large
nut, both on the solenoid. If this helps, it's basically a nicer
verion of crossing the terminals with a screwdriver.
