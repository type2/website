Hi George,

There are people who preassemble MS Kits.... The cost of a completed  
and tested board is about $200.

Mounting, plumbing, and wiring harness fabrication is the fussy part.

Once my wife's bus is on the road under L-Jet I plan to look into a  
MegaSquirt conversion, and I aim to leave the chip-soldering to an  
expert.

Happy trails,
