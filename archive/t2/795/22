IIRC, there was a rather involved cooling system bleeding procedure, that,
if not followed to the letter, resulted in air locks in the system.  A big
air bubble would get into the pump and the pump would stop pumping which
is bad for cooling!

No doubt that the cooling systems were adequately designed, but this one
was not as forgiving of mistakes as the aircoolers.  This was the "last
stage of the transition" from vehicles that could be maintained by
farmers in the barn to vehicles that required attention from fellows
named "Manfred", "Karl" or "Otto" in the spotless VW dealership.
