Subject: Lesson learnt about oil seals

For anyone out there new to the engine dropping game like me, about to 
change their crankshaft oil seal...

DO NOT FORGET TO OIL THE NEW ONE.

One month ago I 'solved' my oil leak with a new seal. Then it came back, 
and much worse. Engine out today, and there must have be a cup of oil in 
the clutch bell housing. I was having to top up every trip, and had used 
a UK gallon in a month. Compared my month old seal with a new one - 
about 1 mm of material missing all the way round.

I believe (after reading Gene Berg's advice) that as I definitely forgot 
to oil the new seal, I did all sorts of damage the first time I turned 
over the engine. I think this was compounded by the fact I had gone for 
a silicone seal (the orange ones). Does any else think they are more 
'grippy' than the regular black seals, and hence much more likely to get 
ripped by the crankshaft if not oiled?
