There are plenty of shops that will build one for you.  I think you can 
get an assembled kit for about 250 or something around there.  That's 
not that bad of a price.

Then you'll have to build the wiring harness.  However, if you've got an 
old FI system, you can just chop up the harness and splice that in.  You 
can also buy pigtails for the injectors and stuff like that.  For power 
to the MS and power to the fuel pump, I just stripped out an old double 
relay and soldered my MS wires to the innards of the relay so I could 
use the original plugs without needing to chop the plugs that go to the 
battery and the fuel pump.  Then for the coolant sensor I just used the 
head temp sensor with a simple resistor mod to the MS.

I could switch back and forth between the l-jet or the MS in about 2 
minutes.
