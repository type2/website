Hi

Nearing the end of a (*) year rebuild, recon engine now starts (last 
problem was no gas).  Runs but sounds loud (I can't remember maybe its 
meant to sound like that).

Moves ok but stalls when I try and drive it onto ramps.  Ran it for a 
while at the weekend Cyliners 4 & 3 seemed to get VERY hot, 1 & 2 not so.

1800 stock twin carbs
009
Recon engine
Checked timing 7.5 deg btdc at 900 (correct for engine)
Dwell 50
Tried blocking the Vaccuum offshoot to the brake booster (no difference)

No ideas?

Thanks
John
