Subject: Re: [T2] air tools

Boy, have you ever got that straight! I bought a whole slew of air
tools spec matched to my $99 HF compressor, only to find it only puts
out enough air to power the tools for a minute at a time, or in the
case of my impact, not at all! I wrote them a nasty letter, but they
were not interested enough to respond.
