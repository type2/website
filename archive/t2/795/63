We used these on all the air tools at the body shop I worked at. You can
run a DA for a long time with one fill-up. We used special air tool oil
which is basically hydraulic oil. Works good on bicycle chains also.

 A couple of good sized drops ( small trickle) of Marvel Mystery Oil will
 do them good.
 Oil them when your done with them, just before putting them away.
 If in fact you have any condensation in the lines, the oil will keep
 them fro rusting up if you don't use them for awhile.

 Do Not Use an automatic oiler in any air line.
 The oil will soften up the interior liner of the hose and make it weak
 over time, and in the event you want to paint anything and do forget
 which hose is which--you couldn't buy enough Smoothy to stop the fish
 eyes in the paint.
 The hose (s) would be junk for painting forever.
