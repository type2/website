<a Makita-blue 4 1/2 inch grinder from Odd Lot Trading for $14.99...Other than sounding like the bearings were lubed with gravel>

Do all cheap tools get gravel lubricated bearings? My HF polisher/sander has the same. So loud at no-load that it requires hearing protection... <grin!> 

Got what I paid for... Fine for occasional use only...
