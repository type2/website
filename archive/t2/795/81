Subject: Re: [T2] air tools

Speaking of marketing, 

       The air compressor I bought, was from Home Depot. It's the one they sell for $449 or something like that. It's a 60 gallon (or is it an 80 gallon?) with 130/135 MAX PSI. It has a 5hp (7hp Peak) single stage compressor pump (two large pistons, the same size). It has a self cooling fan, a built in emergency pressure valve, and a gauge. 

It's actually very decent, and I've been really happy with it.


But the funny thing is, it's labelled as a "HUSKY". Thinking that it was actually of that make. Come to find out it's a Campbell Hausfeld. Which really... is not that bad of a brand at all, it's pretty decent. But I've also found out that Campbell Hausfeld also sells cheaper air compressors that they label as "Pittsburgh" brand through Harbor Freight. Now... I totally love the Harbor Freight catalog. I've bought a set of wheel dollies from them that are just invaluable at moving my 81 TransAm around the garage. I've also gotten their work bench... all of it made in China.

But they do have these "American Names" that they use to help sell their stuff..

Like.. "Pittsburgh Mechanical" for their compressors, and non electric tools. And then they have another brand "Chicago Electric". So... when you see these brand names, you think to yourself.. damn... these are made from a company who have been around a long time.

When I think of the name, "Chicago Electric" I think to myself, a company that's been around since the 20s... in an old industrial building.

Truth be told, it's a low income labor shop in China.

And when you actually get the tools.. the packaging will say "Chicago Electric" or whatever, but the tool itself will have some generic lable on it, and say.. made in China.
