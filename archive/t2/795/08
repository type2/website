Hey guys  As Lee Corso would say not so fast my friend  the diesels are prone 
to h2O leakage at the head gaskets and the water neck flanges.  the biggest 
problem with the vanagon s leaking is dummies running them hot and not using 
the correct antifreeze . I am running an 85 westy that I rebuilt in 1995 without 
any leaks  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
