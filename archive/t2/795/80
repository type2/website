You are correct.  Thank you for the correction George
Lyle.  It does not matter whether the sheet metal hole
is on the left or right side of the engine
compartment.  Hot-air will re-enter the engine
compartment through the rust holes, and then travel to
the fan and be distributed equally left and right.
However, Cylinders 3 & 4 bake at a higher temperature,
due to the oil cooler being on the left side of
pancake engines.  
    
Correction heartily acknowledged!
