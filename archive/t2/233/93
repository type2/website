Subject: throttle valve not in sinc

(75 1.8L) since i can't get power to the fuel pump i thought i'd stop with
that and look for different trouble and i think i may have found some. with
the linkage attached from the egr to the throttle, there's no movement of
said linkage while the throttle is increased. is there a part of the
throttle, in or around its high tensioin spring, that works to keep tension
on the egr linkage so they may move harmoniously like two underwater
syncronized swimmers? - steve
