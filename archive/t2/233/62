Subject: Re: [T2] 70 speedo adjustment?

The '70 owner's manual specs 7.00x14 tires. Seven inches is 177.8
millimeters. 

The aspect ratio of those tires was about 92.
(See the Yokohama and Tirerack tire-info sites:
 http://www.yokohamatire.com/04a1a.html and
http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/general/size_conversion.htm )

So a 7.00x14 tire with an aspect ratio of 92 tire converts to 178/92-14.

Now, using the purely mathematical conversion gimmick found here --
http://www.powerdog.com/tiresize.cgi -- compare the stock 178/92-14 tire
with your 195/70-14. It's about 8% smaller than the original tire, and your
speedo is about 8% off.

Even the 185/82-14 tire VW went to in mid-'71 is smaller than the 7.00x14.
And VW didn't change the speedometer calibration to compensate for the
smaller tire.
