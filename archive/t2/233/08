Success ! I did have the wiring correct, but found 
a loose wire at the starter that came 1/2 unplugged while I was
replacing the main battery wire. Now the bus starts and runs correctly,
but the battery light is on dimly, even when I rev up the engine significantly.
I take this to mean it is not charging correctly ?
 
The battery measured 12.7 volts with my voltmeter. Not sure if something
else was fried when the sort happened. Maybe my voltage regulator ?

Appreciate any ideas.
Thanks
Dean
