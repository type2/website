Subject: Re: [T2] 96mm piston upgrade

When  doing a lot of building on type 1 engines I learned to shy away 
from any "slip in" cylinder upgrades.  They do not last long and can 
cause severe damage the rest of the engine when they start warping.  
Always start from scratch with a machined case to take a "correctly 
designed" jug.  I never had a problem of any kind with jugs that were 
machined in and heads machined to properly match.
