<I have a 78; the aux wiring typically does run as a positive through a
<relay to the other battery.   Is the "square white thing" a relay? >

Yes, the square white thing is a relay. The pigtail off the positive
battery terminal runs directly to this relay. I measured it with voltmeter.
It is at 12.7 Volts no matter if bus is off, or key is turned on trying
to start. There is a wire that runs from this relay to the aux battery (although 
the battery is bad and not working at this time).

<Typically the relay has to get power (usually to coil so it's on when
<engine is on), and that power flips a contact so that wire pigtailed to
<the main + now gets connected to the AUX.  So a wire should go from the
<relay also to the spare battery.  Did someone try to get the ("power"
<when on) from the regulator?  If this wire touches ground, you get
<frying back to regulator.  If the pigtailed wire touches ground, you get
<major frying back to battery. >

You are right, the pigtail was grounded out on the engine lid mechanism
and I had major frying on the pigtail back to the battery. No frying to the
voltage regulator or to the relay for the aux battery.

How is the voltage regulator hooked to the positive electricity ? I have
no wire running directly from the battery to the voltage regulator. From my previous post
do you think I have the wiring correct ? What would prevent the
starter from engaging ?

Thanks !

< The wire from the AUX battery should go
<to the relay.  If the relay burned out, was it bypassed so someing was
<looking for a + source like the regulator??   To properly bypass the
<relay (I did it) just connect the pigtailed wire from main right to the
<+ on the AUX.  Now they are in series and charge together.   Now when
<camping, you will have a longer time to use stuff before you reach a low
<voltage that typicaslly is 10.9-11 volts where I'd run the engine.  Just
<keep a voltmater atached to a plus line to watch this.  You can buy

<I have a 1978 Westfalia Bus that had a near fire this weekend.
<I opened the rear engine lid to check the oil, and some wiring got caught
<in the mechanism that holds the lid open, and shorted out to the frame. 
<Started melting and burning the rubber wiring cover, lots of smoke. 
<I managed to push it off the frame to stop the melting/burning, and then disconnected
<the positive cable from the battery.

<The wiring that melted was the 10 gauge wire that runs to the positive  battery terminal alongside the 
<4 gauge main red wire (which of course runs to the starter motor). This wire also seems to run to the voltage regulator
<on the rear passenger side of the engine bay, connected to a blue wire. Then it also runs
<over the top of the engine bay, to the square white connector on the
<drivers side of the engine bay (looks like it is wiring for the auxillary battery on drivers side).

<I purchased a new positive battery cable with 10 gauge pigtail included. I removed the 
<old battery cable from the starter motor, and from voltage regulator, and from wires across top of
<engine bay to auxillary battery. The old wire was so melted up I had a hard time figuring our
<how the wires ran, but looked like the following, and this is how I re-wired it:

<1. Primary 4 gauge red wire to the starter motor
<2. Red 10 gauge pigtail from positive battery terminal spliced to red wire going over top of
<    engine bay to auxillary battery.
<3. Blue wire to voltage regulator spliced to black wire running over top of engine bay to aux battery
 <   white square connector on drivers side rear of engine bay.

<I also looked at the Bentley wiring diagram, but could not understand how these went together.

<I tried turning the key on and starting for the first time tonight, but nothing from the starter motor.
<Not a sound. I did seem to have strong lights, turn signals, etc so battery appeared to 
<be OK. 

<Can someone help with the correct wiring, and ideas on why no starter ? The key was not
<on when the short happened.. I am hoping I didn't fry anything else, and maybe I have
<wired it incorrectly.

<I am very happy the bus didn't burn down this weekend !
<Thanks !
