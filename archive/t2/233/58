Subject: engine noise help!

HI friends,
quick question about engine noise I'm gettting on my
2.0 '78 with hydraulic lifters. A noticable ticking is
present when I accelerate and then let off the gas or
when I'm using the engine to slow the vehicle. Is this
valve rockers? Just exhaust noise or just a VW thing?
I'm asuming it's rockers and if so how long can I
still run it without something going kaboom? Thanks
from me and Anya the bus
Giles
'78 t2
