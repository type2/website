Subject: VDO CHT Gauge Installation

OK,

so I buy a VDO cylinder head temperature gauge, and...........

When I mount it in the pod beside the oil pressure and oil temperature 
gauge, I can "plainly" see that the CHT meter is not nearly as well 
illuminated as the other two.

The bulb is completely different, as is the method used to mount the CHT meter.
I saw that the bulb size and type was different from the OP and OT gauges 
when I installed the CHT meter, and suspected this "differently illuminated 
appearance" might be an adverse result once hooked up and running.

Did I get an "old stock" gauge, different from current production runs as 
to the type bulb used for current illumination?

Also,
How in the Hell do others mount the temperature sender for the CHT?
There is no way that the supplied "spark plug trapped" sender is going to 
mount under the spark plug, and then be screwed down against the cylinder 
top as the spark plug is installed.

The W8AC spark plug has a shoulder above the thread and beneath the ceramic 
that "just" enters into a recessed area in the cylinder. This close confine 
will not allow room for another item to be enclosed in that area.

I guess I will have to mount the sender to a fin when I next remove the engine.
