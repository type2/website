Subject: RE: [T2] Torque Converter Wanted

  In our beautiful Lake Havasu City, Az.There is a company called The
Converter Shop aka TCS Performance. They remanufacture torque converters in
house. They also make heavy duty parts for VW auto trannys. 
www.tcsperformance.com.  If they don't have a bus converter in stock you can
send yours in and they will rebuild it. Ask for Rusty and use my name and
you should get a deal. 928  453 4020 is there phone
