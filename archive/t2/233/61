They are using "reply to all" and you are simply using "reply".

You don't.  This mailing list (not group) is set up to discourage people 
from sending unnecessary posts to the list, which I guarantee you would 
happen if we were set up to reply to the list by default.

Everyone makes mistakes and nobody here is going to get upset at the 
*occasional* rogue post to the list.  That said, it is everyone's 
responsibility to verify who they are sending their messages to.  It's like 
checking that there is water in the pool before you dive in - get into the 
habit of doing it and we all will be a lot happier.
