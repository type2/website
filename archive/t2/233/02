Hi There!

I have a short question:  I'm looking for the guy/girl who is restoring a
1970 deluxe, a darkgreen one, I thought i've seen it on a website but I lost
the URL..

Could You please give me a sound ..I have a 1970 deluxe too and it is also
darkgreen/white even the same interior! I'd like to know a bit more about
your car!

Michel
