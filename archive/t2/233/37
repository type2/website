Again, thanks for the responses.
I should clarify.

The engine was built as a stock 2L except for the
presence of the 1974 1800 heads.

I was attempting to defend my opinion that the 1800
head might run a little higher CR than a 2L head.
I think i am wrong.
The heads probably run a lower CR if it is different
at all- which is a GOOD THING. ;p

More likely, the two dropped seats this engine has
suffered over the past few months are a result of the
009/weber prog conversion coupled with the owner's
inexperience - my friend did advise that she tends to
shift early and lugs it a bit.

The fact that it is a complete and functional 1973
adventurewagen doesn't help.
Heavy, high drag SOB!

Danke,
clark
