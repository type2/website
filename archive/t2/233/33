Hi all,

     I am looking for the little flappers that go in the bottom of the =
fan housing.  They prevent air from returning into the fan housing.  I =
would also need the pins they ride on if possible.  I have never seen a =
source for these.  Also, if anybody has any type 4 thermostat parts, I =
am looking for those too.  Thanks.
