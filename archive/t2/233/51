Relays are generally very easy to fix. If they failed, it's usually
because of stress in the soldered connections from heating and cooling.
You can fix these by simply heating the old solder with a soldering iron
so that it liquifies. If the solder 'evaporates', just put a little more
on.

On the late-80s Porsche 911, the main computer (called the DME), had a
relay supply it's power and power to the O2 sensor. This relay was also
wired into the factory theft protection system. The relays were prone to
failure after about ten years and would leave a less-astute driver on the
side of the road (the net affect of the relay failing is exactly the same
as the theft protection engaging - no power to the FI computer). These
relays are $35 and I saw lots of Porsche drivers buying new ones and
keeping spares. Typical Porsche mentality. All you have to do is crack the
thing open and check the solder points. On the side of the road you could
even wrap some aluminum around the relay and keep the power permanently
engaged!
