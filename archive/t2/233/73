Subject: Re: [T2] need part

Sounds familiar - I am also looking for these things (as well as the
little covers for the bottom part of the fan housing that mates to the
heat exchangers).

My only leads: BusDepot has the hardware for mounting the thermostat.
Unfortunately, it appears that nobody makes the type 4 thermostats
anymore.  But, it looks like the type 1 thermostats can be converted for
use with the type 4's.  Check out:

In the pulldown menu, select "Type 1, 80-85 Degree C Unit".  There are
instructions for the conversion.
