Subject: EGR/CAT/CHT and me

Volks,

Formerly CA-emissioned 78 Westy 2.0L...

Five questions quickly:

With the removal of the catalytic converter (-at-) rebuild and
installation of all new exhaust components, I had my mechanic
weld shut the feed to the EGR valve which runs from the infamous
cross-over pipe.  I now have a huge vacuum-ish leak (-at-) the EGR
where it bolts to the manifold, lots of sucking.  I can feel the
negative pressure with my hand around the unit.  Leak is present
(-at-) idle and increases corresponding to engine RPM. Upon removal of
the valve, I discovered lots of icky brown gook - basically it
looked like this thing had seen much better days.  I cleaned it
best I could, installed a new gasket and set it tight.  Still a
leak.  The suction seems to be coming from the screw adjustment
on the outboard side of the valve.
Q1: How does this leak affect engine performance?
Q2: Could I have someone fabricate a blocking plate and install
it with a gasket, since I don't need EGR functionality?
Q3:  What is the sensor that energizes the CAT idiot light?  Is
it the O2 sensor?  Where is it?  My idiot light is of course
permanently lit.  Other than simply pulling the light from behind
the instrument cluster, can I do something w/ the sensor to make
this go away?
Q4:  How does the lack of a CAT and the energized CAT idiot light
effect engine performance?  Is the ECU making calculations based
on what it perceives as poor exhaust emissions?  If so, how can I
fix this?
Q5:  I think my #3 CHT sender is bad *again*.  What test can I
perform with a VOM to check it?  Should I check connectivity -
and what numbers should I be getting?  Does the lead to the
sender need to be soldered (mine is butt-crimped)?

Many sincere thanks again for your help!
