Subject: Roof Racks

Hello,
     I have done some research without any good
results about roof racks.  I am looking for one that
would secure a kayak on my 77 pop top.  I remember
another VW owner saying that the yakima one that he
had worked great for his surf board, but I'm not sure
which kind to get since I have a pop top.  If anyone
else has something like this I would really appreciate
some help.  Thanks a lot.

Tim
