Subject: Re: [T2] Torque Converter Wanted

[...]
I show that the A is supposedly a direct replacement.  If this is 
correct it goes all the way to 91 for almost all of the transmission 
parts on the auto. The thing to watch out for on both the auto and the 
manual for the vanagons is that sometimes the updated parts require 
replacement of the connecting parts also.  also a strange note stating 
that the torque converter part number is a replacement number and then i 
noticed that the other 3 speed auto transmission torque converter has 
the same part number but no A in it and no replacement part comments.  
That 3 speed stopped production with the 75 model year.
