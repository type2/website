Carb mixture. It will need an adjustment first. If the tuning doesn't help 
then you need to re-jet the carb. Typical problem.

Start by checking to see if the choke is stuck shut.

I suggest the Weber carb book. I got mine through CB Performance but I'm 
sure ANY bookstore can get you good Weber carb books.
