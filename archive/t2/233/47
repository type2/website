Subject: starter wiring?

About to wire up my new starter. '71 1600 dp van.

I know the heavy black wire and the two heavy red wires with circular metal
ends go under the starter terminal that has the stud/nut (terminal 30?).

My old starter had two push-on terminals as well - one held a heavy
red/black wire with an insulated spade connector, the other also a fairly
heavy red wire. On the old starter, it looks like these two terminals are
part of the same thing (i.e. two spades that shoot off the same basic
terminal)

The new starter solenoid has two different push-on terminals, on opposite
sides of the stud/nut. One of the terminals is marked "50". The other one
has no marking. 

Where should I connect my push on wires? Heavy red/black to 50? Does it
matter? Are both spade terminals on the new starter terminal 50? 

Hope this all makes sense
