check fuel pressure also as well as the double relay.  I have seen fuel 
pump(part of the double relay) relays and fuel pumps cause similar 
problems. and the fuel filter and air cleaner.  plugged fuel filters and 
air cleaners can make it look like a problem elswhere in the system.  At 
the same time checking the air cleaner check all the hoses going to the 
AFC for a vacuum leak.  Thats the challenge of AFC injection systems.  
They are a loop.
