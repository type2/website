The 96mm kit has thinner cylinder walls than the 94mm kit.  You will make 
more heat due to the increase in displacement, and have less metal to 
absorb it.  Also the increase in displacement with no changes to 
intake/exhaust will move your torque peak to a lower rpm resulting in a 
decrease in volumetric efficiency at higher rpm.  End result will be that 
the engine will run hotter before - not what you want for towing cross-country.

Jake Raby seems to have excellent results with WebCam camshaft kits.  I am 
going to try one of their milder grinds in my next 2-liter engine, if I 
ever get the time to put it together.  A stock 2-liter engine has poor 
volumetric efficiency at freeway speeds and I think the WebCam addresses 
this problem.  Should run cooler AND have more power at freeway speeds, but 
like I said I haven't been able to confirm that yet.
