Hi Chris, Tom,

I have the perfect "cheap" solution to the kayak transport issue: The 
"Yak-Rack".

I built mine out of plywood and it works perfect for me every time, and 
takes up very little space when not in use. Why not use a home-made rack 
for a home made 'yak??

The .PDF Plans are online at:
http://www.geocities.com/vw_type2/roofrack.pdf

Note that I have since discovered the crossbar dimension widened between 
the 73 and 74 roof designs. The 74 roof has a much more vertical side 
wall so I had to make new crossbars to compensate. But the basic idea of 
the plan works well and it's easy to implement..
Happy trails,
