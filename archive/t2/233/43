Thanks to list members for all the great information provided on
traveling to Newfoundland. We really appreciate the information provided
by ...Greg, Shawn, Mark, Doug, Hans and Roy, on our trip to
Newfoundland. As we start east in our 82 Westy, we have ample routing
and points of interest information with us. Much appreciated!
