dimmer definately, but I aint picky if i can read it.  BTW there used to 
be two different bulbs available for the older gauges.  one was a higher 
wattage  the bulb housing carefully pulls out and the bulb is a 
replaceable type that i used to get from a local flaps that has changed 
brand names so i am no longer sure he stocks them and also from a shop 
that specializes in custom restoral of 50's early 60's vehicles.  He has 
a large VDO display with all the little parts.  should be able to find a 
shop in houston with all the same goodies.  If not you might send a 
message to john at aircooled or call the same place you got the gauges.
