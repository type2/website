Subject: Side step

Hi.

I paid $75 for mine, it was local, and I had the money in my pocket.

This side step should fit on either side of the Transporter.

If it mounted on the driver's side, it helps with loading stuff on the roof 
rack (that you will also want), since the other side could be managed by 
opening the sliding side door, and stepping inside.

If it is mounted on the passenger's side, it functions as a place to rest 
your feet as you are sitting on the floor of the main compartment, with your 
feet hanging off the edge, towards the outside.
It makes you feel super cool, feet up, with a beer in your hand, and boss 
music pouring from your 8-track, and all the litle kids saying, "Gosh, dad, 
I want to grow up and be just like HIM!!" and dad saying "I'm sorry son, you 
can't do BOTH!!"
