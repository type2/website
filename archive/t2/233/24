Note: Last time I checked, a civil penalty of $2500 may be imposed for 
rendering any emission control device or element of design inoperative.
I assume you are talking about off road use.

I now have a huge vacuum-ish leak (-at-) the EGR

Increases air fuel ratio. Could damage engine if it gets too high. Engine 
might seem very peppy just before it blows a jug.

Yes.

No you don't have an O2 sensor on the 78 (79 is first year)

My  idiot light is of course

This sensor is activated by a mechanical counter driven from the speedo. It 
can be reset by pushing the reset button but I forget how.

No effect.

Is the ECU making calculations based

No

If so, how can I

If you mean Temp sensor II, resistance vs temperature is of interest.

Should I check connectivity -

No harm. Could save you $25 for a new part.

>and what numbers should I be getting?

roughly 300 to 3000 ohms hot to cold.

Does the lead to the
>sender need to be soldered (mine is butt-crimped)?

No, solder is better but not required.
