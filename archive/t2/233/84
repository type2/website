very similar to what used to be called the "Getto air conditioner"  in
that arrangement a wash tub of ice was sat in the middle of the room, and
a window fan was aimed down and laid on top of the tub.  viola!  

so for you it might be simpler to forget the middle of the system and just
put a ice chest on the floor with a grill on both sides, put a fan on one
of the grills, blowing out of the ice chest, put ice in chest, turn on
fan...

probably would work, not sure how much it would cool a big ol van in the
sun, but it has to help some.
