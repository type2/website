I've picked up two in the last couple of years, both at junkyards who didn't do a lot of V-dubs...

First one was inside an early bay westy, paid $10 for it ( $1 a pound for the aluminum).

Second I found a month later in the same yard upside down in the middle of the main rd.  This time the guy (who remembered me) said "I gotta get $15 for that, they are pretty rare nowadays..."  It was a little twisted from being run over many times by the huge yard loader, but after
a little tweeking it was as good as new...

I get $100 each for them now at the swap meets I vend at...

The steps that Bus boys sell are okay for reproductions, but not perfect.  The original ones were close ended, the new ones are open on both ends...

The thing to find is the step that bolts up to the outrigger frames and main frame members.  These extend and retract when the sliding door is opened and closed...

Just saw one (in working condition) on a guy's '71 Westy at a shop in VT last month...

Wouldn't sell it as he sometimes takes disabled kids camping in it and the jack point mounted step is not as easy to use (and it is much easier to slip on).

What's nice is the same step fits both Splitties and Bays..
