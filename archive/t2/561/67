>you set the end play exactly the same as for a flywheel.

Looking down at the Flexplate from above, mine does not look Square to the 
engine, as a rigid flywheel would. Are flexplates that flexable or should I 
be look for a replacement.

Let me rephrase this. If I could not stop the flexplate from spinning to get 
my torque then I would swap out the flexplate for the flywheel "ONLY" to use 
the flywheel lock. How do you or did you lock your flexplate, I don't want 
to damage it, it is the only one I have. I have several flywheels and a 
flywheel lock.

>do you plan on putting the engine in a manual tranny bus???

Not a chance because it has a flexplate. I really would not mind swapping 
out my Auto for a Five Speed(HeHe). But considering I have only driven this 
bus a few blocks I would like to try out the Auto and see what it is like 
before I go through all the hassel. Anybody that has their heart set on an 
Auto and want to trade for 4 speed manual? 5 speed?

>manuals have flywheels

All of the ones that I have seen do.

>automatics have flexplates

Yep mine do and the others I have seen.

>they are not interchangable

Sure enough that seems to be the case. Like Hyd. lifters with a solid cam, 
or solid cam with hydraulic lifters, knees and elbows, oil and sand, etc. 
That is why I said I was too lasy, but if I needed to I could swap the 
flywheel for the flexplate just to use the flywheel lock. Didn't mean to 
sound like I didn't know the difference, although still learning everyday 
about these automatics.
