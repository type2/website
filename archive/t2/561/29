This depends on driving style but 50-75,000 miles could be a good 
estimate.

How many miles will you log a year?
Is this going to be your daily driver?

If you're only using it occasionally and for vacations, 50,000 miles is 
a LOOONG time...

I have not seen this to be true

This is not true.  It may happen if you do not have the return spring 
on the carb throttle, but if that spring is in place I haven't had 
problems with it sticking.

There is a rubber gasket that sits around the fuel line where it passes 
through the firewall.  If this gasket is in place, the firewall WILL 
NEVER cut through the fuel line.  Last I checked it was $2.50-$4 for 
two of these gaskets.

It can be replaced with the engine in the car.

I have not had problems putting the skid plate back into place.  The 
bolts tend to shear off though, so you have to be careful and may have 
to drill them out if this happens.  Not a big deal.

Understood.

It's an adventure, but a worthwhile one.  You (and your spouse) will 
need patience though.  That is the nature of buses.
