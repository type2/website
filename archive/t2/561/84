Subject: Re: [T2] Bay Parts for sale No CA + Question

I've been slowly collecting parts for my '72 to replace the 32/26 Weber
with dual Solex again. Sorry I didn't know about your stash when I
started, I could have saved us both some trouble. Anyway, for the list:
Is there a material difference between the '73 duals and the '72 duals
that I need to be aware of? The dual carbs/manifolds, linkage, hoses,
bits and pieces are mostly '73. The patient is a '72 (oil bath air
cleaner yet to be acquired).
Thanks!
