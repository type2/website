Thanks!
I will ask her that one!
It all depends on what I do with the interior. Maybe I will have to sew them!

I appreciate all the feedback from all the people. It has been very
helpfull. I am aware that this is a 30 year old car, and it will require
more maintenance, but I have no problems with that. I do intend to use
this as my daily driver, presently with a round trip of about 40 miles.
And I am looking forward to driving slower, and planning things ahead a
bit more.
