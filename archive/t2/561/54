Do you have any of the blowers/fans, cables, or hose (from under the 
bus) for the heater? I basically have just the heater boxes, but am 
trying to reassemble a working heating system as cheaply as possible 
before our cross-country voyage in June.
Suggestions from other folks would also be appreciated.
Thanks

this retail , but looking for cheaper options if possible):
Hardware for the Dash table
Spare tire mount (front of bus)

Curtain hardware
