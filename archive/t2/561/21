Subject: What's the practical low end for the endplay spec?

The endplay spec is 0.07mm to 0.13mm which is 0.003" to 0.005" according to the book specs. If you do the actual conversion it's closer to 0.00276" to 0.0051". What concerned me for a while was that the rounding of the units have produced one value at the lower limit that is smaller than the other. I checked without guesswork and the metric values seem to be the baseline...

It was 0.15mm before I removed the flywheel to replace the seal and I suspect that was probably the cause of the tapping noise I used to here at startup and possibly the cause of my flywheel seal leak (got pounded by the crank).

Reseting it to 0.09mm seems a better choice to me. What do you think? I don't want to end up going too tight in practice even though it would be ok going by the book.
