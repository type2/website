Hand controls are very hard to get, mostly due to the liability involved
in their manufacture.

If you can borrow a set of hand controls, they can be reproduced by any
competent machine shop, for a reasonable price.  Just _don't_ tell them
what you are doing with all those odd parts they are making for you!

I have a friend who had hand controls made this way for his cars and for
his airplane.  Oddly enough, the airplane was much easier to adapt to hand
controls!
