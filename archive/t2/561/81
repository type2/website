Folks,

We have talked over the relative merits of compufire v.s. pertronix, but I 
would like to hear from folks who have actually installed some of the late 
model CDI units...ones I can buy on the open market today.

Better, worse, same?

Old coil ok, new coil necessary?

I see John sells Mallory, Ron sells Crane...some are pushing MSD

Who has installed which..and how did it work and what was included?

Do all of them have a bypass switch?...if the "booster" fails?

Did they include the "points" replacement...was it optical(compufire?) or
"hall" effect like pertronix....don't know about the crane unit.  Will 
they work from "regular" points?  

Can you use your old "blue" coil, or can you sue one of the "silver"
coils that require an electronic trigger?

I just can't seem to find enough info at the various suppliers to make an
informed decision.

I just want to compare and think about it!

Cheers, dave.
