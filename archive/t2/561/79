It may be a bit premature to mention this, but I hope to have new '75-79
tanks available in about 6 weeks or so, for somewhere around $100-$130.
This will be the first time available in years. I'd imagine they could
be used on '72-74 as well by plugging off the return line. These are
aftermarket, from Taiwan. Before you get too scared by the fact that
they're Taiwanese, I'll mention that I've been selling the same
company's Vanagon gas tanks for many years and never had a problem. I
wouldn't claim that they're identical to German, but I have many
customers who have had them in their Vanagons for years now and they've
been holding up just fine. While a very clean used German tank is always
a good choice, it can be hard to find a used tank that is not already
pretty far gone rust-wise. I would certainly recommend a new aftermarket
tank over a used original one that is already getting thin at the bottom
due to rusted metal flaking off inside the tank  I'll post a note when
they are in.
