Wow!  Tell us what you really think!

It seems to me that most people who hate the stock jack either have rusted
out jack points or allowed the vehicle to move while up on the jack.  You
can't do much about rust, but you should always securely block the
opposite wheels any time you use a jack.

The "fault" with the stock jack is that it has zero fore-aft stability and
therefore relies on the user to block the opposite wheels to prevent
movement.  The German mindset seems to assume that the user would follow
correct procedures each time.

Alternative jacks, like bottle jacks and scissors jacks have a little bit
of fore-aft stability and therefore will give a bit more stability when
the car is jacked.  However, this can lead to false confidence in the
stability of the jack alone.  If the ground compresses under the jack or
the top of the jack slips (impossible with the stock jack) the bus will
fall.  The user might get away with not following correct procedures, but
it still isn't safe

I much prefer the stock bus jack to the piece-of-tin scissors jack that
came with my Scion.
