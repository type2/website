Let me point out a few differences between your case and mine (where I 
am getting 15 mpg currently):

1. A '70 Bus is a lot lighter than a '76 Westfalia.

2. A '70 Bus has a shorter profile than a '76 Westfalia.

3. Riverside is a lot more flat, and I suspect somewhat less windy than 
San Francisco :-)

One of these days, I'd like to do a little experiment and drive 55 
instead of 65 on the freeway, to see if it increases my mileage 
significantly (I expect it probably would).  However, driving 55 can be 
downright dangerous on freeways around here (even at 65, people are 
blowing by me if the traffic isn't jammed up), and you just might get a 
ticket for impeding traffic or creating a hazardous driving condition.

An interesting experiment would be to drive 55 on I-5 down to LA ... 
you might be able to get away with it more easily there, since truck 
traffic on I-5 has a 55 limit, as well.
