I've had no experience with engines attached to automatic transmissions so
I'm not sure quite how you attack this.  I know that you'll turn the engine
over before reaching proper torque so you've got to keep that from happening
somehow.  I know before I got a flywheel lock my "tool" for this purpose was
my wife holding onto the flywheel as hard as she could, with gloves.
