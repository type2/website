VW has always believed in putting the engine over the drive wheels. So
I'd argue that front-engined-with-front-wheel-drive or
rear-engined-with-rear-wheel-drive are both consistent with Volkswagen's
original design philosophy.

However I too am not very sorry to see VW change course. The prototype
New Microbus, in my opinion, looked absolutely nothing like an original
Microbus. (In fact personally I thought it was butt-ugly.)  What's more,
it was too expensive. The New Beetle not only looked like a Beetle, but
like its namesake it was an affordably priced car. By comparison, the
New Microbus had a projected price of $40k plus based on the dollar
exchange rate about two years ago.  At current exchange rates it might
have been a $50-$60k minivan. Who would buy one?  

Maybe, just maybe, by abandoning their poorly executed attempt to evoke
the old Microbus, using more off-the-shelf T5 parts, and waiting until
the dollar gets stronger, they can finally bring us an affordable van in
2007 for the first time in years. That would make it a more legitimate
successor to the Microbus than a $60,000 minivan could ever be, no
matter what it looked like.
