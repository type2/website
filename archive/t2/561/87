Subject: General maintenance

Hi all,

I would like to ask what others would suggest for general maintenance. I
have a '77 Westy FI 2.L that I think runs great. By the way I have not
yet found GL4 gear oil locally, so replacing the transmission oil
project is put on hold; which brought me to ask the list about general
maintenance. I do not know the mechanical history of my bus which is too
bad. The good is it runs great! When I first got it I had my mechanic go
over it, he did a tune up, replaced the fuel lines, electronic ignition,
one new master brake cylinder, CV boot, the gas tank filler neck and
breather fuel lines also the exhaust was new but the PO did not connect
it correctly and that was fixed also. It has good compression and I
think good power, I try never to go over 55 on the highway. But living
near the D.C area it can be scary at times. I think that is all. So on
to the question; I want to do some mechanical stuff myself/or my
mechanic but what would help my old bus the most? I don't want to wait
for something to go wrong you know what I mean.

Looking forward to others opinions and what they have done. Prioritizing
the maintenance would also be helpful. I do have the Bentley manual but
was looking for personal experience and opinion.

Peace

Meg
