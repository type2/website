Hello Guys    When I was going to Va. Tech  I helped a graudate student get a 
motor to run on wood smoke. We got it to run didnt produce much power and 
gumed up real bad. We found that real old dry hard wood worked better than any 
thing.  I also made an old 36 hp Vw motor that would run on Kerosene. I would 
have to start it on gas then switch it over, Again very low power and it smoked 
like the dickens.  Later  and have fun  mark Dearing  Salem Import Service
