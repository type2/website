A properly maintained VW will have none of these problems. Be sure that you read the library section and do any updates mentioned. For a vintage vehicle, the VW is easy and cheap to maintain. You need to leanr to do your own maintenace b/c you will do a better job than a bored mechanic. 

I'm married so I know how important to maintain household harmony.
