Interesting article.  In hindsight, we should have been suspicious of the
"committment" shown by a projected release in the 2007 model year when the
New Microbus was announced two (?) years ago.

If VW wants to capture the youth market with a new microbus, they won't do
it with a $35,000 vehicle.  They need to get the price under $20K.  VW
used to be good at such things, but I don't think that they can think in
terms of "low cost quality" any more.
