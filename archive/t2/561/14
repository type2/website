Subject: Re: [T2] Re: gasoline vapor induction?

I've read several of the websites now that are talking about these supper carbs which rely on (as far as I can tell in my quick reading) vaporizing the gasoline before it is fed to the cylinders. This ensures no droplets of fuel are fed to the cylinders which will almost certainly result in unburned fuel. 

So isn't this the same thing as running a car on propane or natural gas? Shouldn't those fuel types deliver a HUGE increase in MPG just because the fuel is already vaporized? I know those two fuels have less power per lb than gasoline so their fuel mileage is a bit worse even if much cleaner. 

Interesting topic, and I am enjoying the conversation. 

I'd LOVE to have a 40 mpg VW Bus and a 50 mpg Honda - all retro fitted by me. 

Never heard of running an engine on coal! Was it the coal that was flammable or just the fine dust or a combo of both? Thinking about grain elevator explosions here. Fine dust that is explosive.
