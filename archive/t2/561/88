Hi all,

Remember me?  I'm the quadriplegic that was investigating ways to get myself 
back behind the wheel of a bus.  Well, I figured - it being Friday - that 
I'd give an update to anyone who may care about my progress or lack there 
of.

I got all excited the other week when I read an article in a 
wheelchair-based magazine about a guy who drove a standard transmission bus 
with German-made handcontrols.  Calls were made, emails were sent and I 
tracked him down only to find that the bus was long gone and he had 
purchased the controls in a tiny machine shop somewhere in Germany in about 
1973.  I was being born at about that time.

While I was tracking this character down, the editor of the magazine told me 
that he knew a guy in Oregon who made similar controls for manual trannies.  
Again, I was on the phone, but the woman at the Oregon shop told me, rather 
rudely, that the individual in question died in February and they no longer 
build such handcontrols because they're not "cost-effective". I asked for 
schematics and she basically told me to go suck a lemon.  Greedy little 
#&(-at-)$%!....

Anyway, my foiled quest aside and the proferred lemon added to an ice-cold 
Corona, I've decided to take the advice of some of you and begin a leisurely 
search for a newer automatic, vanagon-style Westie.  At the same time, 
however, I've been inspired by the diligent work that so many of you 
continue to do on your buses.  I, subsequently, arranged to have my '75 
Westie towed to a friend's farm about an hour and a half from here and I've 
started going there on the weekends to sand the rust spots and refurbish my 
ol' home on wheels.  I hope to have it repainted and in immaculate shape 
both mechanically and aesthetically by next year.

Well, that's about it, I guess.  Happy motoring to you all!

Chris
