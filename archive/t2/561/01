Subject: Re: [T2] Re: gasoline vapor induction? 

All,
     What can I say, maybe I'm just gullible.  I think that gas vapor 
induction is possible, or alternative carburetion and utilization of fuel 
for increased mileage and performance is possible.  I can't say why it is 
not in mainstream production, but I just plain believe in the concept.  Here 
are several web sources to peak your interest.

Interesting to note is how the author refers to the fact
that older gasolines had higher octane, and thus these
concepts could not be utilized with today's gasoline. To
me this implies that they may have been possible, or at
least more so, at that time.  Also makes me wonder about
alcohol alternatives as mentioned in article one.

This is an excellent article that describes the chemistry involved.  It also 
has info on how to get the inventors full booklet on the subject.

Here is the guy's website:
http://www.himacresearch.com/
It has some nice images and descriptions of the process, also information on 
the octane ratings and additives of fuels and how that affects his process.  
Very interesting.

This website has some plausible economic and business reasons as to why oil 
companies and auto manufacturers would NOT suppress such knowledge.

Finally:

Folks, you can obtain all of Pogues patents and blueprints at the US patent 
office www.uspto.gov. You have to do a search by patent number only (PN). 
The patents are 1,938,497 : 1,997,497 : and 2,026,798. You can only get the 
images in tiff format.  There are also several thousand other carb patents 
that use vaporization, alcohol mixtures and other things.  Can any of these 
work day in and day out in real production and meet their claims? Who knows. 
  I know that I am probably going to destroy a couple of lawnmowers playing 
with the idea though :-)
