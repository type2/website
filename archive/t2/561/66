Subject: Empty Car Trailer From East to New Orleans, Houston, June 18-25

Hello All,

I wil be driving a 16 ft car trailer empty from VA to New Orleans and Houston
on June 18.  We will be vacationing in New Orleans June 18-25, then picking up
a parts tractor in Houston for the way back home.

Bus Content: I have hauled my bus on the trailer before, so I would be happy
to trailer a bus to any point between Roanoke VA and New Orleans or Houston.
There also is enough time that I could pick up a vehicle in the DC area next
week when we are up there for a funeral.

I will be advertising on other groups so act fast and get trailering done
cheap!
