> 1. Most of the time a engine that is built good will
last over a 100K, I have not seen many that did not
leak a little(VW's mark their spot)
> 2. I don't know of any two gaskets that will get rid
of the oil. Pushrod tube gaskets will leak , main oil
seal but these can be replaced, as most other gaskets.
--3. fuel line, put a protective cover over it so it
won't be cut. 4. correctly route the throttle cable
and put a return spring on it that wont come off      
             
> 5. skid plate, put it up with self taping screws.
good luck with it, Phil
