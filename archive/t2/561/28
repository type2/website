my 71 engine went 112,000 miles mostly abused miles the rebuild would have
cost about $800

yes, but in 30 years of driving I've never had a valve cover gasket fail.
at least not enough to lose any amount of oil that would damage the engine
in a week or so

any linkage can get stuck if it is not maintained, the only one I ever had
get stuck was in the off position and it wasn't on my 71

easy fix,  and it can be done with engine in.

well having a partner I know that I am only happy when they are happy so
they either have to agree or you will never really enjoy your bus.

my 78 now has 322,000 miles on it and I plan on keeping it runninng as
long as possible, and it helped me meet my wife so what can I say

good luck
