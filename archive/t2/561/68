Subject: Gas tank for 78 Westy

Hello All-
Our baby has been running great and then started to die while we were 
running.
I have run through all of the possibilities and am looking at having to 
replace the gas tank :(
It just got a tune up and new fuel pump and more. But the fuel gauge 
reading has been erratic and it is pumping brown stuff into the fuel 
filters that tells me we may be stalling due to some crud  blocking the 
fuel line from inside the tank.
I am looking to the list gurus that you are to see if you:
1. Have any other ideas to try prior to pulling the tank?

2. To see how much a new tank should cost ?

3. And to see if anyone might have a tank for sale in the PA region?

Thanks for any help or leads!
