Possible differences besides the ECU that come to mind might be:
 
EGR Valve (if you even still have it)
Possibly throttle microswitch.
Distributor?
Exhaust header (square vs. round ports)
If you have a California model, who knows what emissions stuff...
 
The Bentley manual FI section (in the back) seems to cover this topic.

Anyone know of FI only parts that might be different from 78 to a 79 engine.
I already have a 78 brain and working engine (hopefully), but was wondering
if any or all the rest of the parts from a 79 might work????
