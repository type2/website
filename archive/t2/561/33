Your friend seems to know a lot about volkswagen problems and little about the solutions to them. None of the problems are incurable and some of those mentioned are downright easy to fix.

If you plan to acquire the tools and maintain the vehicle yourself it will be one of the most fun and worthwhile projects you can take on. If you are going to depend on local mechanics with the expectation level of your friend then it won't be as fun to own.

If your wife is looking for a 30 yr old vehicle that won't require any maintenance or won't present any problems in future then it's the wrong vehicle to own. With the right tools and time and money put into the vehicle to properly maintain the condition, it will drive like new.
