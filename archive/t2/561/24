actually engines get less BTU per unit of fuel running on Propane or
Natural gas, the Buses (transit type) replace a 140 gal diesel fuel tank
with 3-5 cyl running most of the length of the roof of a 40 ft bus and
they get less range.

nope, it is the amount of BTU's produced per unit to provide the power.
so far no one has violated the law of the conservation of energy.

during WWII there were a number of interesting (desperate) methods used to
provide power, one was to tow a small coal tar generator behind a vehicle,
usually a bus or truck, very inefficient, very dirty but when all the gas
and diesel was heading to the front it "moved" under it's own power.
and that was sufficient
