Subject: Putting Worries to Rest - Try #2

HI All,
  I am working on getting a 1971 bay. I have a friend who owned a couple
of them, and hes expressed his wisdom and experience to myself and my
wife. My wife is no longer comfortable with my getting the bus.
So I am figuring that there are a few points of his that I need to refute.
I am going to list them below, and I would like other opinions about these
points of contention.

- You have to replace the engine every 50,000 miles

- There are 2 .50 cent gaskets that when they go bad, all the oil leaks
out quickly.

- Throttle linkage gets stuck on full easily.

- Fuel line gets cut by firewall. this one I am aware of, I am wondering
what the best fix is for it, and can it be done with the engine in.

- The Skid plate under the front end is impossible to put back in place.

If anyone can help me cover these points so that I can ease my partners
mind, I would appreciate it. As I am new to the bus arena, I want to make
sure I have my facts straight.

Thanks All,
Matt
