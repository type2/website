14 MPG WOW, shoot me now..

My '70 bus with 1600 SP was getting around 20-22MPG, i
drive a GMC 2500 Extended Cab Utility truck with a gas
guzzling 5.7LTR and I get 12MPG.. Unless your driving
uphill fully loaded, pedal to the metal. something is
wrong with your bus, and i think its just the fuel
leak coming from bottom.. :0)

good luck,
