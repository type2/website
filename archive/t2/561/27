Subject: RE: [T2] Putting Worries to Rest - Try #2

T1 engines in buses probably average 60k, but well build doghouse cooled
will go further.
Any car looses a drain plug and you are leaking out, bleeding dry, Vw is
no different. You change them so often, it is not a concern.
Throttle cable doesn't get stuck when ina bowden tube and properly lubed
and installed.
Fuel hose slit and put in place of junk grommet saves bus. 
The fornt plate is a PITA, but not impossible. Removed rarely, engine is
not there.. :)
Gotta jet to BBb4!



- You have to replace the engine every 50,000 miles

- There are 2 .50 cent gaskets that when they go bad, all the oil leaks
out quickly.

- Throttle linkage gets stuck on full easily.

- Fuel line gets cut by firewall. this one I am aware of, I am wondering
what the best fix is for it, and can it be done with the engine in.

- The Skid plate under the front end is impossible to put back in place.

If anyone can help me cover these points so that I can ease my partners
mind, I would appreciate it. As I am new to the bus arena, I want to
make sure I have my facts straight.
