Subject: Running Hot 

It appears to me that the thermostat is not opening the cooling flaps in my
75 FI westy (Cable is frayed and I  am not seeing any movement)  - not
having a spare and finding that I am getting temps of 250 driving around
town what can I do in the short tern until I can replace - Is it safe to
unclip the spring and wire them open - I assume that pushing the control arm
down opens the flaps
Any suggestions - Thanks
Eric
