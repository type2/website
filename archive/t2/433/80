Subject: NJ to Savannah next week-any listees there or SC?

ant to take the 78 camper (the high milage one!) to Savannah to check
out the Art and Design school there, and then hit Busch Gardens on
return- can any listees email me as to emergency contacts on the way,
good campgrounds there (is the State Park on Skidaway Is. good?)  In the
past we stayed at a family campground below Busch and may do so again. 
If anyone is close to 95, we might want to meet?  .Mike Benthin in
