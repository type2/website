Subject: Removing Permanent Marker from Paint

Some local teenagers must have been a little bored the other night because
I came outside this morning to find a black triangle drawn on my bus and on
several other nearby cars. If this was someone's "tag" its pretty f'ing
weak! So kids will be kids and I'm not that upset, would be different if it
had been done with a key.... Anyone have any ideas for removing the marker
without damaging the paint? I was thinking of trying some Bug and Tar
remover but I don't know if it will cut it. I am hesitant to try any
solvents but maybe some "goof-off"?
