I have spots of surface rust that I can sand down to bare metal..snip..what 
else should I
use to get the rest of it out of the pitted areas?

..............I use a Dremel with a small round engraving burr, followed by 
POR-15 to get the microscopic pits.     Doyt

I am going to try some
marine clean tonight....
Thanks Volks,
