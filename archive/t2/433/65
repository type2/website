Subject: RE: [T2] Running Hot

In my experience the dipstick has been a good indicator of engine temps.
If it's too hot to touch for more than a few seconds, then it's probably
too hot to drive.  It seems you tried troubleshooting some good stuff to
try and fix it.

If I think of any suggestions I will let you know.
