well, those bikes and the rack may not weigh much. They probably
weigh much less than the static straight down breaking point fprce
of the fiberglass, however, weight straight down is not the only
stress force involved.
When you go zipping off down some mountain pass at 66 mph, the
wind catching on the bikes will try to rip the whole apparatus up
and off the roof. Lots of people get killed when things fly up and
off vehicles. The problem with fiberglass is that it is not
flexible enough. When it fails, it can fail catastrophically:
pieces will just break off. As opposed to say some metals which
deform when placed under more than planned loads.
For safety sake, I suggest that you install a rear end trailer
hitch type supported bike rack. The bikes will be much easier to
put on and take off. And when they get covered with oil spray, you
will know to repair the oil leaks in your engine.
