Subject: I'm going to offer paint service in SO CAL. >>VW only..

anyone need their VW painted?
I will paint only, no body work unless its minor..
I just dont have that much time..
I will spray your VW in my shop, any stock/custom VW 
color PPG urethane, single and two stage..

Im going to offer this service very inexpensively and
only to VW owners in So. CAL. 

I will get photos of my newly painted bus up by
monday. Savannah Beige, and Pearl White, pearl white
isnt the correct color for that year (70) but it sure
looks nice and was still a very popular color..

I dont paint cars for a living, so this is no sales
pitch, just wanted to know if anyone could use a
quality paint job, but didnt want earl sheib and the
likes to use crappy synthetics on their vintage ride..

peace and chicken grease,
rob
