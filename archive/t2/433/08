Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Rust removal

Here is the basic truths of metal and rust---

First, you have to do all you can to mechaniclly remove it from the top
layer of metal.
If it is in an a area where this is impossible, it can be chemicaly
removed with either muriatic acid, or phosphoric acid.

The area must be free from all corrosion / rust or it will come
back--this is just the way it is.

Then the area has to be chemicaly treated to retard further oxidation
from happening, and starve the metal from getting any more air and
moisture.
I know nothing better than zinc to do this.
And when used in and acid etch formula it will lock itself down onto the
damaged metal, with all it's pits, nooks and crannies.
No air--no rust.

Rust comes in layers---top layer usually course, and as it works back
into the metal it's grains get finer.
Now--by masking the problem by overcoating it with some sort of
miraculous converter, is not removing the problem---it's just like
putting a condom over it--it may prevent any more oxygen from getting to
the top layer--but the rust is still there--and if it leaks--the rust
will have  a greenhouse to work under and propagate more of the same.

Rust is truly like cancer--if you don't remove it all--it will be back.
This is just a sad fact of life.
