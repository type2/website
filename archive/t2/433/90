Subject: FW: [T2] Zerk fitting

I happen to work for a company that designs networks and software
for mechanics, car washes, and also lube shops.  I also work with
several folks that have years and years of experience in the lube
industry ( try not to laugh, that's what it's called ).  Anyway the
general response to the question about zerks was that they are
absolutely 1 size fits all.  I checked with three different folks
that used to fit a lot of these things and the responses were the
same.  Myself, I'm the computer guy, not the lube guy, so I'm just
passing along the info.

For those that are curious, a zerk is a fitting that very often is
put onto a vehicle _after_ it has left the manufacturer.  It is a
rubber fitting that works like a 1 way valve and functions as an
injection point for grease and other forms of lubrication.

General conscensus says 1 size fits all.
