Subject: Re: [T2] Removing Permanent Marker from Paint

Theodore Reshetiloff speaketh:

"Anyone have any ideas for removing the marker
without damaging the paint? I was thinking of trying some Bug and Tar
remover but I don't know if it will cut it. I am hesitant to try any
solvents but maybe some "goof-off"?"

I like to use Bug&Tar remover.
