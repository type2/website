With risk of being flamed, I still say that one should consider the
Corvair engine / tranny swap as a legitimate alternative to building up
a Type II or even a Type IV engine. About the same amount of money will
be spent beefing up a VW engine as will be spent doing the Corvair swap.
The two best flavors of the Corvair engines for VWs were the 94 HP and
the 110 HP. They have the nice torquey low end that busses need.
Displacement on the later model Corvair engine is 2.7 liters. That
horizontally opposed air cooled flat 6 is one smooth motor.
