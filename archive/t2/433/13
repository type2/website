Doyt--

Sounds like you getting the job done right.
Now let me remind you of this --

After you get done removing the spot rust, and prepping the metal, and
sealing it with the Vari Prime--the area's have to be lightly sanded,
and fill primed, sanded,  and more than likely primed and sanded down
again.

Here's why--- 

The pits, or spots will be lower than the rest of the panel---
Fill priming the area and feathering it out will a sanding block will
give you a uniform surface--so you won't see the spot repair's under the
new paint---

Boy, would you be awfully cranky it the finished product came out like
the surface of the moon---:>(

Have Fun Doyt
