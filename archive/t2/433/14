I always list every possible thing wrong with a vehicle before I sell it.
Make a list, and give it to prospective buyers.  I've never had one come
back due to "Hey, the whatzitdohickey was broken and you didn't tell me
about it!" Syndrome.

Granted, I sometimes lose a few bucks on the selling price, but it's a small
price to pay for the peace of mind.
