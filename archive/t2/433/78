Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone using Thule artificial gutters on a pop top?

I found that the brackets made for mounting a roof basket fit
beautifully under the edge of the poptop.  They're intended for
gutterless vehicles.  Low enuf profile not to interfere with anything,
just slip under the edge...  These are sold widely in a set of 4 with
nylon webbing straps pretty cheap.  I'll use mine someday to mount my
solar panels.

Dunno if you could use those to secure the thule, but...  No drilling,
gluing, etc...  I'm loathe to drill holes in my bus anywhere...  Buy a
set and check 'em out.
