Hello List,

I am sorry to say this but I am going to leave the
type2 list for a while. I do not know how long. I am
starting new classes that will require much of my
attention. I will also need to focus my attention on
moving. I want to appoligize for not replying to those
of you that emailed me last. I am sorry. Thank your
for your helpful replies though. I will hopefully be
back on the list in the near future. I want to thank
everyone that has helped me with my Bus so far. I have
learned a lot since I joined the list a couple of
years ago. My engine still has major issues which I
will hopefully be able to address later this fall. 
Thanks again for all of the help!

Until then, 
Happy Busing!

Regards,
David Kelly
