Subject: re: Children in a T2 camper ?

Children, 2 .5 and 0.5 ages??

Definitely use approved car seats.


Without fastened seat belts, the rear seat in a camper is unsafe for anyone, 
any age.  Same with the front seats.

Even a moderately strong braking will cause the rear seat passengers to be 
thrust up forward, against the passenger seat, or into the front compartment 
.  Expect bruises, or sprains if you are lucky.  Broken bones if you are 
less lucky.


Last week, I was at a stop light, behind a few vehicles.  Light turned 
green, vehicles went forward, including me.  Vehicles stopped unexpectantly, 
and I mashed the brakes.  Really just STOOD on the brakes.

I was not wearing my seat belt, and I was lifted off my seat, and going over 
the steering wheel, and getting ready to kiss the windshield with by full 
face/open mouth.

I was in first gear, going no more than walking speed.  (Of course, in a 
type 2, the minimum speed is 10 mph!!)

If anyone was in the rear seat, they would have been thrust forward by the 
sudden stop.


if you expect the 2.5 year old to stay buckled up when s/he gets older, you 
MUST be a new parent!!

There is no middle seat in a camper that they can push off against, just the 
front passenger seat (re: '77 camper).

So, if you want a REAL experience, ask someone with a late bay camper to go 
for a ride, and ask them to slam on the brakes at 25mph while you are seated 
in the rear, sans seat belt.

Remember, it is not 'drive as if you life depended on it', but 'drive as if 
the safety of your children and spouse depend on it"
