dan first off you should have solid lifters not hydraulic....
and as far as what to do...
give it a good tune up...\
change oil and filter,
new plugs
new rotor,cap,and points
new spark plug wires
and get you a can of carb spray and clean up the engine...
just my suggestion there will be other s from others lol...
peace
