Wouldn't surprise me in the least to hear that there are SAE and
metric.  As before I stand on the statement that I'm not the lube
guy, I'm the computer guy.  I just asked some folks that used em a
lot over the years.  Certainly they could be wrong.  I'm not in the
position to offer absolute advice here.  I guess that they either
worked on tons of japanese cars or a lot of motor city stuff.
Either way, if they aren't aware that there is a difference then
they must have a ton of the same thing for a long time.  Thanks for
the additional info on Zerks :)
