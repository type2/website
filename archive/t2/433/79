Subject: How do I connect laptop to cell to get list messages?

We finally had to change our ancient cell phones for modern tri-mode
ones when switching to a nationwide shared plan), and at Verizen I said
I wanted the cheapest phones with the ability to connect a modem adaptor
to a laptop so I can do email-we have the old presario I take along for
the map program and DVD watching.  So got these Kyocera phones (2 for
$30) and a kit I wonder about - it's a connector for a USB port (we
have) and software for their own Express Office network or any other
ISP.  It would not work with the IBOOK (Mac) we have for business
trips.  Is there NO adaptor that is modeled after the old "stick it over
the mouthpiece/earpiece" of a phone to let one connect the handshaking
of your modem to the phone connection established when you dial up the
ISP?  On an old computer with a failing modem, I'd have to dial the
number manually on a house phone, listen for the handshake and then
stick the jack into the modem to satisfy the dial Up networking
program.   Heck, I might design my own modeled to the the cell earphone
jack-has anyone heard of this or knows of a simpler adaptor...
