Sears have them but I think you'll have a hard time reading them in 5 degree intervals when the torsion bar adjustment is specfied precisely in minutes. I saw the original VW tool on eBay once...

...and it's a lot larger (finer scale) than Sears one. Too bad the digital angle finders (like the smarttool) are about $90 but I think that's the best way to perform the measurement.
