No, but it is not necessarily less work to drop it. This is a fairly
involved procedure either way, but you can certainly do it. I did this
recently on mine. It took me two good days of labor to do it, so you
could probably do it in a weekend.

If you want to do it with the engine in, the hardest part is dealing
with the exhaust. You have to lower the exhaust slightly or completely
in order to remove the fan housing and get at the oil cooler. The cooler
sits on the left side of the engine behind the fan housing.

To get to it you have to remove pretty much everything off the top of
the engine, the tinware around the fan housing and the fan guard. Remove
the alternator belt, and the three bolts that hold the fan on. You can
then get to the bolts behind the fan that hold the fan housing on. It is
then possible with a bit of manuvering to get the fan housing out of the
bus and thus get to the oil cooler. Replace the two red oil cooler seals
while you are doing it, since they are super cheap.
