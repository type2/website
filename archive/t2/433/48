Subject: oil cooler leaking

i found oil comeing from the oil cooler tonight...
i dont think its as bad as the dipstick boot that is spraying oil everywhere....

i found the dipstick boot
valve cover gaskets
pushrod tubes

and the oil cooler leaking tonight....

i cleaned the engine very good and with a few shots of carb cleaner...

all oil wiped up and cleaned up....
then i crunk her up and rolled forward a bit 15 -30 ft and back revving up a few times,...

then there after i crawled under to see where the oil was comeing from and that was my findings....

the oil cooler?

 does the engine have to be dropped to fool with it or replace it?

the dreaded dipstick boot i just replaced looks as if it has a small hole in one side of it...

the pushrod tubes ...
dont know why they are leaking they were brand new also...?
all is good...
just have to get the dipstick boot and the oil cooler .......
plus valve gaskets,...
just put new ones on there also but they are leaking again to,..????
<scratches head>

any help thanks 
peace
