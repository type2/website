Rule of thumb:  (Actually, this is a 'rule of finger')

The spring plate sits between two metal stops.  This is visible just forward 
of the rear wheel.

If the spring plate is mid way between these two metal stops, you are as 
well as can be expected (provided the front was not messed with!!)

You can easily determine if you are mid way between these two stops by 
visual, or put your finger between each stop and the edge of the spring 
plate.

You should easily be able to feel if both distances are the same.

As they are probably NOT the same, check both sides of the VW to see if one 
side (left or right) is higher/lower than the other.

This does not fix the situation, but at least you will have a decent idea of 
your condition.
