Subject: Removing Permanent Marker from Paint

I'd suggest that if your paint is still a little shiny and/or well
polished... then you can probably rub some paint thinner onto a rag and
just wipe off the paint.  I highly doubt a thin wipe of the rag would hurt
your car's coat, but it should rub the marker right off.  Perhaps you could
try it in a test area.
