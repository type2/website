Hi Russ, If you are speaking of the T-3
fastback/squareback those engines are 1600cc, now if
you are talking of the T-4 fastback/squareback they
have 1700cc up to 74 which had a 1800cc engine. The 
T-3 engine will not fit without modification to it.
The basic T-3 engine might be made to fit using all
the tin and assoiated parts from the bus engine.. Phil
