Subject: cv joint spacers

Those little spacers (3 per joint, 12 total) that don't come in the cv joint
kits are available at the dealer still. The part number was 211 501 357 but
the number has been superceded by 1J0 407 357A. I believe the dealer is the
least expensive source for this item ( <- standard Steve Dolan taunt ;-)
