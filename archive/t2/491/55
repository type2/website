I followed Steve's chemicals advice some time ago and all the locks are wunderbar except one: I didn't clean it thoroughly enough and when it got cold it went a little stiff. Still, it's far better that it was in the first place but I'll clean it better when I go back into the door to replace the plastic cover that was left off.

Tri-flow is excellent especially when you've got newly cut keys by code ;-) with sharp edges that don't want to go in easily. I also used it on my wife's car also and all locks turn effortlessly now.

I found Tri-flow at OSH (for the local folks). It was hard to find at first. It's made/dist by Sherwin William so maybe you can call and find a local distributor if you have difficulty finding it.
