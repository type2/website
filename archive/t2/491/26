As a favor, the friends of Jerry and Melissa Jess would appreciate prayers for
Jerry's health and Melissa's well being during this time.

Leave enough to say that Jerry is currently in a Phoenix area hospital and not
doing too well. It would be extremely appreciated if you would think of the
Jess' in your prayers. Visitors are not permitted at this time. Locals are
reaching out to assist Melissa as they can.
Thanks,
Collective Friends of Jerry and Melissa.
