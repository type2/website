10 days from PA to TX? You're lucky: it's closer to 14 days out here on the coast and upgrading to expedited shipping elimintes the savings for me.

FYI, the original parts are still available from online vendors:

I've found the new rubber plugs to be quite hard. Not sure who is making them but I didn't see any VW logos.

I just adjusted the brakes after putting on anti-seize a year ago. It was a breeze to turn the adjusters. I find the anti-seize stays in the barrels quite nicely. I find it gets contaminated with brake dust naturally but I seem to have a tight fit with my adjusters and barrels and the dust only contaminates the gears. I was quite liberal with it and this was my technique:

Time will tell. No one should be replacing rear brakes drums without adding anti-seize to the star adjusters.
