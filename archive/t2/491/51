Subject: RE: hard turning door locks

I had this problem on my 71 bus when I first got it. The driver side would
unlock no problems, but the right hand door had to be gently coaxed by working
the key back and forth until it unlocked. When I took the door panels off
prior to taking it to the body shop, I noticed a plastic insert in my driver
door that the lock rod ran through. On the passenger door, this was broken. It
appears to keep the rod from bowing out instead of sliding back and forth. At
the time, about 1994 or 95, I got a new plastic slide from RMMW and replaced
the one on the passenger door that had broken. I can remember the steps to get
the rod through the slide, but once I did, the part just snapped into place in
the door where it was intended to go. Lock works perfectly now. Just my 2
cents.
