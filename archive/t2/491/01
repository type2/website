Hello D   I have been running an 1835cc for 5 years now in my 59 panel It has 
done very well , I would choose the webers over the kadrons or better find 
some dells .  and personnally don't like the pertronix as much as comp-fire or 
better the crane ingnitors,  You will need the remote oil cooler with a fan,  I 
would believe that you will get better life from an 1835cc or 1904cc than 
from a 2110cc  As far as the 009 dizzy it will work OK better would be an 050 or 
019 or 031. later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import Service  Salem Va
