Subject: Re: [T2] "Engine Recommendations" and "68 bus motor"

> IM just having problems with trying to figure out WHAT
 DOES go in this van because i have gotten conflicting
 stories on what does.........I belong to
 superbeetles.com on yahoo and ran it passed them
 first......stating that i had an option of using a 66
 bug motor a 1300, to use in my van........they told me
 that outside of it being underpowered which i would
 agree that it wouldnt fit because of the way it was
 built........and that bus motors were more like the
 ones from this t-4? is it......more flat if you
 will.......and i thought i ran it passed this
 group.....now the guy i got the van from said that he
 didnt know it was just in the car and he would give it
 to me if i wanted to come get it........so he took it
 out and sat it in the van that i was going to use for
 parts..........NOW im finding out that they take an
 engine more like or like the actual beetle engine
 which is more up right........SO I guess i just need
 to get books books books......

In the USA:
The 68 to 70 bus 1600 engine is a single port bug engine and the 71 bus 1600 engine is a dual port bug engine
with a special front upper tin piece.
The only DIFFERENCE between the bug and bus case is the 3 holes below the crank pully for the rear support
bar. You can put the bus engine in any bug with no problem. But you need the support bar to put a bug engine
in a bus.
A 'universal' case is made to fit in bugs, buses, and type 3's.
