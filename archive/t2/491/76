Hmmm... mine were fairly pliable.


>I just adjusted the brakes after putting on anti-seize a year ago. It was a breeze to turn the adjusters. I find the anti-seize stays in the barrels quite nicely. I find it gets contaminated with brake dust naturally but I seem to have a tight fit with my adjusters and barrels and the dust only contaminates the gears. I was quite liberal with it and this was my technique:

I also put anti-sieze all over everything with one additional step.  After putting a good bit into the hole, I unscrewed the "bolt" nearly all the way from the star and filled the threaded hole in the star with anti-sieze also.  Then I put the assembly into the hole and turned the "bolt" into the star, forcing the anti-sieze out the bottom.  The idea was that this would fill the cavity underneath the star beyond capacity, forcing it up the sides and ensuring that the star/bolt assembly was *ahem*... as lubricated as possible.

I am really hoping that with the plugs in place this won't be an issue anymore.
