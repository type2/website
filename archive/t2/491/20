Hi Peter,

OK, now we know what end of your bus is the front, let's get to the 
more important issues.

1. Inspect your fuel lines ASAP. Regardless of the engine type, VW's 
are prone to engine fires if the fuel lines are not scrupulously 
maintained. If they don't look perfect, replace them. Check the type2 
library for a listing of the procedure, and be sure to check that pesky 
bit tucked behind the spare tire well.

2. Engine tin is NOT optional.  You need a seal between the engine and 
the body for the cooling system to do its work. Without the proper 
tinwork and foam seal in place an air-cooled engine won't last long in 
a bus. You have a few options here: there is a fibreglass  kit 
available from http://www.creativecarcraft.com/notforbug.htm , you 
couyld try to find some original tin from a european late-bay, or you 
can make your own seal using sheet metal or tire inner-tubes.

Question: What is holding up the rear of your engine? If it's only 
bolted to the tranny, then you're missing a rear hanger. If there is a 
hanger there, it's a specialty item and I'd love to see a picture.

3. Oil leaks are not uncommon. They can happen regardless of whether an 
engine has been overheated or not. Make sure you keep an eye on your 
oil level, as without oil the engine won't last long. Some oil leaks 
are easy to deal with, particularly the valve cover gaskets and the 
push-rod seals. You're gonna want a manual to help you with this... 
which leads me to:

4 .Get a manual. Start with the Bently, which can often be had on eBarf 
for $10US. Clymer and Haynes manuals occasionally offer useful pictures 
for certain procedures that the Bently misses, so if you get a chance 
to pick one of those up for cheap then grab them too. John Muir's 
"Compleat Idiot's Guide" is great inspirational reading but I would not 
recommend it as a sole reference.

5. Power and fuel economy issues are a relative thing. Both depend 
heavily on driving style, terrain, traffic and the state of tune. I can 
get 10% better performance out of my camper simply by unloading the 
extra equipment I carry.  The best way to get power and fuel economy in 
a stock setup would be to go with a fuel injected 2L engine, but to do 
that will require swapping out your fuel tank and designing a custom 
bracket to hold the FI  airbox. Without the top access hatch above the 
engine you will find the FI less than pleasant to maintain, so you may 
be better off with dual-carbs instead. Either way, it won't be cheap.


You need three things to get your engine to fire: fuel, air and spark. 
If you're having problems getting it started, start at the basics. Is 
there a nice fat spark at the plug? Or is the plug wet?  A wet plug 
means you're getting gas to the cylinders, but not enough spark to 
ignite it. That problem could be points, wires, timing or plugs. A dry 
plug means you're not getting fuel, which could be lines, pump, filter 
or carb. We're gonna need more data to help you go further with this 
one, check these details and get back to us.


Happy trails,
