this is exactly what happened once (that i know of ) when i lived in seattle and we 
had campers parked on the street.  we never saw the person but someone spent at least 
one night in the bus.  normally we did lock them.  they didn't really take anything 
just used the blanket and if i remember i think they even pulled out the bed.  i felt 
better about that occasion and the spare change he/she took than i did about the 
person that broke into my car and trashed my stereo and installed phone and didn't 
get either and broke the car window to do it!!!  but they did take my favorite cd's 
at the time......

with patch i usually do the don't lock unless i am leaving it for a substantial 
period of time.  i figure she looks so un-carshow type that people don't expect 
anything of value to be inside ;-)  works for me and my door locks don't get over 
used!!!  am not so sure now with just the little dog he probably would lick any 
invader.  at least the bigger dog used to bark once in a while and maybe look 
imposing.....
