Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [BP] Hightop Blues!

You all are the best!  I know I shouldn't care what anyone thinks (I just 
needed to be reminded ;0) The purpose of the top was not beauty but 
functionality of my bus.  As Greg said my bus is not too nice, and because 
of the hardtop I really can't use my SO- 69 interior.  I might as well use 
something I learned in college.  I was an art major as well as a math 
major.  I focused on architecture and studied Frank Lloyd Wright.  His view 
was that form follows function in architecture. This is what I originally 
planned when deciding to install the hightop.  We use this bus to camp at 
least 20% of the weekends in the year.  Thank you all for the encouragement.

I'm going to DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
