Hey ! ! !

Solution = STOP LOCKING YOUR DOORS ! ! !

If someone wants to get in, they WILL, and you will be replacing a passenger 
side vent window, if they are the 'good and kind and considerate' type of 
goober.

And leave something of moderate value in the bus, hidden from the casual 
bypasser, but easy to see by the cretins, like $7 in the visor as a reward 
for their random act of d%an$#ness


BTW, this is considered a FART!!!  Do not light match !!  Do not attempt 
this stunt at home!!
