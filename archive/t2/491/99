Hi Rus,

To get it to work without *any* mods, you are going to have to stick 
with the stock 1.7L Type 4.

I currently have a 412 motor that is being prepped for a 75 westy, so I 
know what you're up against.

1. 412's had fuel injection, not carbs. You will have to get an FI fuel 
tank and fuel pump to use the 412 FI in your bus, and you will need to 
obtain the entire engine wiring harness, intact.  Our plan is to use 
the FI that originally came with the motor we pulled out of the bus.
If you don't go with the 412 fuel injection, you will need to obtain a 
carburetor. The 72 bus originally came with solex dual carbs, but there 
are many other options available, including the infamous single weber 
progressive. I've had dual solexes on all my buses but have found them 
troublesome to tune, so my next project is to convert the westfakia to 
FI.

2. The engine hanger bar brackets are different from the 412 to the 
bus, so you will need to find a pair from a bus and bolt them to the 
hanger in place of the ones from the 412.

3. The heater boxes from a 412 are very weak compared to those used on 
a bus. They will fit, but they don't produce nearly as much heat. 72-74 
bus heater boxes will fit just fine and give much better heat.

4. The dipstick on the 412 will be coming out of the top of the motor, 
which will be a major PITA, considering that the 2 doesn't have the top 
access hatch. I would strongly recommend you add an oil filler tube and 
dipstick from a 72-79 bus engine before you install this in your bus. 
It will work as-is but it won't be convenient; and if you neglect your 
oil bad things may happen. You'll also need to get the rear tin to go 
with the filler tube and dipstick.

I originally suggested the 412 as it is often overlooked at scrapyards 
where the buses are already picked clean.

Happy trails,
