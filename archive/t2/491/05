First thing you need to learn is that the tranny is NOT in *back* of the
engine. If it is, you have a problem. <grin>

When talking about your Bus' mechanicals always remember FIF (Front is
Front). Everything is discussed in relation to the front/rear orientation
of the vehicle.

You did get one thing right -- the seal you're talking about IS called the
REAR main seal. But it's at the FRONT of the engine. That one still
confuses me. ;-)
