Subject: RE: hard turning door locks

Hello All:
Seeing a remnant of the above thread compelled me to write in response.  I
have this problem every winter:  my front door locks get "sticky" and hard
to turn (that is, quite difficult to unlock with a key), resulting in
twisted keys and sometimes even broken ones.  It's not even officially
winter yet but the cold weather has already led to one broken key, most of
which is still lodged in my sliding door lock.  (It was weakened over time
by the front door locks and just happened to finally break off in the
sliding door.)  At the moment, my driver-side door simply cannot be unlocked
without some kind of key damage and my passenger-side door is not much
better but still workable -- but I'm getting real tired of having to climb
in thru the passenger door.  Anyway, I only saw one part of the "hard
turning door locks" thread and in it I saw mention of "lubricating" the door
locks somehow.  I feel like I need to do this to avoid breaking more keys
before 2004, but I am unsure how this is done.  How and where can I
lubricate my door locks to prevent this?  Thanks for any and all insight!
