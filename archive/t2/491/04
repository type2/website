Hi James. Yeah...I noticed a difference the few times I drove it. I'm looking 
forward to getting it reliable and roadworthy...

I haven't driven my bus much, yet. It really doesn't like the cold weather at 
all -- probably just needs a little tuning. Plus I get no heat. Some of the 
heating ducts are disconnected and the gas heater doesn't seem to be 
running...

So I've learned. If I decide to keep this engine, I'll have to check into the 
fiberglass engine "tin" that Paulie posted 
(http://www.creativecarcraft.com/notforbug.htm).

It's not a whole bunch. I get what looks like a teaspoon sized blob after the 
engine runs for a bit and it looks like it might be coming from the back near 
the tranny. Maybe it's the rear main seal?
