If you ran it without fuel flowing, it will get loud real fast and be toast 
in but a few moments. They are cooled by the fuel and without it will burn 
up very fast.

If, however, it did have fuel flow, it should sound like a very smooth hum 
and not at all loud. Otherwise, replace it as anything other than a 
smoooooth hum is evidence of wear/age and it will not last much longer. One 
that sounds good should be tested per Bentley for volume and pressure. If 
it meets specs, fine. If not, replace.
