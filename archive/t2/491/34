Goto: http://www.biggreenegg.com/boilingPoint.htm and with a little
experimentation you will find that a boiling point of 1000 degrees
fahrenheit can be achieved at only 546 inches of mercury (as opposed to
the more everyday 29 inches). That's roughly 18 times normal atmospheric
pressure.  Sorry to say it won't do Celsius.

                             OOK!
