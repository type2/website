Subject: Bay window front door posts

Folks...

I've received quite a bit of private e-mail about my procedure for 
putting Vanagon seat belts into a bay window Bus/Westy.  Some people 
have expressed the concern about the extra torque placed on the top 
swivel mount bolt in the event of an accident.  The extra torque could 
come from the fact that a longer bolt and spacer are used.

I performed a couple of non-scientific tests, with the result being 
that I want to eliminate that spacer and go back to the short bolt (I 
could sit down and do the math to see what the actual stresses are, but 
I changed my major from M.Eng to CS precisely because I wasn't very 
good at the math :-)

My plan, then, is to trim just enough of the lip using a Dremel with a 
metal cutting wheel (well, probably a 10-pack of wheels :-) from the 
door post that the Vanagon top swivel has the clearance it needs.  This 
doesn't look like it will be very hard to do at all.

My concern, though, is that I could be trading one torque problem for 
another.  Does anyone know if the lip on the door post is intended to 
provide structural support (stiffness, I would guess)?

Thanks...
