Subject: Correct Coil Resistance and Ignition Questions

I am hoping Santa will bring Possum (78' westy 2.0 FI) an electronic
ignition kit this year. I am leaning towards the Crane Fireball and am
wondering about my coil. I have read that for the pertronix units you need
to verify that you have either a ballast resistor or the correct Bosch blue
coil with the resistor built in or you will burn up the unit. Questions:

1. Can I check the resistance on my coil across the + and - terminals with
my VOM and what does it need to be? I have a black coil???
2. Do I need to meet the same resistance standard with the Crane kit as the
Pertonix kit and if there is a different standard what is it?
3. It is my understanding that the Crane units are better made and work on
a slightly more reliable principle, but are they easy to install?
4. Where does a CDI unit come into play here, specifically what parts does
it replace or connect to?

Thanks,
