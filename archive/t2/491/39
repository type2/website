Hey i would be willing to trade for an engine that
would fit right in my 68 bus if someone would trade
for this one. I know that it probably needs an
overhaul but from the LOOKS of it it seems to be
intact and in decent shape..........the car it came
out of was an automatic.


IM just having problems with trying to figure out WHAT
DOES go in this van because i have gotten conflicting
stories on what does.........I belong to
superbeetles.com on yahoo and ran it passed them
first......stating that i had an option of using a 66
bug motor a 1300, to use in my van........they told me
that outside of it being underpowered which i would
agree that it wouldnt fit because of the way it was
built........and that bus motors were more like the
ones from this t-4? is it......more flat if you
will.......and i thought i ran it passed this
group.....now the guy i got the van from said that he
didnt know it was just in the car and he would give it
to me if i wanted to come get it........so he took it
out and sat it in the van that i was going to use for
parts..........NOW im finding out that they take an
engine more like or like the actual beetle engine
which is more up right........SO I guess i just need
to get books books books......
