Hi Doug,

IMHO, 2110cc is too big to bore out the T1 engine and still get decent 
reliability and longevity.  Sure you can build it that big, but the T1 
engine wasn't designed to handle that much power and displacement.  If 
you're looking for something with that displacement, consider starting with 
a 1.8 or 2.0 T4 and boring it out to 2110cc.  The entire bottom end is much 
beefier, and the heads are similar to those used on the 914 (read: high 
performance/racing stress).  Keep the dual carbs and oil cooler if you want, 
but you get full-flow oiling built-in with a T4 and the stock cooler may be 
enough to do the job anyway.

For more high-performance/high-displacement info, check out 
www.aircooledtechnology.com.  I got my new engine from Jake Raby's outfit, 
and I've been very pleased.  The T1 engine may be easier up front, but may 
not stand up to the test of time.  Pay a little more up front for a T4 and 
enjoy better reliability and longer life.

As always, YMMV.  Good luck!
