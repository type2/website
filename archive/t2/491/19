Well, the PO and bill of sale/registration says it's an 1800, but that is now 
in doubt. Karl von Salzen has confirmed that it's indeed a beetle engine, and 
so it can't be any bigger than 1600 (unless it's been bored out to 1800).

White.

Yes it has a gas heater but I don't know if it's working. Again, the PO said 
it works great, but the last time I drove it I couldn't get any heat. Perhaps 
it's due to disconnected ductwork (I did notice a few things disconnected) or 
maybe the fan doesn't run. I have to look into it some more.

Not too bad for a 72 (I guess). There's little here and there and a few areas 
(mostly along the bottom rear side panels) where I'll have to do some welding 
or replacement. The nose has the worst damage where the spare tire pushed in 
the metal. It's also had some body work done on the nose 'cause some of the 
bondo is starting to lift.

$1000 CDN
