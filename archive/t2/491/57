Subject: Help...I'm freezing!

My winter season auto is a 1973 VW Standard Micro Bus
I just replaced my heat exchangers and muffler with new german
stuff.........:-)
But...I am still missing...
1. Heat control boxes
2. The Metal pieces that go on top of the heat exchangers to receive the
tubes from the auxillary fan at the engine
3. All the tubes/hoses...the ones inthe engine compartment...the ones from
the exchangers to the control boxes...the ones from the control boxes to the
main baffle that takes heat to the front...and the ones that go on the front
of the main baffle.

SO...HERE'S THE QUESTION....WHERE THE HECK TO YOU GET ALL THIS STUFF.

I'm soooooooooooooooooooooo tempted to just solve my problem by moving to
San Diego....ohhhhhh...makes me warm at the thought ;^)

Thanks,
