My plan is to re-plumb the vent under the rear seat of my '78 Westy into a 
bilge blower, then into a "y", then into the heat exchangers.  I will plug 
the outputs of the engine fan (more air for the cylinders!) and run ducts 
down the tops of the heat exchangers forward (and plug the holes in the 
engine tin) to my "y".  So it's air through the heat exchangers, plumbing to 
the front of the bus, through the bus, back into the vent under the rear 
seat, throught the bilge fan, through the "y", and back into the heat 
exchangers.  I think my bus leaks enough that CO2 buldup shouldn't be a 
problem.
