Either find and appropriate used distributor, and have it rebuilt by The 
Philbin Group,
http://philbingroup.com/

or buy an SVDA (also a rebuild) from Aircooled.net.

I've done both, and recommend both.  The first will be less expensive, but 
more hassle
(you must find a proper, used, distributor.  They both come with absolute 
CR(-at-)P points
and condenser, so be sure to add some Bosch(tm) parts to your shopping list.

Be sure to carry that 009 (complete through plug wires) as an emergency spare.
