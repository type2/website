Does anyone have a photo/diagram of what the z-bed hardware looks like?

I have a bed in my camper but i've been told it's not a z-bed and I'm 
curious what the z-bed hardware looks like/how it works.

My hardware is weird in that the seat rests on a rectangular piece of 
aluminum tubing which is chained to the area where the rear seatbelts bolt 
in to prevent it from moving past a certain point.  

Thanks,
   Tom
