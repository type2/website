My 2 cents on this swap: Putting a type 4 motor in a 68-71 baywindow is
difficult to the point of not being worth it. The type 4 motor is supported
totally differently than the upright and there will be much fabrication to
make it work. The main problem is the lack of hanger mounts above the
transmission, which is where most of the weight is supported on a 72-79 bus.
The 68-71 body has no provision for this, nor does the transmission
bellhousing.
