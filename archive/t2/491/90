Subject: engine stalls

Ok, my wife has about had it with me.  My low mileage 1600 dp keeps
stalling, usually not until after it warms up a while, and I come to a stop.
I don't think it is the idle rpm.  I changed plugs and did points, timed it,
change the fuel filter.   Now here may be a key, the plugs were black with
what looked liked carbon.   What kind of leads might you have.
