Subject: emissions failure - advice?

now that i live in a stink-hole big city, the 70 needs to pass 
emissions... and it didn't.
here are the results:


HC in PPM - high rpm  :    MAX  500   my bus - 60      at idle :  MAX 
500  my bus 852

CO in %   -  high rpm    :  MAX  4.20  my bus  - .26    at idle : 
MAX 5.5    my bus  .20


1679cc with schneider cam (roughly an engle 100) and 88s, new, stock 
vac dizzy for 74 MT beetles, new brasol 30/31 (125 main, 135y 
emulsion, 50 idle and pilot). side screws are fairly far out to get a 
nice idle and acceptable off-the-line performance. all stock flaps, 
hoses etc in place.  dwell is 50, advance totals 35 at speed.  lady 
suggested a misfire or vac leak - idles pretty smoothly, so i 
dunno... i've also shot so much aquanet on it looking for leaks it 
could star in a john waters film.

so in addition for looking for intake leak, what else do i do? also, 
how in the hell do i know if i fix it??? i mean, i have an afm on the 
dash, but it only flashes lights at me, not readout of ppm.

any phoenix listees w/ pointers would be appreciated.
