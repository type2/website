Berryman makes a similar product too.  I believe it has a picture of a 
bearing and a bike chain on the can, but I can't remember what it's called.  
Works excellent.

Any bike shop should have Tri-Flow- known for its ability to lube a
chain....
Then again, straight Slick 50 or TUFOIL should be the same....

I found Tri-flow at OSH (for the local folks). It was hard to find at first. 
It's made/dist by Sherwin William so maybe you can call and find a local 
distributor if you have difficulty finding it.
