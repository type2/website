78 Low Floor    !! 

Tom

70 High Roof


< of course the other option is to lower the floor between the wheels, one
can stand in my bus (if your not too tall) but the roof is stock height.

of course I then go and put a boat upside down on it anyway, but at least
I can take it off and go fishing.....
