Subject: RE: [T2] What's your MPG

Jason,

I have been tracking both of my VW's mileage since I got both of them on the
road. You are right on the mark with what I get around Denver. My driving is
mostly stop and go city with a little highway and load hauling on the
weekends. I also DRIVE both of them, especially the Double Cab since all its
power is in the top end. To give you an idea.

The '78 Westy (2.0L Solid Lifter with Factory EFI, 85 octane):
14.47, 16.38, 16.5, 16.48, 20.94, 17.14, 16.8, 16.4, 16.34, 17.8, 13.53,
16.58, 16.1

The '68 Double Cab (1914 with Redline/Weber EFI, 91 octane):
16.9, 16.8, 16.7, 17.82, 17.14, 18.67, 18.74, 14.8, 16.7, 15.9, 17.13, 20,
13.1, 15, 13.83, 14.32

You can see the dip in mileage in the Double Cab due to the colder weather
and hauling a lot of wood around.

Subject: [T2] What's your MPG

Since I got Zoey on the road, I have to admit that the trips to the
gas station are a lot more frequent than I have become accustom to
having owned cars that got 35MPG or had 16 gallon tanks.

I tracked my mileage for the last couple of fill-ups and got 17 and
then 16.5 last night. Now my office is 25 miles from my home, and I am
doing some pretty fast driving (up to 80) to keep up with traffic or
just because I can. However, when I filled up last night and got 16.5,
I decided that my lead foot would be no more. I figured that Zoey is
32 years old, runs well, but is still old and just because I CAN  do
80 on a straightaway doesn't mean I should! Granted, I am sure that
the camper top adds a little more weight and wind resistance, but
16.5... Holy crap!

So I am curious what other are doing to get the best fuel efficiency
(aside from just going slower and making sure their buses are tuned
up) and what your current MPG is?

I love the fact that she is running so well (despite some other
quirks) but I feel that my mileage kind of sucks.
