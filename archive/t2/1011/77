	You seem to be assuming that the auto mfrs are rational. 
Better face the fact that the history of commercial technology is not 
merely littered with irrationalities but dominated by them.

	It will do those.  Even for a low-CR engine that is worthwhile.

	I'm happy to tell you this is incorrect.  Even low-comp, 
low-revving engines do benefit from WI  --  see e.g the report from 
The Silver Snail in my article 
http://www.dave-cushman.net/misc/mannject.html
.
	Actually the first engines with WI, a century ago, had CR 
down around 4:1 and benefitted if only from improved cooling (an 
effect us airhowler fans should not ignore).

	In an age of outrageous hype, WI sounds too good to be true. 
But it isn't.
