I wish I got that kinda mileage around Sac.  I get 14 or 15mpg on the
freeway at 65-70mph.  I'm using a PICT 30/31 on my 1600DP, and I'm
having trouble dialing it in.  Smells a bit rich at idle, but based on
the tuning procedures I'm trying to follow, I'm not sure where I'm doing
wrong with it.  Maybe I just need to go slower.
