The  candidate will need to be in usable condition but does not need to

Hey Chris
      The only one I know about is in an 82 diesel  we sold Robert in 
Highpoint (was veggie werks). the vanagon was used as a goat  house after the engine 
broke the timing belt so the transmission should be just  what your looking 
for. 
 
Sorry I don't know how to get a hold of him, but if you go to the business  
section on the full moon bus club site I believe theres a phone # an  address.
 
hope this helps
