Subject: Re: [T2] Re: What's your MPG

Its funny because on the one hand people are always waving ang giving you the thumbs up or peace signs, but on the other hand they are slamming on their brakes and swerving to get around you with out hitting you. It always seemed to me like people on this list were getting better mileage than me but maybe it has more to do with speed. I  have routinely seen folks posting 23-25mpg on this list but I don't think I have ever gotten better than 19 and most often its closer to 16-18. I do drive primarily 65-70 though.
