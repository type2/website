Hi Jason,

Slow down, and you will save a lot of $$$.  I find that my bus gets  
comparable milage at 65-76, but I can get closer to 25MPG on trips  
made at 55MPH.

A lot of the time on long trips I will also try to save gas by  
letting a big truck or another vehicle push the air in front of me. I  
don't get close enough to call it "Drafting", just enough to feel  
some of the resistance recede.


Happy Trails,
