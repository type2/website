Hi Airic,

There are a couple of options here... But why not go with the  
original stepped studs??

Or else you could open up the holes in the exhaust flanges a bit and  
use a 9mm stud at both ends.

I wouldn't recommend a helicoil or timesert if it could be avoided.


Happy Trails,

Question about rethreading the head exhaust studs on a 2 liter head.  It

insert?
I figure VW went up to a bigger size on the 2 liters for a reason,  
but I can't
see why a 8mm with an insert wouldn't work for another 30 years.

I was NOT planning on  using a wire helicoil insert , unless others  
have good
experience with them, it does not appear they can handle the heat.
