Now that is the exact science I like to hear about. It is like when I
figured out that I could get 21 MPG in my 99 4Runner if I held the
speed at 75 where it when down to 19.5 at 80.

I think Duroc is right and that I need to get my mixture looked at and
dialed in. I love my bus, but it is become more expensive to drive
than I ever imagined it would.
