Wolf/Brazil is the only manufacturer of chrome bumpers today.  They make a
standard chrome version and a triple-plated "show chrome" version.  The
standard ones rust out in no time. The show chrome ones are not up to German
standards but will hold up okay if you wax them periodically.  The ones we
buy are the "show chrome" ones; some other vendors ship the standard ones
for about the same price.
