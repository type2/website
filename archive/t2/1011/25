Subject: Re: [T2] What's your MPG

I got a '74 Westy with a 2L fuel injected engine (LJet from a '76 bus).
In the city, usually cruising around at 40mph or so I get 14-16 mpg. I
know that the injectors are not flowing optimally. I'm
waiting to get my old ones rebuilt. Engine is a boston bob rebuild
with about 50,000 miles on it.
