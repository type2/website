Subject: Replacing just the electrical part of late bay ignition switch

Hey listees, I read the article in the Type 2 library tech bulletins about redoing the ignition switch on a late bay, and it looks like the electrical part of the switch is just held in with a small grub screw. All I want to do is replace the electrical part; the mechanical key part is fine. Has anyone done this replacement WITHOUT removing the whole column as advised by this article? The article in the tech writeup section makes it look rather daunting.
Thanks,
Courtney
