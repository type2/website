ain't that the truth, I have to go up too Delaware twice a month and
getting on I-95 can be a hair raising experience and crossing the
Susquehanna river bridge (very high and in gorge) can really get
interesting, I usually try to hit the bridge in the center lane with
no one beside me, not always possible but fortunately the state has
wind "thingies'" at the ends of the bridge so you can get an idea of
the wind speed and direction.
 hate when I have to stop for gas because they are in the median and
you have to merge into the fast lane when you come back onto the road.
no-one will let you in even when all you want is to get back to the
relative safety of the slow lane!!!!!  Drafting a truck is not an
option, more often they look like they are trying to draft you...

I-495 is not an option, the most I will drive on that is from the B-W
parkway to the New Carrollton Metro station!!! and usually it is
driven to the nearest MARC station and take the train in.
