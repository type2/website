Greg,

A couple of minor nits - the difference in 4th gear ratio between the 73 
and earlier 002 trans and the 091 is closer to 8.5% or 6mph at 4Krpm. 
Your '76 with the earlier trans is spinning 4,750rpm at 80mph whereas if 
it had the stock trans it would only be spinning 4,400rpm.  This from a 
spreadsheet I put together that has been checked for accuracy in 
real-world conditions using police radar.

I also think that 80mph with the early trans is not generally acceptable 
for long periods of time.  My reasoning is that there *must* be a high 
load on the engine at that speed due to the frontal area and wind 
resistance of a bus, even on level ground.  My bus certainly could not 
have held that speed for more than a few minutes without overheating. 
I'm also assuming that we are talking an honest 80mph here, and not what 
is reported by many wildly optimistic bus speedometers.

Another thing to consider, fuel mileage at 4750rpm is going to be awful. 
  The bus engines are most efficient in the 2000-3000rpm range and the 
farther above that you go, the faster the efficiency falls off.  Combine 
that with the geometrically increasing power requirements for higher 
speeds and you will be spending a ton of money on fuel to go 80mph.

In my engine, oil temps were a bigger problem than CHT at high RPMs so I 
would recommend an oil temp gauge in addition to CHT.
