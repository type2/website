Subject: 82 vanny tranny needed in NC

Posting for a friend in need:

"I am in significant need of a 4 speed transmission for a 1982 diesel vanagon.
The candidate will need to be in usable condition but does not need to include
the  bellhousing. The closer the candidate is the North Carolina the better.

Thanks
Chris"
