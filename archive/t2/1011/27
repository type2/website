Good question, I am not sure. My tires only have a few hundred miles
on them since I got them new (Hankook RA08) and they are nicely
inflated. I have not thought to check their pressure, but I probably
should just so I know. They are not sagging in the least little bit. I
believe that they are still properly inflated but I will check on
that.
