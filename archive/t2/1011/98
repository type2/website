Ok, I've been plotting the "restoration" of my 1968 Kombi for quite  
some time now, and after finally taking stock of the situation I'm  
ready to have some body work done.

I'm interested if anyone has any knowledge or recommendations about  
the following businesses:

Metric Autohaus (Pasadena)
Very Wild Car Co. (Willmington, DE)

The big issue is getting the undercarriage taken care of before the  
rust takes over.  There is some surface rust forming and I want to  
take care of that asap.  Then there's some old body work that needs  
to be re-done from an incident with a drunk driver hitting the rear  
quarter panel while it was parked in the street.

Info on these or other trustworthy shops in Maryland, the closer to  
Annapolis the better, is greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Greg U
