This is true, things really change at 60, I have been going to Bonneville Speedweek for over a decade now and you constantly hear "remember it takes twice the horsepower to go 80 as it does to go 60"

The resistance curve dramatically turns and points straight up between 60 and 80, there is also something weird around 188 and 260, but I am not sure that relates to our busses, but it is almost Friday, 17 more minutes.
