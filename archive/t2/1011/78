Subject: Re: [T2] 40+MPG? Water injection??

I've screwed around with water / alcohol injection set ups for 40 years.

Looked like an impressive gizmo under the hood, but did very little, if
nothing as far as improved fuel economy, or HP.

I skipped the Rube update in the VW --
It didn't offer anything in a bigger horse GM engine, what's it gonna do
for the squirrel cages?

Nada.
