at 3/4 throttle or more (65 - 80mph still got 44 mpg.

I have looked at these water injection articles a little in the past and I
must have totally missed the part about mileage going up.  I saw the
advantages to running cooler but the whole thing seemed counter intuitive
about using water.

Can anyone elaborate?  I would like to hear feedback from all of you who have
tried it.  With fuel prices going up the whole idea of 50MPG really seems
intriguing.  I just don't know if I have the technical knowledge to
implement.

Thanks,
