Was comming over the "hump" today, on the way home from the center of maximum
capitalism, and saw a "BaY" on the side of the road.  After much protest from
"SWMBO", pulled over, and within 20 minutes, had a "sage" lady, who knew the
"greatful Dead", on a first name basis, on her way!  Sometimes, "forgotten
knowledge, mechanical", is "GOLDEN"!
