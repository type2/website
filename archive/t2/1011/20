Subject: 2 liter head studs

Question about rethreading the head exhaust studs on a 2 liter head.  It
appears they have a 9mm originaly.  Is it best to tap and install a 8mm
threaded insert in bad hole, or remove the additional and go with a 9mm
insert?
I figure VW went up to a bigger size on the 2 liters for a reason, but I can't
see why a 8mm with an insert wouldn't work for another 30 years.

I was NOT planning on  using a wire helicoil insert , unless others have good
experience with them, it does not appear they can handle the heat.
