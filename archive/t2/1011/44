	Many types of carb have a 'power jet' which chimes in at a 
rather precise speed (under given conditions).  In some cases you can 
hear it  -  as I could on The Water Wagon, during my thousands of 
miles testing water injection.  As I say in my WI article,

	During several trips between Auckland & Wellington, I had 
been in the habit of cruising around 1/3 throttle (just off the power 
jet), 50 - 55 mph, 45 - 40mpg.  With water:fuel at 5 - 10%, on this 
same journey, I took to cruising at 3/4 throttle or more (65 - 80mph) 
- and still got 44 mpg. Back down off the power jet, the former 
cruising regime gave 53 mpg.

	On that Solex at least, I could clearly hear the power jet 
come booming in.  Fuel consumption then slumps.  The above excerpt 
tells  you that WI can fully compensate for this extra fuel 
consumption  -  as the Wright Cyclone mfrs put it, at high power 
water is approximately equivalent to fuel.  The cooler running is a 
valuable bonus.
