Subject: Re: [T2] 40+MPG? Water injection??

I was just reading about this Water Injection stuff and it really
seems interesting. Adding water and alcohol to the fuel and air mix
cools down the cylinder and BOOSTS the octane while to increase
overall fuel efficiency... I have GOT to be missing a critical
component of why this concept is flawed, because I cannot understand
why this concept was not widely adopted by more auto manufacturers
than just for the Saab 99!

I have an extra engine in storage that I would LOVE to try this out on
if it truly worth the time.
