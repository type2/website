Lots of good info on this thread....

Geez.... I see people talking about going 75 on the highway. I don't
even think my bus can go that fast.
Luckily I'm in an area where I don't do lots of highway driving in the
bus... and even then, the highway I live near is
tame , and I can do 60mph without much turmoil. I can hit 65mph at
about 4300 rpm. I don't push it much beyond that. And I know that my
in dash tach is not accurate. I really use it for reference more than
anything...


I have a '76 2L engine with a transmission from a '72 bus. I got the
tranny with about 50,000 original miles from the original '72 bus (it
was from nantucket, can't do much driving on an island). It probably
has about 55,000 miles on it now. Would I be able to go much faster at
that rpm and/or get better highway mileage if I switched to the later
091 tranny?

I always figured running at around 4500rpm for extended periods would
overheat the engine.
