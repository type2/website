Greg,

I don't understand your logic.  The load on the engine (in hp, to 
maintain a particular speed) is the same regardless of the gearing.  The 
effect of the gearing with the earlier transmission is that the load 
will be satisfied at a higher RPM which is even farther beyond the peak 
efficiency of the engine.  That means that for every gallon of gas that 
goes through the engine, less will come out as power and more will come 
out as heat.  This is not an insignificant difference.

My opinion (admittedly not directly supported) is that the lower gearing 
will do more harm than good at extremely high speeds.  Don't forget that 
the flow of air through the engine is not linear with respect to RPM. 
At some point, more rpm will not equal more air.

The '78 owners manual specifies 75mph as top speed:

... and I think the top speed for a '73 with the earlier tranny is even 
less.  90mph would be 5400rpm in the '73 (and your bus) and even with a
stock 091 it is a lofty 4950rpm.

That manual also specifies the HP peak as 4,200rpm (71mph).  Anything 
beyond that and the engine will be making less hp and *much less* hp per 
rpm (translates to more heat and *much more* heat, respectively).
