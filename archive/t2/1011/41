Subject: Re: [T2] What's your MPG

When my original '78 engine hit past 240,000mi  I had to slow down due 
to oil pressure being low and to keep oil temps below 245. Wow, at 55 
mph I was getting 24+ mpg. Usual was around 22 as my daughter gets on 
her 75.
Now that it has around 3k on a rebuild it's only around 16 on the 
highway- possibly due to rebuilder putting in a stuck pressure regulator 
that blew one injector and not sure about the rest.
