 Hey Jason, I've never checked my milage but I will weigh in on the 80
because you can.  Our buses are not good at those speeds and the old brakes
aren't as good as the guys in front of you doing 80.  Keep it safe bro.

I am doing some pretty fast driving (up to 80) to keep up with traffic or
> just because I can.
