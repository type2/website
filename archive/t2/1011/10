Subject: quiet car install ?'s

I just got a gallon of quiet car. I am quite excited about putting this in
my single cab. I plan on painting the interior of the front doors, and maybe
the floor and wheel wells(as per site recommendations). Anywhere else that I
should focus?

 

I remember someone else on the list used this. Any
recommendations/suggestions for application?

 

I was also wondering if you applied it on the inside of the cab when doing
the wheel wells, or underneath the bus?

 

Thanks for any suggestions.
