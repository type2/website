Subject: Straight Info On SM & SL Oil

Here's the straight info on the new oils your able to buy for your older
Buses, and other flat tappet cam engined vehicle's.

No hype, no BS.

OK--the API rated SL oils had a zinc & phosphorus index rating of 1000
parts per million.

The new SM rated oils are now 800 parts per million of zinc &
phosphorous, and can cause problems in a flat tappet cammed engine.

Now--Shell Rotella ( diesel engine oil ) with a CI-4 rating had 1400
parts per million of the zinc & phosphorus.

The new CJ-4 Shell Rotella has 1000 parts per million.

Don't ask me how much a portion of a million is, I wasn't told
that---this is all direct from Shell oil company when I called them outa
sheer curiosity yesterday.

The answer man also told me that seeing as the diesel engined trucks ARE
NOT going to be required to run converter's right now--( The particulate
matter separator's are a totally different animal that the new trucks in
07 are required to run ) and are exempt from the EPA's  API automotive
standard's.

What happened here I guess is the EPA wanted the automotive
manufacture's to come up with a converter that was good for 100,000
miles, and which they would guarantee for that long.

They told the EPA--no way Jose'--not unless the oil companies back off
on the phosphorous.
The phosphorus is a portion of the zinc content in the oil which gives
the converter's a hard way to go--it short lives them.
So--the oil companies were required to drop the content of the zinc &
phosphorus so the converter's would live longer in automobiles only.

But in this process, all of a sudden guys with older engines--Chevy,
Olds, Pontiac, Fords, etc., started complaining about their cams going
prematurely flat and face of their lifter's wallowing out.

Ooops--nobody at the oil companies, or EPA ( I don't really think they
really cared anyway ) thought of that.

So there as been a problem for the first portion of this year with the
poor oil quality of the stuff your buying at Wal Mart, and other large
distribution center's of oil.
The west coast was the first to see all of these changes-- 

The answer is very simple.

Run Shell, Kendal, Mobil, Mystic, Sinclair, Amco, or Citgo diesel truck
oil.

Automotive oil burner oil is an EPA regulated product and has the lower
API automotive requirement's.

Even with the lower diesel API rating of CJ-4 this is the same zinc
content than the original automotive SL formula.

If you run the older CI-4 rated diesel oil--your covering all of your
bases.

Your engine's, lifter's and camshafts (probably the bearings too) will
thank you for the better lubrication & load bearing attributes of the
higher zinc & phosphorous content in the diesel truck engine oil.

The real bonus is that the diesel oil's have a anti sulphur & ash
formula that far exceeds' the automotive engine oils.

It'll go longer without breaking down, especially in an air cooled
engine.


This was all direct from the horse's mouth.
