Subject: Re: What's your MPG

I'm not one that's ever gone 80mph, partly because I can't get the 81 Westy 
to go that fast unless I'm headed down the CA grapevine fully loaded!

However, I agree with your statement about the inaccurate speedos. 
Everytime I pass up one of the highway speed signs that indicate your true 
speed, I'm always 3-4 mph off, but in the other direction.  I'm going say 
57mph according to speedo and 60-61 according to radar.

I'm stock everything . . .from tires to tranny, to you name it . . .and I 
check tire pressures regularly.  Sound common?  Guess I'm putting a few more 
miles on than I really think I am . . .and my heads have lasted longer than 
I give them credit for!

Thanks for the great info!
