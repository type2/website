Subject: Re: [T2] 40+MPG? Water injection??

I was just reading about this Water Injection stuff and it really seems
interesting. Adding water and alcohol to the fuel and air mix cools down
the cylinder and BOOSTS the octane while to increase overall fuel
efficiency... I have GOT to be missing a critical component of why this
concept is flawed, because I cannot understand why this concept was not
widely adopted by more auto manufacturers>>>

If your Bus was a P-51 yea--throw the water to it.

You don't ave enough compression or ponies to make the bus fly with an
water / alcohol injection system.

All's the water will do is prevent pre- ignition, and maybe clean the
carbon outa your valve train.

Now if you had an oil burner you could bump your HP & go tain big time
by injecting water & alcohol.

Why don't the mfg's use it?
It won't do anything to benifit a low compression engine.
