As most of you guys know, I drive the Guac hard. I treat 4500rpm as my
redline, and 3/4'ths pedal is my limit except for brief periods (under
30 seconds). I've made a few trips from Denver to SoCal and back
maintaining 80-90mph (indicated). Usually with a few hundred extra
pounds from either family or cargo or both. Aside from vacuum and
exhaust leaks, no problems with the engine.

Granted, it's not a full Westy so it's lighter than many. But the bus
hasn't shown any signs of failure due to overheating or overloading.

My 73 let me know when the heads were softening. I could feel a
difference in throttle response. The 78 has never shown a difference
at all. (Ok, except for a mild hot start issue... I really need to
pull that starter and clean and regrease everything.)

I don't know why it lets me do this, but I suspect it's the fact that
the engine compartment is well sealed, the pistons were recently
re-ringed, the heads are newer AMCs, and that I keep the oil changed
ever 2k miles or so. Timing is carefully maintained at 8* when home,
and 7.5* when road tripping.

I would love to put an accurate CHT on there, but even when I could
afford one I didn't buy one because the VDO's were too inaccurate and
the Dakota Digitals are too fugly.

**I'm knocking on wood right now because you just KNOW Murphy is gonna
come along and make me suck a valve... hehehe**
