Subject: door handle springs

Hi guys,

I had problems with my door handles when I first got my single cab. The
driver's side door did not open from the outside, and the locks were super
tight. Basically they felt like I might break the key in them.

I figured out the drivers side door mechanism was missing a spring. I got
two springs online. I took the driver's side mechanism out, and replaced the
little spring as per http://www.type2_dot_com/rvanness/lock.htm. Very
helpful.
Thanks for that Ron. The original spring was not there. I also lubed the
mechanism, and cleaned it pretty well. I noticed that one of the other
springs was broken. It looks more like a single turn round spring. I'm not
sure what you call it.

Anyway I put the mechanism back in the door, and now the door works from the
outside, and locks well, but I can't open it from the inside. I am guessing
this other spring that broke is causing the prblem. It looks like something
that should not be too hard to find-but I thought I'd ask you guys for
sources on this spring. Any ideas/suggestions?

I also took the passenger side door mech. Out to clean and lubricate, and
noticed that it was missing that little spring as well. I installed a new
one, and cleaned/lubed it. I have not installed it yet, I will tomorrow
morning. Hopefully this helps the lock mechanism work better.
