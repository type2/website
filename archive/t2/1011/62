The article in the tech writeup section makes it look rather daunting.

I'm waiting for this too, I read the bulletins and have the new part
in hand but I look up under there and decide to work on something
else.   put on new heads, buy an engine, weld up a door panel,
anything.  that job looks very hairy.
