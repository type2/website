Hi David,

I agree that there is a higher load at 80MPH than there is at lower  
speeds. But that earlier transmission has lower gearing, so there is  
an improved mechanical advantage that reduces the load to the engine.  
So the load on the engine is 8.5% lower than the same speed being  
driven with an 091 transmission. And that''s more like 73 MPH, which  
I think you will agree is maintainable.

Yes, there will be more heat generated by friction, but you also have  
a cooling system that is running 8.8% faster to help deal with that.`

II am NOT suggesting that 30-year-old buses should be run at 80MPH,  
but they were designed to go 90MPH as a maintainable maximum when  
new. But you're right, that was determined by the speedo, not a GPS.  
(They wouldn't be commercially available for 20 years yet).

Happy Trails,
