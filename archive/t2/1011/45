Subject: What's your MPG

Wow I wish I could go 80, but probably not safe. Happy when I get 60!  I think
that is about right judging  from my own experience.  I get that around town
(on the low side)  closer to 15.  But  I was happy to find out that on my most
recent interstate experience I was gettin getting 20 -21.  I just had tuned
her up and really thought my MPG still sucked but when I got her on the high
way I got 20-21.  I maintain 60 -65.  I have a 78  2.0  FI with originally
miles and dont want to push her harder.  On a down hill I can go faster!
Ladybug has mostly run in the CO  mountains and my MPG are closer to 12 when
travelling in the mountains   :: ((   SOunds like  I am in the same ball park
as others.  Oh yea  I also run 87- 89  octain.  Use to run better but prices
have pushed me down,  I have heard the arguments, but I believe the best gas
you can afford is the best for you in the long run for engine wear.  JMO
peace
