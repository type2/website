Subject: Re: [T2] What's your MPG

>I tracked my mileage for the last couple of fill-ups and got 17 and
then 16.5 last night. Now my office is 25 miles from my home, and I am
doing some pretty fast driving (up to 80) to keep up with traffic or
just because I can.

Try slowing down! Air resistance is proportional to the square of your
velocity so by going at 80 rather than 60 you almost double your air
resistance! The travel time difference would be about 6 minutes
(assuming door to door at 60 or 80mph!). I imagine travelling at 60
should see your mileage well above 20 mpg.

The alternative is to change to imperial gallons for an instant "no
stress" jump in mileage! ;)
