Reminds me of the commercial with the nascar drivers sitting in a
driver's ed class.  The instructor (cop) asks "what is
the proper following distance" and one of the drivers pops up with "two or
three inches"  :)

Drafting does work, and I've crossed the Mojave against a stiff headwind
by drafting about 100 feet behind a semi.  I couldn't even maintain
cruising speed without the draft, but with it I got my normal mileage.
