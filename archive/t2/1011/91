Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for ignition switch contact for 78 westy

Mike asked:

It's getting more and more difficult to start the car (78 westy), so I'm
thinking that the plastic electric switch that hooks onto the bottom of
the keyed ignition switch is probably cracked and slowly dying.  Does anyone
know the part number for this part?  They have a few on BD, but I just want
to confirm that I'm getting the right one.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

ETKA shows the part number to be 111 905 865 L from 2x4 2164 060 to the end
of 79.

Looking up that number on Bus Depot I get 88-92 Vanagon, 74-79 Bug, Ghia,
and Sb!   http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=111905865L
Strange!

Looking by application, you get this one:
http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=171905865
and if you look at the list on the bottom of it, it lists the ones for the
111 905 865L switch.

Here is the 171 905 865 switch for $13.95:

Other than price and manufacturer, I have no idea what the difference is....

Here is the 111 905 865 L for $22:
