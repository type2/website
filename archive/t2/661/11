"I didn't have a hot start problem as much as a slow start problem.  If it
didn't get at the first hit, then the next hit would be real slow until it
fired. I likly will need a solenoid or strater soon, I imagine."

Did the relay help? If I understand your problem, it sounds like you have a 
near dead battery.
