That's a good point that hasn't been brought up yet -- old cars need
to be driven more gently than new cars. I had an embarrasing object
lesson on this when I was in high school auto shop. My friend had been
given a project car by the teacher of an auto shop class at another
school. He not only invited me to go with him to get it, but offered
me to drive it home. When we got there, the shop instructor was just
putting the final touches on it so we could pick it up.

On the freeway home, the car was driving great. I said, Hey Don, look,
this car is running great. Look 50, 55, 60 and the car died! When we
got home his sister said, John, don't you know how to drive an old
car. I have never forgotten that lesson!
