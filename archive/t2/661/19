Subject: Fouled head replacement

Hello All,

I replaced the #1 and #2 head recently only to discover an oil and fuel
leak, lots of it,  coming from some where around my work and ending up
collecting on the tin that wraps the cylinder. The other side also had a
small amount on it's tin.  I checked the oiled and discovered I had
overfilled  3/4 of a quart and the fuel rail was absent of any fuel.
This is the second attempt, last time I forgot to lap the heads to the
cylinder.

Any suggestions at this time would be helpful. I haven't the tolerance
now to research the archieves or flip any pages.

Thanks in advance, Craig
