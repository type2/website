When I made the drive last year, we hit white out conditions up the 
Sacramento Pass just west of the Nevada/Utah border.  We were going to 
continue through Denver, but had to head north to Salt Lake City and 
southern Wyoming because of closings on the Interstates around the Denver 
area (or on the way to Denver, I forget which).  And this was during 
mid-November.

We considered heading south, but didn't have the time (had to make it home 
for the Christening of my companions daughter).

I guess the point is, this time of year, my advice is to take the southern 
route.
