From vwwesty:
 
 Oil consumption: 1.7-4.8 pints per 1000 miles. 
 
Ouch, thats a lot of oil for 1K on a new car!?

Not really. I [somewhere] have oil consumption charts for 50's vehicles. 
Normal on a Pontiac was 1 qt per 300 miles!

Today, Mercedes says 1 qt in less than 660 miles is excessive, anything more than 660 miles is OK!!!

Try explaining that to a new MB owner..... "I am using 1 qt in 1000 miles..... the engine 
holds 8 qts of synthetic oil..... I am going to put in 10 qts before I need to change it at 10K
miles??  You have to be kidding me that this is normal!!"
