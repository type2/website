David,

You are mounting your alternator externally to the tin.  In this scenario,
any alternator could be mounted.  From where did you get your external
pully that mounts on the front of the crank/fan?

This has me thinking that I could mount an internally regulated Chevy 105
amp alternator outside like you did.  Then,  I could disconnect the belt
to the factory alt, or, I could have the second alt run my electronics and
extra battery, etc.

Thanks for taking the time to respond.

Mark
