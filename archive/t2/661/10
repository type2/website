Subject: CDI ignition system write-up

Did the .045" plugs today, and I am happy.  Engine purrs like a kitten 
... idle is very smooth, throttle is very responsive, and starts are 
fast.  I just need to reset my AFM now, and I will be good to go.

As promised, here are photos and a write-up of the work I did to get 
the CDI installed.

Hopefully this can be helpful to someone!
