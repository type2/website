Hi Greg,


Just across the border in Niagara Falls Canada is a place called John's 
Bug Shop. They are highly recommended... they do lots of aircooled 
work, I have bought parts from them and they have done service work on 
Dad's westy.

In a "Worst Case" scenario, they could throw a carb on it that would 
get you home.
