 Well after it was all said and done the t'stat works great, but the
 new pump leaks like crazy. It constantly drips a drop of oil every 2-4
 seconds (or about every 20-30 feet). While it may be good to help me
 find my way back to the house w/my trail I'd rather have a non leaking
 pump again.
 
 Does anyone have any suggestions for trying to get the leak to stop.
