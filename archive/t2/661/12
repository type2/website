I'm very familiar with the CA/NV/UT portion of the road.  However, I am
intrigued with the idea of doing the whole thing.  Perhaps it's the fact
that it is probably the longest and most intact US route left.  US 66
gets all the press, but there's a lot more left of US50 to drive.

miles east of Fallon, NV.  If you think it is lonely now...
