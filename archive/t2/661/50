My 78 Westy does just fine at about 62 in the right lane.  any faster we 
are talking "dodge-em cars".  In Sacramento we have a nice 10 mile 
causeway over rice paddies (or open water in the Winter) to get from 
Davis into the City.  I know the Beetles were rumored to float, but I 
Don't want to try it with my Bus.

They just are not stable over 65.  I have the special tires KONI shocks 
it's better but still dangerous speeding in the wind...
