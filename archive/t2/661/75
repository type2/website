Low buget WR-1 suggestions,,,

run a 16awg wire from term. 50 on the starter to near the battery positive
terminal.. if it won't turn over with the key,, put parking brake on, key on,
trans in 'N'  ...friendly wave to the guy parked RIGHT behind you in the middle
of the intersection where you stalled it....as you open the engine lid... touch
that $0.25 wire end to the battery positive terminal till the engine starts...
you might have to play with the throttle cable if you have flooded it
already,,,,

OR
If you happen to have the 71 or 72 with the factory test block still installed
on the engine bay ceiling,, you know that multi-pin electric diagnostic  "plug"
..... you can use a Hair pin or paper clip to jumper + or 6 to 15,, that gives
the coil power,, then temporarily jumper + or 6 to 50... that will spin the
starter.... until it starts. Pull the clip out of + to 15 to shut it off.

One thing I have found doing this... for some odd reason the horn will blow.....
weird...

I don't think the 50 terminal is available on the 73 up till they discontinued
the test plug so it might not work on 73 and newer
