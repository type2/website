and the reason I have the WR1 in my bus.

some years ago the wiring from the rear to the front shorted and literally
caught fire.  no big deal to put it out, but in rewiring I decided to just
let the major power take a short cut and make it a little easier on the
old beast.   so yes I have a WR1 in the bus, not because anything is wrong
with my starter or my wiring (now) but because I prefered a solution that
would put less stress on the exsisting/new wiring.   it also made it a
little easier to put in the rear start switch too.

YMMV
