Subject: RE: [T2] cleaning out my parts stash (bumper overriders)

i also failed to mention i have a set of bumper overriders from an early
bay.  they do have surface rust, but are still in very useable condition.
also still have the original rubber strips intact.

$50.00 + shipping.

thanks,

Joel
