 Seems 68 and 69 are the same, 70 is one year only and 71-79 are the same for
 master cylinders.

 Do you mean the resovoir that sits on top of the mastery cylinder or the
 resovoir in the cab where you add brake fluid? If it's the first one I'm not
 sure where you would get it, don't see any on busdepot.com but if it's the
 second I think any little plastic resovoir thing would work as long as you
 get it mounted firmly to somewhere.

No, you have it a little off :)

68 is one-year-only.  The upper reservoir is kidney shaped. The tube between the upper and
lower is metal. This makes the lower one-year-only.

69-70 are the same. The upper is round. The tube is plastic.

All 3 years are horrible for the uppers. They are wafer thin and crush like a snowflake.
For 69-70, your best choice for the upper is the square 71-73? that is mounted behind the drivers seat on the
bulkhead panel. This material is a whole lot better and lasts just about forever.

For a 68, your best choice is the 71-73 upper, the 69-70 plastic tube, and the 69-70 lower.

68-70 lowers are all you can use. These are the only years where the center-to-center nipple measurement are
100mm. Nothing else out there is 100mm. 67 dual and 71 up, Volvo, Rabbit, MB are all 85mm. You cannot use the
68-70 master on a 67 and back to make it a dual system because there is no lower reservoir made with a screw
cap.
