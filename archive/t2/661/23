Subject: RE: [T2] 69 Bus master cyilnder resovior

Seems 68 and 69 are the same, 70 is one year only and 71-79 are the same for 
master cylinders.

Do you mean the resovoir that sits on top of the mastery cylinder or the 
resovoir in the cab where you add brake fluid? If it's the first one I'm not 
sure where you would get it, don't see any on busdepot.com but if it's the 
second I think any little plastic resovoir thing would work as long as you 
get it mounted firmly to somewhere.

Otherwise I'd start picking at parts buses if you can't find any new ones.
