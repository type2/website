Subject: Gunson exhaust gas tester opinions wanted

I am concidering purchacing a Gunson gas tester. I am thinking about this unit
because there are no shops in Flagstaff Az. that I have found that are willing
to work on an air cooled engine. SMog tests are not required in this area,
YET. I am supposed to receive my newly rebuilt engine from Bus Depot/AVP in 2
days. I have purchaced a new afm for it, the original had dead spots. Is the
Gunson gastester suitable for setting the correct c.o. level. Is it truly a
reliable instrument when used correctly or just another gimick to drain my
wallet?
Thanks
