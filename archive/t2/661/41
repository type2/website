I have no idea what it was like in Germany but in Italy - also the land of no speed limits (we ran 120 mph regularly in my VW Rabbit convertible - read drop-top GTi) the folks I knew did not brag that they got 340Kms out their engine, they simply replaced the engine once in a while or replaced the vehicle. The people I knew just took it for granted that their engine would require a major overhaul or replacement due to the speeds they drove. It was like using up a set of tires... 

In my family we reassure ourselves we get 150K miles or 200K miles out of an engine and my extended family tries to time a vehicle sale so it occurs prior to major engine work. In Italy, the point where the car body was beat up or rusting was the determining factor on when to sell the car. 

It's been tough to retrain myself but that is how I operate here. My extended family gets rid of cars at 100-120K miles and the fact that we buy them at 120K miles really causes them concern. Their cars are used up at that point to them. I see no reason to sell a car just because it needs an engine. It's the point where it is ugly and beat up (or rusting). This delay in replacing a vehicle leaves money in my pocket.

So drive it hard, just know you'll need an engine more often than your grand mother...
