I drive my bus (-at-) 70 all the time.  Sometime 75,
sometimes 80.  Now it does have some trouble reaching
those speeds, but yes- 70 often.   Of course, the
engine is screaming some high-note way above the
treble-clef, and we still have the situation of a
large object with the aerodynamic characteristics of a
loaf of bread, plowing down the freeways.  "Warning: 
At speeds in excess of 120 MPH, do not open windows." 
Yea, right.  My bus wouldn't reach 120 MPH if I drove
it off the cliff into the Grand Canyon!
