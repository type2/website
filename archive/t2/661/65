Subject: Pressure plate wear limit?

I'm replacing the clutch in the 72 bus. Bentley doesn't give any spec that I can find that says how thick the disc should be. It only says the lining should be 2mm above the rivets. Since the rivets are really close, I'm replacing that.

The release bearing was really ground down and noisy so that's going too. As for the PP, can I have an expert opinion to comment on the condition of the fingers? The rest of the PP checked out.
