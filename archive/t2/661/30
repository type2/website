Marc,

If I remember correctly, I had the same problem untill I realized that the 
plugs are color coded to the connectors for those parts.

Look again and see if they aren't!

Pics here...not big detail, but maybe close enough.

Blue to blue for coldstart
Brown to brown for thermo?

Now here is what really bothers me!  I was having trouble maintainig idle 
after startup on my new 78 2.0l.  Changed the head temp sensor to a new 
one that I had for several months and everything was really great.  Fired 
up on a 23 degree morning like a champ!

But!  Went to get a christmas tree Sunday morning in the rain(about 50 
degrees) and the bus did not want to start....I had to open the throttle a 
little before it fired up...which to me means too much fuel was there.

Did just fine for the return trip.

I haven't had time to investigate further yet...or check gas mileage 
lately...



Cheers, dave

I've been having hard starting problems in the morning, smelling gas, and getting really lousy gas mileage.
