here if the interstate is doing 55 it is a good day

well yes, I was sideswipped by a truck at about 60mph or so. the tractor
trailer driver fell asleep and drifted into my side.  lets just say a bus
going backwards at 60mph is scary to say the least.  thank whoever you
want a well placed guard rail kept me and my bus from going over an
embankment.  I was unhurt and the bus was surprisingly little damaged..but
not something I wish to repeat.  passing trucks is white knuckle now and
that was over 10 years ago....
