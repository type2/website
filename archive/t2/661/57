Part of equipment operation is knowing the design limits and capabilities. 

Responsible operation includes remaining within those parameters
unless you are an emergency responder or in combat.

The only way I can see to accurately know whether or not we are
operating within design parameters is with full instrumentation:

Tach
Oil pressure gauge
Oil Temp gauge
Cylinder head temp gauge
Air / Fuel ratio gauge

This instrumentation is crucial in aircraft mechanics because people's
lives are at stake more so than in a car. In a car, your engine blows,
you pull to the side of the road unhurt in most cases. But in aircraft
this is so vital that at least in some applications I have seen each
cylinder is monitored for A/F ratio. I'm sure we have aircraft pilots
or mechanics on the list that could elaborate on this more, but from
my limited experience, all I can say is that this is the only way for
us to really monitor empirically the things we have been discussing
here. I don't have the money to equip all my vehicles this way yet,
but I am working on it!

  I think the problem comes in when people slap a set of Webers and a big cam
 and exhaust on the engines, pushing them past what stock equipment could
 give the engine in air/fuel and exhaust capability.
