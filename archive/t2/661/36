Subject: Oil Pump leaking like an Exxon tanker

So this weekend I pulled the engine in my 66 to actually install the
thermostat as well as replace the heat exchangers with some older
(but genuine VW) ones. While out I decided it wouldn't be much more
work to install the new oil pump I bought from CB perf about a year
ago that allows me to run a remote oil filter. Naturally a small
addition to the project cost me big in time.  

Well after it was all said and done the t'stat works great, but the
new pump leaks like crazy. It constantly drips a drop of oil every 2-4
seconds (or about every 20-30 feet). While it may be good to help me
find my way back to the house w/my trail I'd rather have a non leaking
pump again. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for trying to get the leak to stop.
I'll most likely pull the pully and tin again tonite and try to get a
better idea where it is leaking from. I'm reasonably certain it is
from between the pump body and the cover plate, but will know more
tonite. I used a piece of sandpaper on a flat surface to help true the
side of the cover, and it appeared to be flat based on the scuff
marks. I also only torqued the bolts that came with the oil pump to
the stock spec (14 ft-lb IIRC). Hopefully someone has some suggestions
on getting this straightened out, my wallet can't take dumping oil in
the bus every trip :(
