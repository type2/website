Richard,

Looks like normal wear to me....and not too bad at that...whole lotta 
rubbing going on there over the years.

The best test is this.  put both down on a clean newspaper(clutch side 
down) and step on the fingers with your shoe.

After you do this a few times over the years, you get pretty good at 
"feeling" how bad the plate is...

Cheers, dave

As for the PP, can I have an expert opinion to comment on the 
condition of the fingers? The rest of the PP checked out.
