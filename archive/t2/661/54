Aircooled engines just can't go as fast or last as long anymore thanks to global warming. It's a fact. :-)

Everyone I know with "unbelievable" mileage seems to drive slower than the average person. That's just my own observation from a few people.

We tend to forget that VW stopped using aircooled designs decades ago. There's probably a very good reason.
