Subject: Re: [T2] 55mph speed

I have a copy of the 70 Bus manual that lists the following.

PERFORMANCE:
Maximum and cruising speed...65mph
Pick up with tarpaulin... 59mph

Climbing ability with full payload on good roads.
1st gear (3.80:1) 27%
2nd gear (2.06:1) 14%
3rd gear (1.26:1) 7%
4th gear (0.82:1) 4%.

Reverse 3.61:1

Oil consumption: 1.7-4.8 pints per 1000 miles. 

Ouch, thats a lot of oil for 1K on a new car!?

I've never owned a bus...
