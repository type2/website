That's a tough one. Unless the value is published somewhere, or
someone in the industry has a working familiarity with it, you would
have to have a physics book to calculate the fan properties and rpm.
There are some formulas here, but they assume same size fan:

It could be useful to you if your bilges are the same size and you can
measure rpm.

 My 73 squirrel cage does move a fair swack of air, but it seems nowhere
