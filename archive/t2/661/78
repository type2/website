 I've tried all places that people have recommended
before submitting to this list, but to no avail.

Has anyone used one from another model or year to
substitute for the 69 bus brake fluid reservoir ?

Yes, I realize that.  All that I wrote pertains to the RESERVOIRS!!!

Here it is again:

68 is one-year-only.  The upper reservoir is kidney shaped. The tube between the upper and
lower is metal. This makes the lower one-year-only.

69-70 are the same. The upper is round. The tube is plastic.

All 3 years are horrible for the uppers. They are wafer thin and crush like a snowflake.
For 69-70, your best choice for the upper is the square 71-73? that is mounted behind the drivers seat on the
bulkhead panel. This material is a whole lot better and lasts just about forever.

For a 68, your best choice is the 71-73 upper, the 69-70 plastic tube, and the 69-70 lower.

68-70 lowers are all you can use. These are the only years where the center-to-center nipple measurement are
100mm. Nothing else out there is 100mm. 67 dual and 71 up, Volvo, Rabbit, MB are all 85mm. You cannot use the
68-70 master on a 67 and back to make it a dual system because there is no lower reservoir made with a screw
cap.
