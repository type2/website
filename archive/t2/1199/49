Hello Bob,

Strange symptoms. My flashers wouldn't blink when I had a blown lightbulb, or
a bad connection in one of the sockets. You could also try cleaning the
contact points in the turn signal switch. They might be gummed up. Sometimes
the battery can slide back and either short or damage taillight connectors.
