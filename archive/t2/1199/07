Subject: Re: [T2] underside of pop-top

Kevin is is "flocked" with something, and it molds.  Best way keep the mold
away, don't let it start.  Don't ever, ever, ever let it be damp.  Replace the
seals (particularly the pop to luggage) immediately, and keep it dry inside,
air it out well after long damp trips, I toss some big dessicant bags I got
somewhere in the '77 when stored.
 
As for cleaning, well, when they were a
lot, lot, newer (when I was flipping late 70's and early 80's Vanagons in the
mid 90s) I'd take ones that had molded and mist them just barely with
blistering hot water mixed 60/40 or so with Tilex, then vacuum immediately
with a super soft vacuum brush, and of course do this on a hot day and let it
air out the next week.  This would remove the mold fairly, wouldn't really
improve the age yellowing (a buddy would use a little bleach in water, same
technique for those, I wasn't sure it really improved it enough).  For either
treatment I'd be very, very unsure of it not destroying everything on one
today now 30+ years on from new.  If it is badly molded, you got nothing to
loose I guess, but you need to prepare for loosing it all.  If it is age
yellowed, just move on.

The underside of the pop-top looks sort
of like felt or something. I've seen
pics of some tops with mold growing on
that surface. What is the best way to
care for it? How do you wash it, and
keep the mold away.
