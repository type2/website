after what my wife went thru after someone stole her tags and used them 
on a car during a robbery of a convenience store, they were caught and she 
had to go to court 3 times to say "I did not let them have the tags"

I went and pop riveted hers and my tags onto the vehicle. directly to the 
rear engine lid and front bumper.  they may try but they will have to work 
hard to get them.
