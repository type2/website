Sorry I missed that post two year ago this coming July.

" I receive AIRS update requests from time to time, and the admin email does
work. People regularly find these emails, yet there was no communication
around this dev work that was going on."

Not sure what you mean when you say "people regularly find these emails" ?
When you say admin email, do you mean the form on the airslist  or an email to
this admin.  I've tried updating my info from the form and have never gotten
it updated.  Maybe I'm doing it wrong?
