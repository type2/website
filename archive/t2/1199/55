I would highly recommend a gps tracker. It is better than using a club and
having them cut your steering wheel. You could recover it pretty quickly.
Don't leave any accessory or part easily snatchable. If it is not bolted down,
it is likely to be taken. Front emblems and mirrors go quickly, as do camping
stools, rear scripts, reflectors and roof racks. Use lock tite and nylock
nuts to make fasteners harder and more time consuming to remove. Security
screws help. There are a lot of little things you can do. You could also buy
your own boot for a wheel if you are really worried.
