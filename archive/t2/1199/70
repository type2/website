With these kinds of solutions, it's difficult to be religious about
doing it every day, even when they are more properly done like a
battery cut-off switch and a fuel cut-off valve. A solenoid
fuel-cut-off that only required an additional hidden switch to be
turned on before starting might be something more liveable.
