You know, I've been saying that here for years...  Particularly for me this is
the trick for a smaller always corroded fastener, brake bleeder screws.  I've
saved reworking many a set of 911S calipers with this trick.  I count my taps,
to at least 100, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, to 2-300 if I feel I'm really facing
a PITA.
 
But it always does bear repeating, it doesn't always work, but if it
gives one a fighting chance, great.  If heat, a good penetrant (OK I keep it
cheap and like Kroil, but doesn't probably matter) and tap, tap, tapping don't
make it loosen with properly applied torque (6 pt like Tim says whenever you
can) then you are just plain doomed.  For that, on the initial part in
question, one can always take a dremel and with 1-2 reinfored wheels slit
through the side of the nut in short order, then loosen it easily, without any
real damage to the underlying parts.
 
But other times you are doomed, like I
recently was on the converter to flexplate bolts on my Suburban, got to love
chevy, they go to a stinking socket head M10 bolt with a shallow (maybe 2mm
deep) 8mm socket indent that a brand new SnapOn bit wobbles loosely in,
because I'm sure for assembly with a multiple head airtool the first time it
was just peachy...  Grrrr.

works with nuts or tapers like
ball joints. Use a peanut hammer like 2 or
3 oz size and just rapidly tap tap
tap for several minutes. The vibrations
will break the bond, and also greatly
help the penetrant penetrate faster.
Can't tell you how many times this has
worked marvels for me. I have even
saved aluminum threads that were highly
corroded with this simple tech.
