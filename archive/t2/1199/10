Here in the home of 500% humidity, and mosquitoes big enough to stand 
flatfooted and make love to a turkey. We take a 5 pound  bag of rice (about 
$2.50), pored into a large baking tray and put in the van when not in use. 
Rice really sucks up the water, and solves a lot of dampness problems. I do 
this in my boat while stored at the marina. A friend puts it his Cessna 172. 
Change rice about every 3 months. Sorry can no longer eat it!
