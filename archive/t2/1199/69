Hi Chris,

Air filter, tire pressure, bad gas, oh I know what it could be. There should
be a small brass tube that is inside of your carb that disperses gas in the
center of the carb. I don't know which carb you have. This tube is pressed
fitted in the carb throat body if i remember correctly and have been known to
fall out. This will cause the fuel to just run down the sides of the carb
throat and not mix evenly with air. I found this out years ago. The other
problem with this is your engine eats the brass tube... Look for some pics and
exploded drawings of your carb and make sure nothing is missing.
