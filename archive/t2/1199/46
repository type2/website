For your reference Kevin. Not trying to be combative, but lets be a bit
more transparent here.

There have been attempts at spinning up a dev group to do a new version of
the AIRS list. Did it go the way we wanted, no. Again with
the volunteer part. Even though a load of time has been spent on
maintaining/supporting type2.com (ask my wife,) we're not always able to
dedicate the time necessary.

Let's not assume it's a pride thing for everyone. I personally think the
new design is pleasing, and my pride has not kept me from telling others
about it. My stance here is that while I wish our previous efforts to pull
together and develop something would have been more successful  I'm glad
that someone was able to find the time to devote to the AIRS function. It
deserves it, and so does the community. I too wish it could have not been
located in another spot. It's just another bookmark to visit. And for what
it's worth, I receive AIRS update requests from time to time, and the admin
email does work. People regularly find these emails, yet there was no
communication around this dev work that was going on.

Peace,
Troy
