Subject: Re: [T2] Rear hatch latch stuck!

Yah,,, lol,, it is that simple... the panel pops off very easily,, and the 
latch will be in your face..
then drill a small hole to match up with the latch.... add a short chain and 
key ring,, and put the panel back on.
you will be able to open it from the inside forever more!
