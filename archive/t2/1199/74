Over the years I've always been able to update my information on the
Airslist as necessary and appreciate the work that has gone into it. It
has been my pleasure to help those that have come my way.  If I were a
bit more tech savvy I'd jump right in and help with the Airslist. Thanks
to all who have helped with it.

The other various Airslists are good things too. We who make ourselves
avalible to help our fellow man will always have the risk of our
information being used in nefarious ways, but I think the risk is very
small compared to the rewards.

Ok..back into hibernation here in wisconsin... I'll come out again once
the snow melts and hit the road in the bus.
