Subject: Losing fuel efficiency

I worked on Lurch some more today.  Many responses to my last post suggested a
problem with compression.

1  110 psi
2  110 psi
3  110 psi
4  115 psi

This is on a warm engine with all plugs removed.  Three trials per cylinder
with about 10 revs per trial.  Only one plug (#2) was black and sooty.  This
has been an ongoing problem.  Why is this happening?  The plugs are new.  The
spark plug wires to 1 & 2 or 1100 ohms and 3 & 4 are 900 ohms, which makes
since because they are shorter.

The only thing that I can think of is some kind of laminar flow in the intake
manifold.  A leak would make things lean, not rich.

I replaced the float valve.  When I removed the fuel line from the carburetor,
gas under pressure came spewing out, which means to me that the float valve
that was in there was doing OK.

I STILL cant account for a 24% decrease in fuel efficiency.
