Hi Mike,

    I like a hidden fuel shut off. That way if some turd should get it 
going, he will run out of gas when the carburetor runs dry. This will leave 
the bus on the side of the road usually out in the open. Attention is not 
what they want so most thieves wont take the time to try and get it going 
again, as time is not on there side and they just walk away! My insurance 
man told me a fuel shutoff is the most popular with insurance companies. The 
reason being that type stolen vehicle usually has the least damage. The ones 
with the most damage.........ones with electrical type blocks, reason being, 
if the thief has the time he will try to defeat it by cutting, splicing and 
in general "G" hawing the wiring!
    I bought a electrical fuel shut off solenoid kit complete for $17.65 
from my FLAPS. 30 minutes later a good nights sleep for all involved.
