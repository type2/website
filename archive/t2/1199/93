Another idea that wouldn't involve the fuel is to install a relay with a key
switch to the 12v source to the coil. Almost any cheap relay would do. Easier
and cheaper than a fuel cutoff. Your carb shouldn't flood if you have its fuel
solenoid cutoff valves installed. You could do the same on fi motors, just
install it before the double relay.
