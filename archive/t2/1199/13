might try a "Pre-Vale" bottle it is a glass spray bottle holds about a 
pint or so. I have found them at certain ACE hardware stores but not at 
either of Home Depot or Lowes

I would suspect that the Acetone would damage any plastic not specifically 
designed to hold it,  All Acetone I have ever bought has been in glass and 
I keep mine in glass.
