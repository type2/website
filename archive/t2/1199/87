A friend of mine dragged me out to a very dilapidated detached garage
over the weekend to
get a "huge stash" of free VW parts...Well, yes, they were free and,
yes, they were VW parts
but apparently the previous owner worked on Bugs (there was one in the
garage so rusted I
could push my hand through the sheet metal) and never, ever threw away
any of the parts he
replaced...Piles of dented, rusted fenders; milk crates of old starters
and generators, etc, etc, etc... ;-(
