Subject: Re: [T2] Drop Vanagon engine

A JOKE Troy.  At one point there I could drop an aircooled Vanagon mill by
myself, in the field, hand tools and a good floor jack only, in less than 45
minutes (not counting the CVs.)  I could single handed reinstall in less than
90 (again not counting the axles.)  Pull it en total, engine and tranny
(unless it is an autobox where it might be just a smidge faster to leave the
tranny in so you don't F with the CVs as it is just the 3 flex plate bolts.)  
For a stick, it really is just 6 bolts, 2 at the tranny mount, 2 at each end
of the bearer bar.  Drive up a set of truck height red ramps, pull axles (the
long lead depending on how much someone has F'd the bolts in the past), then
unwire, un fuel line,  undo shift linkage (easy on vanagon), place a 2x10
under pan stretching up under tranny, balance point of floor jack just at
front edge of engine.  6 bolts and drop straight down all together.
 
So much
easier than a bay, no bellhousing bearer points, no stupid shift linkage up
over the axle beam, etc, etc.  It will make you cuss the next time you are
under a bay.  Of course you got to pull the T4 a lot more often in a Vanagon
when it burns up every 75-100k and all, so it better be easier, and then
waterboxers are abominable from a plumbing standpoint.
 
YMMV.  (but not a lot
on this one.)  I'd give it 3 hours start to out including the axles with any
competence unless there are any hangups.  The outboard CV's are what can bite
you in the rear buried in those stupid trailing arms if someone F'd em
before.  I guess you could just pull the inboard ends and might waggle the
right one by the starter but I wouldn't swear it.  And of course, I'd repack
those CVs anyway, do the fuel ring, and the 4 engine mounts, while you are
there.   Cheap, cheap, cheap.  The Vanagon cooling gasket is usually still OK
of course.

Morning everyone. What is the level of
effort needed to remove/install a
Vanagon engine ('81) compared to a late bay?
We have an oil cooler seal that
is shot, but my experience with the Vanagon is
minimal.
