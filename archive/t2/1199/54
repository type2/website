Subject: Re: [T2] Stealing a VW bus

Stealing a VW Bus! Ok here's my story.

    Please note the names have been changed to protect the .........dumb! 
Several years ago a very good friends wife broke the gen belt on their very 
very nice low mileage (38K) 68 Bus and fried the motor. My friend took the 
bus to one of the best shops on the west coast and had a complete motor job. 
I remember it was a very complete job and for big bucks too! It included 
"new" heads, "new" case, and "New" crankshaft, pistons & cylinders, etc!
    Well it seems before the first oil change the wife drove it shopping, 
well don't you know she came out to return home and "CLICK", locked up 
motor. Well the heat was flowing between husband and wife, and it was 
decided to sell the bus without even a call to the shop about warranty. So 
we cut to the chase, I bought the bus, for $2500.00. At the time I thought 
that was steal enough, until I towed it home and found the starter drive 
gear had split and jammed the flywheel locking the motor up! $20.00 later 
and I had a new 68 bus!

SO IS THAT CONSIDERED A STEAL OR WHAT!

    Now if Paul Harvey was still with us, this is where he would say; "And 
now the rest of the story".................................
Being as he was a good friend, I told him, and sold it back for the same 
money! If he only would of said or done something to PMO, I would of had an 
excuse to keep it! Damn the luck, I still laugh every time I think about it. 
Now the real up side to this was........he owed me big time, and still buys 
the beer more than what's fair. Also he's still got the wife, and her 
automotive luck isn't any better! Bus is long gone!
    No animals were harmed during this event and the only broken heart was 
mine!
