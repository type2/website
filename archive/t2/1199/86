Subject: Re: [T2] RE Stealing a VW bus

It's weird, if you think about it, that the most valuable thing most  
of us own is something we leave outside, sometimes (or most of the  
time) away from our own yards. If you put your laptop out in the  
street, it would be gone in an hour or two at most and we all know it.

Every day, when I go outside for the first time each morning, I check  
and then breath a sigh of relief when Peregrine is still parked in my  
parking bay. My security system has been parking my GTI behind  
Peregrine in the bay, so that someone has to steal, or at least move,  
the GTI before stealing the Vanagon. I like the idea of combining (a)  
a fuel cut-off, solenoid activated, with a remote switch (like a  
remote door lock) with a GPS chip.

And insurance.
