	Could you ease the oven tray of (now water-laden) rice into 
the oven at say 160 C to re-dry it?
	Silica gel is widely used for reversible uptake of water 
vapour from air  -  in little muslin or paper bags which can be 
re-dried after  ... (judging when is not trivial).  Can this fine 
cheap Loozianuh product possibly be a cheaper dessicant?
	The oven-drying should kill such insects as have occupied the rice.
	BTW could unpolished rice be better?
