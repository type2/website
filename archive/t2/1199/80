Subject: Re: [T2] RE Stealing a VW bus

As there is absolutely no security in a mid 60's convertible, I have a
hydraulic lock on my TR4 brake system, hidden under the seat, functions much
better than the parking brake does anyway, press pedal hard, engage the lock,
locks the rears solid.  If you don't know it's there, frustrating as hell to
try to get it to move.  I don't lock the cars doors for fear some idiot would
cut the top if they want in if they are too stupid to just unpeel the roof
snaps.
 
Would work really nice on a bus, could hide it there in one of the
"jack cubbies" and if you didn't know, it would take a while to find it.  You
aren't going to overpower well adjusted rear brakes with a SP or a T4.
