Fuel solenoid switch with a key switch somewhere near the driver's seat. 
I'm thinking through the seat pedestal with the key slot hidden by a 
flap of the rubber pedestal mats. Make sure it can't be accessed from 
the other side of the steel too.

Also a red flashing LED goes a long way. Make them wonder. Have also 
long thought about a starter interlock that allows the starter to click 
only or only whirl for 2-3 secs at a time with the ignition cut out so 
the engine just can't start. make sthem think the starter has a problem. 
Could also run this through a multi-pole fuel solenoid lock out switch.

I think in a high crime area - I'd first consider just moving. Then I'd 
consider cellphone tricks that notifies me when the vehicle is being 
entered. Then a garage. Then maybe starting a business with a communal 
inside garage parking for interesting vehicles - split the cost with the 
neighborhood or subscribers?
