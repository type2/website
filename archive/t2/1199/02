Even with the most basic of procedures, I always use some refinements just
from shop experience.

You certainly need to go to at least a 3/4 drive bar for these big nuts.
Also a 6 sided socket.

Factory install and the torque spec on the Big Nut assumes threads clean
and dry. I don't like dry because of the potential for rust. I grease the
threads, turn on the nut by hand, then remove the nut and wipe off all
excess grease. On subsequent removal I use just a few drops of light oil.

Then I torque to 80% spec and if required a bit futher to the next cotter
hole. And for those who don't know, there are two sets of cross holes near
90 degrees apart for the cotter key. Adjust further turning to set that
lines up. So it is spec torque then further a bit if required to insert
the cotter pin.

If in good condition, I straighten and reuse the cotter keys. I know I
have used some 3 times and good to go. That would be with good quality
cotter pins, not some of the designed to be cheap pig iron. Get those big
cotter pins anywhere that has tractor parts. Shoot, they even may have a
linch pin that would be trick.

Rule of thumb, one in ten will take penetrant and tappin and sometimes
heat to get loose, or a giant 175+psi compressor with super duty impact
wrench typical of big rig shops. One in a hundred will need to be cut off
when all else fails.

A 3rd generation machinest gave be this tip for stuck fasterners. This
works with nuts or tapers like ball joints. Use a peanut hammer like 2 or
3 oz size and just rapidly tap tap tap for several minutes. The vibrations
will break the bond, and also greatly help the penetrant penetrate faster.
Can't tell you how many times this has worked marvels for me. I have even
saved aluminum threads that were highly corroded with this simple tech.
