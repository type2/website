Subject: turn signals problem

78 bus.

couple weeks ago turn signals started acting up, but if I pulled the 4way 
then off they worked fine,. was waiting for warmer weather.
well yesterday turning on 4way didn't get em working.

so today I replace the relay, 2twice (3 different) all same problem 4way 
works normally, turn signals light but do not flash?

thought they both used same relay.
but changed the other relay next to it anyway


???? ideas??

Bob
