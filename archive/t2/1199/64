Can't we all just get along?  I'll ask it, and god knows I'm the combative
type.
 
As a few vague facts such that I'll say.  First, the moderators had
asked
countless times for volunteers to update AIRS, as the list has declined
(or have we really died and don't know it), they haven't seemed to get
any
takers I've ever seen.  And I don't seem to think they go whining
that much
for money any more.
 
Next the form to update info did work, the last I tried
it, but that has been
a while (2 years?) so I won't say I know anything since
then.
 
Last, most of us seem to have posted our info on aircooled rescue, I
did
just the other day.  Indeed if I get a bunch of spam shit mail from doing
this
I'll be pissed, but after all, it will just be more in the lists of spam
shit mail
from joining one more forum/list/whatever.  So I've been warned.  If
I
missed the fact that he had initially seized info from AIRS without
permission, sure, bad, boy, whatever, all of us left that probably had
contact
info on AIRS have now probably volunteered it then.
 
I like it myself, needs
some work, but using the map interface is nice, and
I'll take my chances
having stuff up there, just like I always have.
 
A humble list servant,
John
