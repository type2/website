they attempted to steal my bus once, hauled it onto a roll back, but it is 
so distinctive a friend saw them and called me and we caught them before 
they had gotten more than a mile or two,

doubt if there is anything that could stop something like that, I have an 
electrical fuel shut off system and hidden switch.
also hand controls does baffle them too.
