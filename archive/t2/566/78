Would you clarify? I concur with Richard Atwell, 35 psi. That's what 
Bentley says, too. Perhaps we're talking apples and oranges.

Operating pressure with vacuum to the regulator is 28 psi more or less. See 
Bentley. Unregulated pressure is higher. The 40 pound reported says first 
check the calibration of the gauge. If that's good, you have a regulator or 
return line issue.
