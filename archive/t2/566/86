Well,  with some good advice from Dr. Tim and Jamie Rivers, I licked the
squeal problem.  The work I described on Friday licked it in its original
location but it started up on the other side.  Putting a slight chamfer on
the pads cured it on the other side (which had *not* been squealing
before... go figure)
