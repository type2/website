That's normal if the plug is disconnected.

Ug.

The oil pressure sounds good. The senders aren't very good but they at least
read low.

That fuel pressure gauge is either reading incorrectly or you're not getting
any vacuum on the fuel pressure regulator (or it's broke). The fuel pressure
should be about 36-37 psi and 28 psi with the vacuum attached. That's your
source of richness.

I wouldn't rule out the AFM.
