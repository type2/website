Hmph.  It would appear from the bughaus pic that I in fact have the 6 to
12 v bushing.  What manner of madness is this?

Pics of the 2 bushings I have:

The p/n of my starter is 311 911 023D.

I can't fathom that I would have anything that was originally 6V on my
'79.  

Stumped, but at least I've seen the photographic evidence and know what
to get...
