Indeed. I was going to do this step, but I wasn't in the mood to take my
experiment any farther. It goes to show how little fuel is needed to make
the engine idle.

I seem to remember Greg saying he had done something tricky with the tank.

This may be the reason for high fuel pressure. If it is a tee type situation
with only one branch into the tank, it can't work as a return line, as the
fuel will be trying to flow in both directions at once.
