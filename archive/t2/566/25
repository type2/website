Maybe the difference is German parts compared other world parts. $200 for 
German parts would be a much better value than $0.05 for the lesser spec 
assemblies, in my adamant and arrogant (experienced) opinion. Just try not 
to pay German prices for lesser parts. Make sure you compare apples to 
apples and not turnips.
