chuck,

yes, exactly. good explanation.

to underline what was happening on greg's engine, the fuel pressure should
be at zero with the afm disconnected, and the bus should not be drive-able,
it should simply be able to produce a shabby idle.

we also had a customer last week who had a 77 bus that would run with the
AFM plug disconnected. he could actually drive his bus around, but
complained of low power. he was looking for small problems here and there
and found some, but ultimately found that the afm plug was not attached.
obviously there is an electrical issue if the pump is running with the afm
disconnected, likely the relay is stuck closed.
