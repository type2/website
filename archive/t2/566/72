Rus, do yourself a favor and buy the Wilson book "how to rebuild your
vw engine" or something like that name. It's a good overview of all
the steps involved in rebuilding an engine. As far as the "good deal"
on a kit auto parts by most accounts are fairly reliable. The more you
spend on parts, usually the quality goes up (to a point)
