Painted. The powdercoater wanted another $125 to setup for a second color
and I didn't want a black shroud. I did get him to sandblast the shroud and
fan for me as part of my engine tin powdercoating. He did that practically
for free.

Nope. That part was disconnected in the 1/79 fiche (and even says NLA in the
3/75 fiche). I guess it popped out and VW decided it was a bad idea to have
bouncing around in there.
