Subject: Brake Lights Part Deux

I tried having my wife press down the brake pedal and I checked to see if the
switch is doing anything. Doesn't look like it... No continuity between any of
the contacts on either switch. With the brakes activated, there should be
continuity between at least 2 of the 3 pins, right?

Checked for 12v at the black wire going to the switches. Nope.

In the cabin I applied 12v to the brake light wires. Lights lit.

I'm prolly going to mickeymouse something together so I can have brake lights
until I find some new switches... :(
