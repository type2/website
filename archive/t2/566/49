It's a smaller 2.8mm connector. I haven't tried the VW dealer for 111 971
957 but I do know you can get them from Wurth in a box of 50 because I
ordered some a while back to redo the wiring in my engine compartment:

0558 5029 without tab
0558 6010 with tab

The tab is the little clip on the back that locks the terminals into a block
such as the little connectors on the double relay. The side marker don't
requie these but it doesn't hurt to have them either.

If you can't order any from the VW dealer, send me your home address via
pmail and I'll send you some if you have the proper terminal crimper. They
are very small and difficult to crimp without the correct tooling and easily
ruined.
