Subject: [T2]child seats and child comfort

just curious on all those that have children and how you accomidate them in the back seats with car seats? 
 
i know it is diffrent for each state on the laws of how many pounds for certain seats and such to booster seats and all..?
 
ok my thing is my child is big enough for a booster seat which is just the bottom part of a child seat  but is suppose to get a arm belt pulled over and snapped...~!~(like the front seat belts)
 
being the back seat it is not able to use the booster cause there is only lap belts...
being only lap belts she is haveing to ride in the car seat which runs the lap belt in behind the seat always keeping the car seat strapped in .....
the car seat it's self has buckles for her to buckle with....
 
surely the other bus parents can help me figure out how to get her booster seat in there....
will i need to install somehow the front kind of belts in back ?????? wouldnt know where to start or is there another way you all have done this legally and safe..?
 
Safety is my number one concern here of course... ~!~
thanks for all or any help..
peace
Cha
ps down in my state ( SC) the cops take seat belts very seriously... not to mention as well in North Carolina which we visit alot...
want her to be safe but also need her to be able to be comfortable to enjoy the ride also.... the seat looks so uncomfortable.. the car seat shes in right now..~!~
