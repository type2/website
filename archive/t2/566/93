Jerry-rigging isn't necessary to install 3-point seat belts in a bus.  
The threaded holes for the shoulder harness are already in the frame- 
covered by headliner material.  You might be able to feel along the 
pillars to find them... For the middle seat, they're on the c-pillar, 
about 3 inches up from the bottom of the side windows.  For the rear 
seat, the holes are under the window/above the panel, about 2/3 back.  
You just need to acquire a three-point belt.

Another option for the very back seat would be to mount a 3 point
seatbelt... Bottom 2 attach points stock and the shoulder point to the 
top
of the engine box. Takes some metal modification but you get a shoulder 
belt
in the back that way...
