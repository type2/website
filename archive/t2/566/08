HI Karl,

Here's the VW Number:

022 906 021 S

I found the number listed in the type2 library, which tells me it is 
for a 77.

So if I swap in the spare dizzy I will wind up with a stock 77 engine 
running 72-74 exhaust and minus the EGR. But hey, I'm not building this 
for consours d'elegance, I just want to go camping.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
