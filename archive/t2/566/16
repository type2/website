Subject: Brown Wire in Harness at Coil Connection '72 Westy

Cleaning up the wiring in the engine bay and noticed a fairly thick 
brown wire where the power wire to the coil and diag connector wire for 
the coil come out of the harness. Can't find it in the diagram in 
Bentley. Any ideas??

Also, Anyone know a good source for the narrow female spade connector 
terminals as used on the wires for the rear side marker lights? I tried 
to get a 1/4" spade connector on and it did'nt seem to want to go. Any 
help would be appreciated. Thanks- Jeff
