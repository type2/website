Subject: Re: [T2]child seats and child comfort

Since nobody else has responded...

My little girl will turn 1 on Wednesday. So she's not ready for the booster
yet...

But WalMart has lapbelt boosters for under $20. They have an arm that holds
the child in place like a roller coaster ride and the belt goes around the
arm.

Another option for the very back seat would be to mount a 3 point
seatbelt... Bottom 2 attach points stock and the shoulder point to the top
of the engine box. Takes some metal modification but you get a shoulder belt
in the back that way... May want to get a corner seat guide for the shoulder
belt, like many new vehicles use to position the seat belt at shoulder
height while the mounting point is lower.

Let us know what you do (with pics!)
