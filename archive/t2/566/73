These are thoughts that sprang into my mind:

Check the ground attachments under the air distribution box and at the
double relay.

Check that the plug on the back of the fan on top of the engine
compartment is plugged in.

Do run the double relay check procedure from Bently although I doubt this
is the problem.

                             OOK!
