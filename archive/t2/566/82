Here's the direct poop from VW on fuel pressure regulation.

--Fuel tank at least half full .

--Connect pressure gauge US1076 or VW 1318 ( or equivalent) to fuel line
T-piece     ( between left side injectors)

--Turn on ignition and run pump with engine off ( open air sensor flap
or bride terminals 36 and 39 in air flow sensor connection plug)

--Fuel Pressure should be 2.5--2.7 bar       ( 36 to 38 psi. )

--Start engine with gauge still connected.Fuel pressure should be
2.0--2.2 bar ( 28 to 31 psi )

This is Gospel--not the Bentley abridged version--


Hasta,

TK
