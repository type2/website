Greg
Do you still have a site open for Buses of the Corn in Aug 6th - 8th?

I have heard from so many Americans that are coming north , I better book my site NOW!

This looks like it is going to be one of the Best Camping events in Canada this year!
http://www.busesofthecorn.com/register.html

And at that price it will be virtually FREE for the folks with USA dollars!
