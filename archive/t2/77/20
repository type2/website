Subject: Beam me up

Hi All,

Yet another "pithy" title for an issue of concern on
my 73' Westy.  Does anyone have any experience with
rebuilding their beam?  Is there a place to purchase a
remanufactured stock beam? 

I have nearly 200K on the original ball joints and
associated suspension peices.  I want to tighten
things up some and am looking down the road a ways as
I have to keep this bus as my only means of
transportation for at least another two years.

Thanks in advance!
Brian in Salem
