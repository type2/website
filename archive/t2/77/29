Subject: Subject: 75 bus fuel injection ? stalls at idle



>Hello all knowing vw guru's

hello, i'm not all knowing, but i'll try to help

> ok the wifes 75 bus new to us runs good 
when cold 
starts up easy cold but after a while it stalls then
restarts the dwell 
is 
37-38 and drops with rpm.

that doesnt sound right to me. pop your distributor
cap off and look at the points, see if there's any
pitting or metal transfer from one side to the other,
make sure the rubbing block is still there, grease the
shaft, and set the gap to .016" when the rubbing block
is on one of the "lobes".

the bentley manual (CH 5 p72) says the wear limit for
the dwell is 42-58 degrees, and new points should be
set to 44-50 degrees.

when you readjust the points you should also set the
timing with a strobe type dynamic timing light to 5
degrees ATDC with vacuum hoses connected at idle.

the bentley also says that if the dwell reading varies
more than 1 degree at 2000rpm from the idle reading, a
worn distributor shaft is indicated.

this is also a (big) problem. this allows unmetered
air into yer engine, which makes it runs lean, which
makes it run hot, which makes stuff break. fix it now.
unfortunately a new elbow is not available, so you can
try to find a good used one (good luck) or do like i
did and put some heavy sticky goo type stuff on it and
secure it with duct tape. this is not the best method,
but you can prolly seal it up pretty well with some
patience. i used some stuff that was LIKE rubber
cement but much thicker.

>  Could this maybe part of the ploblem or the 
ploblem

i'd say part of the problem. mine leaked so much that
i couldnt get the engine to idle below 1800rpm or so.

> im 
thinking any unregelated air is bad. 

you're right.

>Plu i read the injection is fired 
from 
>the points according to bently.

it is, and you also have a problem at the points,
which is causing injection problems i'm sure. it's not
very hard to confuse that ECM.  also check out your
temp sensors I and II, and do the checks on the AFM
while you're there (make sure engine is COLD when you
check #2) the specs are in the bently, which i just
noticed you've been reading.

>Help before i give up and Weberize this Bus

you'll never get your bus running as good with that
weber as with the original FI. the weber has bad
problems with carb icing because there is no provision
for a manifold preheater. since there's no heater, the
fuel vapor condenses in the manifold and doesnt get
enough fuel to your cylinders, another lean condition.

I bet you dont even know how powerful your bus can be.
it must be a dog to drive.

wow, this turned into a really long response.

the FI is great, the checks are easy if you can use an
ohmmeter and read (the bently). dont waste yer money
on the weber.


peace!
