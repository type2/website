Hi Ian,

Sounds to me as if the parking brake has locked up on one wheel. This has
happened to my bus in the springtime if I have left it sitting for a week or
two. It could also be a bad brake hose that is corroded internally and
unable to release pressure.

The clunking sound you mentioned tells me that it is much more likely to be
the parking brake. I would recommend having someone press as hard as
possible on the (foot-operated) brake pedal and release repeatedly at the
same time that you hit the offending brake drum a few nice hard whacks with
a BFH (very large hammer).  The drums are pretty solid, so don't be afraid
to let out some agression with that hammer.

If this does not loosen it up then you've got to work on replacing the
lines.

Happy trails,
