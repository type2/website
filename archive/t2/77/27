Quoting http://www.type2.com/library/suspens/tmadj.htm :

"The easiest way to check your bus is to park it on a level surface, open=
 the
sliding door, put a carpenter's level on the door sill, =


***put a driver in the driver's seat***,
 =

and read the level. If it is close to level your suspension is fine. (I'm=

assuming that you have equal-sized tires all around, of course!) =


Buses normally sit a bit nose-high without a driver in the driver's seat.=

 =

Be very careful using the rear-view as an indication. =

***In a properly-adjusted bus you _cannot_ see the horizon in the inside
rear-view mirrors. The mirror is positioned higher than the upper edge of=
 the
rear window.*** =


I assumed that my bus was sacked out because I couldn't see the horizon a=
nd
wasted quite a bit of time. If you adjust the bars too high you will end =
up
with strange handling, rapid tire wear, and CV joint/boot damage." =

"The bus is is low to ofset the weight of the up front passenger's"

The bus is supposed to sit flat and level---no bird watching at
night----no looking at the white lines in the rear veiw mirror's----

I had my torsion bar's adjusted to the factory spec's and it is flat and
level----as it was as new----

Later,
