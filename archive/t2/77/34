Subject: Heating possiblities

Hi All,

I was out nosing around the WEB (imagine that:-) and
thought to take a look at what kit plane owners might
use to heat themselves.  I happened across this link
and was wondering if anyone else had had any
experience with this sort of thing:

Lemme' know

Thinking outside the box,
Brian
