Subject: Re: [T2] Welding your VW-braizing?


> I'm pretty familiar with braizing because of bicycle frames- can anyone
comment on or say why braising wouldn't work on small panel holes as it uses
a much lower temp than welding?

Mike, brazing works fine, and it is at a lower temp than true gas welding.
I think it is a dying art in terms of panel welding because migs, although
operating at higher temps when the juice flows, have instant on and off,
unlike a torch, so unless you're reall good, the mig still imparts less
total heat than a brazing torch.

I read a car mag article about sheet metal welding in which a hoary old body
man said he always uses brazing wire in his mig with reversed polarity.  I
presume the brazing wire is silicon-bronze wire.  This would be the best of
both worlds.  Trouble is, i can never find it.
