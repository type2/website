Subject: Re: [T2] Heating possiblities

I may have missed the original post.  But here goes;  The other day at
Advance Auto I saw a 12v ceramic heater that looked like it would be good
for heating up front or at least defrosting the windows.  I plan on at least
trying it if I ev er get my Bus going.
