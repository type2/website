Subject: wheel cease

Hello all,

I have a '72 Kombi in *running* condition. I left it for two or three weeks 
over winter (no extreme cold, just wetness so far as the weather went) and 
now it will not move. The engine will run and sounds and works fine, but it 
is as if there are imaginary blocks behind the drive wheels. I gave it some 
gas in reverse and the right rear went "clunk" and I could feel the 
resistance go away from that wheel. But, no matter what i try the left rear 
is locked. Is it ceased? Could it be transmission or brake related?

Thanks,
- Ian
