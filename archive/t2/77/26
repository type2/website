believe it or not Bus Depot has gotten some "NEW" front beams but they are
Bare, and I mean bare as a babies butt.  but they are new. check with him
on avalibility and price. 

  I recently did my 78 and I got a good beam from BustedBus in Colo. now
my bus is a daily driver and the current beam was in pretty rough shape.

   so i got new torsion arms with new Ball Joints already pressed in and a
new(used) steering gear box. with shipping etc was about $600 if I recall.

   I put the bus up on jackstands and started out, was a little harder
because mine is an automatic and the shift linkage is much harder to get
out, then back in and adjusted, took my time and got it done including new
gear box in a long weekend.   don't forget it will need a front end
alignment soonest!   The beam is "HEAVY" I used a transmission jack to
hoist the old one out and the new one in.  I also did some frame welding
while under there and in the wheel wells so that added to the time. 

   Can really feel the difference.
