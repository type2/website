Subject: warmish startup prob.

'68 Bus runs great. Stock carb with stock elec. choke
hooked up and -- i thot -- adjusted properly.

In warm weather I don't hit the pedal at all and it
starts on first crank. Ahhhh.

For winter starts--down to single digits-- I pump the
pedal once and it starts on first crank. Ahhhh.

But when it is really cold and I only drive 10 minutes
or so (2-5 miles, the VDO temp gauge just starts to
register). i have a hard time restarting for the next
few hours. Usually if I hold the pedal all the way
down while cranking 5 to 15 times, it starts and runs
fine.

But sometimes when it is in some limbo, half-warmed up
state after an hour in the cold, it takes several
long-g-g-g sessions of cranking with the pedal held
down before it fires up (obviously flooded--gas odor).
Xmas eve it took me 20 minutes of cranking and letting
it sit before it came back to life.

Is this diagnostic of a easily fixable choke problem? 

Otherwise, I'm figuring to just live with this as a
delightful little quirk and hope i don't get stuck
somewhere.

Tnx for any guidance.
