 refer to it as the ''hard start problem'' but in reality, it will not crank 
when
 hot. >>

Hot, cold, doesnt matter, it wont crank reguardless of the temp. outside.  

<<Your problem is a major drop in voltage in the wiring. 
 Well, you can go thru every connection in the ignition/starter circuit and 
clean

 you can install a relay at the solenoid. >>

I allredy have the relay in there, and it still wont start.
