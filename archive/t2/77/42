Subject: Re: [T2] Pop top hold downs

 I had the same problem. They ARE different AND the originals on a 72 are a
grey or off white color. The ones you can get aftermarket today are black.
If you aren't restoring its no big deal. Another thing (off topic) is the
water filler tube. Aftermarket ones are grey and they should be white.

Your only hope is to find a donor bus with good ones. It is tough to find a
rear pop top hold down thats not dry rotted. If you find one you can
probably pick me up some original curtains too!!  :)

Hi all,
Just a quick question.
I was on the phone with BusDepot recently purchasing, among other things,
pop top hold downs, (you know, those little rubber & metal things that keep
the top from flying away.)
Well, on my '72 Westy there are 3 of them.  According to the guy at
BusDepot, all 3 hold downs
are *exactly* the same.  But on my bus, the 2 side ones are the same and the
3rd one, nearest
the luggage rack, is different.
Can someone clear this up?  Is the Depot wrong?  If so, where can I get this
3rd/different hold down?
Thanks,
-Paul
