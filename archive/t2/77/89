It's not a job for the faint of heart! It took me 4 or 5 weekends to do =
mine, but then I wasn't in a hurry and I ended up replacing a lot more =
parts than I expected. It *could* be done in a weekend, especially if =
two people tackle it. Follow the link below then the link at the bottom =
of that page for my axle beam experience.
