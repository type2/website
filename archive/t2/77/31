Esteemed volks,

    About the horizon in the rearview mirror:  some busses, mine included
came with a 3" mirror mount whch makes viewing the horizon possible even
with a sagging rear end.

Quoting http://www.type2.com/library/suspens/tmadj.htm :

"The easiest way to check your bus is to park it on a level surface, open
the
sliding door, put a carpenter's level on the door sill,

***put a driver in the driver's seat***,

and read the level. If it is close to level your suspension is fine. (I'm
assuming that you have equal-sized tires all around, of course!)

Buses normally sit a bit nose-high without a driver in the driver's seat.

Be very careful using the rear-view as an indication.
***In a properly-adjusted bus you _cannot_ see the horizon in the inside
rear-view mirrors. The mirror is positioned higher than the upper edge of
the
rear window.***

I assumed that my bus was sacked out because I couldn't see the horizon and
wasted quite a bit of time. If you adjust the bars too high you will end up
with strange handling, rapid tire wear, and CV joint/boot damage."

"The bus is is low to ofset the weight of the up front passenger's"

The bus is supposed to sit flat and level---no bird watching at
night----no looking at the white lines in the rear veiw mirror's----

I had my torsion bar's adjusted to the factory spec's and it is flat and
level----as it was as new----

Later,
