I believe it's Bus Depot that carries the black covers and the 
white-with-black-piping covers. They fit very nicely, and it would be quite 
easy to spraypaint a vw logo on (with a carefully crafted stensil) or even 
take a real metal emblem and bolt it on. They're pretty cheap, as I recall, 
and look great.
