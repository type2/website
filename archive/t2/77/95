PDFs can be read, using Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.0, on Palm, PocketPC, Windows
3.1 through Windows XP, 680x0-based Macs, PowerPC Macs running systems 7.5.3
to Mac OS X, Linux, Sun Solaris (both the X86 and SPARC versions), SGI Irix,
IBM AIX, HP-UX, DEC Unix and OS/2 Warp. That's pretty much all the computers
in common use today.

It's easier than you think; if you have Adobe Illustrator 9 they open right
up. It's a touch harder if the author set the "do not modify" flag, but it's
still doable.

Depends on your Distiller version. Everyone who distills PDFs needs Acrobat
5; we distilled a PostScript file in Distiller 4 and got a 22.5MB PDF, then
distilled the same PostScript file in Distiller 5 and got a 2.1MB PDF.
