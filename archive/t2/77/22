Neat trick I just learned about a month and a half ago: MIG wire (22 gauge
is good) makes outstanding filler metal for oxyacetylene welding of sheet
metal. Be sure to get MIG wire, which is all steel, and not flux-core wire.

Metal warps because you use too much heat on it. You use too much heat
because coat hanger or welding rod needs so much more heat than the metal
does. Now, get some MIG wire that's about the same gauge as your base metal,
and the two melt at about the same rate. It makes such a pretty weld, with
minimal distortion of the base metal.

Another neat trick if you've got little bitty holes in your window frames:
grind the metal nice and shiny, use a centerpunch to kinda roll in the hole
just enough to fit a 1/8" mild steel welding rod in it (it should take a
little doing to get the rod in; that way you know you have a good close fit)
then weld it in with MIG wire. Use your angle grinder to smooth it up and
you're done.
