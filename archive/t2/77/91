Subject: Re: [T2] Heating possiblities why not to use header wrap

HEader wrap has been pretty much abandoned by serious racers. The reason,  it
is so effective that it results in a header that reaches near molten
temperatures and seriously shortens its life span.  for this reason i would
advise not wrapping every square inch of your exhaust system with it, not to
mention that would get very expensive.  I personally would limit my use of the
stuff to the box itself, not the exhaust pipes at all, and the tubes that go
from exchanger to the flappers, this should make a big difference and not
causes too many unintended problems.
and of course you may remember my experience with the roofing patch material
and why i cringe at the sight of it......
Jamie, warm and toasty with stock early style heat in 78 westy.
