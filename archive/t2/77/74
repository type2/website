Subject: Re: [T2] Welding your VW-braizing?

Brazing is a quick way to attatch panel's and do repair work, except for
the fact that primer, and paint doesn't stick to the brass, unless the
area is acid etched primed, with zinc chromate------

Brazing is also a soft weld--not as strong as using steel wire----

Mig welding by far is the fastest, cleanest, strongest weld you can get
for body work.

Mike, brazing works fine, and it is at a lower temp than true gas
welding. I think it is a dying art in terms of panel welding because
migs, although operating at higher temps when the juice flows, have
instant on and off, unlike a torch, so unless you're reall good, the mig
still imparts less total heat than a brazing torch. 
I read a car mag article about sheet metal welding in which a hoary old
body man said he always uses brazing wire in his mig with reversed
polarity. I presume the brazing wire is silicon-bronze wire. This would
be the best of both worlds. Trouble is, i can never find it.
