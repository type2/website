But with the recent thread, I am interested in fixing this.  So do tell, how would one go about adjusting hte rear torsion bars to relieve the saggy rear syndrome??

On this note.. Does the height affect the camber of the rear tires? I ve
seen busses up too high and they always ssem to have negative camber and
my saggy butt has too much. Im not reall understanding it but observation
seems to suggest a correlation.
