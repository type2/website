When I asked my local shop to adjust the torsion bars to level my 71 Westy,
he was reluctant to do so, afraid of breaking the torsion bars.  Instead, he
installed KYB coil spring over shocks.  I remember some flaming and general
disdain for this treatment of the problem, but I've had them for about 15
years now and no problems ever.  The handling of the bus was markedly
improved, due to the higher overall spring rate in the rear, which lessened
the body roll during cornering.

Good point about CV joint wear, though.
