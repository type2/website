There is free autocad veiwing software available from autodesk. it is called
Volo Veiw.  you can download it for nothing or send them $5 for a CD.  it is
great for veiwing and it won't let you make changes which is great to give
salesman or customers.

Even though .pdf files may not work on all platforms, I think it is a nice
option for people to have on the web. Especially since the acrobat reader is
free and AutoCAD is not. The drawings would get used more if more people
could see them. Some drawings do not need to be plotted, measurements and a
good drawing may be enough. Just my 2 cents worth, since I cannot find my
copy of AutoCAD to install and view these drawings.
