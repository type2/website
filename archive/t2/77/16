	Great time to get a mig welder and a Makita grinder.  Also a
sandblaster.
	Not as hard as you'd think.  If it is seriously holey, then maybe a
patch
	panel is advisable.  For holes of about nickel size, you can cut
little
	patches with tin snips, and tack a piece of coat hanger on to use a
s a
	handle for positioning.  Flap discs in the Makita give you a
beautiful
	smooth surface.  Finish with a hand file.

At some time in the past someone on the list mentioned drilling drain holes
in this lip to keep rust from reappearing.  I think a hole in each corner is
a good idea and frankly I'm a little surprised VW never did it.  I've found
that Karmann did just that in my Ghia.  There is a hole in each lower corner
of the windshield frame with a little bit of some kind of dope around it to
keep the hole itself from developing rust.  I'm getting ready to replace the
windshield rubber in my Bus and I plan drill the holes, sand the lower lip
down and put a coating of fiberglass resin over the whole area to prevent
problems in the future.  I've seen too many Busses with this problem to want
to risk mine developing problems in the future.
