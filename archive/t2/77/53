Matty,

The answer is really... "Yes, but WHY?"

The problem with resistance heat in a 12v system is that you run into
physical limits very quickly.

The controlling equasion is

volts x amps = watts

The bus comes with a 45 amp alternator.  If you look around, spend the
bux, there was a 70 that will fit.

12 volts x 70 amps = 840 watts

OK, spend the big bux, get a welder to fab a mount for the biggest you can
shoehorn in... a 150 amp diesel alt!

now.... 12 volts x 150 amps = 1800 watts!!!!

Go into your bathroom, read the label on your blow dryer.  I'll bet it is
at *least* 1500 watts!  So... after sepending all that money, you have
achieved enough power to run the car, a stereo, and *A HAIR DRYER*

REAL heat, you start with 220 volts and 20 amps!

220 x 20 = 4400 watts!

NOW you have heat!

IMHO, you cannot get decent heat off of electrical resistance heating at
12V.  Sorry.
