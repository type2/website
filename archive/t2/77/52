Subject: Re: [T2] Heating possiblities

They already exist.  Homebrew, mostly.  Many of those guys use standard 
110V ~1500W heaters in their cars (they work fine on DC), BUT they run 
them off of their enormous main battery packs (typically 96-144V (-at-) 100+ 
amp-hours).  In cold climates, not only do they have to run the electric 
heaters, but they also have to use battery pack heaters.  This is a BIG 
problem for electric propulsion and cuts down on the range of the 
vehicles significantly.  I think the answer may be to use a heat pump 
driven by the main electric motor.  But the bottom line, as others have 
said, is that it just isn't do-able with one or two batteries and 
alternator-charging.  Engine heat is the most efficient (since it is 
"free") and failing that, auxiliary gas heat is the only reasonable 
option.
