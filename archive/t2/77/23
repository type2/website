Subject: Re: [T2] Beam me up

Brian,
I completely rebuilt my beam in the process of doing the swap into my '60
Double Cab.
You say... "nice, but I'm talking about a '73, not a '60.  Different
beasts"
Yes but no.
My beam was from a '69 and trailing arms out, were from a '79  (avg =
'74?)
I purchased new ball joints from Bus Depot along with rubber seals, brake
rebuild kits,  and any other disposable parts (rubber snubbers).
My steering dampner came out of a junkyard bus, still worked fine.
I tore it all apart, cleaned and degreased the beam, primered and then
painted it.
I took the torsion arms to a local VW mechanic and he pressed the old ball
joints out and new ones in for $20.  The catch being, I left the bare arms
there for him to get at when he was slow.  About a week later, he called
saying they are ready.  (if this is a daily driver, you could pull arms
from a bus in the junk yard to do the rebuild and have them ready to go
when you are)

Everything went back quite easily, the torsion arms were fun to get back
in place off of the bus, but I was able to do it all myself.

I wheeled the new beam, complete from spindle to spindle, including discs
and calipers out to my truck and had two friends help me lift it into the
back of the truck.

Another friend lent me the use of his hoist for the day.

I put the truck on the hoist and removed everything holding it in place
except the four bolts on each side and the clutch cable...woops (ended up
having to cut the cable, due to pressure on it)

I then lowered the hoist to where the drums were just 1/2" above the
garage floor and removed the remaining bolts.

I slowly tapped the old beam off and it gently rested on the floor.

Raised the truck up and out with the old beam on a cart.

The area was prepped for the rebuilt beam
I took a step and put bearing grease on the surfaces where the beam
flanges ride on the frame and also on the beam flanges.

Lowered the truck and lined up the beam until the holes were all lined
up.  I got one bolt in on each side to aid the process.

Finished bolting everything up and was done.

Note that I was able to do the entire swap single handedly with the use of
the hoist.  I had the weekend before been involved in a run in with a
runaway vehicle and was smashed into the wall of the garage and messed up
my left shoulder.  So when I say single handedly, I mean that literally
not figuratavely.  The left arm was just kinda gimpy and not good for much
of anything.

I mention all the above to drive home the ease at which this job is
accomplished with the use of a hoist.
If you have a set of torsion arms rebuilt, all the replacement parts on
hand, a hoist available and an able bodied buddy, you could do the drop,
rebuild and install in a good 6 hour Saturday.

Hope this helps,

Scott
