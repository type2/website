Not to knock you guys who are talented enough to gas weld but another
neat trick is to just MIG it.  A neat trick for that BTW in this circumstance
is to back up the area to be welded if you can with a piece of copper, I have
several pieces of 1/4"x1" copper bar stock bent into various shapes of many
lengths to reach up behind and back up areas to repair pinholes.

Whoever mentioned the flapper discs though, those things are another
relatively recent and outstanding innovation.  Has anybody tried the Harbor
Freight ones at 3 for $9.99 as paying $6.50 each locally is getting a bit
old.
