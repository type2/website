Matty, Biggest deep-cycle batt. you can put under your rear seat: 210 amp 
hours. Heater will deplete this in 1.4 hrs.(210 amp hrs. is "rated", it ain't 
what you're gonna get out of it in the real world) Time to recharge off of a 
55amp. alt with 3 batts (-at-) 2300rpm constant speed, 10.73 hours, no load other 
than to charge all three batts. (-at-) ambient temp of 49 deg. f. Moral of the 
story: You can't violate the Laws of Physics. Why doesn't anybody get this? 
Electric heat for a bus is just not doable. If it were, the factory would 
have already done so.
