Subject: Re: [T2] Heating possiblities

This electric heater sounds like madness to me, for the reasons already 
described; it just uses too much heat for too little output. You may as well 
buy a power inverter and run a normal plug-in space heater; it would cost 
about the same and let you use other things. Maybe, if you had a high-end 
alternator; a small heater; and turned off every other accessory, it would 
even work... ;)

Seems to me, that I've seen gas heaters go for under $200 used ($600 new!), 
so my plan is to hold out until I find a used one or can afford a new one. 
Well vented propane heaters seem like a valid option, too. With a little 
clever work, you could even get it to run off the propane tank you already 
have (if you're driving a full-equiped westy, anyway).
