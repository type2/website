Subject: Bad Camber (no G) - related to saggy butt

Regardless of proper angle of the bus, my saggy-reared '71 Westy has inward-leaning camber on the rear wheels.  Anyone else have this in conjunction with 
perceived sag?  It looks just like you'd expect an overloaded swing-axle bus to look.  Does not appear to be resulting in uneven tire wear, though.
