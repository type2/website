Gary,

WOW! Steampunk!! That is really inventive. It brings up all sorts of trim
ideas: I wonder if there's anyone who sells the dash gadgets with a
copper/bronze finish. Copper/bronze knobs on the radio? Tufted leather seat
covers, or even velvet? Would the steam whistle work with one of those
compressed cans of air that you clean electronics with? really cool.
