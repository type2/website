Subject: E-brake to brake shoe pivot pin

The pin that connects the e-brake mechanism to the rear brake shoe  
has disintegrated long ago. I have been replacing these with a M8  
bolt, washer, nut, and thread locker. I have usually also peened the  
nut into place. However, now I had one come loose twice in about 12  
months. Not good and horrible scratching noises when parts get caught  
between the shoes and drum ...

Anyway, ETKA says NLA and thus lists no part number. Does anyone  
still have the OEM pins and the "circlip"-looking thing that keeps  
them in place? If not, what is an acceptable replacement?

Marcus
