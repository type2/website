Subject: Engine running too hot

Hello all,

I just came back from my first trip after my engine overhaul (2.0l
enigne with brand new heads and clutch). Drove from Southern Germany to
Southern France (Provence) and back without any problems (1600 miles
total). Since I added a CHT gauge (from DakotaDigital), I learned a lot
about not to rely on an oil temperature gauge! Oil temp was always below
220F wich I consider as normal. The bus runs good, but I think CHT is
too hot. Sometimes I can barely keep it at 390 F by running only 55 mph.
Outside temperature was around 77 F. I tried my very best to keep it
that cool, wich is kind of hard in dense traffic on the highway. The
engine feels very powerful, but I can only barely touch the throttle. I
think 65 mph should be a reasonable driving speed on level ground. When
looking in the engine compartment, the engine felt absolutely cool to
the touch, dipstick was not hot at all. Why are the head temps so high?
Engine tin is all in place, as well as the thermostat and engine seal.
Timing and valve play in specs. Standard compression ratio and rebuilt
carbs. I just can't think of anything else than vacuum leaks, but I
replaced all seals on the intake and all hoses are new, too.
Brake-booster? My heat exchangers are rather rusty, but I doubt that
they account for this problem. Will an additional oil cooler help in
lowering head temps?
Help is always greatly appreciated, especially since I don't want to
overheat the new heads.
Cheers,
Timo
