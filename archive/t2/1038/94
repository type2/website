Subject: Re: [T2] Caliper repair kit issue

I am in the process of replacing the calipers on my 71 bus and the ones 
I removed were ATe.  One caliper had dust boots held with the retaining 
rings and one caliper did NOT have the metal rings.  I bought rebuilt 
calipers; they are ATe and the 4 dust boots are held with retaining 
rings as shown in your picture <http://www.jnar.com/avatar/IMG_6408.jpg>.
