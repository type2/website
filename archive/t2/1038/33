Subject: Running funny :(

Hey guys.. Any idea what would make #3 run funny? I mean i can pull the plug
wire to it and it only makes a "hair" Difference. Pull any of the other plug
wires and the rpm's drop consideribly. Another reason i suspect something
wierd is going on there, i just did the valves again and put electronic
ignition in too. But the engine isnt "smooth" when idling it shakes a
little, and if i pull the wire to #1 it shakes less which makes me think
number 3 isnt firing well.. is my reasoning here correct??? I have not
replaced my cap as of yet, but will try to do so soon. I am getting spark to
# 3 at least, i can pull the wire off the cap and see spark, and it seems to
be going through the wire as if i go back and forth ie: on and off i can get
the exhaust to "pop" any ideas as to why #3 is being goofy let me know.. its
a 72 bus, 1.8 litre, Dual Carbs (solex 32's rejetted)

Thanks in Advance,
                    Jason
