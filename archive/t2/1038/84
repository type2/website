Subject: AMC heads

Has anyone put AMC heads on a standard type 4 engine and had to change the
push rod lenghts?
Local mechanic has put new heads on my standard engine, tappet gap set at
6thou. But sound little noisy. So Im assuming the push rod lenghts are not
correct lenght anymore.
Why? AMC heads not the same as the originals?
