Subject: ok lets see here..

 ok, So I looked at the van, pulled the valve cover off, started it, looks
kinda like maybe the valve closes to the front of the van on the drivers
side may not be opening enough?? im not 100% sure, its getting dark, but i
will look more tomorrow, Im using rotella, good oil.. Drive 65 only on the
freeway 40 miles each way a 4 days a week, matched lifters and cam.. it
seems a little noisy on the drivers side.. little bit of a tick.. I just did
the valves the other day.. tick is quieter but still there.. I dont want to
have to replace another cam dangit.. I am going to have to turn it over by
hand tomorrow and see how much lift im getting.. grrr :( Maybe i need to
build this 2.0 sooner than i thought.. This engine only has like 4500 miles
on it..
