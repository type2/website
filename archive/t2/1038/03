Subject: Buses by the Beach Thursday Night "Tasting" Update

Just talked to those knuckleheads on the cell phone at Grand Rogue with the
"beer tasting" in progress. They put me on speaker phone and made fun of me
for not being there.  How much beer does one have to "taste" before one gets
rude?

16 buses there so far and they sounded like they were having fun!

I just spent the last couple of hours giving the buses the once over for the
2 hour jaunt up north and packing in vital supplies for the weekend.  Also,
tightened up our Saturday Raffle list and we now are up to 52 very cool VW
related items to include the 60th Anniversary Bulli Book, a cool Specialized
Kids Mountain Bike, a "just Kampers" cutlery set for 26 (Thanks, Busdepot!)
and other great stuff.

See y'all at Grand Rogue tomorrow as soon as we can get there!
