I'll definitely check that.

I already did this when installing the sensor (engine was out on a stand
anyway). Hopefully, I don't have to drop it again.

That's what I think, too. But since I happen to have a big Mercedes oil
cooler and the mounting adapter for the oil filter, I'll just install it
to have one less thing to worry about.

I think it's correct, too, since I tested it on boiling water. I can't
check it on ice, since it can't measure below outside temperature.

Still, I want to feel good about the rebuilt engine. I did some thorough
testing yesterday and noticed two strange things (all the following is
very subjective, so please excuse the vague descriptions): When I
accelerate in fourth gear (e.g. from 40 to 60 mph), sometimes the
throttle is just a little bit harder to open and the bus will accelerate
just a little bit slower. It also sounds sort-of louder and not that
aggressive/powerful. If this is the case, when I slowly release the
throttle to keep the speed at, say 60 mph, it will definitley run up to
20 F hotter than on all the other occasions (throttle opens easily,
engine sounds powerful, etc). I don't know what else to test, so if
anyone had similar problems and knows what I mean by this odd
descriptions, please share your thoughts.
Cheers, Timo
