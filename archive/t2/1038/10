Subject: Brake Proportioning Valve?

I've had a braking quirk for close to a year now, it's gotten worse lately, and I suspect it's the proportioning valve...

The brake system was rebuilt by me a couple of years ago (original steel lines and p-valve), all the bugs worked out, and is properly adjusted and maintained.  

I've replaced the booster, know what that failure-mode feels like, and this is not it.

When I press the brake one of three things happens:

1) Normal Range of motion, feel, and braking.

2) Early resistance feel with braking action, followed by a "breakthrough" to full range of motion and normal braking.

3) Early resistance feel with normal braking at less-than-normal range of motion. This has been more common lately.

I suspect the braking action always seems normal because I'm not getting on it hard, so the fronts can do the job alone.

Acceleration/deceleration sometimes causes the system to switch modes, so I'm thinking the p-valve is only allowing fluid to the rear soometimes.

What do you guys think?  

Anyone know of a test before buy a new p-valve?

TIA...
