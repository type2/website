Talk about a day of ups and downs! After a VERY long night at Bandimere
Speedway watching Jet cars do 285 MPH, I got up this morning exhausted.

My wife had a few things that we needed to do, so we of course decided to
take Zoey since she can carry large boxes. Well me being the sneaky guy I
am, I forced her to drive. Bare in mind, my wife grew up in Hawaii and has
never driven a car older than 1998 let alone one without power EVERYTHING,
so needless to say, this was going to be a new experience for her.

Long story short, she not only drove the bus like a pro (let's face it, they
are very quirky vehicles)  but she told me that she had more FUN than she
ever imagined she would. I was sooooo excited.  This  is just one of a small
like of things I have introduced my wife to since we met. First I taught her
how to drive stick, now the bus. Next it will be a motorcycle.

So as I am cleaning some stuff off the driveway, my neighbor asks me if I
went to the VW "convention" today. My first response was a Tim Allen like
"R" of confusion and interest. Then she mentioned Columbine HS and I
realized DAAAAAAAHHHHH I missed VWs on the Green!!!! I am still ticked about
that.

Oh well. At least I still have the Nu-Vintage Bug-In at Bandimere to go to!
And for any of the Colorado boys, please let me know if you are planning on
going so we can all carabus.

I'm just happy that my wifey enjoyed driving the bus today... gives me a
little tickle inside.
