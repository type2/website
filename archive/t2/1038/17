Subject: Re: [T2] Lifters

Hi Jason

Maybe I missed the first part of the story but one thing is important: 
lifters and cam wear together and shall not be mixed.

When you repair an engine and you have to get back each lifter to the 
position it was before dismantling.  Because where is different for each 
position and have to keep it "matched".

In the same thinking, new lifters shall not go on used cam or new cam shall 
not go with old lifters.

Most of the time, lifters show wear and are concave.  A good lifter shall be 
slighly convex to help it turn slowly in its bore with engine running.  I 
use the side of a lifter as a straight edge on the bottom of the lifter I 
want to check and look at the "cave" using a back lighting.

Now, about running hyd on non-hydr or versi-versa, I know some did it but I 
do not know the real impact on performance.

What I already read about was that the grind was different hydraulic beeing 
more gradual.

I'm pretty sure more comments will come soon.
