Subject: Re: [T2] Brake issues on 71 Westy

Feel the wheels for temp. Your wheels are excellent
heatsinks. Often when one side grabs it is because the
other side is dragging and has faded from heat
buildup. If the right side is dragging, it could very
well be from deteriorated flex hoses. If you have not
replaced them ever, now's a good time to do all of
'em. -BaH

 a little to the left ... Confusing as on a 71 the
 disk brakes are self
 adjusting.
 
 2.) I hit the brakes hard yesterday and the left
 front grabbed (locked up for
 a second) and left some rubber on the road. The
 right one didn't.
