I had a weber 32/36 carb for some years with the stock vacuum advance
distributor. The vacuum advance worked but I had trouble getting the idle
speed low enough to prevent a small amount of advance at idle.

A possible cause of the overheating could be vacuum leaks. Possible locations
include where the manifolds join the head and the rubber boots. As you do not
have a vacuum advance connected is the vacuum port blocked off?
I had a lot of trouble identifying the location of leaks when I have had them.
I knew there was a problem because removing the spark plug lead from the
affected cylinder when the engine was idling caused less of a drop in the revs
than removing the other leads. The spark plug on the affected cyliner was also
paler than the others.
