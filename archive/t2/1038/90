Subject: Caliper repair kit issue

Hello to you all.

I've recently bought from an Ebay.de online shop a pair of caliper repair kits
with the pistons I've showed on a previous message.
Althoug the german seller stated on the ebay shop that the repair kits were
for use on ATE system I think they are not.

Here's a picture of them, already on my calipers (the strange thing is that
they do fit really nice):

but, looking to this technical drawing from Vw, we can see that the ATE system
doesn't have that metal piece around the outer seal:

and for example, at Justkampes.co.uk there are two kits available:

Have I really been deceived by the seller?
Could they be wrong?
If I still use the calipers with these repair kits, will I have any problems
in a near future?

Thank you all.
Cheers from Lisbon, Portugal.
