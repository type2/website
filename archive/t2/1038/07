Subject: RE: Air Filter for 71 VW Kombi

If your 71 bus has it's original 1600 cc engine with 34PICT-3 carb, then it should have an oil bath air cleaner mounted on the roundish?metal platform welded to the bus, to the right of the engine.? There is a plastic duct that connects the air cleaner outlet to the?carb air inlet.? http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=211129615E

There are also evap. and breather hoses that connect to the air cleaner.?

All of these parts except the air cleaner are available new from the various online vendors.? Check "The Samba" for the air cleaner.

As an interrim solution, you could probably find a pleated paper type filter that would fit on top of your carburetor, but it will have to be fairly small as there is not much space between the top of the carb and the roof of the engine bay.? I suggest this as an interim solution only, because I think the oil bath air cleaner provides much better filtering and engine protection.?
