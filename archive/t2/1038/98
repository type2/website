there is a gear pressed on a shaft that connects the motor to the
wipers, mine broke loose with the same symptoms as you describe.

I fixed it by taking it apart and cleaning the gear, shredded some
steelwool and mixed it with some PBweld and stuffed the mix inand
around the shaft.  it held for about 7-8years until the motor failed
and I replaced the entire unit

good luck is a real bear to get in and out but is easy to work on when
out of the bus
