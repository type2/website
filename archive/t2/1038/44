Subject: Running Funny :(

Ok, Update, So im tired.. just got off work at 5 am.. but i changed my  
intake manifold gaskets and no leaks there at all. Still runs fine,  
but like i can disconnect 1 and 3 and it still runs ok. but if i put  
those back and disconnect 2 and 4 it dies. Like 3 isnt firing... It IS  
getting spark because as its running i can pull 3 off and place it  
near the cap and get a POP. I am gonna sleep for a while now but I am  
going to check the valves on 3 when the engine has had a chance to  
cool off. grrr.. I wish my hydraulic lifters would just get here...

Jason
