Not really.  Mine doesn't work and I just remove the hot air tube in the
summertime, closing the hole in the tin with a plug.  When the weather
cools off I reinstall the tube.  Many cars of the era actually had a
manually-operated flap with summer and winter settings

That controls temperature with airflow.  Slow airflow gets warmed air for
better drivability.  Fast airflow gets cooler air.
