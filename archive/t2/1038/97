Subject: Wiper Motor Spins

Got some things done on P-II this weekend: new cup-holder, replaced the horn slip ring and the  T-signal switch since both the ring and the contact on the switch were worn out, R&Red the RR side window and vent window, and installed the body trim panel that goes below the RR windows.  


The vent window was replaced with a non-rusted one, the big window seal was torn, and the body panel cannot be installed with the windows in place...at least I had a good reason to remove both windows.  I put new rubber on the vent window...major PITA, but the both windosw installed easily, probably because it was the second time around.

Of course, as soon as you get ahead something breaks...

The windhsield wipers stopped working...they move freely (still synchronized) by hand and you can hear the motor spinning, but no motion.  The archives are pretty sparse on this...is there a nut or something that can be tightened, or is there more too it than that? I assume it's hard to get to...

TIA,
