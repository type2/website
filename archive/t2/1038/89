Hello Martin,

I am not sure that you would have any power increase by switching to a dp. If you were going to switch, you would have to replace the heads and both manifolds for your carb. You would also have to check to see if you have 8mm studs or 10mm studs. I don't know if you would need to replace any of your engine tin. I am sure that other list members can comment on that. I personally would not change it to a dp. I have heard that dp heads are more likely to crack than sp are. The advantages of dp are that the heads are usually easier to find and are cheeper. DP are used more often in new rebuilds and can be bought brand new instead of rebuilt like most sp heads. It is a personal preference. 

WHat kind of issues are you having with the vacuum and the brake booster?
