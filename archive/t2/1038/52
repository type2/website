Subject: 71 West Brake and Turn Signal Lights

I got this 71 Westy a little while back from a guy for impounding fees.  The
body is in good shape and so is the interior.  Bad news is that the ignition
switch had been previously drilled out (lost the keys) and the motor was shot.
Well I finally got a motor in it and now is the time to tackle the electrical
system which had been hacked (after all the P.O. started it with a toggle
switch to put it in the "ON" position and then touching the starter wire to
the switch.

In any event, I am having problems with the brake lights and turn signals.  I
have followed the electrical schematics but some things really don't seem to
match.  Does anyone out there have pictures of your fuse panel and where the
relays are mounted to the bottom.  I don't know if the relays are in the right
place or what.

In any event, headlights work.  Back-up lights work.  On rear running light
works.  No turn signals and no brake lights.

Suggestions?

Thanks,

Michael Martin, Montevallo, Alabama
