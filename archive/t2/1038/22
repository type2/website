Hi Volks,

I had the day off work today, and since it was nice weather outside I
elected to spend some quality time working on a dual-carb engine for my
Dad's project bus. But that went off the rails when I kept tripping
on the spare jump-seats that I brought back from EveryBus. So I thought 
I might as well get them installed.

The installation was very straightforward. It required 2 holes per seat
to be drilled into the floor, and 4 holes per seat drilled into the
fender well. The holes in the fender wells are a bit troublesome as it
can be hard to fit nuts onto the bolts sticking through the seat-base,
but once you get that taken care of you're good to go.

These seats would work equally well on an early or late bay; the
bulkheads behind the seats would not be a problem.

I'll miss the storage under the rear-facing seat, but the increase in
passenger capacity and the comfort of my passengers will make up for it. 
Plus these seats are easily removed when I need the extra space.

Here are the  pics I know you're craving.
