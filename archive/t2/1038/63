Subject: Brake issues on 71 Westy

1.) When you come to a stop sign, the last 10 feet or so the bus wants to pull
a little to the left ... Confusing as on a 71 the disk brakes are self
adjusting.

2.) I hit the brakes hard yesterday and the left front grabbed (locked up for
a second) and left some rubber on the road. The right one didn't.

In the last 6 months I've:


I changed the brake reservoir behind the seat ( it was cracked) and bled the
system

I replaced the right rear cylinder as it was leaking and installed new brake
shoes on both rear  wheels...

no leaks anywhere in the system.... Thoughts

Thanks,
Trey
