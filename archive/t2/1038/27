And if you bugger up the Phillips head screw, you should just drill
out the head of the screw .

Say, how did you expect to get this engine lid INSTALLED on your vehicle???

Don't give me this 'installation is the reverse of removal' deal, either....

(Something tells me we will soon be seeing a post that asks 'What size
is the Phillips head screw. . .')
