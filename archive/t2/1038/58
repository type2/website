Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust,   differences in ports

Hi Sid,

WHo said it wasn't?

It was merely unavailable in North America, thanks to decreased 
emissions legislation. Other markets like Europe and Australia continued 
to offer dual carbs; though I can't say whether they stayed with the big 
sodium valves or not.

The FI engines started using smaller intake valves in 1975 to improve 
low-end torque. I dunno what the reasoning was behind the change to the 
exhaust port. Perhaps it was thought that the square port would increase 
the flow of the exhaust out of the head, and thus help reduce head temps.

Happy Trails,
