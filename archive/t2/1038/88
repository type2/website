Subject: RE: [T2] 1776 sp to dp conversion

The intake manifold wouldn't really be an issue for me since I could reuse
what was with my 1600dp that came with the Westy (That engine, however, was
completely shot and that is why I am using the 1776sp that I found).  As far
as engine tin, I am curious how that would be an issue since the tin I am
currently using on the 1776sp is the old tin that was used on the 1600dp that
I previously had (for the most part).

I don't want to go with a head replacement on this 1776sp to make it a dp if
there isn't much return (that is if I can get the brakes to work a little
better given my current brake booster issue...I'm not sure I am getting enough
vacuum volume with the sp intake).
