Subject: Smells

After driving my bus with a 2.0 and progressive carb for about 15 
minutes at 45-55 MPH, the cabin starts to smell gassy. I'm guessing its 
just running rich, but the other problem is that its also running hot, 
which would make it seem more on the lean side. I'm in the process of 
deciding which set of dual carbs to order soon, and when I do I'll set 
the timing right before I install them and see if this fixes the 
problems. Any other ideas?
