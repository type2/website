Ditto- The daughter's 75 (with stock cam never removed and new hydraulic 
setup) gets 22 mpg (with 091 tranny) driving flat out (65mph) from 
Savannah to NJ; been doing that for 4 years of college 4 times a year.
It was rebuilt (heads,top end plus rod bearings 6 years ago and has gone 
  about 50K.
