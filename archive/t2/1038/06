Subject: Re: [T2] Air filter for 71 VW Kombi

You're right about this.  I wouldn't run my engine for any non-trivial  
(I'm saying anything more than a few minutes) amount of time without  
an air filter.  I'm no expert but it can't be good to allow dust to  
get into your carb and subsequently into the valves and combustion  
chambers.

It would help the list to help you if you'd inform the list of the  
specs for your bus.  Year, engine modifications, etc.  Most  
importantly perhaps in this context is the type of carburetor you're  
running.

If you're running an aftermarket Weber carb you can pick up a filter  
kit for it from any local auto parts store.  K&N brand pleated filters  
are what I mostly see on these.  I don't know about the original  
equipment filters for carb'd busses.

Good luck!
