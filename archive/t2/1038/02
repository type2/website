Subject: Headliner

"Can anyone think of any reasons why I couldn't take a new-unopened
headliner for a 79 deluxe, and put it in my 75 deluxe sunroof transporter? "

I believe that the metal bows that hold up the headliner are in different
locations on the sunroof models.  Also, if you cut a hole in the headliner
for the sunroof, you'll need to  leave enough of the liner around the hole
to glue up around the sunroof opening, you wouldn't have enough left over to
cover the sunroof panel.  Again, the sliding sunroof headliner piece
has loops stitched in for the 3 metal bows of it's own.  I don't think it
would work well - maybe you could trade with someone on the list for the
correct headliner?
