I think that your gauge is correct, and your engine is NOT too hot.

Almost all of the information you will find on the web about head 
temperatures was gathered using one of the highly inaccurate VDO CHT 
gauges. I installed a Datasensor QS PID controller to use as a CHT 
gauge, along with a Type E thermocouple. That combo is spec'd for about 
7F accuracy at 400F, but I'm sure it's much better than that - it's 
right on in ice water and boiling water.

This is on an '81 Vanagon, but same 2.0 engine. On a flat road at 
highway speeds, I'll get CHT readings in the low 400s. If I'm really 
gentle, I can get it to stay just under 400F, as you've observed. The 
engine has never felt or smelled hot, before or after I installed the 
gauge. I didn't worry about overheating before, so I'm not going to 
worry about it now just because the gauge shows hotter than a VDO one.
