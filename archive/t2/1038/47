Subject: Re: 71 air cleaner

I watched to see if the warm air flap opened today, and, as far as I could  
tell, with the engine at operating temperature, it stayed in the closed (i.e.,  
all warm air from the preheat tube) position.  I'm guessing that the  
thermostat is inop.  Is this an intolerable condition?  It's probably  been that way 
since I've owned my bus (24 years).  Is there a "hippy fix"  that would work, 
at least temporarily, using a thermostat made for some other  purpose?  
Anybody got a working 71 air cleaner warm air thermostat.?
 
Also, just downstream of the warm air flap in the air cleaner, there  is 
another, counterweighted gravity damper.  Whazzatfor?
