Remember that the CHT gauge only measures the temperature of the
cylinder it is mounted on. I have had very similar symptoms to you when
only the CHT cylinder had a problem. I dropped the head temp
significantly by moving the sensor ring to another cylinder! In my case
I had two problems. Firstly the cylinder (#3) had a vacuum leak.
Secondly the sensor ring had jammed slightly askew allowing exhaust gas
to sneak up the spark plug threads. The first problem was initially
identified by removing the spark plug leads one at a time from the
idling engine to see what difference it made in each case. Removing #3
lead had much less effect than the other three. The exhaust gas leak was
identified by removing the (cold) spark plug and examining the sensor
ring and the spark plug hole. Both were black. I got the sensor ring to
sit properly by a combination of drilling a groove down the side of the
recess the spark plug sits in and by carefully rebending the bit where
the wires join to the sensor ring.

As I understand it, oil and head temperatures and largely independent so
adding an additional oil cooler won't help much.
