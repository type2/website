Subject: RE: [T2] E-brake to brake shoe pivot pin

Anchor Pin or Pivot Pin
211 609 601B  CIP1 (-at-) $1.25 - Also Bus Boys, Bus Depot, Wolfsburgwest


E Brake Lever C-Clip
211 609 619A  CIP1 (-at-) $.25 - Also Bus Boys, Bus Depot, Wolfsburgwest

The pin that connects the e-brake mechanism to the rear brake shoe has
disintegrated long ago. I have been replacing these with a M8 bolt,
washer, nut, and thread locker. I have usually also peened the nut
into place. However, now I had one come loose twice in about 12
months. Not good and horrible scratching noises when parts get caught
between the shoes and drum ...

Anyway, ETKA says NLA and thus lists no part number. Does anyone still
have the OEM pins and the "circlip"-looking thing that keeps them in
place? If not, what is an acceptable replacement?
