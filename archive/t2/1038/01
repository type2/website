Subject: Headliner

Can anyone think of any reasons why I couldn't take a new-unopened 
headliner for a 79 deluxe, and put it in my 75 deluxe sunroof 
transporter? Granted I would have to open up the sunroof and trim the 
hole for the sunroof, but is there anything besides this and the crank 
handle that would be different than a regular hardtop? I bought the 
headliner for another project that now turned into a parts bus, and my 
project could always use a new one.
Thanks,
-Nate
