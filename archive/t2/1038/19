Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Proportioning Valve?

Make sure your brake rod between pedal and MC
(booster) has adequate clearance. If too tight it can
result in similar symptoms, especially if just a tad
too tight.

Re-adjust your drum brakes. Tighten both star wheels
as tight as you can, stomp HARD on the brake pedal,
then tighten even more, repeating until you just can't
tighten the star wheels any more. (Tighten same clicks
on front/back, of course) Loosen 3-4 clicks on each
one, STOMP on brake pedal HARD (to re-center the
shoes) loosen a few clicks each and repeat until
ever-so-slight rubbing still (or none, if that's the
way you like 'em). Be sure to re-center the shoes VERY
frequently.

Now do the same for the other wheel.

Last but not least, flush your fluid totally with
fresh fluid. Start with right rear and keep adding to
the reservoir as you bleed until the fluid is totally
clean. Do left rear next, right front, then left
front. 
If the fluid was perfectly clean/clear to start with,
then no need to flush, but every time I have had a
proportioning valve problem my fluid has been quite
brown. I highly doubt proportioning valve problem
unless the fluid is yucky and if you then flush it,
chances are very good the PV problem will flush away
with the dirty fluid. -BaH
