Subject: 1776 sp to dp conversion

I have picked up a 1776 single port (sp) for my 71 Westy and it seems to work
OK for now (although I still have some issues with the vacuum and the brake
booster).  What is involved in converting the 1776 to a dual port (dp)?  I
assume I would need different heads (but what kind).  I've never done the
rebuilding thing and my work on the motors have, thus far, been limited to
valve jobs, some electrical, etc... minor stuff.

Is it even worth considering converting from sp to dp?

Thanks,
