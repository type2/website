out.  Does anyone know of a good repair shop that specializes in old VW
radios?  Close to Ventura, CA would be nice.  I don't want it concours
"restored", but it would be nice to have AM and a dial light.

Bob's repairs all kinds, especially tube type, of OLD car radios.  AFAIK does not work on modern stuff, but will convert old radios to have FM capability using new parts.  Good work, fair (not cheap) price, stands behind his work, good turnaround.  I have been to his shop, and watched him work.  He knows his stuff.
