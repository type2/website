Subject: Caliper piston doubt...

Hello to you all.

After a few weeks, I was able to bring back to life my 78 front brake
calipers.
Here's a picture of how they look like when I took them out:

and another one:

One caliper had a problem in both pistons. They were very worn:

and the outer seal was always falling from the right place.
Why did this happen?

However, I menage to buy this new ones, from NK to replace the worn ones:

but now I not sure if they are OK to use.
This is the problem (or is not a problem?):

and the new ones:

As you can see, they don't have enough gap for the plate bumps as the original
ones.
Is this going to be a problem when I hit the brakes?

BTW, here's how the caliper looks like now.
I even manage to take the broken bleeders using a 7mm drill:

Thanks in advance and best regards from Lisbon, Portugal.
