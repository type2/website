Subject: parking of my van

Hi,

I have a problem I need to work out.

Do to my 13 year old's basket ball addiction, I moved my van away from
the net.

This means I have two options.

The grass, or my dirt garage.

My Garage has a concrete base all around it and is actually in very nice
shape. The garage door is rotted.

I am considering parking it in there and liming the ground first to draw
any moisture down into the dirt.

I expect liming dirt is better than sitting on grass.

Are there any other considerations or ideas about this?
