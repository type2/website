Subject: Re: hyd lifters stock non hyd cam

Jason asked:
 Hey guys.. Who is running hydro lifters with a stock cam? some people had
e-mailed me but i lost them. Are there going to be any huge drawbacks? I
believe one person mailed me and said he had been running it that way for
years...

------------------------------------------------------

Both my 77 Westy and my daughters 77 Westy have been running used VW
hydraulic lifters on the stock used solid cams for over 300,000 combined
trouble free miles.
