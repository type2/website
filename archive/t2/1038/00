Subject: Pancake Breakfast Sunday at Buses by the Beach

Volks:

Been getting some emails regarding Sunday Breakfast.

Wavy Davy and Ang Strohs say if anyone wants to bring something for the BBTB
Sunday Pancake Breakfast, some good items would be:

A pack of sausage links or veggie links/patties like Morningstar

Fruit (pineapple, strawberry, grapes, etc)

Donuts, Muffins Pastries, etc

They will have 100 sausage links plus all the pancake mix, syrup, butter and
OJ.

So, see you there!
