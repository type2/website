Subject: engine lid / impact tools

I got one o' them air chisels but as much as I can
blow on it, it don't seem to do nuthin'. A real waste
of money if ya ask me! 

So does it twist while impacting? A lot of people
don't know that often when you can't get a screw loose
you can use a driver bit and smack it with a hammer a
few times and that will break loose whats holding it
enough so you can use a screwdriver or a ratchet with
a screwdriver bit in it. I always carry a hand impact
driver (the kind ya hit with a hammer) ever since I
worked in a motorcycle shop 2-3 lifetimes ago. Ya hold
tension in the direction you want the screw to turn
then smack it smartly with a hammer and it provides
the jarring plus the twisting and is held tight in the
screw head all in one motion. Neat tools for
asthmatics and other airless folks. -BaH
