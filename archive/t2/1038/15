I'd be more supsicious of the vacuum assist and the condition of the
(recently replaced) booster.  This sounds exactly like what my 73 was
doing for a while.  I finally got around to replacing the booster and
the problem went away.  Seems my booster was FULL of brake fluid (I
don't remember exactly how this is possible, but belive me:  It is!) and
was resulting in the pedal having a *false* resistance at times.  Very
disturbing whilst driving in traffic!

Just my 2 cents.
