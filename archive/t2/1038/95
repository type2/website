>WHat kind of issues are you having with the vacuum and the brake booster?

Being a sp intake manifold, I had to drill and tap a hole (about 3/8") for the
vacuum for my power brake booster.  The intake had a vacuum port but it was
only about 1/4" or less in size.  I have checked for vacuum leaks.  Found
none.  But the brakes don't seem to be as responsive as I would have
anticipated with using a brake booster.  I have rebuilt and adjust the drum
brakes on back.  Installed a new master cylinder (the old one leaked and cause
brake fluid to get sucked back into the intake via the vacuum line).  Verified
that my brake booster is working.  Replaced pads on the front discs.

It stops.  But not quite as much power or petal as I would like or would think
I would have.  (This is based on my previous experience with previous two 1976
buses I had.)

Suggestions...
