Many of the original ones I've seen have been steel sandwich on (presumeably) asbestos that I've taken off of '79-'80 or so.  Just like the early ones for inline VW 4s.  Certainly the current are steel sandwich embossed crush gaskets, and still work better than the copper rings.  Though I note I've never had terrible problems with the copper.  YMMV.
