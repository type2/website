Thanks for the info.  Great pictures.

How high off the deck did you put the two seat rails?

And you said "These seats would work equally well on an early or late bay; the
bulkheads behind the seats would not be a problem."

Mike B installed these same type seats on a VW that DID have the
bulkheads, and he had to space out the seat rails a tad to compensate
for the bulkheads
