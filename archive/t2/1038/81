Subject: Looking for a front-end clip for a 78 bus - USED ONLY

Sorry, I should have also mentioned that my metal shop guy would rather 
use an original clip, not a new one.  He said it fits better.  That's 
why I'm looking for a used one.

Hey Everyone,
I'm looking for a front-end clip for a 78 bus in good condition in the
Los Angeles area.  If anyone has any leads, please let me know!!

Thanks,
Mike
