Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust,   differences in ports

Interesting- Nyssa's FI 75 bus was top-end rebuilt plus new rods 6 years 
ago- he used I think 74 heads as they had the bigger intake valves and 
the smog port holes which had to be plugged.  He claimed they breathed 
better.  As I said before, with a 091 tranny and hydraulic lifters (same 
stock 75 cam) she gets 22 mpg doing 65 for 13 straight hours of driving 
from Savannah!

  The FI engines started using smaller intake valves in 1975 to improve

  exhaust port. Perhaps it was thought that the square port would increase
  the flow of the exhaust out of the head, and thus help reduce head temps.
