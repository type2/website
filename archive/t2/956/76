	A sensible vision.  Mind you, purpose-designed electric 
vehicles don't use a gearbox or clutch (saving considerable weight, 
and some running noise); all we need is the diff.

	I think this is an unfortunate term.  It has been easy for a 
half-century to convert a car, e.g a Beetle, to burn rubber at 70mph 
or more  -  to outperform most petrol cars in speed & acceleration. 
The key problem has been RANGE  i.e battery storage.

	But need it be, in any reasonable scale of production?

	If one's daily drive is only, say, 40 mi  -  a common 
pattern, for millions of drivers  -  existing electric vehicle 
technology is fine.
