Subject: [Q] Nose Panel Replacement

Group-

I have to replace the nose panel on my '69 Westie.  I cannot seem to locate 
a replacement.  Any ideas?  I've checked with BrokenBus and BusDepot with 
no luck.  (I don't really want to retrofit a later model to my '69.)

As an alternative to the '69 style, I wouldn't mind a pre-68 style nose 
panel.  However, I think that would be difficult to fit.  Has anyone out 
there ever done this?
