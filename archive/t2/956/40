My advice is to view this exercise as an opportunity
for counterattack. Whenever a powerful bureaucracy
throws its weight around, the 'judo mentality' can
lead you to bring about its downfall or at least a 
setback for the powe-crazies.
What I would point out is that you might, in a
rearguard action, advocate a compromise: less
stringent (don't say 'more permissive' or 'slacker')
standards, esp for CO and unburnt fuel, for the
15-y-old vehicles.  I suspect you may be able to make
a "big sacrifice" on NOx  -  if our airhowlers tend in
any case to produce less of those than a modern motor.
 It may turn out that you can act 
all righteous and say NOx can be nearly as good as
for a recent motor, but CO & HCs less stringent.

Well, as good as this sounds, Calif is not going in
that direction!

Over the years, they have LOWERED the specs to get
your bus to pass. Right now they are lower than when
the bus was built new. We are having a harder time
getting them to pass.
