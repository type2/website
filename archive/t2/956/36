It comes to mind that last year China, by natural reproduction, created 7
million people!  It also comes to mind, that there are 18 billion people,
"there".  Now, because I am a simplistic man, and it is not quite Friday,
China has also become the worlds highest consumming beer country, and
"quickly" behind it, or in front of that statistic, is the fact "they" are the
number one cigarette consumption country in the world, and there fore, why are
"we" as a group worried about "smog" tests,..here, when the "bad stuff", is
already aloft, and comming via the "natural" wind course, eventually, it will
not matter, how many "hydrocarbons", are emitted from what you have to deliver
same, it will already be upon you, and "change" to that option, will take
"humungous" effort!  Some how, living on the "Wet Coast" of Canada, I feel all
of the "smog" tests, will be proved irrelevant, because, "we" are the
receivers, and in a "perfect" world, (I am still looking!), there could be
"change", by consortium, and not commercialism, but the "dragon", is awake,
and now the requim!  Sorry, prolly these Perscription drugs for "flu!
