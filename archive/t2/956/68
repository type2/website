Subject: Gas Leak : Correction to the PS comment

I didnt proof read: It should read:

PS> Since I wrote the above message, I talked with a VW owner/mechanic and 
described my problem.  His thoughts were 1. since there was gas up in the 
air filter apparatus possibly the cold start was stuck open or 2. there was 
a pinhole leak in one of the rubber connectors to the fuel injectors on the 
right side  that would not leak when shut off, but when the fuel pump put 30 
psi on it, the gas would spray out.
