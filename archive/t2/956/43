Amen, brother.

The downside to this is that many people seem to feel that a healthy
exhaust system is optional, quite a few overly loud vehicles here.

My insurance went way up from CA.  Just got a renewal and NOW it's lower
than it's ever been, when I checked on it, the gal said these were my
golden years.  I'll get the lowest rates of my life between 50 - 64.

Gives you youngsters something to look forward to eh?  ;-)

Karl, have you checked on insurance rates up here?
