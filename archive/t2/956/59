Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Bus Front Face

Hello-

Let me clarify.  I *just* learned that the part I need is called a "nose
panel".  And yes, I need the whole thing.

In terms of the year, I have a '69 Westie.  I realize that 68-71 is very
different from earlier models, but thought I'd mention my (potential)
desire for a retro-fit nose panel and see what reaction I'd get.

I do wonder if the outer dimensions and mounting style of earlier years is
the same and/or similar?  If so, I have a very capable body guy on tap who
could most likely "make it work".  How's that for over-confidence and
stupidity?

-David

What do yiou mean by "face" do you mean the entire
front nose panel?  If so, 66 and 71 are very different
animals.  66 and 67 would be the same, however 68-71
would be VERY different. What year is your bus?

Peace, John Baker
