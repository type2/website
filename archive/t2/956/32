Robt,

Thanks for jumping in and adding your comments to mine. While I agree  
that earlier smog checks were not related to global warming, and had  
to do with air quality, new and more restrictive legislation is  
almost certainly motivated by global warming and to a desire to get  
older vehicles off the road (how they'll deal with SUVs is another  
question, and a more important one I think).
