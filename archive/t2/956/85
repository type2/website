Hey guys  what ever became of the hybid that VW developed that had the  3 cly 
diesel and electric. Ran on electric under 35mph and switched to diesel  over 
that with the diesel recharging the batteries. Supposed to have gotten  
165mpg .  I know the limiting factor is still the batteries size and  capacity.  
Wouldn't that make a great motor system for a bus.   later  Mark Dearing
