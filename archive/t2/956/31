Subject: Re: [T2] Upholstery glue?

Not sure exactly what you are trying to stick together, but we are  
currently re-upholstering some Westy cushions and will be using  
rubber cement to attach the material to the boards on the bottom.   
Again, you might be talking about applying upholstery to foam or  
something else.  Our thought on the rubber cement is that it will  
give a little bit in that area instead of having the material give.

Peace, Troy
