Subject: Re: [T2] Annual smog checks coming to CA? 

	I'm just outside Denver (next door in Arapahoe County) so maybe  
things are different with the slight change in location.  In any  
case, I have the Vintage Vehicle plates and understood the following  
as the rules for smog.

The registration on the plates is paid in 5 year chunks.  The first  
time you get the plates, you have to pass smog.  But from there on  
out, as long as it stays registered in the state of CO, you never  
have to get the vehicle smogged again.  Im going to go read up again  
as well, but am I off on that?

I was a little concerned about this initially because I threw away  
the stock exhaust system for two simple turbo mufflers sticking out  
the back.  Also with lack of an EGR system, the inspection part is  
what concerned me.  Thankfully, they don't keep as close an eye as  
they do out in Cali.  In any case, my results were more on par with  
todays cars then those of the 1978 standards that they had at the  
testing facility.

Peace, Troy
