PS: For the record, I taught at UC San Diego for the past decade.  
That's the institution where the original work on global warming was  
done in the 1950s and 1960s. In "An Inconvenient Truth," Al Gore  
mentions a study of 928 scientific papers, all of which form a  
consensus in the scientific community. That study was done by an old  
friend of mine, a brilliant woman.

I used to park Peregrine outside what was Roger Revelle's office on  
the campus of Scripps Institution of Oceanography and work early in  
the morning while I watched sea kayakers out under the SIO pier  
before dawn.

I don't take comments about global warming "hysteria" lightly. My  
friends and colleagues did and do this work.
