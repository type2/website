Subject: 85.5 * ??.? for "A" pistons

Greetings -

I've been away for a while. Greetings to all of the new folk! I know  
you've found a great place to share and learn. Bus On!

Most everybody's seen the Hot VWs 1745 project, and I was actually  
considering building that motor a while back. I hope they have a  
"shopping list" when they wrap that up. I have noticed that they were  
using some hi-po parts (see the rods..) that I would have used a less  
expensive version of... but that's not my point.

I have been given a stock case that I want to build into a  
1745/1791/1801, using a stock T1 bore (85.5), but a stroke of  
76/78/78.4, respectively.

My question is: What is the longest stroke I can expect in a crank,  
and still use "A" pistons?

I do NOT want to increase the width of the motor noticeably! In other  
words, "an 84mm stroke with a .250 jug spacer...", doesn't cut it.  
Also, I want to KEEP THE DECK HEIGHT in the .40-.60" range... I'm a  
pretty laid-back dood, so a deck height of .100" won't ruffle my  
feathers.

I'm "number oriented", so if someone can tell me the deck height on a  
stock 69mm stroke "A" piston, on a stock jug, I think can calculate  
what I need.

Thanks!
