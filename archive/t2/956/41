At last - something I can offer advice about :-)  In summary, you'll get some
benefit form adding mass/damping to the insides of the sheetmetal in your bus
(dampens the resonances - stops them "ringing", and also reduces the influx of
airborne noise from outside), but you will get negligible benefit from adding
lightweight materials like bubble-wrap behind interior door panels etc.
Porous lightweight materials are useful *inside* the bus, exposed to the
interior, to absorb noise. My experience is mostly with architectural
acoustics (concert halls, conference rooms etc), where we used commercially
available acoustical panels - but these were essentially a rigid fiberglass
core covered with a permeable decorative outer covering (e.g. open-weave
fabric etc). If you can mimic this in the bus, it will further reduce noise
levels (as a previous poster said, the upholstery already helps - although
mainly at lower frequencies, since the foam isn't as absorptive as
fiberglass). You might be able to buy some 1"-thick black-faced fiberglass
duct-liner board from your local HVAC contractor, and either install it
as-is
in the engine compartment (*must* keep it dry!), or wrap it with
open weave
fabric and install it inside your bus. Same thing applies to the engine bay -
add *absorptive* material (e.g. fiberglass) inside the engine bay, to soak up
the sound at source, and add *mass* to the metal between the engine and
interior, to stop noise getting through.

As a final note - resist the
temptation to believe hype regarding acoustical treatments. In 8 years of
professional acoustical consulting for the construction industry, we rarely
made recommendations for anything more space-age than drywall (for mass) and
fiberglass (for absorption). The same concepts can be applied to the bus. For
this kind of application, one type of sticky tar stuff is probably pretty much
the same as another type of sticky tar stuff if it weighs the same, no matter
how the marketing people spin it - physics is physics :-)  

Disclaimer - some
people consider fiberglass to be the "new asbestos", even when it's protected
by a treated surface - if you have concerns about air quality, then other
materials are available, probably at slightly higher cost. It just needs to be
soft and porous, and the thicker the better.

cheers
