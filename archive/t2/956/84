Any  thoughts on how to get those boogers loose?



Hey Mike   I have seen these things get really stuck . I am  assuming that 
you aren't going to reuse these old P&Ls some you and take an  air chisel to 
them and drive them off.  AE cases were 1971,72 years. the  early one had 10mm 
head studs and no factory case savers , if this is the one  you have I would 
recommend installing case savers  later  Mark  Dearing
