My antenna is next to the drivers side A pillar, I don't know what that hole you have is for, did you narrowly escape a driveby shooting once?

Do you have a hole near your drivers side A pillar that looks like it might accomodate the standard antenna?  Can't see the spot where it would be in your picture
