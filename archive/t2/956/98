Well, just for a little more "ambiguity", on the Bus speaker issues...... I
was at a "tin scrap yard" awhile back and bought some "pieces" of round thin
wall, (like stove pipe), and some 90 "elbows", and "crudely" mounted my
speakers from left side and right side front, to meet in the middle with an
adjustable total diameter, "flapper" valve, and I was impressed, (note, I)
Seems it makes a "sound chamber", and I liked it, but will have to get back to
it, when I can!!  (JFFT)
