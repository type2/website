Exactly. I would like my next bus to evolve until it is a true hybrid  
of a Volkswagen aircooled engine and an electric vehicle. That's  
because I will use my next bus, as I did Peregrine, as a camper/ 
research shack. I need range.

Hybridizing a type 2, while keeping the original aircooled engine,  
should not be impossible but it will probably be difficult.

In addition to the mechanical issues (adding an electric motor drive;  
smoothing the transitions back and forth between gas engine drive and  
electric motor drive, and redesigning the brakes so that they capture  
braking energy), it will be worthwhile to reduce the overall weight  
of the bus as much as possible without sacrificing integrity.
