Subject: Re: [T2] Annual smog checks coming to CA?

????? When I first smogged my 1979 CA van I was advised that it had to be
smogged every year because of the model. The implication was that they are
all considered gross polluters. Mine was less than 10% of the allowables in
all categories when checked.
