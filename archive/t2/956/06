Subject: Re: [T2] Sound deadening...

Not to hijack this thread, but I have seen this stuff used in engine rooms on boats and was going to give it a try in the bus.

  It works very well there and should do a good job keeping the road noise down, but not too good for insulating .So I am thinking about painting this stuff on for sound deadening, then putting in some insulation that does not retain moisture on top of that. Any thoughts??
