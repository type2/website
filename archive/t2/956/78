Subject: Antenna Question

OK, this may be a silly question...

I want to install an antenna on my 78
Bus.  Side mount, single base seems to be the right answer.  However, when I
look at pics of these types of antennas, it appears that 2 holes are required:
one for the antenna cable to hook to (on top) and one for the mounting
hardware.

Here's an example of the typical antenna:

Here's a pic of the front
of my bus - only one round hole.

Am I missing something?  Do I need to drill an extra hole?  

Thanks.
Mike
