Subject: Gas Leak

HI Rich:

I did shut the vehicle off right away.  We rolled the van away from where 
gas had dripped on the asphalt. I opened up the engine compartment and we 
didnt disconnect the battery until everything had been aired out for awhile. 
  However, that was not due to my understanding these issues so thanks for 
the info.  SO, are you saying I shouldn't even try to deal with this 
problem?

Cheers,
Janyce
