I have seen this before, it was not treated in any way that I would be doing it or that any expert would suggest, it was filled with things that would hold water, not dynamat and bubblewrap, I think that this example has nothing to do with sound deadening and everything to do with not having any common sense.

In my case I only have dynamat against the metal, the cloth tape I use goes between the mat and the bubblewrap.

The spray in foam I am suggesting would be under my seat, not in my doors where water can get on it regularly.

Just don't fill your bus with a bunch of sponges, use materials that make sense.
