All of this global warming hysteria is not going to bode well for us bus owners as it's going to prompt more and more regulation.  If you haven't read Michael Crichton's 'State of Fear', I'd recommend it.  He was a believer until he started working on the book.  And it's full of good science. Cheers....KR
