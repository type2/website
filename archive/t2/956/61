I wonder if there's a difference in insulating for reflected noise (like in a concert hall) and insulating for transmitted noise (like in a vehicle).

In a marine diesel installation (insanely loud diesel with no damper) they commonly use pink construction foam encased on both sides with sheets of lead. The lead can be very thin but it needs to be there. I don't know if this is the most effective thing but I'm told it is the most bang for the buck. Hey I made a pun, did you see what I did there?
