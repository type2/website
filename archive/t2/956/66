Kenneth Hooper askz:
>> I wonder if there's a difference in insulating for
reflected noise (like in a concert hall) and insulating for transmitted noise
(like in a vehicle).

"Insulating for   reflected noise" is actually sound
ABSORPTION, not really "insulation". Applies in concert halls *and* buses.
"insulating for transmitted noise" is sound INSULATION, or sound ISOLATION.
(Uppercase letters just for emphasis - I'm not yelling at you ;-)

Sound
absorption "soaks up" the noise in any given space - e.g the noise that's
created in the engine compartment, or any noise that finds its way into the
passenger space - so
 adding soft, porous absorbers in these spaces will help.
Adding absorption in the passenger space might also help to increase your
perception of "quality" of the vehicle, since it will be not only less noisy,
but also less reverberant or "echoey" inside.

Sound isolation "contains" the
noise - for example, keeping it in the engine bay, instead of letting it leak
thru' the divider into the passenger space. Adding mass to the divider helps
increase sound isolation - hence your experience with the sheet lead in marine
diesel installations. (The pink construction foam is to separate the 2 sheets,
because at certain frequencies, 2 separated sheets are better than a single,
thicker (e.g. for walls, studs & drywall can work better than just the
drywall) - but we're probably getting too complex for bus applications.
Vibration damping reduces the amount of "ringing" that occurs in body panels.
This is achieved by the tar-like stuff that bends with the panel but has
 some
"viscosity", thus converting vibration energy to heat. This stuff also has
some mass, however, so improves sound isolation a little, too.

>> The bubble wrap [..] as insulation, not
done for acoustic treatment

Sorry - my misunderstanding!
