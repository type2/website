Subject: New VW Bay Window DST Rules

Greetings All -

It's late, and I might not get home, from tomorrow until Monday,  
seeing as the new Daylight Saving Time (DST) rules affect my other  
life (called "work"), so I'm appealing to the Admins to allow me this  
- I'll try to make it T2 oriented...

So.... in my '69 Westy, I have a clock that it searches for signals  
from Boulder, Colorado's DIST-F1's Cecium-powered Atomic Clock for  
the time-of-day. Not such a big deal, eh? ... remember, I have this  
clock IN MY BUS.

If your BUS, like mine, has any "Scheduled Tasks" (or, if your BUS  
uses Unix, like mine, CRONTABS), that are scheduled for 2:01:01AM  
until 03:00:00AM, THEY WILL NOT EXECUTE on March 11th. Likewise, come  
November... things will execute TWICE if scheduled from 01:00:01 to  
02:00:00.

Obviously, Germany never anticipated DST in the 1040's... so be  
prepared!

Mike
