Subject: Re: [T2] Sound deadening...Speakers in the door panel

I am fairly certain that a large portion of the noise I am hearing is from the speakers mounted in holes cut in my door panels, they buzz and rattle and sputter, this includes noise coming out of my door from having them in there and the wind escaping because the weight of the speaker is destroying the door panel.
I am in the process of building a new front speaker box, I can't wait to replace the door panels and the plastic behind them.
