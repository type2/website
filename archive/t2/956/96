Subject: Keeping mold at bay on a bay :-)

It seems that even though I have a "Dries the Air" contianer with the calcium pellets in it, and keep the van as dry as possible, my canvas and flocked roof interior inevitable end up having blue-black mold spots appear all over it. I use a 10% bleach water mix to spray it all down and scrub it in, but it will be back in 2-3 months. Has anyone ever come up with a way to actually beat this problem??
Regards,
Courtney
