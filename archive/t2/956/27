Subject: tow bar -- Volksie =?iso-8859-1?b?tWJ1cw==?=

Concerning your question on tow bars simple and cheap... I have a towbar that 
took my 69 Microbus from Baltimore to Chicago and back; then recently to South 
Carolina -- Spartanburg, to be more precise.

It was originally made in S.C.... Gibbes or Gibbs was the name of the maker, 
Columbia I seem to recall; but I have the tag someplace.  It was intended as a 
towing hitch adapter, clamping around the rear torsion bar housing and 
extending past the back bumper... think letter A where the serifs would be the 
clamps grabbing just inside the outer ends of the torsion bar housing.

Anyway, I modified it to grab the FRONT torsion bar housing.  To use it I have 
to remove the anti-sway bar and the grease nipples, no big deal.

At this moment I am relocating from Maryland to Sparkle City.  When I am 
settled, I could lend you the towbar, say, a month or two from now when the 
dust of moving settles and I can find things......

Sorry, but all of the archives were all over the board.  Who makes a tow
bar
that is 55 thru 78 capable, or the best out there?
