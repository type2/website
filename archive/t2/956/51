We purchased a foam material that was dense & cvered on one side with  
silver
insulating material.  It comes in 5mm, 10mm, 15mm & 20mm thick.  
(1/4", 3/8", 5/8"
& 3/4")
It is reasonably flexible enought to mould to the shapes & contours  
of the two
compartements under the front seats.  We have covered the front  
floor, under the
front seats, front panel behind the kick panels, sliding door, from  
under the rear seat
to the rear hatch, inside the rear hatch & the wall inside the  
cupboards.
The noise reductiion is really good but still hard to have a decent  
conversation
  with anyone in the rear seat.
The thermal difference however is excellent.  The heater now doesn't  
have to
overcome the extra breezes coming in and the cold metal in winter.
