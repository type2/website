Mike, you can safely use A pistons up to 74, and can push your luck with 76mm cranks, but you might need to use spacers under the jugs. If it were me, I'd use the venerable 1776 or at most a 74 X 90.5 setup. 1776's have proven themselves over the years to be just as long-lived as stock engines. The only time I've ever had grief was with 92 mm pistons. I am currently building a 2276CC 82X94 for one of my bugs and have been playing with HiPer engines since 1974. :-) You could use some gently cleaned up dual port heads with some Kadrons/Solex 40's in a 1776 with an Engle 100 cam for some really good HP and torque without losing driveability. This would give you about an extra reliable 20 HP. Of course you would use a counterweighted crank that is properly balanced. Stock rods are just fine in these engines, but after 76mm, and sometimes (depending on the crank company) you might have to clearance the case.
HTH,
Courtney
