Subject: Re: [T2] Annual smog checks coming to CA?

	The issue was 'smog checks' i.e legal limits on CO, HCs & NOx 
in exhaust, as well as some checks on related eqpt.
	This relates to climate degradation only slightly  -  to the 
extent that you burn your fuel more thoroughly (e.g water-injection 
halving the CO & HCs in your exhaust while improving your fuel 
mileage c.10%), you do produce marginally more carbon dioxide (CO2). 
But I must chime in supporting my fellow academic Mark Hineline, and 
not merely thru UC solidarity.
Mark quoth:
>  I don't take comments about global warming "hysteria" lightly.
		Tho' not myself a practitioner of climate modelling, 
I too have friends who are; and I've followed their work for 3 
decades now.  A fiction writer like M Crichton cannot trump the 
leading scientists who, in overwhelming numbers, have agreed on the 
IPCC predictions  -  which are therefore the best available basis for 
public policy.
	A common assumption in the current frightful undermining of 
science is that any restrictions on increased consumption in the 
overdeveloped world will make you unhappy.  You don't need to think 
much to see thru that propaganda; as supernerd Amory Lovins pointed 
out 3 decades ago, most of the well-off in the overdeveloped 
countries were happier in the 1960s than ever since.  The challenge 
is to consume less and enjoy it more; to the extent that you do so, 
e.g by keeping interesting comprehensible old VW going, you are doing 
your bit for climate conservation.
