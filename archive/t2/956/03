seeing as they use this stuff on modern cars, and vanagons, and 
undercoat cars as well, I think it's pretty safe to say that it's not 
going to be a problem.  Now, I think that doesn't mean you can forego 
proper vapor barriers to keep the moisture out, especially when you're 
installing insulation.
