Robert, I love you, man.  I love your interesting posts.  But give me some facts.  Let's talk about science.  I'm all about that.  Nobody has laid any true science out there that makes ME a believer.  Can you?  Or Mark?  Or anyone???  Please.  I'm trying to believe that I'm causing my children's demise.   But show me the facts.  I didn't see them in the Gorefest.  I want to be right.  Can you help me....KR
