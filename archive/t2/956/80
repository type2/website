I just muddied the waters, I guess.  The weekend was just a couple of
events around the Bug Run.  I think they figured there was this VW
focus just down the way, so they figured they'd do a Friday night
burger / Sunday swap meet and make a weekend out of it.

I was just wondering if there was any talk of doing that again.  Sorry
for the confusion,
