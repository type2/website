 "If so, why try to get in the last word  -  and in such an 
ignorant amateurish way?"

 Come on, Robert.  What makes that ignorant or amateurish?  You really believe in that crap.  I don't and I think I can justify it.  You think it's ignorant and amateurish that I disagree with you?  No.  It's very important to me.  I don't want politicians to buy into the hysteria, yes hysteria, that you guys cause.  By what I think are the products of very, might I say very, bad science.  

But I still love you, man.  Cheers...KR
