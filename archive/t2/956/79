Subject: Stuck Jugs on Disassembly

Greetings -

Thanks for the response and pmails on my stroker motor project. It  
will turn out to be a 1699cc stroker.

My brother gave me the old AE engine that he had hanging off the back  
of his Baja. It's been sitting for 20 (?) years. This is the case I  
want to use for my 1699 project. There is all sorts of build-up in  
the head ports, and the tops of the pistons have crust all over them.  
I have Liquid Wrenched the piston/jug and jug/motor contact points  
for days, and those jugs just are not budging. I've tried the rubber  
mallet and leverage (which resulted in broken fins).

Haven't tried heat yet. Don't know where to heat..

Any thoughts on how to get those boogers loose?
