Mark,
      I share your wish.  Go for the max!  Wouldn't it be great if we could buy 
off-the-shelf a lightweight electric motor that bolts right up to the VW's 
bellhousing?  A little more weight in the central section, perhaps from 
batteries and/or fuel cells, would be OK as long as the motor weighed less.

One could read this kind of idea in the Pop Mech magazines years ago; but AYMK 
with then-existing technology the performance was poor and the price high.
I dream that the technology will advance (and the related prices will decline) 
while there remain enough VW Type 2s to make the business case compute. 

As to daily driving, our dreams may never come true. If you can build Peregrine 
II for the longer term, no surprise, the problems become those of combating 
rust, satisfying safety requirements (adding air bags, upgrading braking 
systems, beefing-up the structure for crash tests, etc.).  Let's not even think 
about air conditioning and other consumer luxuries.  

I'll be delighted if I can keep the old Microbus as my Sunday driver for my 
remaining on-planet time.  For my daily driver any econobox will have to do.  
Call it getting 1/7th of the loaf ;-))

.. I really want a bus to replace Peregrine... and I want  
that bus to be my only vehicle -- daily driver and commuter, camper  
and excursion vehicle. I think all the time about the best way to do  
that over time (assuming that I have 20 to 40 years left on this  
planet). I wish that hybrid technology, for instance, were available  
to home tinkers through off-the-shelf components. I imagine that, in  
time, an all-electric alternative will be feasible for traveling good  
distances...
