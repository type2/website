Subject: [T2] Memory Foam Mattress

That is great info there Mike, one thing I will add to your post is that  
Talalay won't break down and compress permanently  over time like the  "memory 
foam" products will.  That of course means that you would only have  to do the 
job once. 
 
Other added benefits of the Talalay latex is that it doesn't off gas nasty  
stuff like some of the memory foam, and it doesn't harbor dust mites, mold and  
mildew!  We have talked about getting some for the bus.  Perhaps a  project 
for next winter!
 
We also did quite a bit of research before buying our mattress for our bed  
and for the new baby's crib mattress.  Natura World out of Ontario has the  
best stuff we could find.

Have a great weekend!
