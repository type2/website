Subject: torque values for the sump plate, oil temp sender?

Is 9ft pounds the correct torque for the oil sump plate? I've come into
possession of a 914 "taco" plate, and, as best I can tell from the
Bentley manual, the VW version of the plate is called an oil cover plate. 

I have a new O-ring for the plate. Will it be sufficient, or am I better
served to use some flavor of gasket adhesive as well?

Is there a range to which the sender unit should be torqued?

Many thanks in advance,

jack
