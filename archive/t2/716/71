Subject: April Fools... Five years and counting

Hi Volks,

I had a random thought today when someone mentioned April Fools.... It 
was April 1, 2000 when my wife Colleen and I towed home the "free to a 
good home" 1979 transporter that has since morphed into "Bob the 
Tomato". It was a very exciting 700 mile journey back from NH and it's 
been a very interesting 37,000 miles on the road since.

Many thanks today for all of those out on the list that helped make 
that happen. Matt DeNiola, and Dennis Jolliffe in particular, but there 
are many others out on the lists that I couldn't have done it without.

Thanks one and all.

Happy trails,
