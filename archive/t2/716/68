Subject: Van just Quits

Hi,

I have a 1978 CDN Campmobile that I just started up for the year.

It quit on me three times so far and after waiting about 5 minutes it would
just start as if the situation was normal.

I don't get it. There is no fuel smell, so it has to be a fuel starvation
problem.

I replaced the filter last year and all but one of the fuel lines. 4 years ago
I replaced the vaccum return unit. All the hoses associated with vacuum have
been replaced.

I am stumped.

Can someone pmail me with thoughts on how to proceed when it dies to
troubleshoot?
