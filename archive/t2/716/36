Subject: Re: [T2] VDO head temperature sensor

I know it's not the "ideal" location, but I have installed my sender in the 
factory FI CHT location (10mm thread next to spark plug). As I don't have 
FI, I just put a steel plug in the thread to hold the sender.
The main reason I did this was to avoid the hassles putting in the spark 
plug with a wire and ring hanging off it (it's hard enough already), and in 
practice it reads maybe 5% lower than when it was under the spark plug.
My temp readings may not be identical to everyone else, but it shows trends 
which is all I really want.
I think putting it under a head stud is a bad idea, the torque required on 
the head stud would probably damage the sender anyway.
