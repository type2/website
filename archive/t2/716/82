Subject: Last plea... Rebuilding distributor

One last try...

What lube (including brand) should I use on the springs and advance
plates in my vacuum advance distributor. I'm pulling it in the morning
and going to take it apart far enough to clean and lubricate the
advance.

I'm experiencing sticking at around freezing temps. I have some
generic "distributor lube" but this isn't something I want to screw
with.
