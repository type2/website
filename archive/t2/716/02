RIP.  Not off to the crusher, I hope!

That is the biggie... however you CAN convert the '69 to disk brakes. 
Email me for more info if you want to go this route.

Interior wise... the '71 stuff should fit in ok.  If your westy has a
'69 poptop it won't have a vent for the sink drain plumbing.  It also
won't have the middle support bracket at the front, and is a little
more susceptible to wind buffeting.  Make sure the canvas is SECURELY
stapled down in the front, or you won't be able to keep that top down
no matter what you do :)

Yes.

Good luck, and enjoy your bus!
