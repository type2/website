Subject: Wheels - same wheel, different price - American Eagle and EMPI

So I'm shopping for wheels for another project and I see an EMPI 8 spoke for sixty+ dollars from one supplier. From a different supplier I see the same wheel from American Eagle for $100. Or maybe the other way around... 

What's the difference? Who makes EMPI wheels?
