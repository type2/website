Hello

I had a very good friend pass away back in Nov.  I was helping clean 
out the garage and stumbled upon a brand new air conditioning kit from 
factory.  It has all the hoses, condensor, evaporator, and installation 
instructions.  Complete minus the compressor.  This kit was used by 
dealership to install optional A/C to Audi 100 cars.  If anybody is 
interested, it is your s free plus shipping.  It may work in a VW???? 
with modifications.
