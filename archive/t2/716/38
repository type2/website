Subject: Adding engine access

Hello All,
I have a 72 bus (no inside top door hatch).  I was wondering if anyone out 
there had added the top engine access to their older bus.  Could you just cut 
one out of a 73-79 and add it to a 68-72? Are the metal ribbings the same? Will 
it just lay in easily? Is there a web site out there that descibes this addin? 
Is this wishful thinking or will I just have to keep hunching over like half 
of us out there?
