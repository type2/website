Subject: Friday OT: Buying stuff over emaill, internet

I've had good luck purchasing a few items from list members for items
from $20-70.
Minor risk here, in neither time nor major $.

I'd like to know  other list members rules of thumb for buying items
$100-$400.  At what point do you go through a broker for some form of
assurance, credibility, etc?

Is it polite to ask for references, or other forms for trust-voucher?

What is your preferred and least preferred acceptable method of
payment? (COD, PayPal, money order.. )  Down payment?

I'm familiar with the useful The Samba Fraud notes
http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=253

and numerous common sense shortcomings: no cash in the mail, shipping
and currency rates up front, be courteous, double-check your not
cc:'ing type2(-at-)type2.com, transaction does not come with installation
hand-holding, no refunds when terms of sale met.
