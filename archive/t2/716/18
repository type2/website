I'm not surprized if VW is going to go after them for the use of the 
emblem!  The Frankenbus (toyota chassis, 60's VW bus top) has a spinning 
clock where the emblem is.......Come to Westies in the Woods, top of NJ 
Nov 27 to see that one!

  Rats. Now I kind of want one. Better get another dog instead...
