Subject: Late Tranny into 72

Hi All,

A few months ago there was a lengthy discussion on putting a late
tranny into an early T4. Couldn't find anything in the library or
archives. What was the consensus on that? Thought I remembered
something about the nose cone being too long and having to shorten the
shift rod or change the cone? I have my engine out on the 72 and have
the opportunity to put in a 5 rib tranny.

Oh, for those who were holding their breaths on why my pilot bearing
went out, it appears that whoever put the T1 motor in did not bother
to shorten the input shaft. I was the sole cause of my demise because
I did not know back then that one was supposed to put grease on the
pilot bearing ;-)

Thanks,

John
