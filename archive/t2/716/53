Subject: Rear valance and engine removal

Dear all,

Only one thing annoys me about my '73. If she had been born a little 
earlier, I would be able to get the engine straight out by unbolting the 
rear cross member. I don't mind jacking her up, but I have heard of 
people cutting out the rear beam, and with some judicious welding, 
converting it to a bolted on arranagement.

Anybody done this or now of somewhere I can get guidance?
