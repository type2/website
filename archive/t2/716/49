Subject: Need something trailered from Charleston SC to Pittsboro NC

I'm thinking about buying this diesel jetta in Charleston, SC so I can put 
the engine in my westy.
It is only a 5 hour 15 min drive each way, but we will have to trailer it 
home and non of our cars that are up for making the drive are set up with a 
tow hitch.
Is there anybody coming this way who has some room on a trailer or who has a 
tow hitch and I can rent a trailer?  Of course I would pay you.
Also, incase I have to drive down there myself and can't make it to the end 
of the month (It's a really good deal and they need it gone now) can anyone 
in that area store it in their driveway for a couple weeks, it won't take me 
too long cause it's close. I just really don't want to lose the deal.?
Thanks,
Kyle
