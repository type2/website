That's really amazing to me.  My one and only Samba transaction:  I tried to
buy a gas cap from some dude in Florida.  He was real chatty by email, sent
me a slide show of the hurricane damage to his house, said he needed cash,
said that in 20 yrs he had never had a problem sending cash via snail mail.
He seemed so friendly I trusted him.  Needless to say I never got my gas
cap, and never could get a hold of the dude.  Lesson learned: there are some
untrustworthy bussers out there.  I wouldn't think so but yeah...  I'm real
skeptical nowadays.  Luckily I was out just $20.  Then there was the dude I
bought my poptop from.  When it was all loaded on my truck, the price
suddenly increased.  That guy was a piece of work.  Said he loved old
busses, but the splitty he had was unconventionally hacked up and pieced
together with seemingly whatever parts were in his mountain of trash.  Said
he expected to get a premium price for it.  Yikes for whoever bought it!  I
don't trust people that don't do things right.
