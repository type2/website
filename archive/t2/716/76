I have had plenty of good dealings for stuff that wasn't that 
expensive.  Usually, these are people I don't know or have never met.  
Being a Type 2 list subscriber has been a good enough criterion for me.

I have had one to the tune of about $300 that went the wrong way.  
Whatever happened to Todd Hill?

Unfortunately, there are people like that out there.

What's the perfect automobile?
Nothing more than you really need.
What it takes to get you where you want to go.
Volkswagen Type 2.
