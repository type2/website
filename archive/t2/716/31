Subject: Mounting the front license plate

All,
I need to mount my front license plate to my 73 Westy.
There are already three holes in the front bumper, two high and one 
low, and none of them line up to the hole pattern on a "normal" North 
American plate.

Does anyone know of a license plate bracket that would have mounted 
using those three holes?
If so, any part numbers and/or sources?

I'd obviously like to avoid drilling unnecessary holes in the bumper.

Thanks
