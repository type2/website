Ignitor I has fixed dwell. Ignitior II for the 009 has variable dwell.

Yes and no. There has to be a minimum dwell otherwise the coil won't saturated enough resulting in a weak spark. If the dwell is too much then the timing will be late but since it's fixed you can simply compensate by resetting the initial timing. This is why you have to rotate the distributor after installing the Pertronix in the first place.

The plastic feeler in the package is mainly to make sure the module clears the magnet. The gap does not affect the dwell, it only affects the spark duration according to Joe Cali:
