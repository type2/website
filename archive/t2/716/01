Subject: 69 vs 71

Hey Guys and Gals,

I have some good news and bad news.

Start with the bad first:

My 71 Sportsmobile engine blew a valve.  AND WOW, what an explosion!  I have 
decide after a lot tears to let her go.

The good news is I found '69 Westy for a steal. But needs a lot of interior 
work.  I believe most if not all the interior from the 71 will fit in the 69.  
But the body is pretty much prestine.

Are there any major difference between a 69 and 71 that should be aware of?  
I know brakes are 4 drums(69) vs disc and drums (71). 

Was there a lock steering column in 69?


Hope to be Bussing again soon,


Brian Eney
