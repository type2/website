Thanks everyone for their input, and thanks Richard (Atwell) for the
offering of a ring terminal. I found a new tin plated copper sensor ring at
a local electronics store that fits in the sparkplug hole nicely.

Since I had two sensor wire harnesses, I drilled and tapped a 4-40 hole
close to the same sparkplug hole and using a smaller terminal ring, copper
washer and screw, attached the second sensor to the head. Once I put the
engine back in I'll try each one to see what the difference will be.

again, thanks,

Joey
