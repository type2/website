FWIW, I have NEVER had ANY PROBLEMS at all in dealing
with T2 and VB listmembers in sales transactions, and
I have probably done 100 or more in the past 5 years. 
It may be a little naive on my part, but I would not
feel bad about sending a few hundred bucks to someone
as long as they were a T2 or VB listmember...

Peace, John Baker
