Hi,

Too bad this is probably an April Fools.  But, if it is true, I want it.


Hello

I had a very good friend pass away back in Nov. I was helping clean out the
garage and stumbled upon a brand new air conditioning kit from factory. It
has all the hoses, condensor, evaporator, and installation instructions.
Complete minus the compressor. This kit was used by dealership to install
optional A/C to Audi 100 cars. If anybody is interested, it is your s free
plus shipping. It may work in a VW???? with modifications.
