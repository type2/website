I have the exhaust for the '75-78 after the heat exchangers. I think these 
are the configurations.

(1) Cross over pipe, elbow, cat converter, muffler, but no final pipe (I am 
going to need that)
(2) Cross over pipe, elbow, straight pipe, muffler (I think), but no final 
pipe.
(3) cross over pipe

Please, pmail me off line...
