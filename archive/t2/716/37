This getting a bit off topic for the list, but just quickly, it's not 
impossible to change the oil, but it is a pain, with the engine access 
via a hatch under the front seat it's hard to get to anything. It's been 
a while, but if memory serves correctly,  they're also a pan under the 
engine which makes it hard to get to the drain plug. These issues aren't 
to prevent maintenance, but merely to allow them to fit things into a 
front engine, front control van with a reasonably comfortable interior.
