not sure how many actual VW buses were sold in Japan although I did see

When I visited Japan in May 99 I saw one splitty with wrap-around
windows on the road, and a car sales lot with a number of volkswagens.
This round of the thread I dug out my video tape and here's my price
numbers in the windows, I'm sorry to report I don't remember what the
numbers MEAN.

74 orange westy: 158
Vanagon westy: 148
Two bugs: 56, 75
Late ghia: 106
Early ghia: 168
