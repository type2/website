Subject: Are Cera and Patxes welcome at Everybus?

We would sincerely like to bring our two well-behaved girl dogs (border
collie and dalmation)to EB this year.  I have checked the website several
times and I have not seen any info on dogs.

We will also have our 5 month old infant daughter Sofia too!
