Hi Richard,

Oh, if only that were true. 7 liters of 20W50 on my driveway this 
winter says it isn't.

I had a terrible time getting my sump plate resealed after installing 
the temp sensor back in January. I made the mistake of re-using the 
original o-ring the first time... it seemed OK when I tightened it up 
but the next morning there was a huge slick under the bus. Then I 
replaced the o-ring with a new one and the same thing happened. The 
third time I added a careful application of black RTV silicone and it's 
been fine since.

Jack, go for the goo. Your driveway will thank you for it.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
