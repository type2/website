>I have a VDO head temperature sensor gauge in my 70 bus.  I know these thing are not 100% accurate, but it does give an idea of what's going on back there. The last time I changed the sparkplugs, the sensor terminal ring that goes around the (#3) sparkplug broke.  I ordered a new one (genuine VDO) but it does not fit in the recessed sparkplug hole.

El stinko. I wish VDO wouldn't substitude parts and use the same part number.

I have a spare ring terminal that I can mail you that will fit.

>I thought about putting the sensor ring under one of the cylinderhead nuts.  The manual says to put the sensor ring between the cylinderhead and a copper washer.  I am worried that the heat will soften the copper washer and alter the torque setting of that cylinderhead nut. Paranoid?

You could put it there but the reading won't make any sense. The heat isn't hot enough to affect the copper.

>Could I drill a hole and mount the sensor elsewhere on the cylinderhead and still get an accurate reading (well, as accurate as it gets), if so where?

Not really. If you do, you won't be able to compare temps with anybody else.
