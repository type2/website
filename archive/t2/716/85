Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Have to disable a bus

A parent is asking YOU to help raise their child by disabling a bus? I'd 
suggest to the parent that they disable the bus after they buy it if 
they think that is how to raise a child. Wow! Outsourcing child rearing! 
Can a non-licensed person register a vehicle? Would a parent allow a 
minor child operate an unregistered vehicle?
