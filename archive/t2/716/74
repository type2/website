Subject: Re: [T2] Have to disable a bus

Ric this sounds as bad to me as the sandrailers buying buses and robbing the 
engine/tranny and crushing the rest of the bus. I wish it could be another 
way, but if this must be the plan here is what I suggest:

If the kid really loves buses as he must, I would talk to them and offer to 
take off $100 from the cost of the bus to keep the engine. You could deliver 
the bus and when it was at it's new home you could pull the engine. This way 
a) you could keep the sweet running engine for yourself  b) if the mom 
decides the kid could drive the bus he could pick up an engine somewhere or 
buy the original back from you and c) if he gets tired of it the bus could 
be resold to someone who could put another engine in it and restore it.

Short of that a cheaper idea would be to remove the axles. Much easier to 
do, replace, and the kid probably would have a harder time finding them 
again. I just can't see demolishing something as opposed to removing a 
critical item insted.
