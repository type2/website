Subject: Re: [T2] new propane tank law

Mike asked:

 If I remember correctly, someone just posted something up regarding the 
 new propane tank law that went into effect.  I am looking into getting 
 the vanagon propane tank for my baywindow from busdepot and I wanted to 
 make sure it's up to spec w/ that law, or if it even matters because 
 it's a mounted tank.
 
 I remember reading the email and the author said "if they won't fill 
 your tank, print this and bring it along with you".  That's what I'm 
 looking for.
