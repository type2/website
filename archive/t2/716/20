Subject: VDO head temperature sensor

I have a VDO head temperature sensor gauge in my 70 bus.  I know these thing are not 100% accurate, but it does give an idea of what's going on back there. The last time I changed the sparkplugs, the sensor terminal ring that goes around the (#3) sparkplug broke.  I ordered a new one (genuine VDO) but it does not fit in the recessed sparkplug hole.  I thought about putting the sensor ring under one of the cylinderhead nuts.  The manual says to put the sensor ring between the cylinderhead and a copper washer.  I am worried that the heat will soften the copper washer and alter the torque setting of that cylinderhead nut. Paranoid?  Could I drill a hole and mount the sensor elsewhere on the cylinderhead and still get an accurate reading (well, as accurate as it gets), if so where?

Thanks,

Joey
