Subject: RE: [T2] VW

Well,
VW isn't making buses anymore.  What's a self respecting Nipponese to do
except make their own?  While it's not a bus, it's closer to a bus than
anything I've seen in the last 10 years.  I would never call it a bus, but I
greatly admire their creativity.  At least it has round head lights and
rounded corners, though certainly it is more angular than an actual bus.

  My buddy here at work is obsessed with all things from Asia, particularly
Japan.  He just told me that you cannot change the oil on the HiAce.  Tells
me that they are designed to make an oil change difficult because of their
environmental regulations.  Also claims that it is cheaper to buy a new
HiAce than it is to replace the motor.  An interesting tale,.. anybody know
if it's valid?  Are HiAce's really built that way?  Unfortunate...
