Hello All,
I saw this commercial the other day on TV.  It was for a mattressb&
Temper-Pedic mattress.  Evidently, it is some sort of bNASAb material.
Anyways, it is
some sort of bmemory foamb that is supposed to be very good for your back.
It
also has the property of only contouring at one spot.
The next morning while driving to work in my 72 Westfalia a thought occurred
to me. The mattress thickness seemed to match the rear seat cushion thickness.
 Has anyone ever used this type of material in their interior?  Does anyone
actually have this type of mattress? If so, what do you think?  How does it
feel when you sit on it? There should be a place on the net to get this stuff
at
a reasonable price.  Just a thought.
Thanks,
