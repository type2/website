I replied to Dean via PMail, but thought I'd share my thoughts with
the rest of you, since I'm such a friggin' know-it-all. ;-)

It's a good question. I don't think you'd be making a fool out of
yourself at all.

I've bought and sold a few things through the list and The Samba with
(so far) good results. I wish The Samba would implement a stricter set
of rules like these:

I've done over 100 trades there with great success, mostly due to
those rules and guidelines.

Also remember there is a sort of feedback forum on The Samba as well.
You can search for a seller to see if he/she is worth your time.
