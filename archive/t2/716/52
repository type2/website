Subject: new propane tank law

If I remember correctly, someone just posted something up regarding the 
new propane tank law that went into effect.  I am looking into getting 
the vanagon propane tank for my baywindow from busdepot and I wanted to 
make sure it's up to spec w/ that law, or if it even matters because 
it's a mounted tank.

I remember reading the email and the author said "if they won't fill 
your tank, print this and bring it along with you".  That's what I'm 
looking for.

Thanks,
Mike
