You're definitely working in the right direction. The Duetz aircooled engine is a good one but I would look for a power INCREASE, not decrease... <grin!> It MAY have more torque than your stock engine but I still think you'll take a hit on overall power. Yes I think it is going to be underpowered at modern highway speeds. 

They did make larger engines. You may find them through tractor surplus sources. I want a big Tatra engine myself...

Question for you: these engines were made to run at nearly constant speeds. How is the going to translate when you are accelerating and shifting gears? Asking b/c I don't know...
