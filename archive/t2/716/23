Hi,

Dogs are allowed in the campground as well as children :) The park 
rules do specify that all pets must be on a leash (the other end 
attached to the owner) at all times and under no circumstance are 
animals to be left unattended. There are usually a lot of dogs at EB 
and I would like to remind everyone who brings a dog (or other pet) to 
please clean up all dog poop that's deposited by your dog.

If you have any other questions let me know!
Thanks

We would sincerely like to bring our two well-behaved girl dogs (border
collie and dalmation)to EB this year.  I have checked the website 
several
times and I have not seen any info on dogs.

We will also have our 5 month old infant daughter Sofia too!
