Subject: Re: [T2] Memory Foam Mattress

A wee bit off-topic, but I regard myself an expert now:

  Memory foam "posturpedic" or "temurpedic" is pure synthetic, and while 
it may be good for a seat or an imobile invalid, on a pillow or a 
mattress it has the disturbing properties of maintaining its impressions 
while you are creating new ones, and if used in a cold environment like 
a camper, it STAYS stiff- its rebound is temperature dependent. Westy 
owners, read that again!  It's also expensive.

I've researched mattresses to death for a recent twin bed/office seat 
purchase, and the best/longest lasting is Talalay process latex foam; we 
are still on our latex foam from 30 years ago!  Talalay refers to the 
process by which air is injected into liquid foam and cured via heat 
inserted by little fingers of metal into the foam mix.  Most "Talalay 
latex" foam  is a combination of latex (natural) and synthetic.  It 
gives the best combination of longevity and firmness choices.  Virtually 
all U.S. mattresses claiming to be Talalay Latex are made from foam 
produced in one factory in New England.  Pure natural latex talalay foam 
is made in Europe.    Here is a link for a good source and description.
http://www.foamorder.com/latex.php - description good, not the cheapest
http://mattresses.net/talaov.html  for a twin 2" overlay  $99 not bad
http://www.centralplastic.com/foam2.htm  - decent prices on standard foam
http://www.foambymail.com/mattresses.html  the cheapest for toppers, RV 
foam  to replace what you have- free shipping

  No contest it is better than innersprings; on just a wooden platform 
one can sleep and jump without disturbing a partner.  It is heavier than 
polyfoam, but can be bought in varying thicknesses as "toppers" for 
ordinary mattresses or for an RV mattress. .

In our Westy I've found the provided foam to be a bit on the stiff side 
for side sleepers, and we carry clothcovered toppers we made, using 1.5" 
polyfoam.  The upper bed in particular benefits from this; in a late 
Westy the pads can be carried with the bed left unfolded.

Italso has the property of only contouring at one spot.
