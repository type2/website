Subject: Kilocalorie to Btu conversion?

Any of y'all know the formula to convert kilocalories to Btu's? The new 
boyfriend swears up and down that the little bitty BN-2 gas heater that he 
retro'ed into one of his old bay window buses, (out of a bug) worked just 
dandy to keep everyone warm up in MA, in the winter. I think it was the 
"antifreeze" in him that did the trick. I just don't see how 2000k/cal ( 
which I think is around 8-9k Btu, but could be wrong) would turn the trick. I 
seem to remember that the BN-4 was rated at 6000k/cal, and that's what the 
put into late bays, right?
Thanks all,
Jesse
