Mike, list:
I too, had a 76 type 2 with dual 40IDF's. All that carb was a little wasted on that
stock motor. And the stock CB linkage was total crap. BUT is wasn't horrible. The
next bus  I had had the stock FI and I really liked the quieter sound and better
low end performance. The Webers were not worth it to me. If You had a bigger cam or
a lighter car, like a 914 or possibly 912, they might make a lot of sense. Would
look almost stock under stock 912 air cleaners!
On your 914 engined bus, why not change out the D-jetronic for AFC or even later
Digijet/ Digifant parts? I think you could retain the 914-2.0 runners and plenum.
I'm sure someone could figure it out and update your technology a couple of
decades! John Anderson (the one from West Virginia- we have at least 2!) has done
this, I think. This is something I would like to do for my 80 westy when this
shotgun motor finally gives it up! Maybe even add a stroker crank? Gawd I already
hear the cash registers in the background!
