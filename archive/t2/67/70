Subject: Westy interior panel patterns

I have the old pieces that I removed when I redid my sliding ddor and rear
hatch interior panels.  I could generate patterns in AutoCad .dwg or .dxf
files if that would help.  Let me know.

FWIW, the front doors have vinyl covered hardboard panels, which you maybe
could get from one of the usual suppliers.
