Most likely the hot lead to the fuse box came loose.  I had that happen to
me coming down a mountian one time.  Scary.

> The dude i trade my '66 to emailed me and said he was getting NO
electricals working anywhere in the bus.  Said he checked the battery and it
was fine.  No lights, no starting no nothing.  So assuming the battery is
good and hooked up correctly, what other things are likely to create this
complete lack of power?
