preferences. My choices are Weber 34 ICT's, Weber 40 IDF or some type of
single carb. I'm open to suggestions. My goals are reliability, reasonable
perfomamce and mpg. Thanks in advancefor your help.

Biggest problem with aftermarket dual carbs on the T-IV motor is the carb
linkage is loosy-goosey micky mouse. Most I've seen don't work well at all.
Very hard to get precise balance. 40IDF's will make it run great with the
hotter cam after installing and measuring mixture, then swapping jets and
emulsion tubes to adjust for your motor/cam combo, but mpg will not be
optimum. I have no direct experience with the 34 ICT's, but the issues will
be similar, linkage design and iterative dialing in. Figure about $70 for
each set of jets/tubes....per carb.

Stock FI on the 3/4 cam will be an experiment. The ECU assumes a stock
profile airflow and may or may not be adjustable to the enhanced flow. If I
tried this, I would get an adjustable pressure regulator off a Porsche 914.
If it's running a bit too lean, you might boost the pressure 2 or 3 psi to
accomadate. This is poke and hope engineering and results may or may not be
reliable/economical. 

You just can't know the result of non stock setups until you run the thing
for a time to see what drivability issues remain. A bit too lean is not a
good thing for motor life, a bit too rich to make it run strong is no fun
at the 12mpg.

The easy solution is put the stock FI cam in there with stock FI. That best
guarantees results, drivability, longevity and good mpg.
