Save it in 2000, it can be opened and re-saved in any format.

Or I can manipulate it into a few different formats if you send me the .dwg 
files.

Also with the university Internet connection I have I can re-send this out 
to anyone that asks with your approval very easily.

I just took an AutoCAD course this semester. I am working towards an 
engineering degree while I work as Library staff. In fact i am waiting for 
my final grades to be posted right now - it's making me very old!!!

See ya.

P.S. I might be able to get good measurements from my headliner, sliding 
door, and door panels this weekend and post the .dwg files Monday. This is 
will be for a '78 Westy. Would that be the same as ane arly baywindow?
