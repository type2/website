Hi Biill,

The type2 list are a great bunch of guys *most* of the time, it's just that
every happy family jostles elbows now and then.

Don't give up on buses just because some normally sane people knocked heads
out loud on the list.... Visit www.EveryBus.com,
www.geocities.com/BusesByTheFalls, www.busfusion.com, and www.BNNTA.com and
then think it over.

There are MANY great reasons to have a bus, but without this list and the
people I have met through it I wouldn't be driving the bus I have today.

(Which, I am thrilled to say, is pictured on Page 60 of the February 2002 VW
Trends magazine, and Jamie Rivers bus is on Page 61.)

And since it's Friday in the Atlantic Time Zone, I'll take this opportunity
to thank the Admins for the fine effort they put forth that keeps these
wheels greased. YOU ROCK!!!!!

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
