Subject: Re: [T2] Westy interior panel patterns

Hey ya Russell or anyone else,

I could generate patterns in AutoCad .dwg or .dxf
>files if that would help.  Let me know

That is something that BELONGS in the archives for sure!  Me, I have 
replaced all my panels with 1/8th wood panels stained Red Mahogany held on 
with brass screws but what I need now are the wood roof panel patterns, 
which I plan on using formica paneling (some cool blue marble pattern or 
such)

Anyone as cool as Russell care to put these patterns or measurements 
available in the archives?
