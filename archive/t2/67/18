Subject: The Second Two

Hi Folks,

It's almost Friday (here in Colorado, at least), and I wanted to get some 
thoughts about a long-unsolved mystery.  Specifically, I'm wondering if 
anybody has an answer for why VW put a second 2 in the Bus VIN numbers.

My theory is that it's the second iteration of the third (year) number.
Thus:  1969 Kombi = 239_xxx_xxx and 1979 Kombi = 239_2_xxx_xxx

The Second Two only appears from 1970 on, as the numbers from The Beginning 
until about 1964 appear to be sequential.  So, I guess if you found an ID 
plate by itself, you could tell exactly which year Bus it was from (which, I 
guess, is the idea).

Perhaps I have too much time or too many brain cells to spend on trivial 
things like this, but I AM a Bus owner after all....

Thanks for being there,
Jason
