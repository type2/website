<< Thanks guys.
 Clara mentions something that had me wondering yesterday. When I pulled the
 oil pressure control valve yesterday a LOT of oil came out. Best guess about
 1.5 quarts. I never remembered that happening before but I did have the back
 of the bus jacked up a bit to get under her a little easier and the bus was
 pointing down hill very slightly. I attributed it to the engine angle but
 (grasping at straws) could this mean anything else??

had it just been running?  I think more will come out if you don't let the 
oil settle first- think of the drainage down from the oil cooler
