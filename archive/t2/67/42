Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Wanted: Bus Towbar

Someone in Arizona used to make them, the name escapes me at the moment.  However he passed
on a year or two ago.  This tow bar only works on 70 and down however.  It won't work with
the later buses because of the disc brakes.  But if I remember the original poster's bus
year it was below that.  I am sure there are more than a few out there if you can get
someone to come of one.

They weren't cheap though. Right at $190 or so if I remember correctly.
