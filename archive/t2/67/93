Here's my two cents,

with a little engineering (if you can call it that) my bus sports a nice

Push button installed and we haven't had a starting problem since.  Why =
go
back to VW's system which constantly had me futzing with it in winter
conditions? Flame suit on and extinguisher poised for action.
