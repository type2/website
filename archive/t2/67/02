Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Pump for a 78

This is going to sound strange but I've done it myself and I know it works.
F*rd trucks model years 85 to 88 have external bosch fuel pumps that are
identical to vw bus external fuel pumps for fuel injected vehicles.   Used
ones go quite cheaply, much cheaper then used vw pumps.  

However, before I coughed up the dough for a new pump I would check that
your fuel filter or fuel line wasn't plugged.  Vw fuel pumps are push pumps,
they don't pull fuel very well at all, so any obstruction upstream of the
fuel pump would make it seem like the pump was faulty.

hope that helps, Jason.
