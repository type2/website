Mark:
I think that if they whir, they are okay! It's when they don't say
anything, that you really need to worry!
I think the filter or intake pipe is plugged. NO $127 or $220 pump will
make up for that!
Remove the old filter, fuel should just run out, BE SURE YOU ARE READY !
Have a clamp pliers/ plug ready.
Replace the filter. Give the old one an autopsy and see if it was plugged.

Try compressed air on the gas filler if fuel doesn't run out. As a last
resort, blow it backwards. Be really careful to only allow about 20-30 PSI
into the tank, they are not made to be an air compressor tank!
