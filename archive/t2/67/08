Consistant with DM. My 912 Porsche came from the factory with an insulated
but loose connector in the motor compartment that is just long enough to
jump a terminal on the regulator for maintenance and emergerncies. An
axillary starter solinoid provision from the factory. Very handy, indeed.
Way better idea than cutting a hole in your dash for a button.

Then just confirm the circuit with your multimeter. Check drop across batt
+ and big bolt solinoid, then solinoid to switch, then through switch, then
back to small terminal at the solinoid, then to ground through the
solinoid. Anyplace your dropping more than 0.2v is weakness adding to the
problem. Just do the voltage drops with a trustworthy meter.
