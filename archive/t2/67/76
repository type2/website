I would suspect that the smaller unit would have a significant effect when
added to the stock bus heat and if the van is reasonably tight.  I have
the BA-4 in my bus (from a 411/412) and it does a pretty good job in my
not so very tight bus with the stock heat system removed.    the biggest
difference is that it would have a longer "on" cycle than the larger unit.
