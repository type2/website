I did a test on my bus about a year or so ago.

finishing a break in on my new rebuild and still had dino break in oil,,
10w40 Sunoco if I recall.  did a hundred fifty mile test interstate, main
roads, stop and go. etc.
  changed to synthetic, Penzoil Performax 5-50 next day ran same course,
temp was the same humidity was the same and compared my gauge readings.  

I could detect no significant difference in temps. (VDO oil sump
guage) although presure seemed to stay higher when hot with synthetics. 

so in MY van and only in my van I have impirical evidence that it works.  

I also got 214k on the original engine with only a ring job and replaceing
a valve, using synthetic the entire time I owned it (last 100k)


> horsepower. (It means more potential HP for us too, but if I have 67hp
