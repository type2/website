Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump for a 78

P. S.  Only my dad is allowed to slam me publicly,
like you just did.  And that is even up to question.

Maybe bus ownership gives us all a different way of
looking at things.

I can guarantee you that I have had many more
experiences packed into these 28 years than many
people twice my age.

PS, help me fix my pump!!

Mark
