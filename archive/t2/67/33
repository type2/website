Thanks guys.
Clara mentions something that had me wondering yesterday. When I pulled the
oil pressure control valve yesterday a LOT of oil came out. Best guess about
1.5 quarts. I never remembered that happening before but I did have the back
of the bus jacked up a bit to get under her a little easier and the bus was
pointing down hill very slightly. I attributed it to the engine angle but
(grasping at straws) could this mean anything else??

I am comfortable with the gauge readings as they were reproducible from
mechanical gauge to electric sender. It is the dual sender and the light
came on at around 3-5 psi.

Clara, I must admit I did nothing about checking the pump as it was brand
new as was the cover. I will not make that mistake again. I figure I can
support the engine, remove the rear carrier to get to the pump for removal
and inspection without pulling the engine again. Is this correct?

Kris mentioned using a Berg 30 mm oil pump with the pressure relief cover on
this puppy. What are the listee's thoughts about this? What does this cover
look like and will it fit in front of the rear carrier?

In retrospect I am wondering about main bearing #3. To me it *felt* a little
sloppy and I even questioned it and was assured that it miced within spec
before installation. What would I know, as I have never seen a dry main on a
crank in my life. What should it *feel* like? This is the same shop that
pressed on the wrong gear to begin with.

Thanks!
