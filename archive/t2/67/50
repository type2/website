Which shows another advantage to synthetic: lower friction. For us that
means better gas mileage and less wear; for them it also means more
horsepower. (It means more potential HP for us too, but if I have 67hp
instead of 66 it's not going to be real noticeable; those guys are looking
for every HP they can get.)
