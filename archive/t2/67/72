Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Pump for a 78

On those fuel injected f*rd vehicles in question there are two fuel pumps,
one in tank, and one frame mounted. The in tank pump is a low pressure "lift
pump" to supply fuel to the frame mounted high pressure fuel injection pump.
The frame mounted pump is the one you want.  It varies in location on the
particular model you scrounge off of.  But fuel injected rangers and f150's
from 85 to 88 have these pumps.  Other models and years may have them but
you have to verify that yourself. When I went to get mine from the scrap
yard it was already pulled and sitting on the sales rack.

Again,  I hope that helps.
