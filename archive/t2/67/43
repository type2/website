I use 5w-50 synthetic in my buses and have since 1976.  just now have
switched from Pennzoil to Castrol since Pennzoil discontinued the 5-50

my 78, 2liter is using 0 oil between changes. 

gotta work at it to get a VW engine tight but it is not impossible
just doing the basic stuff by the book, Vitron seals on the push rod tubes
helps too!
