Stan replies: I worked for Borg Warner Corp. they offered rebuilt
clutches. They didn't have a rebuild plant every rebuilt clutch was a
production over-run and new clutches, PPlates were shipped as rebuilts.
They had the same policy on the Autoimatic tranny that AMC (Nash) used.
Same story goes with a lot of other manufacturers of auto parts. (I'm out
of the distribution loop currently so I can't say which are currently
shipping new for rebuilt.)
I worked for Prior products (rebuilt vacuum boosters and master
cylinders) and the cores came back in the boxes and most were pretty
clean. Prior stored them outside in 55 gal barrels and most rusted up
before they got cycled into the rebuild cycle. Beware of Lec (NAPA)
rebuilders they are the same company, just merged. 
List members have told me that most Bosch AFMs are new even when you
purchase a rebuilt (from authorized Bosch distributor) I believ it. I'd
believe the same of the fuel pumps if they came in a Bosch box from an
authorized Bosch distributor. Seems nobody returns the AFM core to get
the $25.00 and I'd bet the fuel pump core isn't more than $3.00.
The key is just to know the source and took at the part before you pay
for it.
