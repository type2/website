BEWARE, if the ignition is on your coil is hot, and if the distributor is
lined up just right it will totally fry your coil....ask me how I know
;8*{

don't know if this same problem exists with a Pertronix which I have now,
but not taking any chances

and that is a major difference..  when you ONLY have your type 2 as your
sole transport and you have to get to work tommorrow morning, well
sometimes you don't exactly follow stock.

   look at my van, more or less mostly stock (is that an oxymoron?) but I
am the one who pushes it 20k a year and if it don't go, I don't go unless
I can con my wife out of her S*t*rn, which won't hold the "stuff" I have
to carry round for work..

sometimes necesity forces our hands.

as for the fuel pump that started this (or was it ignition switch) I don't
know about rebuilds and the $$$ is steep, so I have grabbed every fuel
injection type fuel pump I see when junkyarding, usually have a tested one
in the van when traveling beyond my local AAA limit.  

I wasn't going to say anything yet but I will try to get out to my "Spare
parts storage garage" over the weekend and see if there is a working
extra, tis Christmas, no warranty but the price is right.
