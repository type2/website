John,

Shame on you<grin>....you of all should know better than to say "test" or
"reference" without the URL or personal data.

Where is the data for synthetics???
I *know* that you know your stuff, but share!

I use mobil 1 in F**d, but am afraid to use it in my bugs.  Every time
that I do, it seems to get sucked up faster than 1 qt/3,000 miles.

In my F**d I use 0 quarts/10,000 miles.

Cheers, dave
