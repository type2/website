 Hello All:
I belong to two lists: This one and BMW digest. I lurked on the BMW list until the patience of the listmembers and quality of the responses convinced me they could see me through any problem and I took the plunge and bought a used 325i. They are knowledgeable, patient and always willing to provide a "cheap" alternative.
After owning several type 1's including a ghia, I thought bus ownership might be cool and started lurking on this list. However, the responses on this list have frequently ranged from condescending to downright surly. I guess I don't understand how a group of "peace loving hippies" (to borrow from a previous thread) could have gotten this way, but I will be continuing my search for a fun, unique vehicle with a more accepting group of owners. 
Interestingly enough, I would have originally thought the BMW owners would have been the more difficult group-live and learn.
Regards and Happy Motoring,
Bill

I agree, even my Dad would never do such a thing. I think everyone on
both vw lists I am on is getting stressed(full moon?).

What Tim is tryingto say, is that everyday he deals with people that want
their cars fixed cheap and he has learned over the years that to keep his 
customers and himself happy, it's gotta be the non cheap way for him.

I don't know if there is such a thing as a rebuilt pump for vw fi, but
nobody seems to have been able to come up with a better "new" alternative
that I am aware of. It seems to be one of those parts that you just have
to cough up the bucks for and then go on your way.

Maybe the hint about ford truck pumps that are the same as the vw ones
might work out. If they are the same, I wonder what they sell for against
the price quoted for the vw ones.....hmmmmmm



Cheers, dave
