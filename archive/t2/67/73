Subject: Re: [T2] Westy interior panel patterns

Actually I would be glad to make a full size (24" X 36") set of blueprints
for all the 68-72 Westy interior birch panels for the VW community and even
the door panels and the kick panels too. I have most of the original pieces
and could make the prints on AutoCad, but I need 2 things:

1) dimensions for the headliner, which I believe should be fabricated in 3
pieces. I also would need the dimensions for the driver's side panels. Russ
it would save me time if you could take some dimensions for the sliding
door. I have the rear deck lid panel and the trim pieces in the rear around
the spare tire.

2) somebody to check the dimensions by actually using the blueprints before
making them available to the public.

Anybody have those dimensions? A good way to check the dimensions is for
somebody to measure theirs against mine too.
