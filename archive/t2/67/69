Subject: Cool retroToys and coolers

I was a trade show for work a few weeks ago and came across these folks who 
had some really really cool stuff.

The guy makes reproductions of old metal pedal cars and Old Metal Coolers.  
They have some reproduction Coca-Cola coolers that are the nicest I have 
ever seen: plus a full line of reto logo coolers, ect.

The pedal cars are cool too,  just that I am too big to fit in one, but if 
anyone has got a kid out there, could make him/her the coolest on the block.

check out     www.american-retro.com

later,
buddah
