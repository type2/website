I have an HPBus drop floor bus and the lower door track had to be
reconfigured to be on the ramp that unfolded.  not sure if it is original
or a copy but it has experienced no rust and appears to be a single welded
on unit.. HPBus went away many years ago (or at least I can find no
evidence they still exist) and since this is a critical part of my bus it
is obviously not avaliable, BUT if someone would like to use it as a
pattern for making a one piece weld on lower door track I am sure we could
work something out.  There are some general photos of the van in one of
the first legs of the hubcap bus tour, showing the ramp and track
unfolded, blue & white 78 with canoe on roof.
