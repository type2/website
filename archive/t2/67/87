I ran dual 40's on a stock 914 2.0 as well as in my 73 bus with 1.8 (had small 
valves from 1.7 heads) for years and years.  I was relatively happy with them 
after I got the kinks worked out.  

Best thing I ever did was spend $100 and replace the piece-of-junk bug-pack 
linkage with a Weber X-bar linkage.  Went from adjusting, adjusting, re-
adjusting, screwing around, adjusting, cussing, re-adjusting (get the picture) 
to setting them up once and checking them every 6 months or so (very seldom 
changed it, just checked it to make sure).

A couple of really important points with dual carbs are #1 make sure there are 
NO intake leaks.  A tiny leak at the manifolds will result in total crap 
running and will render balancing and tuning completely ineffective.  #2 you 
HAVE to get the right jets and emulsion tubes.  The carbs as they come in the 
kit are NOT set up right for any type IV motor.  Replace the F11 tubes with 
F7's (or is it the other way around - I can't remember).  #3 get the jetting 
right.  I'd recommend starting off with 130 mains, 185 airs, 50 idles and be 
prepared to go 1 or even 2 sizes in each direction for any of the jets.  The 
reason for the different emulsion tube is to take care of the stumbling problem 
as the carbs transition from the idle circuits to the main circuits.  The F11's 
(if I've got it right) create a much richer transition and you'll be amazed at 
the difference.

Personally, I believe the dual Weber 40 IDF's are one of the best choices for 
carburetion on type IV motors.  Very flexible, very reliable, very easy to 
field-strip if needed, easy to change for extended high or low altitude 
driving.  Gas mileage is not quite as good as stock FI, but performance (if the 
carbs are set up right) is slightly better.  On my stock 74 914 2.0 I went from 
roughly 19/22 mpg to about 22/30 when I put the FI back on.

I will have to admit that I've been much happier with my 914 2.0 after 
replacing the carbs with the stock FI several years ago.  So much so that I put 
the same d-jet FI on my 73 bus when I installed the 914 2.0 motor and 5sp 
tranny.  But I do miss those days when I'd look into the engine compartment and 
see nothing but a clean case with those impressive looking carbs sticking up on 
either side :)  MPG on the bus is impossible to compare because of the engine 
swap and tranny swap at the same time, but I went from 16/18 mpg to 18/20.
