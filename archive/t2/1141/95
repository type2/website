	I've mentioned some y ago the taxi driver in Auckland, 
record-holder for biggest mileage on a cab (Vauxhall 'Victor' c.1968 
model; >500,000 mi) who told me the shrewd taxi drivers buy tyres a 
year or so ahead, and keep 'em in a dark basement.  The rubber then 
hardens and runs about double the mileage.
	The price you pay for this longevity is that they skid more 
readily.  On a racing motorbike, that's a serious drawback; on a VW 
bus, not for most drivers who weren't drifting in the first place.
	So I agree the protection from sunlight is, as John says, v important.
