This will catch crap, but who cares...
 
Greg, although you see many of them, the Facets have a poor long term rep,
most NAPA, Autozone, whoever will have a radial style that will last much
longer, provides more even flow.  Don't ususally need a PN, just ask one of
the guys who doesn't look 12yo for a low pressure, generic pump for carb
application.  Probably still under $50, even in the south (of me that is.)  I
know you see Facets in every VW kit ever made, but doesn't make em right, just
cheap.  They are the only electric pump I've ever had personally fail (2 of
them) and I'll never touch em.

Does anyone have a Napa p/n for a facet fuel pump to fuel a pair of solexes?
The mechanical pump on my Dad's westy is starving the carbs above idle.
