Subject: RE: [T2] Fuse blew and stopped my van

FYI- there are some circuits that are "hot" all of the time, so just because
the ignition is off, does not mean there is no juice in the fusebox, it
depends on the specific circuit.  For example, in most of the aircooled VWs
the lights work without the keys!  Burned up a few batteries in the rain with
that one.
