Subject: tires

I have a small story about tires.

My local tire store (Small town) worked hard to find me tires for my van. So much so that he was not happy until he found the right ones.

I like people who behave that way.

He finally settled on 8 ply Yokohamas.

The combination of new shocks and the tires blew my mind!

I never thought my bus could be so stable.
