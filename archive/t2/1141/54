Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Cap Gasket?

I always had a gasket in my stock oil cap. Just looked like one belonged 
there. Seems to me I had a small sheet of viton rubber and cut a gasket out 
of that. It was always a little tight, but it went together and never 
leaked.

I now have an aftermarket filler, so I don't have that problem.
