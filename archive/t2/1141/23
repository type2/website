That is the "base" casting number that's on at least 8 different
Throttle Body Assemblies I've seen and depends on what they were
installed on.  Could be my Waterboxer Vanagon or a 74 412 Wagon and
anything in between - it's just the way they're configured at the
factory for a particular application installed on.
