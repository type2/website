Subject: '70 Bay Gas filler re-plating

Hello all,
I looked into my gas filler a few minutes ago as I was checking the
fit-and-finish of the stainless locking gas cap I just received from the Thing
Shop, and I saw that the filler is starting to rust pretty severely on the
inside.  Has anybody re-plated their filler?  Ceramic?  Aluminum?  Cadmium?
What would you folks choose to re-plate with?  Thanks!
Eron
