Subject: Is this why 75 bus may  be failing inspection?

    My daughter's 75 bus failed NJ inspection (HC, CO too high) and I 
traced it to a sticky distributor that was not returning to idle 
timing...so I switched it with a good one (the bus depot $169 Bosch one) 
and it still failed (HC ok, CO just over...)
    So I checked it out and vac hose was off pressure regulator 
(pressure then too high?) and I checked like I do with our 78 camper- at 
the 7.5 deg before top dead center marked on the replaced degree arc- 
then noticed that the sticker on fan housing says 5 deg after top DC- 
you mean she's been driving it for years too advanced?  Maybe that's why 
she had good mpg (22)?  It failed 2 years ago, but then we had a shop 
redo it and pass it after replacing the exhaust.  AAArrrgh- hope it 
passes now!
