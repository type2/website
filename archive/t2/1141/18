Subject: Embarrassing Question

I hate to even have to ask this but I've been searching for 2 hours and can't
find the answer.  I have a newer VDO fuel sender that I'm hooking back up.
The two terminals are labelled "G" and "T" and I don't want to hook it up
backwards.  I *think* the "G" stands for Guage and is the + side and not the
ground, but was just hoping someone can confirm.  And if that's true, what
does the "T" stand for?

Thanks,
chandler
