Thanks, Martin.  But I doubt I could get them from England by this 
weekend.  Looks like the weather will be better so I'll give it a shot 
flying blind.  If I can figure out how to hook everything up, there's a 
shop here that told me they can tune them.  I'm willing to pay but don't 
want to pay for grunt work that I can do.  Thanks...KR
