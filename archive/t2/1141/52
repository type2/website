Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Cap Gasket?

Hi bob
I checked 22 caps I have .. 1 had a gasket ! ...
now.. i wouldn't normally have searched quite sooo hard ,, but a parts list
book I have shows the gasket..
here is a picture of the page.

I don't think it is an issue to run with out one.. the mating surfaces are a
good seal.. plus the dirt has to pass thru all the threads.
