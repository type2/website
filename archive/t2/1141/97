Subject: Re: [WetWesties] 71 dash ->  lights and levers-DONE!

We have done it!  Took both of us to remove those old plastic plugs  
from the heat/air the levers;  they were so old and like steel.  A  
horrible contortionist job taking many punishing hours.

New speedo in, all wires sorted out  and re-routed behind dash . Many  
were about to come detached - the large red power plug was only tip- 
touching in the T5 connector.

Thank you every one who offered suggestions - perhaps the best before  
the job was encouragement to keep at it, and after the job  is DON'T  
put plugs back in, even new ones (they are available - google  
pushpins - )

So, now we know just how slow we are  going :-)

And I have taken apart the old speedo to see how it works - can find  
no  visible problems - so put it together again.

I wonder if gas prices will come  down so I can afford to go  
somewhere, however slowly. If not I will hire out as the 71 lever  
expert.
