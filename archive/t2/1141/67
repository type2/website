Update - I realized that the wire running from the fuse box to the back 
is obviously working, because otherwise your coil wouldn't be working. 
So, the problem most likely exists somewhere up front.  Unfortunately 
it's a bit complex to explain the fuse box wiring so you'll need to 
refer to a wiring diagram to make sure that you have everything hooked 
up correctly up front.  This requires that you methodically look at each 
wire and where it is going to/coming from and make sure they're all 
connected correctly.  This can be quite tedious, so if you're not 
comfortable with wiring, you might employ the help of someone that is...
