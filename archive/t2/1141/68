Hey Max,
The first thing to do is bust out your Bentley and look at the wiring
diagram for your model year. B If you don't have a Bentley, I'd highly
recommend getting one because if you don't have the diagram to refer to,
it will make it really difficult to diagnose these kinds of problems.

If you don't have a Bentley, or Haynes which also has a wiring diagram (in
black and white), then go to The Samba.B  There is a wiring digram there that
can be printed out.
