I did some more research and suggest that you look into commercial shrink 
wrap as a way to reduce the exposure of your tires and rubber bits to ozone 
and sunlight. Type "JHNN" into your browser search window and when you get 
the web site, look at thermoplastic shrink wrap. They use it on yachts, 
aircraft, and military vehicles and it isn't as difficult to remove as 
cosmoline.
