Subject: re:Front blinker seals

Was writ:" You can purchase a rubber expansion nut."

 

I believe these are called 'well nuts' if you are looking for them. I
thought about using these when I install the new door panels on my splitty,
as Idon't like the snap in things.

 

I have to admit, I replaced the rubber seals on my '69, but I don't remember
having to deal with rivets or anything, is this specific to a  certain year?
