That's probably because your 75 *may be* a Federal Model, which didn't
come with a Cat.  A good smog shop will usually check the sticker on
the door jam and/or the engine compartment from the factory which
indicates "catalyst equipped" or not.  California BAR has both the
Federal and California passing standards on file in their computer to
properly test it.  Remember, I said a GOOD smog shop that knows what
they're doing - if it says "catalyst equipped" or "catalyst" on the
sticker, the tech should at least visually pass it as well as properly
use the proper test for such a vehicle for the sniff test (this info
from my smog guy up the block from me, which I have gone to the past
10+ years for my Vanagons, Holiday Rambler Motorhome and 04 KIA
Spectra and he REALLY knows what to look for and is very thorough).

My nickel's worth :)
