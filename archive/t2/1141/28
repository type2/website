Subject: baby dels

Anybody have a scan of the manual for a set of baby Del's?  I just got 
my new (old) set of them from Jim Arnott.  He sent me some CB 
Performance info but I'd like to have the real thing.  It's snowing in 
Chattanooga right now but I'm hoping for decent weather this weekend.  
Thanks...KR
