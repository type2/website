This is exactly what I thought at first too.  I just had another look at it
though and it's definitely a "T" and I'm 90% sure it's the ground connection.
The other connection labeled "G" is cased in plastic and seems a bit more
heavy duty than the other.  Either way, I guess I'll know in a month or so
when I have everything back in and can test it out.  I looked around the
interwebs again tonight for a while and still can't find any solid
information.  I also know I didn't have this problem when I originally
installed the sender so it must have come with directions that I tossed after
the install.

Thanks to everyone for the replies.

  I can't remember when I hooked my sender up, but I think you have it
backwards, and you are not seeing a 'T' but rather a '+'. So you have '+' for
the power, and 'G' for ground, but maybe I have it backwards?
