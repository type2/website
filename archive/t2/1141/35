I have no idea how I missed this before.  In the pic, on my unit the
connection to the gauge is labelled "G" and the ground connection is labelled
"T".

    I can't remember when I hooked my sender up, but I think you have it
backwards, and you are not seeing a 'T' but rather a '+'. So you have '+' for
the power, and 'G' for ground, but maybe I have it backwards?
