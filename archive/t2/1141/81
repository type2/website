Subject: Re: [T2] Is this why 75 bus may be failing inspection?

The replacement distributor from Bus Depot will work (I have one with
a Compu-Fire on my 75 914 1.8 and it works "bitchen"), but must be
timed at 7.5 BTDC with the hose disconnected and plugged.  After the
timing is set, reconnect the vacuum hose.  When you look at the engine
room in my 914, it's virtually identical to the 75 Bus 1.8 (ED) setup,
so I feel right at home working on it (that is, if you like
contortions :) )

As said before, you originally had a dual vacuum style distributor
where the timing is 5 degrees AFTER TDC with both hoses connected.
This was used from 75 thru Mid 1976, then they went to the single
vacuum style.

High CO means it's runnin' a bit rich.  New plugs and a general
tune-up usually solves that problem, but the CO screw in the Air Box
(AFM) may need to be slightly readjusted by someone with an exhaust
gas analyzer at the tailpipe to bring it within specs.

Federal model 75s didn't come with a Cat Converter, but Calif models
did.  If equipped, the Cat may need replacing as well.
