Morning

Got a problem, well actually a "concern" to be more accurate.  Baring something tragic happens, it looks like I will heading to Germany by the middle of next month for what I guess will be for a 5 year stint.  Now I have a '69 Truck that I initially thought about selling but instead will be storing, the concern I have is that I just bought new tires and was wondering if there is something I can put on the tires to prevent dry rotting.  I'm going to put it up on blocks inside a storage unit and take some air out.  Is there something else I can do will they go the way of most VW tires and crack before the tread is worn.
