Subject: Re: [T2] Front blinker seals

Mike, you are right. The aluminum rivet is the correct attachment type
for the front blinker assembly. It presses the seal tightly and
doesn't corrode. They are very easily drilled out. for the most part I
try to keep it factory and try not to out think the VW engineers.
