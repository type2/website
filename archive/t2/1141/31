Subject: re: Oil light flickering

normally this is a sign of worn bearings, or a worn pump.  Get someone with a
pressure gauge to see what pressure the pump is putting out - as i remember
the values are in Bentleys.

I just had a motor re-rebuilt because the lowers were wallered - with 500
miles on them (!!!!) and the clue was the dropping oil pressure - right before
the knock started.
