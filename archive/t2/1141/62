Subject: rear window hatch... ;-(

My rear window hatch needs adjustment... The top edge doesn't close
tight to the body and the passenger side "just" nicks the body when I
close it. I've tried adjusting the arms where they attach to the hatch
and the lock bracket. I suspect that the swing arms have shifted on the
torsion rods. Is there a procedure to realign the arms on the torsion
rods
... ?-(
