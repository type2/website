Anybody have a scan of the manual for a set of baby Del's?

I don't have a electronic copy, but the Dellorto Tech book is the best book
out there that I have seen specific to Dells.  CB Performance carries these as
well (http://cbperformance.com/catalog.asp?ProductID=2)  You may check your
local VW parts place as well.
