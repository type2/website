Or maybe not. I don't recognize the model numbers on the cover. Maybe
someone else on the list is more familiar with these books.

I'm not sure what good a book is for you unless you are planning to do
jet tuning. The basics of idle mixture and speed adjustments are
universal across carbs with just the two screws.
