Subject: Fuse blew and stopped my van

Hi everyone,

I have a '71 van that is mainly stock. Yesterday I was driving and the red
fuse that controls the rear interior light and auxiliary heater which I do
not have blew. When that happened my van ceased to have ignition. My
headlights still worked but no ignition. I replaced the fuse and she started
up and got me home. While replacing the fuse with the ignition off, sparks
occurred between the fuse and the upper contact.

I would like to find out why the fuse blew. What is the general procedure
for doing so?

Thank you.

Max
