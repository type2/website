On the not so mentionable site:

You can also search for "cling wrap" on that site but there's a lot of
cruft to sift through.

Block bus

remove tires/wheels

wrap tightly -- get a friend to help you get good stretch

stack flat with 4"x4"x{width of rim} wood blocks between to keep them
off the floor and off each other. You want the wood blocks touching the
plastic where it touches the rim. Not touching rubber and not just a
4x4x4 stretching the plastic in the center where it's pulled like a
drum skin.

Use the leftover to wrap anything else in storage that you don't want
exposed.
