Yes,

Unfortunately, the BBC iPlayer is not available outside the UK.  I believe the 
website examines the IP of incoming connections and rejects non-UK addresses. 
 Same thing for when I try to watch US shows on Hulu or whatever from the UK. 
 If you have a friend with a Slingbox in the UK, then they could forward the 
program to you.  There are also some companies that provide proxy servers in the 
UK that will make it appear that you are using a UK IP address, however that 
costs money and some networking knowledge.  There used to be a program that 
would *ahem* capture a stream from the iPlayer site, but that program doesn't 
work anymore.  If I find a solution, then I'll let the list know.

As for the show, so far it's light on details about his Bay window and more on 
the locations and cooking.
However he does have a little info on his ride at his website:

Ches, how to do you like your Viking?  We just got a '79 1600c Super Viking. 
 Loads of space with the top up.

Many times I've taken my UK laptop to the U.S. West and East coasts but have
never been able to get BBC iplayer.   I have not changed any settings from
those used at home.   I assumed the BBC website could tell where I was in the
world and blocked access.   If it's possible to get round this problem I would
really like to know how.
