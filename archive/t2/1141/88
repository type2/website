Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Tires

A lot of good advice on this thread.  I would offer this:  I have some 
mounted tires that have been in my garage for 10 years at least and are just 
fine.  Again, the main thing to avoid long term sun exposure.  Dealers store 
some tires in warehouses for years.  Here is a link to tire storage.
