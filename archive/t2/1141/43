Subject: Oil Cap Gasket?

Merry Friday All,

2.5 Parter, one I think I already know the answer to...

1) Should my 79 2L Oil Cap have a rubber gasket ring (within what appears to
be a gasket inset) inside?

1.5) Or does that inset simply allow it to mate with the tube?

2) If I haven't had a gasket for oh, let's say a few thousand miles or more
- any detrimental anything I should be concerned about?

Thanks, Mike
