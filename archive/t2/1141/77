You are talking about an issue with the dual vacuum advance
distributor. With the retard side disconnected you tune with 7.5 BTDC,
with it attached, you tune to 5 ATDC.

This was supposed to help with smog control, otherwise it is not
optimal for the engine, and I always disconnect the retard side when
present.
