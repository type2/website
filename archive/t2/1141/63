Hi Stan,

I'd consider selling them at a small loss and buying new when you get 
back. Less risk than winding up with cracked rubber and unused tread 
five years from now.

Post them for sale on fullMoonbusclub.com or Limbo; there should be lots 
of guys looking for tires in your area as the new camping season approaches.

Happy Trails,

Baring something tragic happens, it looks like I will heading to Germany by the middle of next month for what I guess will be for a 5 year stint.  Now I have a '69 Truck that I initially thought about selling but instead will be storing, the concern I have is that I just bought new tires and was wondering if there is something I can put on the tires to prevent dry rotting.  I'm going to put it up on blocks inside a storage unit and take some air out.  Is there something else I can do will they go the way of most VW tires and crack before the tread is worn.
