Good job. Look at the gear on the side that drives the pin that goes
through the number wheels. It usually develops a hairline crack so it
doesn't grip the pin and spins uselessly on the pin.

It usually spreads the gap between the two adjacent teeth, too, so
that attempts to repair with a spot of super glue haven't been
successful, but a trip to Western Speedometer Repair cost just a few
pennies to have them put a new gear on it and set the numbers to
whatever I wanted.
