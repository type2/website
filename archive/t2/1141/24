There is a way around it, but it's not for the faint hearted: 

  http://hurwi.net/blog/?p=28

The general idea is that you use Tor (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29) to surf anonymously and configure it to use an "Exit server" in the UK.  This satisfies the BBC's server's requirement that you "be in the UK".  To get your browser to use the Tor connection they suggest you use Firefox and install FireProxy with the suggested configuration.  Is this overly complex.. yes!

Best of luck,
Elliott
