Subject: Crankshaft Connecting Rod question

Hello all! I'm in the process of replacing the pistons and cylinders on
my '72 transporter. While I was working my way around the engine putting
on the new pistons, I noticed that there was a fair amount of
play/movement on one of the connecting rods (#4). When I grab the others
and push/pull on them (without moving the crankshaft), none of them
move. I inspected the nuts holding the connecting rod to the crankshaft
and they appear to be as snug as possible. My first instinct tells me
that this movement is not normal. Has anyone experienced anything
similar? I'm trying to decide if I need to open up the crankcase and
inspect or if I'm missing something. I looked through the archives but
haven't found anything. Any thoughts?



Chris
