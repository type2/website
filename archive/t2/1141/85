You could go a step further and inflate the tires with nitrogen (I'm not a
fan, but in this special case it might help). Put the wheel/tire into a
large heavy plastic bag, use a canister vacuum to suck as much air out as
possible, and tape shut. Or just use one of the commercially available
similar products (space saver bag, et. al., but be careful. I am not
impressed with their resistance to abrasion/pinch). Object is to remove as
much O2 and O3 as possible. Use a dark bag to keep the light out, too.
