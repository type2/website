Not too bad a question.I'm sure I have asked dumber questions.

 

Here is a site with good info.www.eguages.com, and you could probably find
your sender hook up info on this page:

or this page:

I can't remember when I hooked my sender up, but I think you have it
backwards, and you are not seeing a 'T' but rather a '+'. So you have '+'
for the power, and 'G' for ground, but maybe I have it backwards?

 

Good luck, and let us know what you dig up. 

 

I think the worst thing that happens if you hook it up backwards, is it
won't work correctly, but you could just swap the wires afterwards.
