Painting is OK but the pop-top is "flexy". Regular auto paint will
most likely start to crack away after a relatively short time. It
should be painted with a marine hull paint.

Greg Potts in Canada did his several years ago and it has held up well.
I'll be darned if I can remember the name/brand of the paint he used
though. 

Greg?
