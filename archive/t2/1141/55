Subject: Re: [T2] Fuse blew and stopped my van

In my experience, fuses can age. Heat, vibration, whatever. I have seen old 
fuses blow for no apparent reason. On the other hand, when there is a 
reason, be glad its there. Since the circuit sparked when you inserted the 
new fuse, something was turned on to draw power, or, there is a capacitor in 
the circuit that charged up with a momentary surge. If the ignition switch 
was off, and do you absolutely know it was off?, there should not have been 
a spark.

If you would like to read about capacitors in a lot of gory detail:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor
The quick explanation is that a capacitor stores a little electricity kind 
of like a barrel stores water. If the capacitor is discharged (empty) it 
will draw a little surge of power until its full when electricity is 
applied, possibly making a spark when the circuit is closed.

If you have a new fuse in place and there is no smoke, most likely there is 
nothing to worry about.

Cheers!!
