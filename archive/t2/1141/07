Many times I've taken my UK laptop to the U.S. West and East coasts but have
never been able to get BBC iplayer.   I have not changed any settings from
those used at home.   I assumed the BBC website could tell where I was in the
world and blocked access.   If it's possible to get round this problem I would
really like to know how.
