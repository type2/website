You don't want to use a two part paint. As earlier stated, it is too hard
and will crack under flex.

This is a really good one part: Interlux Brightsides Polyurethane. Research
"roll and tip," have a helper, and PRACTICE. It's kind of a weird paint.
Once you roll it on and tip it off, don't touch it again. It WILL level out
on its own. I have seen boats hand painted with this that look better than
automotive finishes. It is also extremely tough paint.

Available at most chandleries (west marine,, etc.). If you're in my area
(94501) let me know. I have wholesale accounts at a couple of places here,
and the markup on that stuff is pretty high. Be happy to lend you the
discount.
