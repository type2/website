Scott,

The big destroyers of tire rubber are sunlight and ozone. Tire makers 
introduce wax into the rubber compound and it works its way to the surface 
with the flexing of daily use, and protects the rubber. If you store the 
tire and it doesn't flex, the wax gets eaten away at the surface by the 
ozone and when it is gone, the ozone starts oxidizing the rubber.

You have to apply commercially available anti-oxident products about every 
month to keep up with the ozone if you aren't driving the car.

I don't know of anything that, without re-application, will protect your 
tires while they sit for 5 years .

You could experiment and try applying a very heavy coat of thick wax (floor 
wax?)and then see if it worked when you get back. I'd expect the wax to dry 
up and powder and be gone, though.
