A lot of good points from Jim, some of which remind me of a
conversation with a smog tech who told me that an oil change made the
difference in so many cars he worked on because of gasoline
contamination of the oil. Similarly, a fresh air filter can prevent
rich running.

He also said that a cat in good condition should be able to bring an
engine into passing readings. I did once have one that was so far out
of spec that it made the cat glow red and burnt it out in short order.
Passed smog though!
