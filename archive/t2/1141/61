Hi Stan,

Getting them up off the ground is the first step in the right
direction. I wouldn't let air out, though. That will help them keep
their shape.

Rubber preservative is the next step. There's some German stuff in the
stores now, can't remember the name, otherwise your OTC favorite
should give them a jump on survival.

I'd cover them too to keep dust off since dust will wick moisture away.

John
