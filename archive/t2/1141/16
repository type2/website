  A few things to consider:

1.  Timing - my oil light was flickering at idle when my timing was off.

2.  Sounds silly but check your oil filler spout.  The original 
squeeze-on clamp works better than a hose clamp and the filler cap 
should have the gasket inside and be fully screwed down.

3. 20W50 seems to keep my '79 happiest.
