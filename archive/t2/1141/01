Subject: Re: [T2] Paint Westy Top or Not

I've owned two buses with painted pop-tops and think it really adds to the
overall look of a nicely painted bus.  I guess a lot depends on what the top
looks like before it's painted.  The POs painted both tops, but I am told they
used high quality yacht paint after a thorough prep job.  The first painted
job looked great three years later when I sold it.  The second bus I just
bought but so far so good!
