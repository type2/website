I considered doing that but unfortunately due to the short notice it looks like I will be driving it up to the day I leave so it doesn't give me much room to do that.  It looks like if I put it on blocks, spray some stuff on it and get them covered they should be usable when I get back.  Wish I could take it with me but it has too much rust on it.


"I'd consider selling them at a small loss and buying new when you get back. Less risk than winding up with cracked rubber and unused tread five years from now."
