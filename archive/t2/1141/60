 The mechanical pump on my Dad's westy is starving the carbs above idle.

Hi Greg,

Here they are. I don't know what happened to price though. They used
to sell the Facet style for $39.95, and I also used to pick up the
Carter style at Autozone for the same price, but here they are $83 and
$54. You might ask over the counter if they still have the $40
electric fuel pumps.
