	Does the starter turn the engine over, or not?
	If it doesn't, but a rolling start works, your ignition & FI 
are (more or less) OK and the problem is in the starter circuit 
(sure, I'm being vague  ...  :-/ ).
	If on the other hand the starter does turn the engine over 
but no combustion ensues, ...

	So let's get that further fact please
