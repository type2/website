Subject: Reminder: Buses Of The Corn 2009; one month to go!

Hi Volks,

I took a drive in the country this week, and I was pleasantly
surprised to see how well the corn is doing in Southern Ontario right
now. Which brings me to this reminder... it's only one month to go
until Buses Of The Corn 2009 opens the gates for another awesome
weekend at the Group Camping section of Heber Down Conservation Area.
For those not in the know, that's about 45 minutes east of Toronto,
north of Whitby Ontario, Canada.

Learn more at the website: www.busesofthecorn.com

This year's event will be more of the usual family-friendly goodness:

- Laid-back Friday night campfire
- Breakfast Burritos on Saturday morning
- The totally psychadelic Tie-Dye Workshop
- No charge vending area for all your buy and sell swapmeet needs
- Afternoon Events (To Be Announced)
- 9-hole Frisbee Golf course
- Pot luck dinner with Farm-Fresh Sweet Corn. Served up only hours off
the stalk!!
- Saturday night campfire and music jam

Register for a mere $20 if you paypal before July 15th. After that you
can pay at the gate.

Gates open at noon on Friday August 7th, and the camp closes at noon
Sunday August 9th. See the website for directions, T-shirt info
(Design not yet finalized, but coming soon) etc.

Hoping to see you there,

Greg Potts
