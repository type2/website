Subject: Clutch fork

Trying to remove the clutch fork in the bell housing.
I've moved the circlip over next to left fork.
There is a plastic bushing in the case where the lever
attaches. How does this bushing come out? It's being
stubborn. I dont want to force it if there is something
holding it in place.
