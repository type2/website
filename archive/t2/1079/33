Yup, that'd be my guess.

Also, make sure that the tranny-side bowden tube mount is not cracked. 
I had 2 of those go out on me - they're not a very well designed part 
and it's prone to breaking.

I'm not sure if you already knew this, but make sure you align the 
clutch disk when you put it back together (assuming everything is OK in 
there).  If you don't, you'll be cussing even more :)

If your clutch is worn, it doesn't hurt to get a new one while you have 
the engine out and also get a new pressure plate; the new assembly will 
come with a t/o bearing and clutch disk alignment tool (if I remember 
correctly).   Also, if you have the tools and the patience, check you're 
crank end play while you're at it.
