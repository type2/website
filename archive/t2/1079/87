This would make sense to me... For clearly figuring this out, I'm going to
install the wideband O2 sensor. But what could be the causes for this? The
only thing I can think of is an air leak in the intake or in/at the brake
booster. Anything else?

Will do this today, but last time they looked okay. I'll be getting new ones,
in order to get readings that represent the last couple of miles.

Cheers,
