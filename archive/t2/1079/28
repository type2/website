Subject: Re: [T2] Running too hot

Richard,

Couple of questions:

1) How fast are you driving?
2) Are your timing and valves set properly?
3) Can you reach around and check to see if something is stuck in your 
cooling fan?

Other tips and troubleshooting advice can be found in the Type-2 Library 
under cooling.  Go to www.type2.com, click on "Library" on the side, then 
click on "Cooling" at the top.

Cheers,
   Tom

> I know this has been discussed alot, but I need help.  My 1600 in my 69 westy is running too hot.  Its got all the tin in place and heater hoses as well.  Nothing special about the motor just stock.  It is getting so hot that you can't touch the dizzy or the dip stick.  Runs great, even when hot.  Doesn't miss a beat.  It's hard to start after sitting a few minutes.  Like it's vapor locked.  But will start if you floor it, and runs fine after that.
