Subject: Re: [T2] Why tight steering?

They won't be dry if they have been sitting with light usage out of  
wet roads. The heat and friction from driving plus cold water  
displaces grease quickly, but cool stable grease keeps things pretty  
water tight.

You are right, a dry joint will creak and will also start to clunk.

I have had torn boots before and just replaced the boots with some  
from BusDepot. They are still running strong. But if they are tight  
and still greasy, then they may be faulty or were installed faulty.  
Hot VW's had a whole write-up recently on the vastly different quality  
of balljoints available for Beetles. I'll bet it is the same for buses.
