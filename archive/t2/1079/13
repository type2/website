In Colorado, you aren't required to have the front bumper license plate.  We've
been ticketed twice for our car that doesn't have a bracket (and I'll be damned
if I'm going to drill into my Van's chromed bumper when it's finished).  Each
time, it gets thrown out in court because it's not required. Also, having it
in the back window is allowed as well.

The cop's giving you a hard time because the speed cameras (at least in Fort
Collins) use the front license plate to ID you.  The red light cameras don't
though, so be careful there.

Cheers,
