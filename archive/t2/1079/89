Subject: Oil dipstick tube seal and fan shroud flaps

Hi, I'm Monty and I have a 1974 Westy.  I'm currently rebuilding the engine
and I put on the fan shroud and noticed that the back end of the dipstick tube
does not go in to the oil filler neck portion.  There is approximately a
half-inch gap inbetween the two.  Is there a seal that is supposed to go
inbetween there or do i need to tap the dipstick tube down into the oil filler
neck pipe. 
 
Also, there are two air vents that don't have the flaps at the bottom of the
fan shroud. There are the holes where hinges are supposed to be I guess.  Do I
need the flaps?  Any help would be appreciated thank you.
