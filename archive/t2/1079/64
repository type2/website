Subject: Why tight steering?

78 Camper was rebuilt about 2 years ago, only about 8K driven since 
then, one Vacation to Indiana and some vw campouts in New England.  I 
noticed that the steering was tight then and still is (resistance to 
freely moving the wheel, and unlike before, I cannot move the wheels 
when jacked up to cause the steering to operate without really trying). 
This does not vary with where the steering box is rotated.  I thought it 
was due to new ball joints and redoing of the swing lever bushing, but 
today after greasing the front end I had someone move the steering wheel 
back and forth as I watched- the swing lever moves visibly up and down 
with slight axial play and all else moves OK-what could be causing this 
tightness?  It does not creak.
