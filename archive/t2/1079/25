I have two LC-1s mounted on either side of my 78 bus and I have them 
mounted in the 180 degree bend just after the exhaust manifold.  They 
work well.  In the event that one mixture was blocked, you'd have a very 
lean reading because it will be blowing air, so in a way, you can tell 
when something goes (majorly) wrong.  But for the FI people, that's 
where you send off your injectors to get flow tested (highly 
recommended, btw).

I don't think you'd be able to do that as I believe the sensor would get 
too hot and you'd run out of room as well, but it might be possible. 
You could use the special extender, but again, space is limited. 
Regardless, I think it would probably be overkill.

I would probably agree - just mount one in the collector and make sure 
your carbs are balanced.  You can then look at your spark plugs to make 
sure that there aren't any major differences between each side of the 
engine.

I think I had mine mounted in the collector a long time ago, but it was 
a bit slow to respond to acceleration changes, but I also have a custom 
EFI so I needed the quicker response.  In your case, mounting the sensor 
in the collector will be more than adequate.  The LC-1 is a nice product 
and well made, however, I did one flake out on me.  I brought it over to 
Innovate (Irvine, CA) and they gave me a brand new unit a year and a 
half after I purchased mine!!

Btw, I have the DD gauge and I bought two senders and put them on either 
side of the engine.  I then replaced all of the screw-terminals with 
Omega thermocouple plugs for quick-disconnection:

Now I can can swap the plugs up front to compare the temp of each head.
