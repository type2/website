Subject: wideband 02 sensor

Hello all,
since I'm getting tired of replacing cylinder heads, I want to be sure
my new engine (2.0l type4, standard dual solexes) is running fine. I
already got a DD CHT sensor, but in order to get reliable measurements
of the air/fuel ratio under different load conditions, I'm thinking of
ordering an inexpensive wideband O2 sensor
(http://www.innovatemotorsports.com/products/db.php) for permanent
installation. Do you guys have any experience with this unit and do you
know what would be the best place to weld the bung into the exhaust?
Any help is greatly appreciated!
Cheers,
Timo
