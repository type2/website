Subject: Update: Clutch problems

Ok, after some minor cussing, I've removed the engine from
my '79. I definitely have some cleaning to do. There's CV
joint grease/dirt from when the boots have torn.

I haven't removed the clutch on the engine yet. However,
the first thing I noticed on the tranny was, the clutch
lever on the outside of the bell housing has a major
crack at it's base. The forks and throwout bearing all
look ok visually. I still don't see any major problems
yet that would cause my pedal to be so soft. I can operate
the lever with my hand, it moves the fork/throwout bearing
ok. So far, I'll be replacing the lever,spring, and bearing.
The new cable, bowden tube, clevis pin are all ok, so no
problems there.

It could be things work ok by hand, but when the throwout
bearing hits the tension on the pressure plate, that cracked
lever fails to move the forks any further. Just a thought.
