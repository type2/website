Subject: Re: [T2] Why tight steering?

Wouldn't it creak or squeak if tight/dry?
We had a ball joint on a 71 get "creaky" on a cross country trip due to 
a torn boot and a day of high speed rain traveling; I had to keep 
rubbing grease in there.  Two boots on this are torn but have shiny 
greasy metal underneath.
