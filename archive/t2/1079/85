Just bought a LM-1 + gauge for permanent installation from Innovate
Motorsports and a wideband sensor (see last weeks posts). Haven't been able to
install it, since I'm unsure where to weld the bung to the standard exhaust
yet, but this weekend I'll try my best. The jetting is according to the Solex
manual, so it should be correct. Have you made any bad experiences using their
proposed jets?
Cheers,
Timo
