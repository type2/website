State rules != Cop's interpretation. Nowhere in the rules does it say
it can't be behind the windshield. But it doesn't say it can, either.

Colorado Revised Statutes
Title 42 - Vehicles and Traffic
Article 3 - Registration, Taxation, & License Plates
Part 2 - License Platees
Section 202 - Number plates to be attached
(2) (a) Every number plate shall at all times be securely fastened to
the vehicle to which it is assigned, so as to prevent the plate from
swinging, and shall be horizontal at a height not less than twelve
inches from the ground, measuring from the bottom of such plate, in a
place and position to be clearly visible, and shall be maintained free
from foreign materials and in a condition to be clearly legible.
