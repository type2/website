Subject: fuel line t's

When the cabin heater fellows installed my cabin heater, they used a metal T bettween my fuel filter and pump

The line that came into the pump had a sharp turn in it. I do not like risk in a fuel line. Also, it just falls off if you pull on it. They did use 5.5mm hose, but the wrong clamp.

My question is, I can get clear but will have to follow the brake line while the vehicle is up in the air.

Currently, the T is pointing towards the center of the bus.

Can anyone sell my a better T perhaps even a metal 45 degree?

Alan
