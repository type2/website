Subject: Fw: [T2] Bus graphics

Hi All

 Ken Mitchell (PaintedBus on FMBC) just painted my two buses.  I had the
 buses primed with a primer that accepts water based  paint.  Ken used
 acrylics with a hardener added and hand-painted the bus with artist quality
 brushes.  The acrylic allowed his designs to be very detailed and very
 colorful.   As soon as it was done, I had a two-part urethane clear coat
 applied.  There is a thread on Full Moon Bus Club showing his work on my
 buses.

 Ken has also painted buses using sign paint (enamel) and rustoleum enamel.
 One of the buses he painted using enamels is also viewable on Full Moon Bus
 Club.

 Peace,
 Lisa
