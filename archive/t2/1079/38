Well, I looked at my "total drama, my tank is plugged" problem today.

My fuel filter had brown gas coming out of it.

I popped the hose off the tank, more brown gas and then, nothing.

I poked and prodded. Nothing.

Scratching my head I thought, "OK, perhaps there is no gas" I went and got my gas can and poured some in.

Out came gas, brown.

And then clear gas.

So, my fuel starvation, bumbling engine I can't do the settings on was simply......................No Gas.

Unbelievable.


But Hey, at least I know there is not crap at the bottom of my tank.

Alan.
