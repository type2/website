Hi Tony,

Without knowing the results of a compression test, I'd consider it a 
$100 core. At swap meets I've seen 1.7's of unknown condition sell for 
well less than that.

If at all possible (and if the seller was confident in the value of 
their merchandise) then I would bring a bell housing, starter, battery 
and a compression gauge.

It would help to know what size the flywheel is in order to bring the 
right bellhousing/starter combo... 210/215mm will work with either a 3 
or 5-rib bellhousing, the 228mm needs a bellhousing and matching starter 
from a 76-83 transmission. If it's from an automatic, that's a different 
bellhousing altogether. Maybe it'd be easier to bring your own flywheel, 
as you never know; it might not have one at all...

My family has bought a couple of "shed" engines in the past... The one 
that is in my westfakia was a VW of Canada Reman that was only 2 weeks 
old when the donor vehicle was sideswiped and parked for 18 years. The 
engine was installed basically "as-is" and ran great for about two weeks 
before the rings seized up and it failed completely. After getting towed 
home I pulled it out and had it reworked and by the time it was back on 
the road I'd spent about $600 on it. Since then I have about 18 months 
use on it, and it's running strong thus far.

Happy Trails,
