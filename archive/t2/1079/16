Subject: Bus Jacking Point

Hi,

This may sound silly, but I don't care. Better a silly man than a dead silly man.

I am trying to remember the floor jack jacking point.

I think I have used the transmission bolt down to the torsion bar point to get a center to install my jackstands on the tortion bar ends.

I am assuming the handles of the jackstands point towards the inside of the vehicle.

Been a while and you all are a marvelous resource.

Just short of another baptism in fuel,
Alan

P.S.
Bought 4X4 blocks today too.

Just hit 47, hopefully I am getting smarter.
