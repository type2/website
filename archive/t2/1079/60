Subject: Non walk through '69 Westy, RARE?

Went to look at a sad trio of buses today, asking price ($300) for all of them
was right.  The buses were all too far gone.  One of them did cause me a bit
of sadness.  This was a '69 full Westy and interestingly was a non walk
through, and the interior and canvas were actually still very intact, pretty
darn clean, and nearly complete, oddly except for whatever had used to be
behind the non walk through divider section.  Now I've owned a lot of buses,
even several passenger 9 pass bays, but although I've probably seen one of
these at a show or in a mag somewhere, I haven't seen many, certainly haven't
passed on buying one before.  Anyone have any idea how uncommon they
were/are?  I passed on the 3 anyway, unfortunately even for $100 each they
weren't worth dragging home, though the interior in this one would have made
someone happy without much work...  It is in AK though unfortunately volks...
 
Just wondering about rarity.  Anyone on here have one?
 
John
