Subject: OT: Misc Bay window parts and Type3 (fastback/squareback),

Hello all, first of all I apologize for an off-topic post. As some of you
may know Brandon and I are moving and we need to downsize a little bit. I
have a bunch of parts left over from my fastback and other items that i just
dont need/want anymore.
I am posting on the mail lists first, then I wil post to thesamba and of
course craigslist, hopefully someone here in the list wants some of this!

*Type 3:*
Horn button and ring(s)
Squareback side windows (tinted)
Glovebox with cable
Passenger side rear fender - fits '70 and up
Fuel injected fuel tank
All fastback window chrome
side view mirrors
literally the whole front cowl/windshield btm/dash area (body section)
Fastback rear window pop-outs *
dual quiet pack and header *
Shelby 500 rims (no tires) * fits bug and T3 (has bigger backspacing for the
bigger rear drums on a T3)
T3 short block (minus heads) with fanshroud and most engine tin (I might
have to look around but pretty sure i have it all) *

*Bay window:*
fuel tank
rear hatch from a '78 champagne
set of wide 5 rims with tires *
Literally a whole front bus section, but about 4-5 inches in front of the b
pillar, currently has front beam (no rims/tires see above), windshield, dash
and steering wheel/column etc. (so far we have had suggestions of: make a
bar, bbq, gaming station, small trailer! use your imagination!!!)
Riviera pop-top with canvas (in pretty decent shape) *
misc BN4 heater ducts
lots of hubcaps
misc T1 engine tin
Wheel adapters for wide 5 to narrow 5 (i have never actually used them, not
sure if they apply for a bus, but they look like bus dimensions)

All this stuff is u-haul, but we always have a means if you really want it
but cant get it to your house ($ to cover fuel costs if you help
maneuver/lift).
Most of the stuff I would like to give away to someone who needs/wants it
and the more you take the better, however there are some items that i would
want minimal $ for (i have marked with *)

We also have a an '87 fox for sale currently at $750
http://portland.craigslist.org/wsc/cto/1259749808.html
(we have a set of good wheels and tires for this for an additional $100)

As well as an '81 vanagon AT westy - it is not yet posted, please call for
details

(...and if someone was really interested in a '71 510 datsun station wagon
with 2.6 merc capri (german ford) engine and 4 barrel holley (brand new) ,
C4 3spd AT tranny with stage 1 shift kit - brand new rebuild, 4 wheel disc
brakes, etc. I would think about parting with it :) please contact me.


My cell # is 971 533 5240 we are located right off murray exit and hwy 26

I know i have more, but this is at least a good start.



ALSO - we are looking for any parts you would need to convert the early bus

articulating vw bus :)
