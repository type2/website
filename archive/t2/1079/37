Hmm.. You could try bringing it to a muffler shop and have them weld it 
(or a radiator shop to braze it).  That will definitely help out.  I 
actually had one crack and also had the bolt shear off.  I would 
recommend pulling out those two bolts and replacing them with new ones. 
  Very simple and easy preventative measure.

When I do it, I use a dial indicator with a magnetic base stuck onto the 
flywheel.  Then have the indicator thingie pressing on the case and pull 
the flywheel in and out.
