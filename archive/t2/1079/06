Check here for VW Wiring Diagrams:

>>Every once in a while my 1977 fuel injected bus will not start. I've had
>>numerous suggestions that it may be either an alternator or voltage
regulator
>>problem. 
My bet would be the Voltage Regulator, My Father's GMC truck was doing the
same thing. I switch the regulator an it starts every time.
 
>>I have this voltmeter and just tested the battery right after it wouldn't
start and got 12.23 >>volts.Isn't that enough juice to engage the starter?
It should be enough. But test it on the starter poles under the bus. It should
be the same. If it not, check you battery cables. My look great at the battery
but were green in the middle. I change them, it starts everytime.
 
>>Are there some tests that I could do to find out what is giving me this
problem. 
Test the battery with the bus running: See if the alternator/regulator is
working. On my bus it puts out 14 volts with the lights, radio, etc
running. Because you have new/rebuild alternator, this test should tell you
the regulator is not working.  
 
Also some autopart places (I thinking autozone) will test your alternator for
free, in hopes that you will buy one with them. I would ask them to test it
when then try sell you a new one tell them it not german parts, so it will not
fit your bus.

P.S. please push it don't jump the bus. Jumping It will mess up the FI brain.
