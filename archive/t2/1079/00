Subject: Bay Window Notebooks from Moleskine

http://www.moleskine.com/about_us/news/moleskine_goes_to_woodstock.php

Of course, it's a late bay design that didn't even exist during
Woodstock, but I'll take what I can get. =D

If you've never used a Moleskine notebook, the paper is amazing. Use
it with a fountain pen or rollerball or even a gel and writing feels
frictionless. Pretty slick.
