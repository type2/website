Subject: Electrical problem

I'm having an annoying electrical problem that keeps happening because of my
own negligence stemming from the fact that I have been too lazy to learn the
electrical stuff. So anyway:
Every once in a while my 1977 fuel injected bus will not start. I've had
numerous suggestions that it may be either an alternator or voltage regulator
problem. I replaced the alternator about a year ago. I've just put in a new
battery. I've checked the cables and cleaned the posts. It seems to happen
after an extended period of driving, say 30-60 miles or more. Like I'm
traveling from Denver to Durango, CO. (about 500 miles) and stop for gas 1/2
way, try to start back up and get nothing. I usually jump it (against Muir's
advice) or push start it) to get it going again. I have this voltmeter and
just tested the battery right after it wouldn't start and got 12.23 volts.
Isn't that enough juice to engage the starter? Are there some tests that I
could do to find out what is giving me this problem. It's driving me bonkers!!
Please, give me a hand......
