Subject: Carb Adjustment

Hello all,
today I drove my bus for the first time after almost one year of engine
rebuilding and getting lost in the details. Great feeling to drive it again -
had a big smile on the face (and of course a bit of fear of having something
done horribly wrong during the rebuild)! Nevertheless, I tried to adjust my
rebuilt carbs (standard dual solexes) according to Bentley and Richard Atwells
advice. I have a question about setting the initial idle of the carbs: I
gapped the throttle plate to 0.1mm, turned the mixture screws all the way in
and 2.5 turns out. I disconnected the solenoid of the central idling system to
render it ineffective after turning out the central idle speed and mixture 2.5
turns. I then synced the carbs using a pair of snake-style synchrometers by
turning the stop screws on the throttle plate in/out. What is the correct
vacuum that should be achieved? As I understand it correctly, I have to set
the initial idle by turning the mixture screws on both carbs to get 500-700
rpm. But this is affecting rpm and in turn affecting the vacuum... So, should
I try to just have them in sync at, say 6 (don't remember the unit) and then
set the idle with both mixture screws to 500-700 rpm or what is the correct
procedure? I'm a bit lost and could need some help. Thanks in advance!
Cheers,
Timo
