Hey Timo,

I'm no bay expert. I only have a splitty. I would look for leaks. Anyone 
have a good way to locate a vacuum leak somewhere in the myriad of hoses? I 
think someone said that blowing some propane (DANGEROUS) from a torch around 
all the hoses and joints would show it up as an increase in engine rpm. 
Judging from your symptoms, if its a leak, it must be a small one. A large 
leak would cause power loss and driveability problems.

Chris,
