Timo,
i;ve been running into the same problems. i have a 2.0L with dual solex. im
currious what jets you are running. i have a recently rebuilt engine and
carbs. i just took all of the tins appart cleaned and got them all to fit
correctly................stil runs hot.  I'm starting to suspect my brake
booster as a major vac leak.    Disconnect that hose and plug it and see how
your temps do....

I just got my hands on good throttle plates with tight bushings, i am
running 135 main jets, and 140 air correction as well as 55 for the idle.
even at idle my engine temps creep up over time untill my oil light comes on
with oil temp at 220...

check your brake booster.
