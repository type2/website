Subject: Re: [T2] lookin' at an engine...

Pick up truck, bus with seat out, flashlight

type 1 engine?
 $200 in $20 dollar bills

type 4
 $400, $200 in hundreds, and the rest in 20 dollar bills

Biggest thing to figure out is what size the bore is on a type 4 and that 
can probably be figured out by the part number on the head, might bring a 
can of carb cleaner and shop rag if there is lots of sludge in there. Screw 
driver/wrench to get the valve cover off.

both would require a copy of "how to rebuild a volkswagen engine" to Id the 
heads

Adjust price to what is there, and what it is worth in your area.
