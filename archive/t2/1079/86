Timo,

I've never done any Solex jetting. Just suggesting the OS as a diagnostic 
tool. Is there some way your engine is going lean under load or high RPM? 
Have you read the plugs?

install it, since I'm unsure where to weld the bung to the standard exhaust

Solex
manual, so it should be correct. Have you made any bad experiences using 
their
proposed jets?
