New ones made of unobtanium for a long, long time.  It's usually the first
thing I look for when checking out late Bays in a boneyard.

Find a good used one from a boneyard 74-79 Bus  Contact Chris (-at-) Busted Bus
in Colorado, he might be able to help.

I've heard from others that have used straight neoprene hose with the
appropriate sized metal elbow for the necessary bend is what's becoming more
and more commonly done these days.
