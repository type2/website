I agree with looking for vacuum leaks. A technique that works for me is to
take the spark plug leads off the running engine one by one to see if there is
a cylinder that doesn't change the revs or changes it less than the others.
Then spray WD40 or whatever around the joints for the inlet manifold for that
cylinder.

Another problem that caused me a bit of grief is leaks up the spark plug
thread with the cht sensor on it. I eventually stuck in another spark plug
with the sealing washer still on it.
