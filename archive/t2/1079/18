	The London fog mentioned was largely caused by inefficient 
coal-burning.
	Prof Harold Johnston, chem dept UC Berkeley, claimed to have 
discovered photochemical smog.
	PCV was a good idea and should have been required everywhere 
by the mid-1960s.  I don't rate so highly many of the other measures 
required in the USA esp. Calif.  A properly tuned engine, competently 
driven (e.g. minimal use of choke, small throttle openings when cold, 
etc) doesn't emit much.
	My '73 VW 1600 has no emission controls.
