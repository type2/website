Hi Mike,
this is a permanent setup. The company also offers handheld
"sniffer"-style products. I don't think it can differentiate between one
injector blocked, while the others being rich or vice versa. You could,
of course weld four bungs (one for each cylinder) in the heat exchangers
(right below the cylinder heads) and check the AFR successively... Since
I have an engine with dual carbs, I would need only two of them, but I
think I will try the installation with just one bung welded in the
middle of the stock exhaust. Anybody has any experience doing this or
where the best location is?
Cheers,
Timo
