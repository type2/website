Jeremy, I hope it is a starter solenoid because i have the exact same bus
and problem and i just returned from the store from buying a new one.

Now, can somebody give me a quick rundown on changing JUST the solenoid?
Do I need to remove the starter and then swap it to avoid a struggle?  How
do you hook the little square on the end into the starter?

I am going to take a look at my ground-strap while i am under there,
maybe remove it to clean up the contacts.

Thanks,
James
