Subject: Re: [T2] wideband 02 sensor

Can this be used as a"sniffer". a stand-alone gauge you can stick in the 
tailpipe for tuneup adjustments?  How can it differentiate for a 
condition where one injector may be blocked but rich overall will be 
"hidden" by a normal overall reading?  Or conversely, one being too open
when the rest is lean?
