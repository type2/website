Subject: heater boxes...

I've got a coupla heater boxes that seem to be OK internally...
but have the usual rust thru's in the tin...:-(

First ? ...Anyone have success in repairing the tin...Brazing?
J B Weld? Can the tin be cleaned to bare metal and a surface
coating added to prolong their life...Some sort of ceramic...???
Second ? ...Can the tin be removed by unclamping the edges
without destroying them...I figger the tin might be easier to re-
pair on the bench...
Third ? ...Why aren't replacement tins available? I've seen lots of
usable heater boxes with only rusted out shells...???
