Here's a picture of what I used back in the 1970s.

  At that time it seemed like inserts were  not easily found - like  
they belonged to some esoteric clan of machinists.  Now the inserts  
are even sold at FLAPS and Ace Hardware.  The tool consists of a 7/16  
tap which has been brazed to a VW head stud - the black tape on the  
stud was my depth gauge; the nut on the end has also been brazed.

Liberally coated with heavy grease the tap was used to drill out the  
case, and hopefully the grease caught the metal shavings.  A 7/16  
threaded rod was cut to the appropriate length, double-nutted and  
screwed in.  I recall even doing one of the repairs without doing  
anything more than removing the valve cove, then the stud from the  
stripped location, using the tool, inserting the new rod, "torquing "  
the stud down, adjusting valves on that side - and finished.

Google for"helicoil" - that's the type of thing to do the job right.

Good luck,
Pat
