Yes, mine is cracked. Held together with JB Weld and a thick cable tie.
Not working...crack still there, but not as wide.

I'm having trouble locating these two parts, the bowden tube mount and
the clutch lever. I'm gonna try bustedbus.com.

Since I have the engine out, I was planning on replacing the clutch,
pressure plate and T/O bearing.

I'll have to review my endplay adjusting procedures. Last one I did was
on a beetle in '82.
