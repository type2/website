Yes, meaning that when you add EGR, you need to advance the timing 
because the EGR causes a slower combustion.  And conversely, when you 
remove EGR, you need to retard the timing because the combustion happens 
sooner.  Because our cars come equipped with EGR, that would mean that 
you need to retard the timing if it is removed.

Except it's kinda hard to use while driving the car :)

I have the Listen Up unit in front of me all disassembled and ready to 
use.  I will give it a go tomorrow morning during our tuning session and 
let you know how it works.  I'll be able to hook it up to my car radio 
and hear the engine - should be pretty neat!
