Subject: Buses Of the Corn T-Shirt

Hi Volks,

I just wanted to announce that the 2009 event T-shirt design has just 
been posted at www.busesofthecorn.com.

It'll be printed in black on a quality white cotton Gildan T-shirt. 
Order online and pick up at the event is the preferred means of 
commerce; but those looking for a mail-order transaction can also be 
accommodated.

Visit www.busesofthecorn to see the design and for ordering info.

Apolgies to the Vanagon list; this year the shirt has no vanagon 
content; except that there will be plenty of vanagons in attendance at 
the event.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
