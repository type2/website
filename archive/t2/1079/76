Subject: [T2] Carb Adjustment - again

Hello all,
I'm still fiddling with my carb adjustment. Symptoms are way too high cylinder
head temperatures. This is a 2liter type4 with rebuilt standard solexes, all
original jets, engine has new heads, cooling system and tinwork in place, and
a rebuilt dizzy. Now up to my questions:
After I have adjusted the throttle plate gap to 0.1mm and to 0.6mm for fast
idle, I know I should sync the carbs for idle. I disconnected the solenoid of
the central idling system to render it ineffective. By using a pair of
snake-style synchrometers I synced the carbs by turning the stop screws on the
throttle plate in/out (in on the carb that has too much flow, out on the one
having less flow, until they are equal). Is this the right way to do it? Or
should I leave the left carb alone and only adjust the right one, so that the
vacuum to the dizzy is not affected?
Okay, after this, I've got an idle speed of 1000rpm. Bentley says to adjust
the idle to 500-700rpm. I lowered the idle by turning in the mixture screws in
the throttle body with central idling system still disconnected and
"pizza-slices" removed from the carbs. Is this correct? I think this way, I'm
just leaning out the mixture, but shouldn't I be setting the idle speed by
adjusting mixture and air (the throttle plate gap)?
Since I want to go camping in 2 weeks, I need to get this done. Beware of my
fiancie if I have to cancel the trip!
Thanks in advance!
Cheers,
Timo
