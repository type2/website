Subject: Re: [T2] ...Strip tease...

I used time-serts for the first time a few days ago when two intake  
manifold studs pulled out of an old head.  I had considered step studs  
and helicoils but then a mechanic friend of mine said "No, no, no,  
what you want are time-serts," and he loaned me a kit to install  
8x1.25 mm size inserts.

All I can say is: WOW.  They were easy to install (although I'm always  
nervous when drilling out holes in expensive parts) and are as solid  
and permanent a repair as can be imagined.

I'd recommend time-serts over helicoils any day.  I've never been that  
confident in helicoils staying in place (I mean, once you break the  
tang off the only thing holding the coil in place is spring force).   
The time-serts are cold-expanded into place as part of the  
installation process.

The only downside to time-serts is their price tag.  If my friend had  
not loaned me his kit I would have gone with the step stud for sure.   
The 8 x 1.25 mm kit goes for somewhere from 80 to 100 dollars and only  
contains a handful of the actual inserts.  What you're really paying  
for is the twist drill, the tap, the countersink cutter, and the  
installation tool.
