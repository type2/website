Subject: More information on timing advance and how EGR plays into the

So, in my on-going saga of high head temps, I've started in the 
direction of EGR as that's really the last thing (or lack thereof) that 
I can figure to be the cause of my high head temps.

After some research, it turns out that when you introduce exhaust gases 
into the mixture, you also need to advance timing because the mixture 
takes longer to burn.  However, when the EGR valve is disabled (as I 
have done), that would also mean that you need to retard the timing 
otherwise you end up with too much advance!

I'm kinda curious how many people have disabled their EGR and how many 
also retarded their timing accordingly - I know I didn't!  I just stuck 
with the same 7.5BTDC at idle and didn't think twice about it... silly me!

Soooooo... first I'm going to try retarding my high-RPM advance curve 
and see if that lowers head temps a little bit.  I will probably also 
get my EGR back up and running again because it looks like it actually 
increases economy and performance as well.  According to an article 
linked below, EGR can also lower combustion temps by a few hundred 
degrees as well - win-win!

Here is some interesting reading:

And since I'm trying to hear engine noises (knock specifically), I'm 
building one of these:

Just thought I'd share those tidbits with all of you ;)

enjoy!
