Hi,

I was slightly active on the list about 10 years ago (in the era of the
traveling hubcap), but then got busy with some larger projects and had to
mothball my '71 Westy to force me to focus on those tasks.  

I'm off to yet another adventure and have come to the decision that it's
time to let her go.  I see that the classified ads part of the site is
presently unavailable.  Do you have a confident schedule as to when that
will be up and running again?

Of, would you object to a one time broadcast to the list of a brief
description of my bus and a personal email address?  Or, what do you
recommend?  

It won't go for much, and probably shouldn't.  But it only has 59K on it,
ran like a politician after money before I sat it in a garage for 5 years
and I'd like it to go to a good home.  I know all that sounds pretty self
serving, but it's true.  

Thanks very much,

John Hartranft
Flint, MI
