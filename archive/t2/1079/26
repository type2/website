What are you getting for head temps?  Every time I am cruising at 70ish, 
my head temps start skyrocketing (400+)!  They will also start shooting 
up when I am going up a hill in third at high revs.

I just ordered an EGR filter and I'm going to get the EGR system 
operational to see if that help things out.  I'd be curious to know what 
kinda temps your seeing, though.  Like you, I'm burning through heads 
like it's nobody's business...
