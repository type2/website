Subject: "Shore Power" to charge 2nd Battery

So I have installed my Hella second battery relay and it works like a 
charm, charging the battery while I drive and powering my heater on 
those cold Canadian nights. HOWEVER, I recently embarked on an "in bus" 
roadtrip entertainment center (Flatscreen, DVD etc)  project which will 
require a little more power from my system, though not prohibitive 
while the bus is running (300w) it would run the battery down fairly 
quick with the bus off. So, I got to thinking that it would be nice to 
be able to do something similar to what they do on sailboats, plug my 
bus in and have the "shore" power charge my accessory battery when I 
have access to a power outlet. Has anyone got any  experience or 
thoughts on this ?
