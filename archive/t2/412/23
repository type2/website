Subject: Bus For Sale In MA 

Hey List,
I am very close to obtaining the bus of my dreams which means I have to sell
my bus. It is a 1975 Riviera camper with a full 75 deluxe westy interior (blue
plaid). This bus is in fantastic condition. Boston Engine rebuilt 2.0L W/
17,000 mi one rebuilt head had a bad valve seat so I replaced both heads w\
NEW ones 2k ago engine and tin were completely detailed clutch and all exhaust
components were replaced w/ new, basically every thing in the engine
compartment is new. I am posting this to the list only at this time.
 I cant sell until the first week in August because of plans I have made. I
will answer any questions any one may have and I will advertise this van
heavily in a couple of weeks. Please e mail me off list for more information.

 Thanks Jamie
