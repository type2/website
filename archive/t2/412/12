That would be the right hose.
But replace them both because if one failed, the other is likely to fail very soon.
They are around $10 from a VW flaps or internet vendor.

Yes, they are filled with brake fluid.

If one hose becomes plugged, it will reduce the effectiveness of the brakes on that wheel.  Also, when you release the brakes a plugged hose can cause residual line pressure which can cause the brake pads to drag.  If your bus pulls to the left under braking and your right brake pads are more worn than the left ones, it's very likely you have a faulty hose.  They seem to last about 25-30 years before they do this.
