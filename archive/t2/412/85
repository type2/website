Subject: help fuel from carb leaking freely everywhere?

well i have recently put a new dizzy in a single vac what the engine origianlly calls for and i set at 7.5 tdc and then set the dizzy close enough to in time as possible..to get it to start...
well i thought that i smelled a whiff of fuel when i put the dizzy in but wasnt sure and even after i checked all the new lines for cracks or holes or the more noticable for wet spots....
didnt see any......
thought hmm mabye the smell was just in the air from my old gas jug about 5 ft or more away,....
well went to try to crank the bus and she tunrned and turned but never fired....

i went back and checked the advance/retard on the dizzy and smelled gas really bad and asap undid the battery cable from the battery....

i then looked under the bus and there was a fair amount of gas leaking onto the ground with a steady drip from the drivers side valve cover towards the front......()<not like in muir when i say front i mean the front of the bus,,..
i ran the drip up to the back of the carb on my left hand side looking at the carb...

where is this comeing from is there a gasket on the carb or something that could be leaking?

could of possibly the new single vaccum dizzy of made the leak worse if there was one already there if not could it of made one ...
i am thinking change in pressure when i ask this..

this is a major problem cause now i have gas everywhere.. i dont do fires to well at all....
i pushed the bus out in front of my house in the driveway just in case of anything.....'
never can tell and didnt wabnt to take a chance tonight on it sitting there in the carport leaking gas while we slept..

another thing i did notice that when i went to crank the bus it didnnt look like i had as much gas in the tank on the needle as i remember but cant be sure of this and i havent seen any leak or smelled any strong leak but then again i havent really fooled with the bus all week kinda took a break from it and now came back to this...

 hope someone has a idea...?
peace
