Zach:  My "solution" to this ridiculous problem needed the assistance 
of a machine shop. I'll have to paint a word picture here.

Start with a slotted screwdriver with a very long thin shank,  whose 
blade fits nicely in the idle mixture screw slot. This alone would 
have worked. Given enough patience, I could find one  -  and only one 
-  angle and location at the rear of the fan housing that would allow 
the tip into the IMS slot.  To make this search, and use,  easier, I 
choose a steel tube whose ID was just a tad bigger than the OD of the 
IMS, and whose wall was very thin. The shop welded this over the tip 
of the screwdriver so that the tube enclosed the slotted tip. 
Guiding this in by feel was no easier than guiding the tip alone. But 
it surrounded the IMS and kept the tool from slipping off while one 
did the adjustment.

Maybe not the most clever idea, but it works.

The real solution is to trade in the T2 for a Ghia. The wide open 
engine compartment on the Ghia is a dream.

Hope this helps.
