Subject: When is a bus..a Vanagon?

Hiya, little help,

Does anyone know if the exhaust system from a ' 81 Vanagon would fit a 2L ' 
79 bus engine? I don't know the engine size of the Vanagon but looks like it 
would bolt
right on it. I've heard the ' 79 has " Vanagon heads." Or, does the Vanagons 
have
' 79 bus heads? (hic).This system would save me the trouble of tapping the ' 
78
system on the bus for a Ox sensor. 


' 79 Cal bus (The Weasel)
