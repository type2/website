well like you said, could be the master cyl, a wheel cyl, even busted
brake line. I would just guess master cyl. What you need to do is go
around & pull the wheel hubs off. Check each wheel cyl. If all are dry
& the flexable hoses going to them are not leaking there is a very
good chance that it's your master cyl. 

I suppose you could check the fluid level & then just pump the pedal a
lot & see if the level goes down (would indicate a leak) or if the
system just never creates pressure to begin with (indicate a master
cyl problem). I personally wouldn't drive it any untill I found the
cause of the lack of pressure, but I'm sure you agree with this.
