Nope, unless you are a glutton for punishment.  By 1,000 miles the engine should be mostly broken in, and you should already have changed your oil at least once.  Some people recommend that you drive conservatively until the 3,000 mile mark but moderate highway driving should be okay.  Just don't climb Pike's peak or anything.  :-)
