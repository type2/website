Subject: Brazilian Tire deciphering

Just wondering if anyone can help deciphering what tires the p.o. had 
installed on the 60 dc I recently bought.

here's everything written on the sidewall

SL93
(116) 693
BRP 116.09
EUROCCO  HP
SEM CAMARA
6.00 - 15L
Cap Carga B
replaces 165 380
tubeless max load press  1,005lb  32psi
Plies Tread 2 rayon Sidewall 2 Rayon
Industria Brasileira

They are very thin, with decent tread left, but definitely don't look 
right.  All I get from this info is they are 4 ply 1,000lb 32psi, and 
probably 165?  Through reading the archives, I can see just by the 
1,000lb rating they are undersized, just wondering if I could keep one 
for a spare or something.

Any help appreciated
