Subject: Distributor gear question

I'm ready to install the distributor drive into the case after rebuild. I
looked at Muir's method and it sounds pretty reasonable. There is one thing he
didn't mention, however. On other types of engines that I have worked on, when
the distributor gear is inserted, it twists about 30 degrees from when it
first starts to mesh until it is fully seated. So, in order to have the rotor
point to a particular position, it is necessary to insert the distributor
about 30 degrees in advance to account for this twist and let it rotate to the
desired position as it is pushed in. My question is this. On the VW, is there
any such twist to account for and, if so, how much? '71 bus.

Sincere thanks,
Bill Moon
