Does anyone have any tips on how to get these things going. I've filled the
tank and pressurized it. The ight one sprays really well, but the left one
just drizzles out. I need them both to spray to pass my safety inspection. How
do I get to them?? Funny, this is the first time this has ever com up in the 8
years I've had the bus. BTW it's a 1970 if that matters
