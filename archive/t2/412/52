This probably won't be a problem, because the 75 trans is only geared taller in the first three gears.  Fourth gear is almost identical to the 69 transaxle.  The only problem might be that it will be a little harder to start off on a hill, for example, but unless you live in San Francisco and carry 1,000lbs of sand in your bus every day, you probably won't notice the difference.
