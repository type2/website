Subject: High Country Bus Festival T-Shits .....LAST reminder

hey Volks:

Just a reminder that he deadline for HCBF T-shirts is July 1st.
A few people have emailed that their checks are in the mail late, and with 
the 4th of July Holiday, I am going to wait to give the order numbers to the 
printer until July 7th.

T-shirts will not be available at the event, so if you want yours, be sure 
to get your order in the mail soon.

Thanks Ya'll and we'll see you in a few weeks.
