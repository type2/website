Does anyone know the actual story behind this picture?  Was it from a news
article?

I'm curious as to the reason why these folk appear to be trying to save what
they can of their household goods from a raging fire.  If this in Mexico,
volcanic eruption?  Forest fire?  If South America, forest fire or gorilla
attack?  Any ideas?
