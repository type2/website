One day, when I have lots of free time (not taken up by repairs on my bus or
school work), I plan to design a tool box that'll bolt to the undercarriage
lit the side step or the propane tank. It'll extend about 3 inches below the
side of the bus and about 1/2 way to the middle of the bus. There is almost 5
inches of dead air between the bottom lip of the bus and the floor boards, so
you'd get almost 8 inches of height inside the box. The door would use a piano
hinge and would be L-shaped so the openning of the box would be greater than 3
inches. The box would be constructed out of aluminum diamond-plate. The goal
is to have a box that'll hold a floor jack, jack stands, and other large
tools.

I've made preliminary measurements and drawings. I want to sit down with a CAD
package and lay it out right...

I've also thought about taking a reciprcating saw to the back corners of my
bus and replacing them with diamond-plate aluminum boxes - with holes for
standard taillights and room for tools or other stuff. I'll have to see. I'm
about to spend some time under my bus trying to reattach my rear bumper - with
Dad's mail jeep at hand (the body is entirely fiberglass and diamond plate -
he's a rural post man in the 'rougher' parts of Crystal River, Florida - when
it's not submerged from a storm surge).
