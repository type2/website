Subject: Kadron idle adjusting

Does anyone have any good tips on getting to the idle mixture screw on a set
of Kadrons. The right side is sort of a PITA, but the fan shroud blocks the
left side. Someone has to be smarter than me out there (otherwise this world's
in a heap o trouble) and figured this out. Thanks

Zach
