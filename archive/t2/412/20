Anybody know what kind of an operation the tranny swap would be - will the
drive shafts mate up - a strait swap or will I have to make all kinds of

I would use the tranny from the 69.  The 75 trans is geared too high. You
will encounter problem with the engine not getting enough rpm to keep it
cool!
