Hello,

I guess this should be a Friday post. It is just an up
about what I have been doing with my bus.

I had been loosing vacuum in my brake booster so I
tested it and it would not hold ANY vacuum. So, I went
ahead and ordered a rebuilt one. While I had my debit
card out, I went ahead and bought a new Master
cylinder and all of the brake "flex" hoses my bus
needed. When I removed the brake servo, I noticed that
it was FULL of brake fluid! This threw me for a loop
so I checked the archives and found that this is
caused by a bad master cylinder. It is a good thing I
went ahead and bought a new one! My rebuilt brake
booster looked pretty good inside and out, but it came
with a torn push rod boot. I switched it with the boot
off my old one and made sure that both sides of the
booster could hold vacuum. Good so far. I reinstalled
the booster and master cylinder as well as 3 of the 4
brake hoses. I would have the last one installed, but
the wasps, dirt dobbers, and black widdow spiders gave
me the heebee-jeebees and I had to get out of there. 

I am currently waiting for my new 70 amp alternator
and the booster vacuum hose to arrive. Once those are
installed, my Bus will technically move and stop on
its own. While I was under the bus today, I noticed
that my electric fuel pump was leaking. Gurr... It is
not the "correct" pump for it anyway. Looks like I
will have to brake out the debit card again....

I'm not complainin'. It keeps me busy.

Anyway, take care!
