Subject: Voltage Regulator Question

List,
After re-installing the engine in my '72 this weekend, I noticed the generator light was on with the key in the off position.  In running through the troubleshooting checklist in the Bentley I noticed that that symptom indicates a faulty (burned) votage regulator.  I dug through my parts stash and found another regulator (condition unknown), plugged it in with the same results.  If I am reading everything correctly, I now have two faulty regulators.  Is there a way to test a voltage regulator?  I didn't find anything in my manuals or the archive outlining such a procedure.  Are there other causes which would cause the gen light to stay on when the key is off?  When the key is moved to the on position, only the oil light is on.  I am hesitant to drive the bus until I get this sorted out.
Thanks in advance,
Billy Ray
