Subject: darn shifting ...

Hey,

I've searched the archives for this question, and found a bunch of OTHER 
questions exactly like mine, but couldn't track down the answers... so 
here's the same old question again. I am very sorry if this is a ... what's 
the acronymn? Old recurring something question ... anyhow:

Trouble shifting from third to second to first.  Once I'm in first goes to 
second easily, but in becoming increasingly difficult.  Third to first 
almost always impossible, must go from reverse to first for a sure start.

Sound familiar?  I've taken the shifting lever out and inspected the parts, 
reverse stop plate, that big spring, etc.  I am pretty sure the play is 
here; trouble with the small rod coming out of the bottom of the shift lever 
connecting with it's matching groove in the rod which goes to the trans.

One notable thing, the rod which goes to the trans, it has a small bend in 
the front of it, like it once was bent too far down (towards ground) and 
someone tried to pry it back up.  Do I need a new one of these? How hard is 
it to replace?

Vehicle info:
'72 transporter, manual trans 1700 ... etc.

Thanks a bunch!
- Ian
