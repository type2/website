Thanks Snoopy,

Ah, that makes a lot of sense, thats a really good idea.  I guess I 
should have been more explicit about my bus situation ! Being a 1973 
Hightop Campmobile I too am without the handy shorepower 
charger/inverter, and I balked a little at the cost of a "shore power" 
circuit (700.00USD).

How long does it generally take to charge a battery with a standard 
charger ?

I'm pretty excited about my entertainment system, I've got all the 
components together and I've just got to get them all in the bus and 
running. It'll be running a 15" Flatscreen, DVD player, Surround Sound, 
TV Tuner (Antenna) and of course Video games ... A little out of place 
in a 73 Bus maybe, but I've gotta keep my passengers happy, goodbye  
"Are We There Yet".

Anyone else out there hiding any technology in their bus ?

Steve
