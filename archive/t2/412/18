If this spring is not clamped down properly or misaligned it can rub against
the pushrods.  I found when I tore down my engine that 3 of the pushrods had
been rubbing like this - one was almost worn through. :-O  It looked like
someone had put it in a lathe and turned it down.  Look for a polished band
about 1/4" wide.

It's very easy to loosen the rocker assembly and push the spring into place,
provided it isn't bent up.  Recheck your clearances afterwards to make sure
nothing is awry.
