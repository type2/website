Well, the guy from Apex Technical School won't be calling you back...
Best bet at this stage is to find a local shop that'll take you on as
an apprentice/gofer and learn as much as you can. Not to dissuade
you from this, but you do realize that AC VW mechanics are work-
ing on an inverted pyramid of available vehicles...Everytime some-
one on the list offers a parts car/bus, that's one less that you
could work on for a living...They ain't makin' anymore of 'em so
the available pool shrinks day by day...That said, I wish you luck.
You might try a local vocational school, BTW, there may well be
a teacher left who is familiar with VW's...It's a shot... ;-(
