Subject: Dumb brake booster vacuum hose connection question.

Hello List,

I am waiting for my brake booster vacuum hose to
arrive and I have a connection question. My bus has a
74 automatic transmission. It also uses manifold
vacuum to opperate. Would it be best to just run a
short length of vacuum line from the tranny and "T" it
into the booster vacuum line? Would this be better
than running the tranny line through the fire wall?
This way, only the thick booster line goes through the
fire wall. I just wanted to make sure before I cut up
that expensive booster line. Any suggestions as to
where I can find the appropraite "T"? L()WES does not
have what I am looking for. Neither does Advance auto
Parts. Thanks!

Regards,
