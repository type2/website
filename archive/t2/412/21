Subject: SC Hoops

Does anyone know of a pic of how the hoops attach to the bed of a SC?  I
just saw a pic of how the canvas attached to the small handle thing on the
outside of the gate
http://www.germanrides.com/ViewItem.php?ItemNum=312364476   (note: not my
auction and I have nothing to do with it) and previously thought the hoops
attached to that some how.

If anyone could help I would appreciate it.

Peace Brothers and Sisters.
