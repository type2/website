FWIW-
  I employ the heel-and-toe technique of revving the motor while
downshifting.  Makes is possible to shift from third to second easily and
smoothly at any speed from 30 on down ('71 1600DP) and makes it possible to
shift into first at any speed above stopped.
  For those not familiar with heel-and-toe, engage brake with heel while
simultaneously revving motor with toe, both of right foot.  Raise RPM's
about 1000, or to suit your ratios.  Takes practice, but results in smooth
shifts.  In non-synchromesh trannies, this is the only way to downshift.
Happy smooth shifting!
