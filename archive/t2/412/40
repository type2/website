Subject: FREE 72 westy shell up for grabs, Sacramento CA

Hi all, 
 As the subject says,I have the shell of 72 westy that needs to leave my 
driveway. One or two of you may remember me posting about my "new" bus in the 
spring of 2002. List member Chris Jackson gave me (via Britt Grannis) what was 
left of his 72 westy after he stripped it to refurbish a 71.
Now, some 16 months later i have finally stripped my "old" 72 down to pretty 
much nothing.
What remains:
-both doglegs and cab floor have not more than surfce rust
-nose is smashed, windshield broken, but window frame was rust free when i put 
in winshield that is now cracked
-driver side rear corner is in fair shape as is its battery tray, pass. side is 
shot patched and rusted
-rear window frames on sides are rusted 
-doors are straight but have mild cancer at bottom edges
-middle cargo floor has only suface rust
-AFAIK the rockers on both sides are solid
-sliding door is straight with one or two small rust holds, I have taken all 
door hardware for spares
-front beam is solid AFAIK, I have taken all front brake components except discs
-it has clear title, registered as non-operational.
That's really all there is. Its pretty much a lost cause for resto unless you 
have lots of $$$$. Im hoping someone out there can use what's left to keep 
another bus or two on the road. I don't have the time, tools or inclination to 
cut it up myself. Any person or persons who wish to part what's left must tow 
it away.
 My wife has been very patient but is very insistent that this bus leave. Pmail 
me if interested. I have a couple weeks to get rid of it and if nobody wants it 
I will forced to send it to the crusher.
