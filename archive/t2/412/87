Cha:  Take a close look at the bolt that threads into the left side 
of the float bowl near the bottom. A 13mm wrench fits it.

When this bolt is removed, it makes it easy to get a screwdriver in 
there to remove the main jet.

There must be a gasket  -  usually a crush metal one  -  between this 
bolt and the carb body. If it isn't there, you can count on fuel 
running out from under the bolt thread.

Take a look and let us know.
