Subject: Wiring to the Rear of the Bus

Hey guys,

	I've got another quick question. While checking out the underside of
my 73 Transporter, I noticed that the bundle of wires feeds into a rubber
contained line, and works it's way into a steel pipe that follows the ENTIRE
length of the Bus into the rear. Pretty cool actually.. but I was curious
how some of you guys have handled adding additional wiring to the rear of
the Bus. For example, my CHT wiring.. do you unravel the wire loom and
rebundle it? Or did you find somewhere else to tuck the wire away?


Thanks,
