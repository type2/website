Subject: Need part number help ...

... from those with ETKA. I just returned from my local VW dealer and the
parts guy could not find a part number I need - though he tried his best.
Does anyone know the part number for the input shaft oil return sleeve (# 14
in Figure 5-1 Bentley Section 6.5 (Transmission and rear axle, p. 17)? It
fell victim to damage resulting from a bad pilot bearing.

I also need a good input shaft for a 002 (1974, 1800ccm) transmission. I
could trade for a nice 091 one or would be happy to purchase it. Due to
excessive wear at the pilot bearing end and where it passes through oil
return sleeve and the seal, mine is only good as a clutch alignment tool.
