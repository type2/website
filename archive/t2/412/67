Hiya Zach,

On the 1970 a rubber tube runs from the pressurized bottle to the switch.  
From the switch there is a single tube which tees into two lines - one for each 
squirter.  That you have a good squirt out of your right indicates that your 
problem lies after the tee.  If your hoses and squirters are in good shape I 
would be tempted to unhook the rubber tube (to the left squirter) and give it a 
gentle little blast of compressed air.  That may be enough to force the 
blockage out.  Worked nine times out of ten when we had to clear squirter lines at 
the service station.

If that does not work, then it's replacing the tube (from the tee to the 
squirter) and the squirter.  Total cost would be about $10US.  Time involved - 
less than a half hour (but on your head most of the time).
