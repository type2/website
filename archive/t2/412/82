> I'm still trying to figure out a method that will remove that filler
restrictor in the fill opening without leaving it in the tank...

I sliced the filler neck off through the widest portion next to the tank
wall, and removed the restrictor tube.  Then sanded the spout portion and
the matching mating surface on the tank flat using a table-top belt sander.

I have to go out for a bit, but will work on reattaching the spout later.  I
might use silicone sealer and short screws, unless I think of something I
like better on the way back from the store... hmm... I think that I just
thought of something better already...
