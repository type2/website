on one of my older buses I designed a mount for my spare tire in that
location between the frame and a hex head same size as lug nut thru floor
where I could crank the tire up and down...found out the hard way when you
have a flat that is a hard place to get to. so never repeated the project,
wouldn't have any room on current bus anyway but it was a great place to
get the tire out of the way if you didn't want it on the nose
