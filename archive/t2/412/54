Because they operate differently

In theory NO, but unless you have a wiring diagram to go by, you would be 
compounding matters.  The Bentley manual has excellent wiring diagrams.

easy now.   CHT gauges are different beasts.

CHTs generate their own electricity.  the signal sent from the rear to the 
front is in the range of millivolts.
The term for this type of gauge is a thermocouple gauge.
That place where they come together in a loop is called the thermocouple 
junction and is the key to the operation.
Thermocouples operate on the principle that when you place two dissimilar 
metals together in a junction and then place that junction in heat, 
electrons will start to flow, generating electricity.  The amount of 
electrons flowing is proportional to the temperature.
There are many different

One thing to remember, you CANNOT use regular wire to extend, move or 
change the length of the thermocouple wires in any way.  If you do, you 
will introduce new thermocouple junctions that WILL be a source of errors 
in your gauge.  The gauge is calibrated for ONE type of thermocouple wire 
and a typical inside operating temperature of the bus.  (I believe around 70F)

Hope that helps,
