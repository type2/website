Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for a hightop near Arizona

Hey Ray and all,

The hightop with the luggage rack is an Adventurewagen top and is the most
common, but you can't put a bed up top as stated.

I have been off of the list for a while and have since acquired a new daily
driver that I put a Riviera high top on. It is one of the biggest hightops
made and allows me to sleep up top (I did at Everybus). Jamie Auch also had
success with a Safare top on his early bay after cutting some of the roof
off.

On a side note I have also acquired a new domain for 72camper.com. Both
sites are live now until I can get all the content on the new domain. The
new site is www.baywindowbus.com and will have all that 72camper has and
more (eventually). For some pics of my new daily driver and the Riviera
hightop go here: http://www.baywindowbus.com/sunshine.htm

If anyone else has some pics of their hightop I would love to add it to my
galleries. Also if you have a link to 72camper on your site I would
appreciate it if you could take a minute and change it to the new domain.
