Dylan-

I've got a big roll of the Heat Shield insulation from JCW, which I 
bought to replace all the stuff under my headliner and to put behind 
the interior panels.  The same stuff is available at your favorite 
local Home Improvement Warehouse- they sell it as Hot Water Heater 
Insulation.  On one or two of the pieces I glued to the ceiling of my 
bus (using 3m Super Trim adhesive), the silver mylar layer separated 
from the recycled lint layer under the weight of the latter.  (I had 
glued the mylar side to the ceiling).  I guess that in your 
application, you would want to have the silver side facing the engine.

Hope this helps.
