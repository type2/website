Subject: THE TIRES FOR BUSSES

Hey Guys,

Just a note that I found a great tire for our busses:

YKS 195R14 Load Range D $60 including mounting/balance/tax

These tires look great on the bus (vintage looking), very tall and somewhat
narrow.  Aggressive tread pattern.. I bought 5 for my '74 and my friend
bought a set for his 82 Westy.... He's on the road now and says the bus
handles 1000% better than his HANKOOKs.  No more wind sway due to the five
ply side walls... My bus is nearing a full resto that I've been spending
every spare moment for the past 6 months!  Will let you guys know how they
handle on my 74' in a few weeks.

-Tom
