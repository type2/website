While you're correct that you must pay attention to the max load weight 
marked on the tire, I don't think it's correct to say "Load range C 
does not mean squat."

As I understand it, you need to pay attention to both:

"Load range" refers to the stiffness of the sidewall, and thus lateral 
force the sidewall can withstand... particularly important when one is 
steering a Bus, going around a corner or bend in the road, etc.

The here is a separate load index that indicates the vertical force the 
tire can withstand.  This is what Karl was referring to.

If you get a tire that has the correct load index but is not at least 
load range C, its sidewall will not have sufficient stiffness, and you 
will have understeer, a sloshy back-end, etc.

When I bought new tires for my Westy, I sought out load range C, but I 
also looked for a sufficient load index (one that could accommodate the 
camper fully loaded with people/stuff).  I ended up with load range C, 
load index 99 (1710 lbs), speed rating P (93 MPH).
