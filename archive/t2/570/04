Primer alone is not the answer Ron.

If there is pot holes and divots in the metal it has to be filled, and
not with primer alone.

What a crummy way to get to an end result.

The only way that I can think of to get this done right is first to lead
in the imperfections--then POR the surface--

How many guys out there are going to take the time to tallow up a
paddle, and start using lead ?

This would be the right way of using this miracle in a can--

You can primer over the POR-15, but you must do it while the POR-15 is
still tacky. This might give you a better surface to work with.
