Sam,

You need the Hydraulic Cam as well. You do have to take the out to replace 
the cam but the lifters you do not have to pull the engine if replacing them 
with the same type of lifter. Hydraulic old to Hydraulic new, Solid old to 
Solid new.

Shameless plug to fund the "el Verde" resurrection.

Good Luck,
