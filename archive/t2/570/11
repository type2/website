Subject: used motor for the hanger queen

Greetings Bussers,

   	Once again I have a goal of getting the Hanger Queen rolling. 
I've had my '72 Westie sitting in the garage for some time.  The P.O. 
had dropped the old 1700 out and put a 1600 DP in its place.  It 
cooked.  I rebuilt the 1600 until I found a basket case 1700 I 
planned to rebuild and put in.  Well, inertia reigns supreme.  Until..
	I was cruising the net looking at used car parts places and I 
find a place that says they have a 1700cc motor.  I went out today to 
take a look.  They tell me they took it out of a '73.  It's sitting 
there on the ground.  Duals gone and it looks like a two barrel Weber 
in its place.  It spins. Everything else is on it.  Check the oil. 
Still up there.  So I squat and ponder.  The engine code is CB069042. 
That's a 1700 right?  The exhaust  is pretty rough, but I have some 
parts for that.  The heat exchangers actually have some rusty tin 
still on them.  Has a couple of stickers indicating that it was 
remaned in Canada.  The guy claims it was running when they took it 
out.  I was going to be a wise guy and mention I usually turn my 
motors off before I pull them, but his nickname is "Mongo" and it 
fits. So I kept my mouth shut.
	I've seen better and I've seen a lot worse so I dickered a 
bit and we made a deal and now I have a motor in my garage that is in 
one piece.  My plan is to clean it up, change the oil, set the 
valves, check out the timing, slap it in and start it up.  I plan to 
go ahead and do the rebuild on my basket case motor, but if I can get 
the bus rolling that would be sweet.
	So if the list has any advice, I'm all ears.  Any other 
things I should take care of before launch?  Thanks.

P.S. Any Twin Cities listers out there?  Any advice on machine shops 
or mechanics?
