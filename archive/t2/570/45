> Load range C means a lot.

 Load range C means the maximum weight rating of the tire is assuming an
 inflation pressure of 50 p.s.i. (LRD=65, LRD=80).

 All tires are rated for weight at their maximum inflation.

 The maximum load rating drops proportionately to reductions in inflation pressure.

Sorry dude, you oughta be a politician. In real life, you need to read some tire sidewalls. I believe they are
more acurate than 99% of the fertilizer you typed. I wish I had pics of those LT Load range D tires that were
max weight of 1311 lbs. I wouldn't put them on anything bigger than a wheel barrel.

The Michelin tires I referred to were the MX. Whether they are still available today, I don't know. But I have
a set of 4 on my 77 Westy and I have a set of 4 on my daughters 77 Westy. Until I need to buy another set,
then I will see what's available. But I know damn well I will not be looking to see if they are load range C
or D only and just relying on that. I am going to go by max weight with 1540 being the minimum and having
reinforced sidewalls.
