Cool the consensus is coming back that they should be at the top center. The 
sides that I did are correct except one is off center. They need to come out 
later to paint anyway.

>also I use wd 40 to help get it in

Ever thought about "Personal Lubricants"? AKA KY-Jelly, Wet, Astrogluide, 
Ultragluide, etc. The are water based and easily cleaned up. Plus for those 
of you who like the dangley air fresheners they come in scented formulas, 
flavors, etc.  I wouldn't recomend licking the seals clean though.

>You missed a graet campout at Naturalbus

Yeah rub it in. I spent all weekend cleaning, sorting and painting all my 
cooling tin to put my engine back together and get it movin. Hope to catch 
atleast a couple campouts this year.

Thanks,
