This is the sort of thinking that got Ford and Firestone in trouble when
they decided to go to low pressures on the Explorer.  Those fat tires had
a lot of excess capacity, so they decided to drop the pressure to improve
the ride.  We all know what that did to handling and safety!

It's very unlikely that tire load capacity is a nice linear function of
inflation pressure.

VW made it very simple.  They specified a minimum standard of 1540 pounds
for bus tires.  All you have to do is read the number from the sidewall
and see if it is 1540 pounds or higher.  If so, put the tires on, inflate
to the pressure specified in the owner's manual for the load condition you
have, and drive happily every after.  Tires are not the place to scrimp to
save a few bucks.
