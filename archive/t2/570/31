Subject: Brakes!

Well, I finally got around to working on my brakes today. New shoes in the
rear went on well and adjusted nicely. A dirty job but not tewrribly
dificult. The fun started when i got to the front brakes. (1974 T2, by the
way) On the driver's side, the inner piston seems to be completely stuck and
the pads were worn down to replacement thickness. On the passenger side the
pads were much thicker but the outer one was significantly thinner than the
inner one. I couldn't get either piston the move much on this side.

When I called the FLAPS they asked if I had ATE or Girling calipers, but
couldn't tell me how to tell the difference. So, can anyone advise me as to
how I can tell which system I have? Also. can someone point me to the site
that sells the power brake bleeder kit that fits our busses?

Thanks in advance,
Dave
