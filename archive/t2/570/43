Subject: Re: [T2] Rust Converter's Results and Finding's.

4" in diameter isn't exactly a "small" area but, use the rust converter
stuff--
It is tough stuff--

You wil have to touch up the area with some paint--the converter doesn't
like UV, and will go to hell if you don't top coat it.

Be prepared--your going to see spots---

The stuff will work great for any interior rust---

There are several lite and ultra light body filler's on the
market--available at any body shop supply house--use it--it sands easy--
