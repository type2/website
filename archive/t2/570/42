Subject: Re: [T2] Rust Converter's Results and Finding's.

I have small, surface spot rusting in the typical places (b/t bumper and 
driver & passenger door; around vent  flaps, etc.) We are about to take 
a cross country trek and I wanted to get these spots at least initially 
treated.

1. What is the consensus (if one can be had on this list) for treating 
spot rusting (I'm talking about areas which are only 4" inches in 
diameter max.)? I don't necessarily need r want to get into a body 
makeover, but want to halt the rust progression and seal it for the trip.

2. What primer should I use? And should I immediately apply touch up 
paint to these areas?

3. Also, in reupholstering my passenger & driver side door panels I 
notice there is some rust build up in the door well, mainly due to the 
PO filling up these spaces with "Great Stuff" (NOT!) foam insulation so 
the water had nowhere to go. I'm guessing this should be treated with 
POR-15. But are there supposed to be vent holes for this water to be 
released from the door?

4. Also, and I know this might be a can o' worms but....
What are the preferred types of  body filler?
Thanks for thoughts from the mountain top.
