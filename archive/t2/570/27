Subject: RE: [T2] used motor for the hanger queen

You do know you can run it on an engine stand, right? That will give you a 
chance to check if it needs rebuild, heads, etc, BEFORE launching it into 
the bus.

After all, it would suck to go through all that effort getting it in there 
only to find zero compression on the #3 cylinder...

Engine stand, gallon of gas, lots of fuel line (so you can keep the gas far 
from the engine), battery, etc. You get the idea...

My plan is to clean it up, change the oil, set the
valves, check out the timing, slap it in and start it up.  I plan to
go ahead and do the rebuild on my basket case motor, but if I can get
the bus rolling that would be sweet.
	So if the list has any advice, I'm all ears.  Any other
things I should take care of before launch?  Thanks.
