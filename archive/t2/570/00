Subject: Re: [T2] windsheild installation

What Jeff failed to mention, What he does is perfect! HE is big and strong,, his
wife is small and smart... big strong guy [ew ew ew ,Tim Taylor voice?> on the
outside putting the windshield in,, and positioning it a bit,, and a nice <good
looking too, sucking up voice?> gentle touch on the cord, pulling the rubber <SEAL!
I am talking about a SEAL thilly!> in place,
Then as the job gets closer to breaking the windshield,, the outside pounder has to
get a lot more gentle, and the inside puller has to be a little stronger.
