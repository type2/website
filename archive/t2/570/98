Subject: Vanagon stolen in Tacoma, Wa june 07

From vwvortex. Call the police if you spot this
bus! I'll pass any info on to vortex.
----------------------------------------------------
My dad's Vanagon was stolen last night or this
morning. You might be thinking that it is just a van,
but this van has recently undergone a 2.0L (inline)
motor swap and it got a five speed along with it. If
you have ever priced this kind of swap retail, you'll
know why I am asking for help.

It is a white 85 Vanagon with five spoke wheels, stock
ride height. The license plate is 279-KVS.

Please help out a fellow dubber. My old man has always
helped me and others with dubs.

The car was stolen from the North End of Tacoma.

Thanks for your help.

Theo
