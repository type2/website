Paul,
I had these on my '72 Westy hardtop. They were great. Even quieter on the
highway than the passenger car tires I took off, surprisingly. Great
traction in snow and mud, look great. Fantastic improvement over the old
tires, but that was to be expected. I'm putting them on my new van. Thanks
for the heads up.
