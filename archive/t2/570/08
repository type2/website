Subject: Stranded Buskatier - FI expert Needed ?

David Cook is stuck at a truck stop somewhere in southern Montana with 
a 78 FI bus that just wont start.
On his way from KC to the Yukon ...

After a fuel fillup the bus seemed to hesitate and run poorly, he has 
done much of the obvious, checked and changed fuel filters, some 
injector cleaner aswell as run some "evaporator" for water. The kicker 
is that he stopped the bus and found a vac leak in his brake booster 
lin, patched it and when he tried to start his bus it wouldnt start. 
After waiting a while she sparked up and again ran hesitantly and 
crappily for awhile longer.

Now he has stopped and again the bus wont start, runs like crap and he 
cant figure out what is going wrong. The starter cranks, he has spark 
at the coil, the plugs arent fouled, his sensor on #3 us connected ...

He seems to have covered many of the bases that seem obvious. I am of 
little to no help being a carb'ed man and not knowing a thing about FI.

SO here is my call to anyone who has experienced this before, HELP !

David's cell number is 785-806-0254 so if anyone is either in the area 
or has ANY tips give him a call or e-mail me.

Thanks,
Steve
