Subject: insulation

Has anyone used the insulation sold by JC whitney that they say NASA uses in 
the space crafts. I want to insulate to inside of our bus engine compartment. 
The inside of our bus is done with this dense black foam that I bought at a 
custom van shop, they sold me pieces that were 3yard wide by 8 feet for $15.00. 
I think it has help with the sound somewhat but need more silence from the 
road noise, whats good. Thanks Dylan
