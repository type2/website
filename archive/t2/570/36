Tru dat. ;-)

That's kinda what I thought. Hence the question.

I didn't think it was a GOOD idea, just an idea. I have ADHD and my brain
goes off on some of the most bizarre tangents.

Yep. =D Even cleaned up a bunch of the danglin' wirin' under my dash, and
fixed the ignition switch so that it turns on the ignition. Still can't get
it to crank the starter though.

Nope. My "repair" (zip tie around the housing) is solid. So unless a new one
falls out of the sky, exhaust and brakes are taking priority. Then I can
start looking at the interior and then the body rust and figuring out how to
get my 009 dizzy out to install the new one Karl sent me. (I think the O
ring has welded itself to the case.)

I did another valve adjustment today to check my measurements from before. I
must be misunderstanding the instructions because they were looser than when
I did them last. That or I did it wrong the first time and was doing it
right this time. (queue embarrassment).

Note/Warning about valve cover gaskets:
I have a late 73 formerly Westie with a 1700. The first time I did the
valves I used gaskets with no name on 'em that cost about a buck a piece.
Everything was fine, nothing to notice about them (good!) This time I bought
Fel Pro gaskets from a store I've been going to since I was a kid
(30-something now) and thought, "These will be much better. Fel-Pro has
always been good to me!" THEY DON'T FIT! The application list on the Fel-Pro
box specifically lists my year and engine, but the gasket is just a whisper
too long. It bows on one side when resting in the valve cover waiting to be
installed. I managed to get them installed satisfactorily (no oil leaking),
so there's probably no functional difference. They're thinner and wider than
the other ones too. Really strange.

But it's all installed and sealed now, so I'm not going to lose any sleep
over it. Just kinda ticked me off. Back to the no-name ones from Dips for
me...
