Subject: Type 4 valve adjustment

I too have noticed this. I found that if I adjusted
the valves at their loosest point the compression was
down a little. I think this indicated that the valve
adjustment was too tight. Since then I always set the
valves at exactly TDC. I guess the base circle on the
cam isn't exactly round. I read somewhere that this
allows more oil to enter the area between the cam lobe
and lifter.
