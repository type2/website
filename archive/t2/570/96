Alex,

Forgot what type engine you have, but suddenly wondered what type
of exhaust system and tail pipe.

The tail pipe is the important part as it needs to get the exhaust out 
into the "slip stream" part of the air flow.

Folks that have used standard bug exhausts on their busses with t1 engines 
sometimes report the same problem.


Cheers, dave
