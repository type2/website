Subject: Re: [T2] bridgestone dueller A/T tires

Load range C does not mean squat.

[I wish I had a picture of a set of 4 LT tires that were Load range D. Those may-pops had a max weight rating
of 1311 lbs.!!!! They were at the Bakersfield show in the spring]

What is the max load weight marked on the side?

I just looked at a 78 Westy that had brand new Kirkland load range C tires on it and the max weight rating was
LESS than Michelin passenger car tires!  Michelin 185R14 are 1450 lbs. Michelin 185R14 reinforced are 1540
lbs. which is the minimum weight rating for a Westy. The Kirkland's were 1435 lbs.!

from personal experience for my westy?
