Subject: RE: [T2] bridgestone dueller A/T tires

Hi Paul,

To return to the original intent of this thread, I would recommend 
Bridgestone Dueler tires.  I've been running 195/75R14 tires on my 79 Westy, 
and have been very pleased with their performance.  They work great 
off-pavement, they're good in the snow, and they're not too noisy on the 
highway.  Their load range is 90/93, which is a little lighter than some Bus 
drivers prefer, but I keep the fronts at 37 and the rears at 44psi and have 
had no problems.  I drive my Bus at its limits most of the time, and it has 
seen its share of high cornering loads.  These tires provide the stiffness 
and tractability that I look for, and they're pretty inexpensive to boot.

That said, when these tires wear out, I will probably look for a different 
brand.  I've heard great things about the Michelin MXVs, but at $90 a tire I 
want to be sure.

Hope this helps....
