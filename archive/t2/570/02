Subject: Re:easiest AIRS mission ever--well maybe

I think I can top Matthew's easy AIRS mission.  Last summere a couple
called me from a local campground.  Seems the CV joints were making
noise and they wanted to know the names of some local shops that might
regrease or replace the joints as needed.  I offerred to grab my tools
and come over and help them do the job.  They weren't interested.
They wanted to spend a day in  New York city doing some sight seeing
and thought that would be a good time to have their Vanagon repaired.
So I gave them the phone #s of a several shops and was done.  It
doesn't get any easier than that.
