Subject: Solid 76 CA bus for sale in Charleston SC

Pretty rust free bus.  a little under front window, but POR paste stopped it
cold............No leaks in vehicle.  New motor brakes etc.  Ready to go.

$3500 obo...............may seem like a lot but you have virtuall no rust
repair on this thing.........it even has original paint.

I must trim my collection to more realistic numbers.
