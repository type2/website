Subject: Re: [T2] insulation

I was just at Wesco (major auto-paint store in the area) today, and I was looking at their sound deadening pads. They were fibreglass re-inforced, about 1/8th inch thick, and were supposed to be moldable with heat. I asked the saleman about it, and he said that the BEST stuff to get was Dynamat. It's at www.dynamat.com and it's used by car stereo people, so it must be pretty good. If your just looking for sound proofing.

I do believe that the best places to put that stuff for road noise is right above/around the wheel wells. Also, I read an article YEARS ago, that suggested removing all of your interior body panels,and spraying in that expandable foam stuff (bout five bucks a can at home depot, need about 2 cans per door size area), then replacing your panels. 

Just my two cents
