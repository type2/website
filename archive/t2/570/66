I was considering the same thing of placing them directly on the top,
but then thought of the "oven effect."  I have a '71 non-poptop camper.
By placing the panels directly onto the roof, the heat absorbed is going
to radiate down and bake you!  Then another idea came to mind... making
a shell that fits over the roof.  The ideal angle for maximum power is
~30 degrees.  The dimensions of a bus roof lends itself perfectly to a
contraption that will hold a total of 6 large, flexible panels each
generating 32 watt and 1.94 Amps/hour.  This gives a total of 192 watts
and 11.64 Amps/hour at maximum efficiency.  (I'm a novice at this solar
jazz, but I'm pretty sure this is accurate.)  The contraption I have in
mind is kinda' convoluted, but theoretically possible.  I hope someday
to be able to put it together.  (I even have thoughts on making it into
a water heater as well.  All in all I don't know how practical it will
be, but the novelty of it should be interesting.

Have a good one,
