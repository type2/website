Somebody's been feeding you a line, I fear.

Load range is simply a maximum weight that a tire can carry in a given
size.  The bad news is that that maximum weight varies from size to size.

Sidewall stiffness results directly from the sidewall construction, which
is a function of the pressure that the tire is designed to hold.  Higher
load ranges hold higher pressures and have stiffer sidewalls.

You can't go wrong with a 185R14 in load range C or D.  Lots of excess
capacity and nice stiff sidewalls.  It's the size specified by VW.  It's
available.  There is little reason to experiment.
