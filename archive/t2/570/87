Hello Guys and gals  Well another Naturalbus has come and gone  A good time
was had by all About 90 buses, Worse rain I have ever seen on Friday night 
about 2 inches, Frank Biffal still built a fire :)  Cleared up and was great
Sat,Sun.  The new Hilly Billy putt putt Champ is none other than Mr Frank
(Chilli
king, Who built that fire  ) Biffal ,  Jamie Auch won the tyed dyed motor. I
dont think I have ever seen two guys with bigger smiles . Over a $1000.00
raised for the Ronald Mc donald house,  Naturalbus gets a gold leaf on their
donation tree . The carabus back for lunch on Sun. had about 40 buses way too
cool .
So all you who didnt come cause you are going to Boonaroo I hope you enjoy
the crowd cause you missed the best campout and group of bus people ever,   
later and have fun  Mark Dearing
