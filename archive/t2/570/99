Hi Dave,
Thanks for the concern. I've read a lot about how the bug
style muffler and to try and not use it. I have a type4
engine and the exhaust pipe exits in the area under the
right tail light (passenger side). You can make it out in
this photo although it is hard to see.

The black soot mark on the bumper is because the previous
muffler/tail pipe was a little shorter. It exited near the
bumper instead of out in the slip stream and blacked
the paint some.

Alex
