What distributor do you have? It sounds like the dreaded 009, but even with
an 009 the total advance is low for a T4 engine. With no vacuum advance the
total advance should be up around 34 - 36 degrees. With a single vac advance
the peak timing advance should be around 40 or 45 degrees when the throttle
is opened; when the vacuum stabilizes it drops to around 34 degrees. This
assumes an idle timing of 7.5 degrees.

My 74 with an 1800, weber progressive, and SVDA distributor gets 15 in the
city and 20 on the highway. Not quite your former numbers, but better than
11!

Good luck,
Dave
