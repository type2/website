Load range C means a lot.

Load range C means the maximum weight rating of the tire is assuming an
inflation pressure of 50 p.s.i. (LRD=65, LRD=80).

All tires are rated for weight at their maximum inflation.

The maximum load rating drops proportionately to reductions in inflation
pressure.

Extrapolating from here, we can arrive at the weight rating necessary at
each axle by figuring the ratio of the OE tire max inflation to the
recommended inflation, then applying that to the maximum weight rating of
the OE tire.

For example, Michelin Agilis 185R14/C (NLA) have a maximum weight rating of
1709# (-at-)54 p.s.i. Assuming an inflation of 40 p.s.i. in the rear tires of a
campmobile, we have a ratio of 0.74 (40/54). Multiply this by the max rating
of 1709#, and we have 1264#, very near the gross axle weight rating of a '78
Campmobile of 1270#, indicating these tires have a rating that closely
matches whatever was OE on the van. This exercise supports the following
statements.

The gross axle weight ratings of a '78 campmobile as listed in the owners
manual are 1270 rear and 1010 front. Working backward from there, we can
calculate the load rating/inflation values of tires that differ from the OE
tires in load rating and maximum inflation.

For example, we have a tire that is rated at 1435# (-at-) 50p.s.i. In order to
reach a rear load capacity of 1270#, we need to inflate these tires to
44.25p.s.i. (1270/1435*50). Fronts would be 35p.s.i.(1010/1435*50).
This is why the inflation values differ front to rear, and why some vehicles
have different inflation values for laden and unladen vehicles.

In fact, if you have tires that differ in their weight capacity
substantially from the OE tires, you may do well to perform these calcs and
adjust your tire inflation accordingly.

Which Michelins are you referring to? Searching their website, the only
tires that size I was able to find were NLA. You said "passenger car tires."
Are these p-metric, or metric?

P-metric tires used on passenger cars and station wagons are rated to carry
100% of the load indicated on the tire's sidewall. However, if the same
P-metric tires are used on light trucks, (pickup trucks and sport utility
vehicles for example), their carrying capacity is reduced to 91% of the load
indicated on the tire's sidewall. LT tires are not derated in this way.
Thus, P185R14R tires with a weight rating of 1540# mounted on a truck would
be rated at only 1401#, while LT tires would remain at their maximum rated
capacity, in this case 1435#, well within the rated GAW of a breadloaf
westy.

The moral is, look at the gross axle rating of the vehicle, not the weight
rating of the OE tire. You should not exceed the rating of your vehicle.
There is no need to go over that rating on the tires, except for an extra
margin of safety. You may find as I did that the higher inflation values,
while increasing ride harshness, improve handling and stability.
