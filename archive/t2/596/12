Subject: Stalls on downrev while slowing

Hey list-

I read that someone else's type IV is stalling while warm, and that it might
be rich, but my situation is a bit different.  My engine seems to idle pretty
well even when warmed up (192 degrees according to the retrofit cooking
thermometer), but when I let off the gas and downshift or let it into neutral
while Im slowing, as the engine comes down to idle it stalls.  Its like it
cant stop itself on the way down.  It starts right back up no problem, usually
I can just kick it back into gear and let the clutch out and it'll fire right
back up.  Its really annoying tho.  It started about 10 minutes into driving
it for its first multiple minute ride.

1700, weber centermount, stock dizzy with only the vacuum advance hooked up.
noplace for the vacuum retard to mount on the weber.  Timing at about 8
degrees with the advance plugged.

Thanks for the advice!
