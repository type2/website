Subject: Just got my Bus Depot exhaust nuts...

Wow. I was picturing crappy steel nuts with the plastic insert. I
wasn't expecting copper crush nuts.

I'd say these are well worth the $25 for 100pieces, though I think BD
should sell 'em for $8 for 20 so we don't have to buy 100 of 'em. Not
that I mind having extras, however... heh

(Please, no offers to buy my extras. All that I'm willing to part with
are already spoken for.)

Now I'm off to replace the alternator in my Fiero, then start dropping
the exhaust on the bus, again.
