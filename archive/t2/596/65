Subject: Wow thanks re super fast access to rear instrument cluster

RE:
insturment cluster rear access from front via turn signal lens
hole

I too have the AC stuff blocking my easy access. I am going to try
that right away. I hate removing the instruments to replace a
light bulb or mess with wiring, etc. It is always risky to remove
the heat, defrost, and vent levers. Your approach will save me a
lot of time. I need to replace some instrument cluster night
illumination bulbs now. It is such a PITA that I always wait until
the last bulb burns out.

thank you thank you thank you

I may, however, change your approach slightly.

I don't like sheet metal screws for regular R&R.

you eventually have to change to larger screws because they losen
up.

I am going to use "well nuts"

these are really neat "permanent" gizmos that provide regular
female machine threaded screw holes in thin sheet metal. Many
factory roof racks are installed using this type of "screw hole" .
You just drill a precisely sized hole and push the correct rubber
well-nut in with your finger. If you do use the well-nuts or a
similar product for a critical structure like a roof rack, you
must be sure that you have used enough well-nuts to produce a
secure and safe system that will not blow off in the wind or break
off with a jack-rabbit start or an emergency sudden stop. Some
well-nut like products are more secure than others and provide a
stronger attachment using an expansion plug type grip hold.
