stick in a late model tranny BUT you will still need to find that part. in
fact if you find the bus with the tranny get the ENTIRE shift mechanism
because the shifter in the front is different too, it should bolt right up
but it is different.  other than that and the cable in the rear going in
the other side, and maybe the accelerator linkage (which you should get
from the donor bus too) it should fit just fine.  might want to grab the
firewall tin don't think you'll need it but never can tell the accelerator
linkage hole may not line up.
