Subject: LPG Pressure Regulator leak 

My wife and I are heading out tomorrow evening for a weekend camping 
trip with our 1984 Vanagon Westy. Just got the bus a couple weeks ago 
and put some propane in the tank this afternoon. When I open the valve 
on the propane tank, there is a hissing sound from the regulator mounted 
on the side of the tank (outside left side) and the smell of propane. I 
removed the cover from the regulator and localized the leak (using a 
small hose in my ear) to the regulator, and more specifically, to a 
small 1/8'' hole  that appears to have been cast into the body of the 
regulator, on the underside near the outboard edge, midway between the 
front and rear of the regulator body.

Anyone have any suggestions?
