Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuilt 2.0 FI - worst case scenario - cam versus gear

Scott, this is alarming!

Except I went and removed the gear and checked it against both the 
webcam and the stock cam and it shows that only one orientation of the 
holes is precisely aligned. Each of the other 4 possible orientations is 
not aligned close enough to get a bolt (or rivet) through all 5 holes, 
up to half a hole off.  Without the gear for reference it LOOKS as 
though the holes are equally distributed.

the 'correct' (and only one that works) orientation that I show can be 
described like this:
- look at the cam/gear from the gear end
- place the alignment dot at 12 o'clock
- the slot for the oil pump tang is almost vertical pointing at the 
alignment dot but twisted clockwise perhaps 3 degrees
- the first lobe on the cam, closest to the gear, is pointed to appr. 3 
o'clock.

The webcam has obviously greater lift on the lobes, but seems to be 
oriented the same as the original cam.

Anyone else want to chime in on this??  I have never seen reference to a 
possible cam/gear misalignment, and no reference was made in the new 
webcam instructions I received with the cam (without gear).

this is incorrect. the cam gear bolt/rivet holes are equally spaced, so
there are 5 theoretical orientations, even if only one of them is right.
