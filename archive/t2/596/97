Subject: RE: [T2] Not White Hubcaps - grey

Since the camper's finally at home, I'll take a pics or two of one of the 
original hubcaps (though there's rust - but not so much you can't see the 
grey color).  I'm not sure how to show you guys the pictures though.  
Where/how do I post it?  The most I've ever done is send an email.
