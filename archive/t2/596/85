Subject: a/c compressor belt

Folks, I am getting ready to install my new a/c in the 78 Champagne 
edition this weekend, and would really like to finish it this weekend.

I have the kit from BD and can't figure out if the stock original belt 
should fit it or whether I need a different one.

I have the original belt(cut) around someplace, but if someone has the 
number of the original or knows that the original size belt works with 
the new sanden compressor and mount that Ron sells, please let me know.

No belt listed on the BD site.

Cheers, dave
