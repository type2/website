Subject: buying and trasnporting questions / laws / dmv?

I was informed today, the day before I fly to new mexico to pick up my new 
bus, that they keep the plates in that state and that id be driving back 
without them.

he offered to take me to the local DMV to get a $5 tag to cover me in New 
Mexico, but what good is that going to do me on the rest of my trip back to 
MN?

suggestions? anyone deal with this before?

id prefer not to have to deal with getting picked up every state along the 
way.
