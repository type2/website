Subject: RE: [T2] Damn!  Rounded over CV Joint Bolt!!!!

Same thing happened to me this weekend......twice. Misery loves company
I guess. I was able to get it out with vice grips. That second bolt took
about 25 minutes and had me cussing. I try to lock the vice grips as
tight as possible and turn it with a single sharp blow.

Check those bolt heads that are going back in. If any of them look
damaged, replace them. I've been able to find the bolts at Ace Hardware.
Lowes and Home Depot didn't carry them. I'm also lucky in that there's
an industrial supply house down the road from me. They have been really
good at having those obscure metric bolts.

And try your damndest to not lose those serrated lock washers. Try to
find new ones if you lose them.

Remember torque the bolts only to 25 ft lbs. Over-torquing will only
make you miserable next time.

Also check the condition of your allen wrench or allen socket. Those
things start to round out with use (especially the way I use them). A
rounded allen wrench is a great way to ruin a whole set of bolts.

Half shafts are on of my least favorite maintenance items. Awkward
positions under the bus, the weight of the halfshaft, 12 damn bolts,
rotating the shaft  get to the bolts. the dirt, the freshly grease CV
joints that have to stay clean, correctly positioning the shaft to get
the bolts started..... Arrrgggg.
