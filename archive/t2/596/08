Subject: FW: [T2] Damn!  Rounded over CV Joint Bolt!!!!

Tom,

The vise grips work. I have resorted to this more than several times, too
lazy to get a pick and clean out the heads of the bolts before using the
allen wrench. Put the pliers on the right direction (they are directional,
and orient the same way as channelocks) and clamp them down as tight as you
can, keeping the cheek of the pliers perpendicular to the length of the
bolt. One caveat... I swear by the brand-name pliers. The imitations just
don't cut it. If you don't have any, p-mail me. I'm in Alameda.

I think cutting a slot in the head would substantially weaken it, since
there is no "middle." You would just wind up with two thin crescents, and
I'm afraid they'd just break off when you try to turn it with a screwdriver.
