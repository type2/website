Order the temp sensor and gage from Bus Depot, when
you get it find a nut that will screw on the sensor.
Pull the plate off the bottom of the engine that is
held on by two 6mm bolts, drill a hole in the plate
that will allow the sensor to pass through, on the
inside of the plate with the hole in the center of the
nut, weld the nut to the plate, cut off enough of the
nut for for the plate to fit back on the engine(miss
the shelf on the engine), reinstall the plate screw
the sensor into the nut with a bit of sealer on it,
run the wire from the sensor to the front of the bus
to the gage. Thats about it. Phil
