Subject: RE: [T2] Eliminating Test Plug & Extra Wires

Tom I have been pondering that same thing. PO on my bus has already clipped 
several of them. Including the Big Red/White one. I don't know about you but 
I am not planning on making this bus exactly stock, and never ever plan on 
taking it to the dealership from them to plug into the test unit. If anyone 
out knows please share. Will removing the test block completely with wires 
create any adverse effects?
