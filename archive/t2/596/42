Subject: 10mm GearWrench buy 

Wow, was that FAST!!

I suggested a group buy of the 10mm reversible GearWrench just last 
Thursday, and I will be mailing out the items TODAY. Wednesday...  Not even 
a week!!

I ordered on Friday noon, and received the shipment yesterday, Tuesday. UPS.

I have 2 extra 10mm reversible GearWrenches and 1 extra 19mm reversible 
GrearWrench.  First preference given to the '72 no-inspection-hatch 
group!!!!  (Sorry, the extra 13mm's I ordered are taken already.)

The 10mm will be $9 mailed, and the 19mm reversible GearWrench will be 
$13.69 + whatever USPS shipping comes out to be.


I will not be able to respond until Monday.  I am out of here until then....

Barry
