I can think of four areas I would check immediately:

Check that the bolts holding the fan to the fan hub on end of the crank
and the center bolt to the hub are tight.

Check the rear bearing on the alternator and the nut holding the pulley to
the end of the alternator

Check the lower alternator mounting bracket and bolt

Check the belt and pulleys for kinks

If you had not said you had done so I would add a fifth, check the upper
adjustment bolt and the arm-to-case stud.

I believe you will find your problem on the first go and will find one or
more of the bolts holding the fan to the hub has sheared.  Do not try to
drive on with the bus in this condition, as the remaining bolt(s) will
shear leaving you with no cooling.

OOK!
