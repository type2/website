They should be stamped into the body on the outside. Usually you will find at least 2 
sets of numbers. The Bosch number will be in a group of 10, i.e. 0 231 137 035.
The VW number will be a group of 9 numbers, i.e. 113 905 205. There may be no letter
after them, or 1 letter, or 2 letters. In the example I gave, the letter T would appear.

This applies to aluminum bodied distributors, made by Bosch or VW. Early iron bodied 
distributors had a oval id plate attached to them. They had a different numbering system, i.e.
VJR 4 BR 8/1. If this plates were removed..........
