A list of NLA parts for a Bus would fill volumes. However many of them
are parts you'll never need anyway, like some obscure washer on the back
of the screw somwehere that could just as easily be replaced with
something from the hardware store if it ever broke, which it won't.

Incidentally, the dipstick tube boot is not discontinued:

As for VWG's alternator cooling boot, we carry their parts and can get
anything that they make. We list this boot at
<http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=021903655B> . It is for
standard, not high-output, alternators.
