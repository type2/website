actually I think VW had a correction and stated not to use the serrated
lock washers at all. I have discarded mine years ago and have had no
problems just using the funny two holed washers that connect two bolts
together....

That's great, I was always loosing those things.

many CV bolts do not use allen wrenches but rather the triple square
wrench (I think that is what it is called) these are not expensive and
can
be found in most FLAPS

Very interesting. I wonder if the triple square heads grip better and
are less likely to strip than Allen heads. If so, I'll certainly change
over next time.

surgical gloves are worth thier weight in gold on this job.
I always keep a box in the bus now days
(but be carefull many people are alergic to latex, you might want to get
the latex free versions of the gloves)

I use the Playtex gloves. I tell you, after a day in 90+ degree heat, my
hands come out stinky, lily white, but grease free.
