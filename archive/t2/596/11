5" Vise-Grips.. Accept no substitutes.  Go buy a new pair. Clamp them
on as tight as you can get them and then twist gently. It will work.
BTDT about twenty times.  Never failed.

After you get it loose, thank the VW goddess that it wasn't the wheel
end of a Vanagon halfshaft.

Drilling will work, but it's a PITA.

Pounding in a 1/4" Allen? Might work. Never tried it. Vise-Grips. work.
Don't worry about the pounding harming the joint. You're not pounding
on the joint.

Slotting and using a screwdriver? I don't think so.....

Note: Vise-Grips., not vise-grips. Get the real thing.  If you pay/paid
less than $10 for 'em, you don't have the right tool for the job.

Replace them with triple-square bolts.
