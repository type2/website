Subject: RE: [T2] Eliminating Test Plug & Extra Wires

Does anyone have a dealership testing unit?

That would be the ultimate piece of VW collectables.

Tom I have been pondering that same thing. PO on my bus has already
clipped
several of them. Including the Big Red/White one. I don't know about you
but
I am not planning on making this bus exactly stock, and never ever plan
on
taking it to the dealership from them to plug into the test unit. If
anyone
out knows please share. Will removing the test block completely with
wires
create any adverse effects?
