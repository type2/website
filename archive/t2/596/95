>Hello, list. I was thinking about the possibility of making my own charcoal canister. What, exactly is the makeup of a charcoal canister? What if I took a can of tomato paste, drilled a hole in the top and drained the paste, cleaned it out, funneled some charcoal, like what you'd get in an aquarium store, drilled a hole in the bottom and ran the vent line to it and out the other side? Is there something more complicated to a stock charcoal canister?

It would be basically the same thing. The main difference would be the grain and type of activated charcoal you used would be slightly different from the original (at least from all the aquarium store varieties I've looked at).
