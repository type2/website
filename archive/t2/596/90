Bad Idea to drive without the Thermostat connected, if the flaps are in 
place. Look at the top of the engine at the back of the fan shroud. If there 
is a bar that runs across the fan housing, flaps are likely in place and you 
need to replace the cable. It goes up through the tin to the top and 
connects to the bar I just mentioned.

This a good link for an exploded veiw.

To replace the thermostat check out this link

or go to

The replacement line is probably a stock match. The carb line is after 
market like the carb. You need a fuel filter inline pre pump, post pump 
would be additional coverage, but not ness.

This should be for Crank Case Ventilation (CCV) no valve just a line to the 
oil breather. The other one sounds like a vacuum line.

I reguards to Holley you should check those numbers again and see if you can 
find some more to help isolate the actual model. L6503 I can't find but 
Model 2870 is listed with a Kit # 3-358. For tech info look here.

Do you have cables to the heat control valves on the heater boxes?

No light good, brite light bad.
