thats all i could think of... if when reving up and the bracket isnt tight or is broke it could be shaking it loose?
wished i could help more all i could think of.

I'm currently in the parking lot of the Flying-J in Fort Chiswell VA, (I-81/I-77, Exit 80), 

side note: Flying J has "WI-FI" acsess. (a true life saver right now)

the alternator belt on my '78 bus will not stay on. this is a new issue (I have owned this bus sence '97 and the belt has only "popped" twice befor tonight). I made it this far (from toledo Ohio) with no issues like this (-at-) all....

SHORT VERSION: when I tention it to the "correct tension" it looks fine and will stay on if you start and rev the engin, but as soon as you get a couple hundread yards down the road it pops off again. bot bolts are tight on the alternator.

LONG VERSION:I stoped to get gas and as I was accelerating down the "get-on ramp" RED LIGHT ON, so I pull over fix it... cool, wait for lul in trafic start accelerating 2nd gear, 3rd gear, cluch down to go to forth RED LIGHT ON, so I pull over fix it AGAIN... his tme by the book!! all looks good, chuk wheels start bus go look (-at-) alternator belt all apears well, so here we go... wait for lul in trafic start accelerating 2nd gear, 3rd gear, cluch down to go to forth RED LIGHT ON, this time I just keep going to the next exit, find Flying J parking lot, try fix again, test rive down side street.... well you get the idea..

I noticed when I rev the motor (using thr trotel cabel) a lot of vibration (-at-) higher RPMs...

I have both Bently and muir here and neither are any help!!!!!
email or call my cell # 419-944-7946
