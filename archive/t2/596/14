Subject: Use 78 FI FS, i have no need for it...

Hey guys, i was cleaning the garage, mostly VW parts and i have decided 
i will not go FI, so i have a pristine 78 (i think) 97% complete FI 
system that i don't need, am sure someone could use this one, if not to 
convert, maybe as spare parts....
here is a shot:

of course i have all the rest...

Make me an offer, but remember, 30 hours cleaning and checking this one, 
of what i know, it's working perfectly. I have also paid $120 USD fot it!!!!
