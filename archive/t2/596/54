Subject: Re: [T2] oil temp sender install

Well Id have to suggest what I did after finding it on the type2.com page.
20$ digital cooking thermometer (with audible alarm at any set
temp)...couple of lengthened wires, bit of extra copper tubing from any
auto/hardware store, a little JB Weld.  Put'em all together, replace
dipstick and you have the single cheapest digital oil temp gauge ever.

See the type2.com website for the real article.  Its in the tech articles
section I think.

As for Type IV sending units, Ive heard you have to tap holes and such
instead of just replacing the drain plug, but Im not the one to be specific
on that.

Good Luck!
