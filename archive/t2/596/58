Subject: LPG Pressure Regulator leak

My understanding is that regulators have a finite life regardless of exterior
appearance.  While you might be able to remove the regulator and patch the
leak by resealing the threads with teflon tape, you'd probably be better off
just replacing the regulator.  You can order them from RV supply houses

install it yourself.  If you're in a hurry I'd just stop by an RV service
center and have them replace it and check the whole system for leaks while
there at it.
I just had to replace the regulator and shut-off valve on my 76.  It proved to
be cheaper than a new tank.  I think I still have a leak somewhere between the
regulator and the stove so when I cook I shut off the valve at the tank and
let the small amount in the line burn out before turning off the stove.  Your
set up may be more complicated if you have a 3way fridge.
Good luck - And be safe!

there is a hissing sound from the regulator mounted on the side of the tank
(outside left side) and the smell of propane.
Anyone have any suggestions?
