Subject: Eliminating Test Plug & Extra Wires

Hey Guys,

I'm in the middle of sorting out and organizing my wiring system... The engine
compartment could be spagetti with a little marinara sauce.  I have lot's of
wires for a non-existing AC compressor and all those test plug wires.  I'm
trying to simplify everything and want to eliminate any wires which are
unnessary.  The engine compartment looks great with the new Dove Blue paint
and single Weber.  I'm using bright yellow for wiring looms!  Can I cut and
cap all the wires going to the old test port and remove the unit?  I have a
full color wiring diagram and I'm not seeing where it would make a difference
in eliminating the entire thing?
Has anyone done this?

Thanks,

Tom
