At least you've got a Type 4 engine, so the alt belt won't kill your cooling...

I would overtighten it to see if it stays on. Get thee to a parts
store and pick up a couple of belts, and a piece of sandpaper.
Assuming all the bracket bolts, including the pivot bolt on the
bottom, are tight... Scuff the alt pulley with the sandpaper and
replace the belt with a new one.

Might be just enough to get you where you're going.
