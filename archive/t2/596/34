Subject: RE: [T2] Not White Hubcaps - grey

Was it originally a panel? I have seen grey ones on panels/commericals
before.

1970 Sporty, originally a panel. (Chrome Hubcaps though)


I was in a boneyard in Eastern NC and spoted a camper with painted
hubcaps. They looked white to me.

I was wrong...the original hubcaps on my '70 ASI/Riviera pop top camper
were not white, as I thought.  They - according to closer inspection of
original brochures - were a light grey color.  Anyone seen these around,
either on someone's camper or else sold somewhere?
