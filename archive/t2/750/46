It may be the carb float, as Mr. Chubb suggests... I don't know beans
about carbs.

Let me suggest, however, that a torn diaphram in the disc brake booster
can produce these symptoms.  The way to check for this is to put a vacuum
gauge on the engine, start it up and have someone stand on the brakes as
you watch the gauge.  NOTE: the parking brake *must* be off for this test
to be valid.  The vacuum guage may bobble a bit when the brakes are
applied, but should return to "normal" (15" or better of vacuum) almost
instantly.  If it drops and stays down until the brakes are released, then
the diaphram in your booster is tearing.

OOK!
