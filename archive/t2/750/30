Subject: RE: [T2] Short range FM transmitters

I recently built my own FM radio station using a kit from Ramsey 
Electronics. http://www.ramseyelectronics.com

They have a few options depending on how far you want to go, but it sounds 
like the Ramsey FM-10a and a $10 home-brew antenna will do the trick.
I've modified my xmitter a bit since initially building it and am now 
getting about 100mw of stable power out of a kit that came stock with 
something like 10mw. With my 105cm J-Pole antenna, I can get about a mile's 
worth of line-of-sight distance out of it.
The FM-10a only costs about $35 and runs on 9-12v so you could power by your 
bus battery if you wanted. Connect music with RCA jacks and go.

'Hope that helps! Let me know if you need any more info about that kit.
