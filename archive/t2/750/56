Subject: [T2] Heavy Braking = Stall ?

I've got a vacuum gauge to lend if needed.... though they are cheap to buy.

I would agree the first thing to check is the brake servo.  Be double-sure the 
check valve in the line from intake manifold to brake servo is in good shape.  
If gas fumes get sucked into the servo, it's death for the diaphragm.  That 
little 50" check valve cost me an expensive replacement, since I could not find 
one in decent used condition... that was of course in the days before the 
electronic auction site.

In the 60s I drove into Pittsburgh almost daily, owned a Bug and Bus, had many 
friends who drove Bugs and Buses.  No one ever complained about engines dying, 
so I never bent the float tab on my 28 PICT.... sorry, that diagnosis would not 
be in accord with my experience.

Let me suggest, however, that a torn diaphram in the disc brake booster
can produce these symptoms.  The way to check for this is to put a vacuum
gauge on the engine, start it up and have someone stand on the brakes as
you watch the gauge.  NOTE: the parking brake *must* be off for this test
to be valid.  The vacuum guage may bobble a bit when the brakes are
applied, but should return to "normal" (15" or better of vacuum) almost
instantly.  If it drops and stays down until the brakes are released, then
the diaphram in your booster is tearing.
