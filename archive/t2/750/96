1973 Bus For Sale in Pittbsurgh, PA:

You now know as much as I do. 

(Sounds a bit pricey, but given that it needs to be sold THIS WEEK, that 
might be flexible).

In other news, I trailered my 71 from Baltimore to Pittsburgh this 
weekend.  The webbing holding the front right wheel kept coming off, 
which seemed a bit dodgey, but I added some extra safety lines (including 
the tow cable that came with my parent's '71 beetle when they bought it in 
Germany) and made it safe and sound.

Happy Bussing!
