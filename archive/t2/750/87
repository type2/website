Well, it has been a hell of a run. Thanks to everyone on the list for
their wonderful support over the years, I could've never made it without
you!

I've come to the end of my rope with my '79 Westy. I've had to replace
my heads twice over the past couple years and now #3 is going again :^(
I no longer have the money, time, or space to work on the bus anymore.
Finally cleaned her up this weekend and snapped some photos. You can
see more details in the buy and sell section of type2.com, listing #1290.

Happy trails,
