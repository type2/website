I am running the CB set on mine with no problems. I would condider
that perhaps the cool side is not firing correctly. Pull the plugs
one by one while running, and confirm all four plugs are firing. It
could also be a vacuum leak on the hot side. An erratic idle would
lead me to believe that perhaps either they are out of sync, or one
side just isn't doing it's job. good luck.
