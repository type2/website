Make the foam a bit larger, but not much. WIdth around 1 inch total
oversize. For the front 1 inch will look like stock. My sketch has a
lip hanging down which would require gluing another piece but will
look awesome.

I've got the measurements for my 73 stock westy bed somewhere in a box
that I obviously haven't opened yet since the move.

Ideally if you have the $$ you can remove the wood bases and take them
to an upholstery shop and let them do it all. But I've priced the foam
itself at around $110 from local shops in SoCal. So it may be worth it
to you to do it yourself. But let the shop cut the foam. I have yet to
figure out a way to cut it so it's smooth. ;-)
