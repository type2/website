Ok: since I started the thread, I will blame Outlook's spell checker. 

So if my wife has the map and I am driving, she is my navigational
instrument?

Hi All,

I was a military pilot for about 17 years and we usually called the
navigation and flight condition instruments, INSTRUMENTS.  We called the
engines, hydraulics, transmissions (Chinook helicopters have 5 of
them) and other system monitoring gauges, GAUGES.  But this probably means
very little because most of us were unable to construct a complete sentence
without at least one explicative (which does come in quite handy when I'm
working on my bus).
