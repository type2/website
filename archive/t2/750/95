Bart,

Some folks think that an anti-sieze coating on the plugs helps them get 
the plugs out later.

In my experience it does help me out but thats me not for everyone. 



Over many years, I have always heard that on air cooled aluminum heads, 
*not* to use it...mostly for various reasons having to do with heat 
transfer.

 

this may be true but havent ever heard that?



I have actually had some spark plug threads strip out on engines that did 
not belong to me. Mostly because they hadn't been changed in 20,000 
miles and were over torqued when installed.

i change mine every other oil change...... might not need them but always get new ones anyways....

Inspect and change them according to the published maintanence schedule 
and tighten them according to the specifications in Bentley and you will 
be fine.

tight is tight ..... i have seen some people put them in way way to tight.....thats ridiculous////

Skip the anti-sieze!

i will continue my use of it as i found it benefical until i see a fact that it really does ruin the heads from heat temps....

thats all at this point i can have though is a opinion.........i havent ever had a problem useing it though....

Cheers, dave





Peace and Love
Chris
