Subject: Light clutch

I replaced the clutch cable on my UK spec '71 yesterday. After the fun and 
games of getting the old one out and the new one in (hint: rotate the cable 
using an electric screwdriver and it screws itself along the rubber flexi 
tube - better than brute force), discovering I had the wrong one and 
replacing it etc. Everything seems to be working fine.

The clutch now seems lighter than with the old cable. I know I have greased 
everything up again but now it's as light as a feather. Can replacing a 
cable really do this ? Is it likely I have missed something ? I did have to 
straighten the flexi tube at the back but I put it back in the clamp as 
before so I don't think I have changed anything.

I've never done a clutch cable before, the old one lasted at least 10 years 
which seems pretty good by any standards so I've no reference.

Thanks

Phil
