Hi Volks,

I was riding in my Dad's vanagon today and it has TERRIBLE radio  
reception. The poor audio quality got me thinking about those  
wireless connectors to feed the signal from a CD walkman or an ipod  
into the FM radio. That then led me to wonder.... what's the range on  
one of those things? Would it be possible to increase the range out  
to 200 yards or so? With that much range I could create a wireless PA  
system for the campground at Buses Of The Corn; and use it as our own  
camp-out radio station. That way we could all listen to the same  
tunes at once...

If anyone knows a cheap and easy way to do this please let me know by  
p-mail.


Happy trails,
