Subject: dash mounted table

So ... finally got up the courage to mount that thing today - I'm still 
hyperventilating from drilling holes in my beautiful vinyl dash - anyway - 
where do the folks store those tables when traveling?  I'm a little 
reluctant to put it behind the driver's seat as I hate to see it get 
scratched.
