Subject: Re: [T2] Busted clocked?

The little metal disk that snaps around as the magnetic relay energizes. This is the heart of the clock, it's what "winds the spring" (it actually IS the spring, if you ask me). Anyway, it had come out of its position. When I first put it back, I had it opposite the way it should have gone in. Once I figured this out (and resoldered the fusible connection to the realy, common breakage point), it fired right up. There are a couple of good sites that have hints and pictures of the Kienzle-VDO clocks that we have in our  veedubs.
