Subject: 82 Westy Timing

Thanks for the offers of help.  Now that the timing scale is found and  set 
to specs the Westy passed smog with flying colors and all emission readings  
were way below max allowed.  Setting the timing at the specified 7.5  degrees 
ATDC has a noticeable effect on power at higher speeds but the  technician told 
me that if I advance it back to the level of  the  previous owners  I would 
destroy the #3 cylinder.  (sure enough, the  previous owners replaced #3 
cylinder 40,000 miles ago and  new heads 9,000  miles ago).  Is there a happy medium 
or should I just get used to getting  the middle finger salute all the time as 
I try to get up to speed? (average  speed of traffic in San Diego is 
somewhere between 70 and 90 depending on Red  Bull consumption)
Chuck
