Hi All,

I was a military pilot for about 17 years and we usually called the 
navigation and flight condition instruments, INSTRUMENTS.  We called 
the engines, hydraulics, transmissions (Chinook helicopters have 5 of 
them) and other system monitoring gauges, GAUGES.  But this probably 
means very little because most of us were unable to construct a 
complete sentence without at least one explicative (which does come in 
quite handy when I'm working on my bus).
