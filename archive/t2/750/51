All of your brake lines are deteriorated, even if there seems to be no degra-
dation...Rubber ages even if it's not used. Tires are perhaps the worst in
this area, tho'. New old tires are suspect at best, but any old rubber pro-
duct is a gamble...Of course, this is offset by the "quality" of the replace-
ment part, so's you pays yer money and takes yer chances... ;-(
