Subject: Re: [T2] Glove Box Mounting

If you look in the space while the glove box is out, you will see that 
one can make their own deeper box liner- I did it with cardboard over 
which I sprayglued felt fabric.  There are cutouts in the cardboard for 
the ducting. It sits on a thin plyboard that I fit between the dash side 
and upon wood blocks glued to the fresh air duct in the back.  Now I can 
fit a US atlas in there without rolling it up!  Pics available on request.
