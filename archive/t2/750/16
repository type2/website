Subject: Westfalia Mattress foam dimensions

I want to replace the mattress foam on my folding rear seat, Z bed

Should I cut the foam to match the plywood,, or should it be slightly larger?

Do you know the dimensions of the foam for a 1974 Westfalia full width [bed]
seat bottom and the back ?
i.e thickness,, width and length,  is there a density that is any value?  I
think I have a source for the foam that is the correct density just going by the
feel of it.. and I know what the plywood dimensions are. For some reason it
makes sense to me to have the foam slightly larger than the plywood.

Thanks!
