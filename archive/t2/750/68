From Don Tuleja:

 How much throw is required for a Type 4 thermostat?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Throw as in travel of the thermostat?

I have one in my hand, fully closed. If I measure the distance in the holder where it reaches fully open, that 
is: 14mm
