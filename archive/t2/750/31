Subject: Van sitting for two years, what can I expect?

Hello group,

I recently bought an 83 Vanagon Adventurewagen, yea!  I bought this van on 
ebay for a great price and can't wait to go pick it up.  It is about 5 hours 
away in NY and the van has been siting for at least 2 YEARS.

Heres where I need advice.  Other than my AAA card, all my tools, a new 
battery and replacement fluids and filters, what else should I bring, and 
don't say a bible.

The seller assured me that the van ran when he parked it two years ago.  
What else should I check and/or replace before I get underway?  If I do 
break down, I can have it towed all the way home with my AAA card... but i 
want to avoid permanant damage on the way, thats my real concern.  When I 
get it home, I will be able to love it and baby it.

Thanks ladies and gents, this is a great community.
