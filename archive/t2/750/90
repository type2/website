Subject: Re: [T2] Dual carb troubleshooting techniques needed

hight corbett we have spoken before about these carbs when i had mine brand new from cb performance....
hippiedog69(-at-)hotmail.com
check with tony (-at-) that email addy.....
he now has my old/new carbs on his bus that i had so many problems out of....
i think they are finally running fine for him....hes a pretty dang good mechanic though.... me i just fiddle till its right on wrong... LOL....and then say HElp hehehehehehehe
come ot find out i had a bent rod so mine were not going to run right when i had them anyways it seems to be...
 
the hot side hmmmmmm?
 
on those you have the idle and mixture...
yes set mixture to two half turns out....then adjust them with the synch tool....
also make sure that they stay in synch when reving engine up....also i found mine at one time to be out at rpm increase....
 
watch those chokes,,,, my left choke drivers side the choke plate bushing was hanging out of mine from factory i pulled it out of the stuck choke flat with a pair of needle nose pliars one day and was like wtf????? till my friend phil told me what it was had no idea and also someone i think on type 2 confirmed this as well from what i wrote and sounded like to them....
 
 
 
my biggest problem with these specific carbs were the crappy ********* linkage...
i think faster laster used a scat linkage on his solex carbs ????
jason you out there....?
 
jason provided me with lots of help on my carbs even though mine were for a type 4 and his are on his type 1.....his help on these was very profitable at the given time....
 
good luck to you....
also i had problems with the manifolds sealing right... double triple check those...
also i dont like those cheapy manifold gaskets they sale with the package...i used diffrent ones and got a better seal.... no more hearing birds chirp....
 
either way good luck on them...
if i can help i will from what i remember on them....
hated that hanger type thin linkage though...
 
peace and love

I am helping a friend try to install a set of CB performance carbs on his Type
2 bus. I have the same set, but never installed them, currently running stock
carbs. We got them on and the bus started. After it ran for about 2 minutes or
so, I turned it off. It ran ok, but was somewhat erratic at idle. I noticed
that the right carb manifold was hot and the left carb manifold was cool to
the tough. The only adjustments that we have had time to make is to set the
volume screw two 1/2 turns out on each carb and some basic syncing of the
carbs. They are still not synced, but I wanted to get feedback about the heat
before we run it to long.

What does the hot manifold mean or maybe the cool manifold mean? I think the
hot side is probably the problem and not the cool side. It did not run long at
all. I thought maybe it was running lean on that side and creating more heat?
We hope to work on it again this week, anything else I should be looking for
besides the volume screw and the sync of the carbs. This bus was running fine
before the carb switch, but like me they are replacing a weber progressive
carb. Got some basic troubleshooting techniques for me?

Also, anyone have good or bad experience with the AJ Sims Kadron carbs? If
these carbs have problems we will be needing another set and the Kadrons from
AJ looked nice with him setting them up.

Thanks,
Corbett



Peace and Love
