Subject: Update, trouble starting

Hi,

 

Thanks for the e-mails I received about problems starting.  It turns out it
was a mix of two (2) problems.....

 

#1 - the battery was low 

#2 - one of the wires was dis-connected at the ignition switch

 

Remember, no matter how unlikely it is, it is always possible to have two
(2) problems at the same time!!

 

All is fixed for now, and van working well.

 

Best regards,

Shawn
