Subject: Re: [T2] Adding gaUges -spelling

I was skeptical about the word "gage" as a euphemism for marijuana, but found this enrty in Wikipedia:
 
Reefer was common in the early twentieth century, but it is now often used only humorously, often in reference to the 1930s propaganda film Reefer Madness, which significantly misrepresented the effects of cannabis. Terms also from this time period are: mex, muggles, gage, viper jive...

 
Bus content: I have a Westy and the electric sink pump was not working. Checked it out thoroughly and am getting power through theswitch, so I am surmising that the pump must be shot. i guess I'll yank it out and bench test it (replacements are $30, yow!).
 
I has a non-working clock that I spent 4 days puzzling over, but, by God, I finally figured it out and fixed it. Sure makes that blank hole in the dash purty, being filled with a matching, WORKING clock!
