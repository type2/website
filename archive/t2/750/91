Bart,

Some folks think that an anti-sieze coating on the plugs helps them get 
the plugs out later.

Over many years, I have always heard that on air cooled aluminum heads, 
*not* to use it...mostly for various reasons having to do with heat 
transfer.

I have actually had some spark plug threads strip out on engines that did 
not belong to me.  Mostly because they hadn't been changed in 20,000 
miles and were over torqued when installed.

Inspect and change them according to the published maintanence schedule 
and tighten them according to the specifications in Bentley and you will 
be fine.

Skip the anti-sieze!

Cheers, dave

 And as we leave in two months for a ride of about 15.000 km, how regular do
 you advice to tune up the engine, considering that we did not drive much kms
 last years?
 
 BTW, it's a 1600.
