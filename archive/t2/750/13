That could be to compensate for a vacuum leak or other problem.

Here's how the scale is marked:

Here's how to find the notch:

Correct. The problem that can occur is if the PO separated the fan and
pulley and put them back together 90/180/270 deg. off.

Set the engine to TDC #1 as indicated by the distributor rotor and check the
state of the valves. You can verify the position of the valves using this
graph I made (valve height vs. time):

http://homepage.mac.com/ratwell/.Pictures/Maintenance3/247-TimingChart.jpg

When #1 valves are closed you can see on the graph (last vertical line where
it says TDC #1), which valves are in which position based on their position
relative to the vertical line:

#4 Intake open
#4 Exhaust closed
#3 Exhaust about to close
#3 Intake starting to open
#2 Exhaust open
#2 Intake closed

If your distributor is 180 degrees out the engine won't fire properly unless
the spark plug wires have been swapped around.
