Subject: Re: [BP] Westfalia Mattress foam dimensions

Hi Jamie,

When I widened the 1973 Z-bed for the westfakia I went to homed epot  
and  bought some 3/4" plywood. I measured the width I wanted and then  
glued the foam from the oriiginal seat onto the new plywood. I used a  
piece of foam from the seat back to widen the base and then made a  
new seat back cushion from some foam I had laying around.

What a disaster.

The foam I used on the seat back wasn't the same density as the seat  
base or the rear cushion. As a result there was a dip in the mattress  
just south of my pelvis. After a week of sleeping like that (EveryBus  
2001) my spine felt like a pretzel. The next weekend after I got home  
I was out at a wrecking yard pulling apart a westy and rebuilding my  
seat back with the same foam.

My $0.02 --- Replace all the foam at the same time. Make it the same  
size as the foam you remove. Mixing densities in a mattress is a BAD  
idea.


Happy trails,
