Subject: fans

OK, gentlemen (and ladies), I'm about to spend my
first summer with the bopmobile as my daily driver. 
I've determined that I have to have a fan.  I've seen
them mounted on dashes in some of the pics I've seen. 
Have any advice?  Are they wired up to run with the
engine off?  How long before it kills the battery? 
Any bad experiences with them?  Recommendations? 
Specific models would be nice.  Cheers....KR
