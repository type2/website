Hi Glenn,

When you say "death for the diaphragm"... do you mean it will really
do damage? I've been hunting down similiar problems with my bus and I
was somewhat relieved to find the vacuum hose going to the servo in
really bad shape; I'm really hoping that the servo itself is still
OK... (I was hoping that my big challenge was only hunting down
suitable vacuum hose...)
