I have one mounted on dash thru an existing screw from the guage pod  
face plate.  The power is supplied from cigarette lighter.  Works  
just ok.  It is especially nice having a little breeze blow on your  
face while sitting in traffic and 95 plus degrees outside.  don't  
remember where i got it and what brand though.
