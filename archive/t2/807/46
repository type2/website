There is something wrong here. The threaded holes in the muffler-tailpipe
flange should be m8 x 1.25. Somewhere along the way the holes have been
enlarged. The repair should not be too difficult - either weld some studs to
the muffler or retap the holes - by welding in some metal to drill and
retap, or use an threaded insert.
