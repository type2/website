Hey Guys  I spent some time in netherland right below Estes park    neterland 
was a crazy place back in the early 70's  like a permanent fiddlers 
convention  the mayor had hair way down his back and sold pot LOL   we were traveling 
thur with 3 split buses and 8 people on a cross country tour when one of the 
buses blew an engine  we had some friends in netherland and stayed there for 
about 3 days fixing the bus . The town was clebrating their centennial I think 
and it was one week long party.  Hey troy send me your addrest and I'll mail you 
those carbs I owe you  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
