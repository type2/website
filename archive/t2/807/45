Subject: Tailpipe question

I don't know if anyone has run across this before, but I cannot seem to locate
the correct bolts to connect my tailpipe to my muffler on my '74 bus.  I went
to a machine shop and they cleaned out the threads on the muffler and the
correct tap to fit the threads turned out to be 11mm X 1.25 pitch.  Well, I've
come to find out that this size bolt is virtually non-existent and I've looked
everywhere I can think of.  I even called VW which turned out to be useless as
usual.  Anybody else experience this?  This muffler was a stock replacement
part, and I believe the brand name is Leistrich.
