Subject: Re: [T2] new factory 1600DP motors??

In the 1970's, MV Augusta motorcycles had combination
starter/generators. 

Giacomo Augustini--what a rider for the MV factory--saw him win Daytona
on a MV in 77.

John Deere, IH, Massey Fergeson, Miineapolis Moline, Oliver, and many
other agriculteral equipment had starter / generator's in the 40--50's

Nothing new

Odd thing is, they had this , and I quote, "wonderful idea that no-one
has ever used before" of combining the starter and alternator in one
unit. I realise Porsche had a DC setup so technically what they are
saying is correct, but does anyone else think Ford are being a bit rude?
I happened to tape the TV documentary this was on, and watched again
just to check. They (well, their engineer on the show) definitely claim
that using a single unit as generator and starter "is an idea no one
else has used in a vehicle before." 
Talk about re-inventing the wheel....
