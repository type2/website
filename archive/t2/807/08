Justin,

This has come up before I think.  There are folks in England that 
specialize in this sort of thing and apparently have done it for years.

When we lived in the oil fields in Texas, LPG was pretty much a free 
by-product for the workers.  We had a 50's something ford that ran on 
it....didn't seem to be a big deal to convert....just the whopping big 
container in the trunk....oh...and my stepDad almost frooze his hand off 
refilling at one time because he wasn't paying attention.

I just googled for        england automobile lpg conversion

There might not be a good place in a bus to put the storage container....

Cheers, dave
