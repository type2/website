Subject: Since the trip to Cali is off...

Anybody been to Cheyenne, WY? It's a 2 hour trip from here and I was
thinking about a mini vacation. Super 8 has a $50/night rate this week. Get
the wife and kids out of the house for a couple days.

Especially since it's raining so I can't (won't) work on the bus for the
next 2 days. Though I did safety wire the fuel inlets on the two carbs. I
also pulled, cleaned, and regapped my spark plugs last night. All were
colored a light gray/tan color. Yay! I checked the float and accel pump on
my right carb and they're fine. I didn't get to do the wiring in the engine
compartment I wanted to do. This weekend I suppose.

I've gotta say though, the passenger seat I picked up at the junkyard that
had the original padding still in good shape is way comfortable! Too bad the
drivers seat wasn't as nice!
