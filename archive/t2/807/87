Subject: Re: [T2] oil from breather

From John Scott:

I've done 5000 miles on a VEGE reconditioned engine 1600 AD type 1 and have developed an oil seepage problem I
am not talking about vast quantities but enough to cause concern, it appears to be coming from the oil
breather - some is making it up to the cleaner element causing staining.
All the various connections are tight.
In order to help me eliminate various causes can anybody tell me which way up the oil baffle plate between
generator stand and crankase is supposed to go?

I did not see a reply to this yet......

The plate goes on with the fins down. The hole is off-center, so the plate will only fit one way.

But, I hate to say it..... I doubt this is your problem.

Sounds like too much crankcase pressure. This would either be a ring problem or the vent system is plugged up.
I would bank on the rings.....
