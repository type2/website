What's the best time of year to do a tour of Colorado in my bus? Too many 
tourists in the summer sucks. Too much snow sucks. I want to drive up Mt. 
Evans and all over. What month would the CO listees recommend?

It sure is a beautiful drive, and I can let you know that a bus can
make it. We took that drive in the 66 LOADED down with 6 people and a
trailer. Talk about no power!!! ;)
