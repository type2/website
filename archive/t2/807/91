For those who don't remember Corvair's driving around, here are some 
specs.

"Did you remember that the Corvair was offered in turbocharged Corsa form 
in 1965 and 1966? With a curve-hugging, fully independent suspension, over 
1 horsepower for each of its 164 cubic inches of displacement and a 
2,500-lb. curb weight, the Corsa was and remains a pony car alternative 
for iconoclasts."

So, 2500#/164hp===15.2 lbs/ hp

And I guarantee that they could burn rubber with the best ofthem.
But...every one of them that I ever saw come into the "sevice" station 
where I worked was just hotter than a firecracker!....much hotter than our 
bus and bug engines get!

Cheers, dave
