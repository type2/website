Folks,

Remember I was looking for late bay tail light wiring covers last week?


I received a set of "used" tail light wiring covers from Ken Madson at 
Busco yesterday.

***Absolutely*** perfect.
Right price.
Right delivery....ordered on Friday, received on **Monday**
**Well** packed...even after the USPS "crushed" the package.

If everything Ken ships are as good as these, he *is* "da man".
...and you don't see me do kudo's often.  I am extremely pleased!


Cheers, dave
