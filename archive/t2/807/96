Subject: Fresh Air vent seals

Due to massive air leaks, especially noticable in the winter, I removed
the front grill to replace the seals. Glad I did, because there was a
lot of rust in there when I removed the grill. The bottom and top edge
were rusted good as well as the fresh air metal flaps. I sanded them
down and cleaned and slapped a coating of rust bullet on them. We'll
see how that lasts. (Don't cringe Terry!)

Anyhow, as was recommended in the archives, I used 1/8" foam tape to
fashion new seals. All went well. It seals better but not completely.
Has anyone used more than 1/8" seals?  I'm really thinking about putting
another layer of foam tape on top of the existing tape.  Any
recommendations?
