For me, the flat spring steel that goes around
the perimeter of the seat is broken.

I thought of taking the built-in mini-welder
that joins up the ends of new bandsaw blades
out of that device and trying to weld the broken
pieces of that seat frame back together, but if
the experts in the house wanted to chime in with
why that would be a Bad Idea I would appreciate 
their advice.
