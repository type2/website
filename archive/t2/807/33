Don,

There's nothing in Cheyenne.  Head up to Estes Park.  Lodging should be
cheap as the season is basically over.  I was up there last weekend.  It
was in the 70's and beautiful.  The elk were everywhere.  You might even
find Trailridge Road still open, although I believe it probably closed
with the last snow.  The route to bear lake region stays open year round.
It's amazing there .. many lakes, trails, wildlife, waterfalls, etc.  The
best part about this time of year is that most of the tourists are gone!

We should get Troy to take off some weekend and caravan the busses up
there.  I've got a great camping spot for next year!
