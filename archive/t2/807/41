I second the drive to Estes Park.  Although not in the bus, we drove 34 all 
the way through that portion of the Rocky Mountain National Park a few days 
ago.  It's a bit of a drive, and get's up to around 12k feet.  One of the 
most beautiful drives I have been on.  Also the first time I have seen a 
mature evergreen standing about 2 feet tall  :)
