In the 1970's, MV Augusta motorcycles had combination starter/generators.

Odd thing is, they had this , and I quote, "wonderful idea that no-one 
has ever used before" of combining the starter and alternator in one 
unit. I realise Porsche had a DC setup so technically what they are 
saying is correct, but does anyone else think Ford are being a bit rude? 
I happened to tape the TV documentary this was on, and watched again 
just to check. They (well, their engineer on the show) definitely claim 
that using a single unit as generator and starter "is an idea no one 
else has used in a vehicle before."
 
Talk about re-inventing the wheel....
