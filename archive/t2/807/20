Subject: Turn Signal Base

While continuing my installation of sound damping materials in my '72, I
walked around front and noticed that one of my turn signals was half full of
water.  I received new seals and lenses from Bus Depot today.  I have
decided that I would like new bases if I can find them.  No one seems to
have any.  Does anyone know where some can be obtained?

The new Vinal Non-perf white headliner looks great.  I also had my drivers
seat rebuilt and covered.  It really needed it.
