I love the fall.  The last week of September / First week of October you
get the peak colors.  The aspens in the fall are amazing.  Tourism is a
big pain, but there are definitely summer towns and winter towns.  Estes
Park for example is definitely a summer town.  There is no skiing and
there is little winter draw aside from the national park.  Winter Park
and Aspen are both winter towns and are very much accessible and somewhat
affordable in the summer.  Having said that it is hard to beat summers in
Colorado.  Most passes are open by the end of May, and close sometime in
October.  Be careful though.  You can encounter large amounts of new snow
in may and june even.  Same goes for September and October.

Stop by for a beer!
