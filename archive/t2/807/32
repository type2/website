Subject: 2000 Engine rebuild essentials

I am a newbie on the aircooled VW scene.  I got a '76 bus at the end of
August and finally got brave enough about two weeks ago to get it out on
the Interstate.  In any event, an oil leak started and the engine
started knocking.  Luckily, I got off to the side quickly, noticed the
problem, added some oil, and managed to get to the next exit to have it
towed home.

Now I am looking at my first engine rebuild.  Before pulling the engine,
I checked compression on all cylinders and got 155 on 1, 135 on 2, 135
on 3, and 125 on 4.  The engine is now pulled and I am ready start the
disassembly process.  However, I am trying to weigh the rebuild cost
against the "new engine" cost.

So...my question is... what essential parts do I need to go ahead and
order for the rebuild (gasket kit, crankshaft seal, flywheel seal, what
else?)?

I realize that I will probably find other things when I get in there but
some items should be a given (and I don't know what). Money is tight so
I don't want to spend more than I have to but at the same time I don't
want to throw any money away.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks,
