All VW engines are designed to run with a negative
pressure in the crankcase, so there must be a way to
make a negative pressure in the case by venting to
atmosphere or the the intake of the carb to draw air
from the case, so when the blow by increases to a
point that you have positive pressure in the case, you
will have weeping oil leaks, especially where the
seals are not tight. Blow by could be the cause(rings)
or you could not have a good draw on the case, not
enough to have a negative pressure. Phil
