Subject: Fw: [T2] new factory 1600DP motors??

 Thanks heaps Kris,
 That's the site I was looking for!!
 On re-reading I notice there is no date for the impending demise of the old
 boxer motor.
 Anyone know any more info? Are they just not using them in a vehicle
 anymore, or are they stopping production all together which would mean our
only option for a new motor would be to re-build?
 Regards,
 Richard
