Subject: LPG (Propane) conversion ..

As a dodgy European I have to be carefull with my language !...

I have a Petrol (Gas) powered 1600cc Type II and I want to convert it to LPG
(Gas).

I may be in trouble .. Has anyone considered this (or even done it?)     The
"Problem" is that you need hot water to work the vapouriser ...

I've heard of people wrapping a bit of pipe round the Exhaust (Muffler) and
then building an expansion bottle outfit .. But I've never seen such a
conversion and I worry what would happen if you were running on petrol would
it all boil up ?

The other thought I had was why not "Create" a hot water cooling system ..
with a Diesel preheater and a cooling system .. this would have the
advantage that we could put radiators with Chintz covers in the bus ..

Anyone had any experience her ?

Justin
