 I happened to visit the UK importers of new type 2s from Brazil this 
week. I went to buy a new set of seats. They had a huge pile (at least a 
100 sets of front, middle and rear) in the yard. They were the 'rubbish' 
from converting hundreds of new imports (they come as 8 seat people 
carriers) to campers.

Anyway, I took the opportunity to look over a brand new van - very 
tempting. And whilst talking to the mechanic about king pins, he 
mentioned that production of the vans would be stopping in Brazil in one 
month (i.e. the 30th of November.) They all have 1600 type 1 motors 
(with Fuel injection from the Polo!). Apparently he believed engine 
production would 'officially' stop at the same time, but several firms 
in Brazil were being licensed to carry on the work. He wasn't too 
worried about the supply of engines drying up. He seemed to think he 
would still be able to get a brand new engine for the next 3 years, as 
that is the warranty VW gives with the vans. The firm was looking into 
how long VW were actually prepared to continue to support current 
owners. The standard term was 10 years in Europe, and as VW sell the 
vans with a 10 year finance plan, that sort of implies something.


I remember the panic 10 years after production of the van stopped in 
Europe - everyone here was convinced the end was nigh for our beloved 
vehicles.

How wrong we were.
