Subject: all hail king karl - again!

in addition to his myriad other kingly duties, karl VS just alerted 
me to an internet ad for an nos 70 bus t/s switch...  which, some may 
recall, i need :)
amazingly, i snagged said item. without karl keeping an eye out for 
me, i would still be hanging upside down under my dash, trying to 
figure out which wire is letting all the smoke out.

karl MORE than da man - he da whole species.


next time some newbie ticks karl off with a fart, they have me to answer to!
