Well, you just remove the poles and you'll be left
with a piece of pvc.  Buy a T adaptor at home depot or
any place that sells piping stuff and attach it.  I
don't remember, but you may have to buy a short
theaded piece to attach it with.  The adaptor will sit
right in the gutter.  Then buy a couple of awning
clips and clip it down to the gutter.  It works great.
 If you buy the awning, you'll be able to figure out
the best way to attach it to the bus.  It is exactly
the right height. I'm sure there are several ways of
attachment that would make it work.  I haven't done it
myself yet, but the one I saw was perfect.  And cheap.
 Cheers...KR
