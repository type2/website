How long would the starter and battery(s) last with a system like that? 
Probably not a cheap starter either. Idling doesn't use that much fuel, 
particularly with a diesel.

VW did the same: Golf II Ecomatic and Lupo 3L. Shut off and start
automatically when stopped in traffic. Probably used separate starter
and alternator though.

Well, Ford  have just finished putting together a new system for their

diesel vans. When you stop, say at traffic lights, and go into neutral,

the engine shuts off. Put it back in gear, by by the time you release
the clutch the engine has restarted. It all comes down to a little box

of electronics, and a very high power starter motor.
