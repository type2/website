Most of those are controlled by L-Jet and not easily adjustable. Strive to adjust the AFR when the engine is at normal operating temp and idling. Dialing in a particular set of readings while adjusting the wiper is time consuming.

These are the settings I chose that I decided were good after reading one of John C's posts from last year.

Air temp: 60F
head temp: 315F at 50mph, 390F at 70mph
AFR idle: 0.7% (14.21)
AFR light throttle: 0.1% (14.72)
AFR half throttle: 2.5% (13.56)
AFR WOT: 5% (12.64)
