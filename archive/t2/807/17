This would not surprise me.  China is already producing Toyotas from old
dies and there has been an attempt to import them by an outfit in LA.  The
Chinese are not at all concerned with intellectual property laws and they
copy just about everything.

For example, GM has a China-only car called the Chevy Spark.  A
Chinese domestic company has introduced a new car called the Chery QQ.
The two cars are so identical that a door from a QQ fits onto a Spark.

Aircooled Beetles are more labor-intensive than modern designs, but this
might be a good thing for a country with a billion people to keep busy, a
rapidly growing demand for cars, and a network of rough roads to drive
upon.

I just hope that the quality is a bit better than the BMW motorcycle
copies they were importing  a few years back.
