   True story:
Far away (and in a previous century) I worked in a gas station, pumping
petrol...A loud and ominous sound came down the street and pulled into
the station...It was a Corvair, driven by a not so little old lady, and the
rear of the car was shimmering with heat and a cacaphony of heavy metal
sounds. She stopped the car (but not the noises) and I grabbed an oil-
soaked rag and opened the engine cover...The remains of a fan belt were
scattered about it. 
"What happened?" she asked me.
"Broken fanbelt," I ventured, "How long has it been making all these noises?"
"It started about a half hour ago...What's the matter with it now?"
I went into the bay to get the mechanic (who was fond of strolling into work
after breakfast at the tavern up the street with a six pack under his arm).
He came out and looked at the Corvair, turned, and started to walk back to
the bay...
"What's wrong with it?" the lady called to his back.
The mechanic turned around and calmly said, "It's broke, lady, it's broke..."
