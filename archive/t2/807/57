Ned as we call it is a nice little mountain community about 10 miles west
of Boulder.  It is very pretty, although not really a vacation
destination.  Make sure you stop by Boulder Falls just below Ned on your
way up if you do visit Nederland.

If you want the far out hippy dope growing community you need to go visit
gold hill just on the other side of 4 mile canyon from Nederland.  It's a
beautiful drive this time of year and it comes out at bald mountain which
is one of my family's favorite picnic spots in boulder county.

The vanagon seats that I gave Troy came from some guhy in Ned.  They
probably still smell like hippy stink and patchouli :)
