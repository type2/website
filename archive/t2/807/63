I have family in Cheyenne so we've been there a few times. There is an 
area between Cheyenne and Laramie (maybe 1/2 hr drive) called Veedavoo 
(sp) or something like that. I'm not sure on the spelling, but there is 
some nice hiking and picnic areas there. (might be getting a bit chilly 
though, and I bet the wind might even be blowing :) )
