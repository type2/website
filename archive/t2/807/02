With a good cleaning, that Weber progressive will work
just fine on the 2.0 L engine. Disassembly required,
put it in a carb soak(acid bath)wash it out good with
pressure water, then blow dry it with air, after that
set the pieces in a sonic cleaner for about a
hour(might make your wife mad if it's her cleaner for
her jewelery.) It will sing like a new bird. Phil
