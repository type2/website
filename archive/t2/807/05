If the engine is being rebuilt due to wear and the old cooler isn't
leaking then there is no reason that it cannot be reused.

However, if the engine suffered a nastier failure that might introduce
nasty stuff into the oil system then it should be replaced.

I note that many engine builders always supply a new cooler with a new
engine, probably to prevent folks from using grunge-filled old filters.

I recall years ago when my father went through three new transmissions (on
warranty, no less) on a Dodge before convincing the dealer that it might
be a good idea to replace the transmission cooler with the new
transmission.
