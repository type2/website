I thought the water spray on the crotch was an VW attempt at a driver
cooling system :0

Folks, my nomination is for the funky air pressure squirter
system.  VW continued this long after they should have switched to
the more "modern" electrical pump system.

May not seem to be a big thing to some, but when you need it...you
generally need it badly.  By going to an electric pump system, you could

eliminate the valve in the turn signals with a simple contact and
you would remove a lot of rubber tubing that tends to leak after
X years....BTW, I really like it when the tubing goes and sprays
washer water all over your crotch, or down your leg  when you least need

it!  LOL!

Cheers, dave
