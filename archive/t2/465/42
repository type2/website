Could you elaborate on the interference?  Is it the "neck" of the box
interfereing with the hole in the frame member, or is the box hitting some
other item?

As time goes on, early bay boxes will become even more rare, and they
won't be any more robust than they are now.  Eventually, we'll have to
make the late box fit!
