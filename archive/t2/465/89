Subject: Re: [T2] lifter noise

Jamie,

     I already wrote to the original list and told him the following:

 >>Please disregard the e-mail I sent you yesterday. It was late and I kinda 
reversed what I meant to say.<<

What I meant to say was ALL the lifters were bled down EXCEPT both the 
lifters on #3 and the intake on #4.

The over spec. spring was the plunger spring in the #3 exhaust lifter. It was 
much stiffer than the springs in the other lifters.
Someone had been in the engine within the last several thousand miles.
Apparently put one of the lifters (at least) together out of spare parts.
