Sounds just fine!!!

Right now as a working student/full time father/owner of a mortgage and car 
payment/full time husband and owner of a 25 year VW a tour of Knoxville (90 
miles or so from here) seems pretty exotic. Talk to me next year after I 
graduate.

Honestly I would LOVE to go through the VW factory in Brazil.

I need a rich relative. I mean a generous rich relative.... <grin>

Any rich people want to adopt me? <grin>
