Some years ago I changed the tank unit on my -78 bay by cutting a hole in
the sheet metal above the tank. As far as I rememeber the hole had to be 
about 4" by 4".
First I had to meassure the position of the hole by cutting a larger hole 
in a wrecked car
in a scrap yard. The hole of course had to be sealed off with sheet metal 
afterwards,
but I did not have to take out engine and tank.
