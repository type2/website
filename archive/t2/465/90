Subject: Rimco - good heads, bad studs

I posted last week about how happy I was with the head-work RIMCO did on my
914 2.0 heads.  I'm still happy with the work, but one little snag came up
when I went to re-assemble the motor yesterday.

SNAG:  The studs they sent for my beautifully re-worked heads won't work!
They sent me 14 (?) studs that were about 1.5 inches long and 18 (?) studs
that were a whopping 1 inch long.  The longer ones will work for the
intakes, but not anywhere close for the exhausts.  And I have no idea what
the 18 one-inch studs would possibly be used for!

QUESTION:  What are the proper stud sizes for intake and exhaust (this
should be the same for any fuel injected Type IV motor)?
