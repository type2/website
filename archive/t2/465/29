Everyone,

I just got an email from Atlasta, they're on their way to the datacenter
to pickup our server.

Keep tuned to http://www.icantclick.org/status for further information
after we go off the air.

Expect 2-3 days, perhaps longer since we'll be shipping over the
weekend.

Hope to see you by Wednesday!
