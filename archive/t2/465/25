Subject: Re: [T2] VW front Emblem

>>73 Westy..
How is the emblem to be mounted and what size?
Mine is 10" with one screw through the middle into the body
(one center hole only).
Should there be clips and more holes in the body for these clips?<<

Chris,

i can't answer your question regarding what size emblem is stock
for a 73, but i can help you with the mounting question for the
10" emblem.

for the 10" emblem i had on my 72 as well as the one i have now
on my 69 SC, they are mounted using 4 little plastic bits that
snap into the 4 mounting holes on the nose. so yes, there
should be 4 mounting holes for the 10" emblem.

it could be that the 10" emblem is not stock for your year
(someone help me out with that), or at one time maybe the nose
was repaired/replaced on your bus.

i got new emblem mounting bits from West Coast Metric. they 
weren't expensive.

also, as a side note, i have had great sucess using 'Eagle One
Aluminum/Chrome Polish' to shine up the chrome emblem.

sorry i can't answer your question in complete detail but i 
hope the limited info i supplied can help.

happy friday,
