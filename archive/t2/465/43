the DC converter might not have supplied enough current.  connect them to
your bus battery and see if they beep.

The points make and break the circuit which makes the horn vibrate.  They
are initially closed.  When current passes through the horn, the
electromagent flexes the diaphragm, causing the points to open.  The
diaphragm springs back closing the points and the cycle repeats.

That would be the problem.  Horn points have to start closed or the horn
won't start to beep!  Apply voltage to the horn and screw the points in
until you get the beep you want.  You might consider ear protection and it
probably isn't a good idea to do this procedure at 3:00AM!
