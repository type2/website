Subject: Re: [T2] brazil kombis

This article is from a Brazilian website and exlains in summary the 
following:
That the end of the Kombi is NOT confirmed however production did fall 
50% with it's end in mexico.  It is having good success in the 
southeast, northeast, and northern regions of Brasil (that's three out 
of four).  The article likewise tells us that the factory confirms the 
kombi being produced until 2004 (at least).  The article has a 
copyright date of 2002 and makes several references to the 2003 models 
so I gather it's relatively recent and seems credible.  What you don't 
understand you'll just have to trust from me.  By the way, the other 
links on there are great.

here it is

you'll see a school bus (or school kombi?)
