Subject: replaced the dizzy in the 73

well, i took out the original dizzy (going to rebuild
it though) and put in a SVDA from Aircooled.net and
also put in the Petronix I had bought earlier from
Bill and Steve's in Paramount, CA.  Anyway, after
putting it in the bus is running like a top and is a
heck of a lot quicker off the line, well, as quick as
one could expect a little 1700 to be torqueing through
an automatic tranny, but I digress, the dizzy sure
made a difference and now I need to get off my rear
and call Enrique in Santa Ana, CA about spraying my
paint out on it.  I already ordered some fabric
samples from Sewfine so I can clear it with the wife
what would look best on the seats.  I'm thinking black
vinyl with grey tweed inserts but they have a lot of
different tweeds so I ordered a bunch of them to see
what will be best.
