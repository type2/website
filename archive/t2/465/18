Hi there,

All your complains about things they don't have now is good for the birds.
Have a 80 Vanagon and a 72 Westy. The technic goes on and some things they
didn't have at this time or it was just too expensive. I wouldn't change a
thing about what I have right now in my VW's.

Take it easy

KARL

73 Westy
80 Vanagon/L
84 Toyota/L Van
95 Golf TDI
90 Hyundy GSI (wife loves it)
