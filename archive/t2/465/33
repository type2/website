Subject: lifter noise

I have a 1979 bus which sounded great until I set it on jacks for 3 days 
while working on the fuel lines, then I took it down and fired it up now I have a 
lifter knock will this go away. I drove down the road and back but still 
noisy. I beleive the 79 has hydraulic lifters so what can I do. thanks
