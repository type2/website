I have a feeling that there was more modifications to the frame relating
to the steering box than simply making the big hole larger and moving the
bolt holes around.  A reasonable-effort retrofit would probably entail
replacement of the frame member (or at least a piece of it) that supports
the steering box.  While this would seem drastic, when you get into
bits-and-pieces modifications of the existing parts the job rapidly
becomes very large!
