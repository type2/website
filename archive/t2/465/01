My current favorite is the plastic gear in the wiper motor, down from an 
all-metal unit in earlier years.  Since mine failed back in July and I've 
been trying to find a good replacement, I have found none.  I can't imagine 
they saved THAT much by making only one part of the whoile assembly plastic, 
but it does assure that the part will have to be replaced sooner than 
earlier ones.  Planned Obsolesence -- America's way of making cheap crap 
worthwhile!

Let's see, there's the non-removable apron, the plastic door handles, the 
plastic non-reflective taillight assemblies.  What else do people have as 
their favorites?
