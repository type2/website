i did exactly as you are thinking... a few thoughts:

1) NO ALUMINUM CASES unless you intend to spend a lot of $$$ 
machining it to a semblance of the original design. AMHIK.

2) INSPECT >EVERYTHING< with the 'without guesswork' book by your 
side. invest in some good micrometers, calipers, etc. and make sure 
the parts match the specs. REFUSE THEM if they do not.  i found what 
a thought was just a cosmetic blemish on a 69mm c/w crank from DPR - 
it turned out to be a bad weld on a journal (on a crank that was NOT 
supposed to have been welded up) and it came apart at break-in and 
fried my rod bearing.  if it LOOKS odd, DON'T use it.  a GOOD parts 
vendor will work with you to get  a good piece, no matter how many 
times you bring it back.

3) david crow told me he would rather use an old german crank endplay 
shim than a new brazillian one - just make sure it is not dished, 
creased, or worn unevenly (use those micrometers you are going to 
buy). sure enough, when setting my endplay, i couldn't get it to stay 
stable. i had used new brazillian shims. replaced em with old german 
ones and voila. the new ones are too SOFT. he didn't mention mexican 
ones :)

4) you'd be better off using an old oil pressure spring and piston 
than the new ones... again, AMHIK. get some older german or mexican 
ones and measure them against 'without guesswork.'

i am using a 30P1 with a vac dizzy and a mild cam, and haven't had a 
problem yet with choking the motor, but i do want to try a 34P3 at 
some point and see if there is a detectable difference.....
