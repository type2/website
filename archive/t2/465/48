Subject: ATE and Varga replacement caliper rebuild kits??

Ron at the BusDepot has 311698471 and 311698471BR rebuild kits. They show
the same name, but the one ending in BR says for Varga replacement calipers.
Would these two rebuild kits be interchangeable?? The price difference is
significant. Anybody know??
