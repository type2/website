Hi Folks,

Perhaps if we can get enough people together, we could "borrow" a few parts 
from the parts bins, bring them back to the U.S., and assemble our own Brand 
New Type2.com Bus!  Small stuff could be pretty easy; I'm just having 
trouble figuring out how to get a complete Bus unibody into my suitcase...
