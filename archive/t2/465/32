Subject: Re: re Pitman arms and retrofitting steering boxes

Sorry to report, I have given up on fitting a later model steering gearbox
to my 70 bus. There are too many issues regarding fit to resolve, in my
opinion. Aside from the bolt holes not lining up, the body of the box
interferes with the body of the bus enough to prevent it from fitting in
properly. I was very disappointed after buying a new TRW box, a Pitman arm
and a new Pitman arm nut, but I have faced reality and shelved the project.
My original box is now back in, torqued in and finished.

Have you tried pinching the end of the pitman arm between two hammers?
Take the nut off, put a big hammer on one side of the pitman arm and hit
the opposite side of the pitman arm with a medium hammer, perpendicular to
the axis of the rod end.  This flexes the end a bit and can pop the
tapered end free.
