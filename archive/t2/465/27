I've been in the Brazilian type 2s and I'm fluent in the language.  I 
mention this for two reasons.  1.  I want to bring home some of those 
retractable seat belts.  and 2.  if any body goes down there it'll help 
to have somebody who could handle the whole portuguese thing.  i.e. bus 
is "kombi" pronounced "cawm - bee" and bug is "fusca" pronounced "foo- 
scaw"

just a thought.
