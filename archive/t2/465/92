Subject: luggage rack

73 Westy
 
How is the luggage rack attached.  It's on the back, not front and had screws straight into the roof that rusted out and ripped out large holes.
It's in paint right now and I just had them weld plates on the back and fill in the holes.
Question is, when I replace it, should I just put screws straight through the metal like before or does anyone know how it's really supposed to be done?
Also, tough time locating the rubber spacers between rack and roof.
Help?
 
PS Is it normal to not paint the pop-top and just have it straight fiberglass or should it be painted?
