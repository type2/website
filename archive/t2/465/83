Probably.

How far down the road?  A drained lifter can take up to 20 minutes to pump
back up.  If "down the road" was the same as "around the block" then try
letting the bus idle for 20 minutes or so.  Bring a book along and sit in
it and read.

It did when it was new.  Who knows what it has today?  From the complaint
I would say that you still do have them.

Let the bus idle for 20 minutes then replace the lifter if it still has
not pumped up.

You are welcome.

                             OOK!
