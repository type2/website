Subject: Building Engines

Ok all you engine builders out there, now's your time to speak up and give 
your $0.02.

I may sound like I'm on crack here, but I'm beginning to start "purchasing 
parts for my first engine", so I thought I'd ping the list to get some 
opinions.

I would like to build a 1600 SP (I prefer the SP heads) with a new case 
and stock, center mounted carb and vacuum advance distributor.  I'll be 
tapping the case for full flow, mounting a dog-house oil cooler 
(modified to use the type-IV style cooler), and adding cool-tin to my 
heads.  I know that the dog-house thermostat might be a little tricky 
with the SP heads, but I'm not too worried about it.  Also, I'll be 
getting a counterweighted crank from Berg and more than likely, having 
everything balanced as well.

My primary question is that I've read a lot about 88mm P&C's -- that they 
have thicker cylinder walls which help in cooling -- and that they give 
you a little more OOMPF.  Is it reasonable to run 88mm P&C's with a single 
center-mounted carb -- either a 34-Pict-3 or a 30-Pict-X -- or is that a 
silly prospect because the fuel throughput won't be able to keep up 
with the additional displacement?

The tendancy is to leave well enough alone and just go stock -- the 
thought being that going SP instead of DP will already help with my head 
temps and that I should be "just fine" withough making additional mods 
which bring me farther from stock.

Also, are there recommended manufacturers for SP heads?  I know the price 
has gone through the roof, so I'm wondering if it's more worthwhile to go 
with someone like Berg or just go standard new heads from busdepot.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this....
