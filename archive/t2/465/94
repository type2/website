Christopher,

> How is the luggage rack attached.   Question is, when I replace it,
should I just put screws straight through the metal like before or
does anyone know how it's really supposed to be done?<
    That's how it was really done.  Long screws through the flange on
the luggage rack, that pass through rubber spacers, and screw into
holes in the metal roof.

> Also, tough time locating the rubber spacers between rack and roof.<
    Yep, those spacers don't seem to be available new anywhere, at any
price.  You'll have to get creative.  Check the type2 archives to see
what other people have done.

> PS Is it normal to not paint the pop-top and just have it straight
fiberglass or should it be painted?<
    Paint the pop-top.  First make any repairs that are needed.
