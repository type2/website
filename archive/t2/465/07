General lack of soundproofing, suspension that is only rubber isolated at 
the pivot points but the torsion bars solid mount to the frame - noise! 
(how about a crossmember mounted in rubber like my HONDA here for the front 
and rear suspension?), heater with single (slow) speed fan assist, 4 
cylinder engine in vehicle priced like a Volvo (why not a 6?), no 5 speeds 
for more choice in the mountains, no ventilated front discs, only 1 
interior dome light, cables for heater and such that are tough (maybe I 
need to oil mine?).....

I probably need to drive a new one (anybody got a time machine I could 
borrow - I'll bring back parts for you...) and then I'd realize how 
different a 200K mile, 25 year old vehicle is from it's younger self...

Reading an interesting book right now: "Battle for the Beetle". Bentley 
publishes it. The library where I work has it. Explains why VW's are what 
they are. I highly recommend this book for your reading list.
