Subject: My house looks like a used car lot

Funny thing happened this afternoon.

A young chap rang the door bell and asked if my '82 Westy was for
sale.

I guess the Westy looked kinda forlorn sitting out there in the street
all unwashed and all. I'm going to pull a running engine from another
Vanagon next week and put it in the Westy while I rebuild the
AVP-rebuilt engine that's in there now.

Of course, I've a bunch of unwashed old cars in front of the house
(including a '71 SB and a '69 F100 that I just got running), so maybe
they thought that they'd be doing me a favor by taking one of them off
my hands.
