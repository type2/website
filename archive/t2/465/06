my (least) favorite cost-cutting measure is the redesign of the bumpers in
73. the 68-72 bumpers are much more attractive IMO and suit the lines of the
bus much better. they could have been made crash-worthy, but i am sure it
was much cheaper to redesign them.

i'm not sure if the non-removeable apron was a cost-cutting measure. it is a
structural modification that was made since the type IV motor is supported
in a completely different fashion than the upright. i suppose this is
similar to the bumper issue i mention above, in that it COULD have been kept
with some associated extra cost.
