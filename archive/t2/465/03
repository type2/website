Subject: A/C Unit For Sale

OK, so I went to remove the heater button and realized I have this A/C unit
for my 79 Westy that again, I will not be using. I understand that some
people like these units so they can rig the blower for heat?

Anyway, I've seen two types of units on buses, one is the type that mounts
overhead (my dad has this in his 77 Bus), and then this type, which is the
one that mounts under the dash and runs the entire length. I took the unit
off yesterday and she's in good shape. It's a VW "Cool" unit, made in USA
for VW. I can check the blower, just haven't gotten around to that yet. I
have no clue what to ask for this, but I'll entertain offers. I have the old
compressor but I think it's shot, but I could include that, as well as the
condenser that mounts underneath the floor. So if someone wants an entire
system, or just the blower unit for the front, email me and we'll talk.

All the brackets will be included... in the pic I already loosened one
that's why it's a little off on the passenger side.
