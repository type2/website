Subject: Heads and Top End Assembly Question

I got my 2 heads back from RIMCO for my 74 914 a couple days ago and they
look awesome!  Cost $500+ to have them refurbed (no cracks, but 8 new seats,
most intake and exhaust studs, and complete dissasemble, inspect, and
re-assemble.  With luck these heads will give me another 100K miles.  They
had them for about 4 weeks and the price wasn't exactly discount, but I was
very happy with the level of expertise these guys had and with the finished
product.

Now to my question.  It's been so long since I've built a motor that I don't
remember what (if any) sealing compound to use at the base of the cylinders
where they slip into the case and also where the heads sit on the top of the
cylinder (with the metal gasket of course).  Any suggestions greatly
appreciated!

Thanks.
