Hiya,

   I don't think being on the stands would make the lifters bleed down, but 
if your sure it's lifter knock you could pull 'em & check.
They could block at any time I guess. Maybe could be that's just when it 
happened.

It just so happens I was just now checking mine. Had a pretty good knock on 
acceleration. Turns out both #3 & the #4 intake were hard as a rock. Took 'em 
apart, cleaned, and...good as new. Except #3 exhaust which had an over spec. 
spring in it.
Guess that explains why half of the cam thrust bearing was wasted.

Don't forget to change your oil frequently when you have hydraulics. Which 
you have.
