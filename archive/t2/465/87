"....Folks, my nomination is for the funky air pressure squirter
system.  VW continued this long after they should have switched to
the more "modern" electrical pump system."

I hated that one so badly that I converted mine to an electric pump,
including modifying the original wiper/washer switch (the dashboard mounted
style - 71 westy) to replace the washer control valve with a switch contact
to operate the pump.  Works like a champ and looks original.
