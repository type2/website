Sounds like a very small vacuum leak, block the
booster line at the booster and check the line for
holding vacuum, then check the booster for holding a
vacuum, this is to find out what area the leak is in,
vacuum line or booster. Let us know which area it is
in. I got a booster from H&R also, and mine is working
fine. From your indications it might be the
booster,make sure it is not leaking at the master cyl
"O" ring, if the booster is bad, I'm sure H&R will
make it good. Phil
