Subject: Fwd: [T2] Changing from Drums to Disc Brakes

Hi Dean,

It'$ po$$ible to change the rear brake$ to di$k$, but it will co$t you 
a lot $ince you will have to engineer the $y$tem from $cratch u$ing 
part$ from $ome other vehicle.

Replacing the rear wheel cylinders is an afternoon's work--  not more 
than that unless you run into hidden problems while you're at it. Take 
them apart  one wheel at a time so you can have something to compare to 
if you have trouble remembering what went where.

When the rear brakes are adjusted properly they  are completely 
adequate to stop a fully loaded bus. Since the front disks provide 70% 
of the stopping power, I'd recommend you spend your money on better 
tires and/or rims instead, you'll get better bang for your buck.

Happy trails,
