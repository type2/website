Subject: SFBA bus storage?

Hi all,

    We're moving to New Zealand, and we're planning on taking our '78
Westy with us. However, we won't be able to bring it in immediately, so
we're going to need to park it somewhere for a bit. It could be anywhere
from 2-9 months, depending on how things go once we arrive in NZ. So, do
any listees have a wee bit of space on their property where we could
leave our baby for the time being? And perhaps be willing to get her down
to the docks in Oakland when the time comes? She's on a DMV non-op
certificate at the moment so street parking won't cut it. I don't really
want to bother with going through all the smog hassles just to park it on
the street...

    If nobody can give her a temporary home, but would still be willing
to help out with transport to Oakland, let me know. I may end up leaving
her at one of these RV storage places, and I'll still need to get her to
the docks when the time comes. Anyway, thanks to any and all for any help
you can give. Don't wait too long to reply, we'll need to move her by
Tuesday (we close escrow on the house at 2pm Tuesday).

Regards,
