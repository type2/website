Jason,
The friuts of your labors are evident--nice job !!

Now --do you want that clean top to stay that way?

Here's another super easy way to do that---

Find any marine ships store---
Boat US, or West Marine on the internet for instance--and get yourself a
guart of Penetrol--

Take an old t-shirt or any other type of rag--and wipe a coat on the top
and luggage rack---
It'll take you all of 15 minutes--and the top will stay the way it looks
right now for at least a year--
It's a done deal--

The Penetrol will put back the oils in the fiberglass that the sun has
sucked out of it over the years--and it will be no more than a once a
year job---simple and rewarding--

Later,

            ______________
