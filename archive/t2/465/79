That is always a good idea.  The most important terminals on the hazard
flasher switch to check are 30, 31, and 15.  Check terminals 30 and 15
with a voltmeter between the terminal and the body of the bus.  Terminal
30 should have 12V whether the key is on or off.  Terminal 15 should have
12V when the key is on only. Terminal 31 should be checked with an
ohmmeter or continuity checker. It should have no reistance or perfect
continuity to the body of the bus.

I will bet that you have no power on terminal 30 and that your interior
lights are not working.  If this is so then look in your fuse box as one
of your fuses has blown.  If replacing the fuse fixes the problem then you
are done.  Uusually there is a problem with the wiring for the interior
lights and a new wire needs to be pulled.  This is a ticklish operation
and many people choose to put it off and simpy disconnect the light
circuit from the fuse block.

They do use the same relay but they use different power sources.

I have seen this before.  No emergency flashers and no interior lights is
a classic symptom to me.  I replace the fuse and look for trouble in the
interior lights.

                             OOK!
