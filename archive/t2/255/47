Subject: Auxiliary battery questions


I'm going to put some auxiliary batteries in my '74 westy for running
things while camping. I'll be getting a battery isolater in a few days
and have a couple questions about how to hook everything up.

First, I want to set it up so that when the engine is not running
everything but the coil has power. Is this something that folks have
done? Does the standard wiring of a battery isolater accomplish this?
If not, I might put a switch up front that will kill power to the coil
when the ignition switch is on. This switch, if hidden cleverly, could
also function as an anti-theft device.

Secondly, I have a fairly large gel-cell battery that I want to mount under
the bench in the rear, and want to get a deep-cycle marine battery to put
on the left side of the engine compartment. Is there a problem mismatching
batteries like this, i.e. one running down before the other and damaging
one or both of them? The local battery shop guys say I need to buy
two identical batteries, but I don't necessarily believe them because I know
they would rather sell me two batteries than one. These are the same guys
who told me not to buy a bigger battery than was stock on my bus because
it would not work, giving me even more reason not to believe them.
