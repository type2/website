Can one cylinder be made in-operative?

Yes it can.

So, I thought I'd ask the list for positive comments about disabling one
cylinder

As many know on this list, I drove my engine with #3 pushing and amazing
10psi.  When I finally got a used head, I drove it from NC to Nashville,
TN.  Thinking in the same respect that you are, I pulled the injector
sender to the injector on #3 since it was not helping any.  I believe
this was a bad mistake.  Correct me if I am wrong, but the fuel injector
is cooled slightly by the fuel passing around it.  When I got to my
destination to drop my engine (FasterLaster's), the injector and seals
were actually melted and severely deformed.  I had to replace them.  I
am not sure which is better as far as running a cylinder like you have
it, or with the injector sender and all that pulled from it, but that's
what happened to mine after driving with it disconnected from the
injector.

Correct, you must watch the valves very closely. Mine became loose just
before I got to Jason's and it nearly broke the cap (technical term) on
the end of the valve spring. 

My experience in this situation.  Good luck.
