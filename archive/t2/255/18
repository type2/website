Subject: RE: [VB] sundial musings

Hi Chuck,
I always thought that the Sundial factory was in Riverside, CA.  Also, I've
seen a 1964 Sundial from the factory, and I think there were even earlier
ones made than that.  There are people on this list WAYYYYY more
knowledgeable about this stuff, but I'm sure that Sundials were mfg in
California.
