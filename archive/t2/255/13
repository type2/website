I prefer to clean old tanks with hydrogen pyroxide. It has the same bacteria 
properties as bleach, although it may not look so pretty (it doesnt "bleach 
white" as well. However, h-peroxide does a great job of removing oders and 
bad tastes from plastics, or in this case nylon. Just my thoughts.

My friend jeff prefers everclear, followed with jack daniels, followed with 
water. Thats his way, and I respect that. SMILE.
