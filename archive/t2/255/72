Subject: Re: [T2] bucket seats

I wouldn't worry too much about keeping the stock mounting positions in 
place.  I very much doubt that you will go back!  I have seats from a Honda 
in my bus installed by the PO.  I don't like the way they were installed 
(thin bolts no washers, etc) but I will probably re-install them to my 
liking and keep them before it's on the road.  I have had a couple of bugs 
with junkyard seats as well, and I can't understand why anybody that isn't 
into restorations would bother with the stock seats.  There have been many 
advances in seat design over the years, why not take advantage.  If you have 
a charging system in good shape, I'd look for something with heat, air 
adjustable support, and maybe even electric adjustment (but really that's 
just lazy, isn't it?).  Good luck, and I hope it all works out for you!
