i am about to make a tire cover for my front-mounted spare and i was =
thinking of embroidering/stitching on an emblem, so maybe i will just =
put
it on the tire upside down.
chris, sad that it has come to this
70 westy

Well then, it is sort of appropriate, isn't it? Sort of like flying the =
flag upside down. I think we all ought to start doing it. Here we are =
out here, keeping the VW namesakes alive and well, popularizing them by =
keeping them in public view and celebrating them as classics and =
durable, practical daily drivers. These are the very cars that put VW on =
the map, and they don't even carry the products we need any more to keep =
these cars running.. But they're going to tell us that we can't use the =
name of the car when we make products to celebrate and keep these cars =
alive. Maybe we can come up with a new name, sort of like that =
entertainer..."Prince". What's his name? "The Entertainer, Formerly =
Known As Prince".. OK. We can refer to our cars as "The Automobile =
Formerly Known As Volkswagen". Or how 'bout let's take those letters and =
switch them around.. WV. Let's work on this a bit. Any ideas?
