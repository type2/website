Subject: Re: [T2] sundial musings

I just saw a yellow sundial today. I recognize them now by their add-on
windows, primarily. I couldn't see the front of this one, so I don't know if
it it was pre-73, but I think it was. I actually owned an old beat up
Sundial, and didn't realize what it was for many years, in fact.. until I
scrapped it. It had gotten hit by another car while parked, and was pretty
much beyond saving. But it had those windows (there were actually a few
different types), and a certain type of interior paneling that I recognized
later when I viewed the interior of a '69 high top...(which I almost bought,
but had funny papers).. That one actually had the Sundial tags on it. Mine
was a '69, but not a high top. So, no, I don't think that the Sundials
started up in the 70's, early or not. I think that they were already
well-established by the late 60's, but my guess would be that they started
up somewhere in the mid- to late- 60's. Jan B
