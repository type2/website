Forgot to add that I pulled the spark plug wire for that cylinder as

As many know on this list, I drove my engine with #3 pushing and amazing
10psi.  When I finally got a used head, I drove it from NC to Nashville,
TN.  Thinking in the same respect that you are, I pulled the injector
sender to the injector on #3 since it was not helping any.
