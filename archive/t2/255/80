The starter gear is sticking in the flywheel teeth.  You shouldn't have to 
wait, just
bouncing the bus backwards against third gear will allow the teeth to unbind.
You may need to clean the gear teeth (engine out), replace the (spring in 
the) starter,
or tighten the nuts that hold the starter to the tranny.

The two that hold the starter to the bell housing of the tranny.  Actually, 
the bottom one is a stud mounted
to the tranny, and the upper one is the "D" headed bolt that is the upper 
right engine to tranny bolt.

You need to read the instructions in Muir, then read and look at the 
pictures in The Bentley Manual.
This is what Muir himself says in the "Idiot Book."  The Muir IS NOT a 
replacement for the Bentley, nor
was it ever intended to be.  It is folksy explanations for the newbie 
driver/mechanic.
