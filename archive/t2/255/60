Subject: removing engine for first time...please help

I'm following the Bentley procedure to remove the engine out of my 71 Westy 
to replace the heads with rebuilt ones. I've done the procedure except for 
the removing the bolts and dropping the engine.

I don't understand when the Bentley says the upper bolt on the right, what 
is it talking about.

All I see is the thingy (don't know the name) that supports the heat 
exchangers, is that all thats supporting the engine??

I do know to support the tranny before the removal.

I disconnected the accelerator cable with by loosening the 8mm nut but it 
seems that it will catch on the fanshroud?

Also like i pulled the fuel line but it doesn't really bend out of the way 
with the engine in, is that something you bend out of the way after you roll 
the engine back a tad.

Thanks in advance and I would appreciate any and all tips for this. I have 
been dilligent in labeling all hardware and wiring.
