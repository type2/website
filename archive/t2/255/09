I once had to disable one cyl when I blew a spark plug, I removed the
plug, pulled the FI wire and the entire wire from dizzy to plug.

BUT!

I only had to nurse it about 2 miles to get it home and I put on a new
head when I got there.

how much of a rebuild are you going to do???  a whole engine rebuild,
don't mind if you do other damage, possibly pounding the bearings etc.  I
never drove over maybe 1200rpm  are you willing to drive a few thousand
miles at 15mph??

If you plan on reusing that engine without a total stripdown  rebuild I
would encourage you to get a trailer and tow it home.

YMMV
