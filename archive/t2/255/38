Subject: Re: [T2] bucket seats

I'd worry about trusting a few screws in a rearward or side impact
accident- seem to rememember bugs had such a  problem, with the driver
being catapulted into the rear when the track failed!

Maybe I should clarify- I never said anything about screws! The old =
Westy seat base is securely BOLTED to the frame of the Fiero seat-enough =
so that if an impact were to tear it off, well I won't be around much =
longer to worry about it anyway. The metal frame between the seat and =
cabinets will keep the seat from being thrown backwards-after all, Mike, =
you know me-I'm 6'4" and drive with the seat back as far as it will go!=20
