I have always felt that this is such a huge project that most folks (not
all) get bored with it long before it is finished, and then there sits a
half finished bus that rusts away or hauled away


personally I fix mine in modules so I can drive it between segments of
work, like last fall I did the whole front end, beam, shocks, steering,
brakes etc.  spring I did body work.  I usually try to take two weeks one
in the spring and one in the fall to do major repairs to bus.  thus for
one week or so I do bus full time.  then get back to enjoying it (most) of
the other 50 weeks

thus you will probably have most of the tools and basic knowledge this
will help a lot.
