Subject: RE: [T2] accufire vs. compufire

Accufire are junk made in Taiwan with a 90% failure rate. These were taken
off the market a couple years ago and I couldn't say if they have ever fixed
the problem. Pay the extra money and get the proven product, I have 5 vw's I
drive with them, with out a problem in 5 years.

My local vw flaps has both compufire and accufire
electronic ignition. He's says they are both the same.
What's the dif (besides $20)?
