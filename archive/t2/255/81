possibly the bolt above the starter? behind the fan shroud in the engine
bay, and above the starter 'round front you've got nuts and bolt.

could...mine has a flexi fuel line front of the wall (wall beyond the fan
shroud) and it makes for enough movement so i don't have this issue. one
thing, you could disconnect the fuel line from the "front"  !find the
flexi!  and drag the metal line with engine extraction.
