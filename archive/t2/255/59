Subject: help! shifter problem, what???

Hello fellow listmembers....

ok, heres whats happening with my bus...

I can't downshift anymore. I can upshift normally, but it will NOT allow me 
to downshift until I am at a very low speed for the gear I am trying to 
downshift into. I just try and try to push it into the gear and when I am 
finally going slow enough, it sorta clunks and allows it to go into gear.

I was going to replace the shifter bushings, but I think the parts I bought 
arent the right thing. I didn't know what to expect them to look like, but I 
don't think these are the shifter bushings. The "bushings" I have are part 
of this metal bracket that connects to the transmission way towards the rear 
of the bus, not right underneath the shifter. In fact, I didn't see any 
bushings right under the shifter anyplace, maybe these are the only ones in 
that system?

So, is it the Pilot bearing - not disengaging the clutch correctly? A few 
times these last two days the bus surged forward even with the clutch pushed 
all the way in.

And if it is the Pilot bearing, does that mean the ol motor has to come out? 
If so, I guess I am no longer tackling this project on my own. So either a 
bay area mechanic, or possibly any nice bus owners out there that would be 
willing to help out with the project at their place??
