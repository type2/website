Subject: installing a gas grill to my westy

In this beautiful land of Colorado there has been a
ban on charcoal and open fires all summer.  I was
thinking of buying a gas hibachi (they run about $20)
and figuring out a connection to the propane tank, so
i can hook it up off the driver side and have myself
some BBQ.  Has anyone attempted this?  Any tips are
appreciated, otherwise I will let y'all know how it
goes and what all the attachments needed are.  Should
be a fun project

Keep it positive
