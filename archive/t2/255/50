We stripped the exterior of handles and chrome, removed windows (all), 
removed poptop, removed all the rubber, prepped, painted, reassemble using 
new rubber everywhere. The put new paint on the exterior but not inside as 
that was okay.

Now the exterior is 99% done and I'm finishing the dash (new colors). I'm 
working in the cab so I can get it driveable sans interior except cab.

I've always looked at it like a reverse of the factory assembly - - - take 
off what they put on last. Remove items as assemblies as R&R those 
assemblies right before you need to reinstall them.

>restoration?

There are some great e-mail lists just on bodywork and restoration. The 
order is revrse of the factory assembly. R&R top while the paint for the 
body is being done b/c you pretty much have to remove the top to paint the 
roof well.

R&R rubber while you repaint the doors b/c you need to remove it to paint 
eveything. Remove latches and catches at the same time - clean and grease.

We stripped ours down until the exterior could be painted without any 
masking tape. That required removal of everything and the dash too which we 
changed the color on.

Then we cleaned, polished, replaced, and painted as we reassembled the 
components.

Consider buying a good Weber book. That carb is "okay" but not great. It 
replaced a better pair of factory carbs IMHO. It needs tuning and could use 
an air cleaner from the junkyard that provided heated air for the winter. 
$20 fix. Think you either need a Pinto or Asian air cleaner.

Last project. Might even consider storing it until you get to it.

Better price the paint and materials to be sure your budget can handle it.

They can supply the 5x5 foot panel over the front seats. Might as well buy 
enough to do the bus. They will send you a catalog free.

Driver camper. That's what we are doing. Another of my goals was to stop 
any aging related to rust on my bus. I had minor rust under the front and 
rear windows. Paint/Waxoyl/bar oil/EXTEND rust converter.

Just shop wisely and make your money go further.
