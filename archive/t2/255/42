Subject: RE: [T2] bucket seats

Hi Volks- I do not have Corvette seats in my bus, as Gregg said, only
corvette air-operated lumber supports built into the stock framed seats.
A friend of my built seats with side-bolsters on the top and bottom
sections that are really comfortable for long distance driving. (the
lumbar supports are great......) As they are the stock seats, everything
works just fine. TBear
