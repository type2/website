Subject: starter, won't start unless push back in 3rd gear

Have another unrelated question and thanks for all the help with the engine 
removal, hope to have some time today to work on that.

A while back my bus wouldn't start.

Reading in the Muir Idiot book it suggested that I put it in 3rd gear and 
push back on it and that magically started my bus. Then it was fine but now 
everytime I have to do that and wait a couple of minutes to get it to start.

The Muir talks about making sure some bolts on the starter are tight.

Which bolts is he talking about, can someone please describe them to me and 
tell me what size they are.

Thanks again for any suggestions help,

Daniel
