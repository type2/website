Hey guys,

I first thought you were talking about one of the busses on the VW Euro
show.

But now i know you are talking about MY BUS!

By the way you should adjust your computer screens cos my bus is black and
grey.. :-D

Well to talk about the bullbar/rhinorack/hummerdeflector it is custom made
by the PO. Welded out of stainless steel pipes of a milk factory and a truly
great job. Nice welds and very smooth (unless you bang your head against
it).

Makes me proud to hear such good talks about my bus.

Thanks guys,
