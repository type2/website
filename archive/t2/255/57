[...]
My westy is also in colorado.
have converted all of my gas stuff to quick disconnects.   this 
includes my portable fridge,  heater, and my spare 5 pounder i carry 
with me.  using something like a little 5 pounder you could hook up a 
gas hibachi easily.  which is the idea behind my quick disconnects.  i 
can leave everything in the van or move it to a tent on the five 
pounder.
