The same company sells their own coil, but I think that any good coil would
probably be just fine.
Just don't get those two leads reversed.
My pal, "Al", at J-Bugs, recommended putting the Compufire into a Bosch .050
Distributor, and setting it around TDC or slightly before. I'm glad I took
his advice on it.. Really like the results.
