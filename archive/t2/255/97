Subject: seatbelt update

After some good recommendations for other list members I went ahead and bought a retractable seatbelt from GoWesty! It's the same item carried by peparts.com that I first located but less expensive.

The unit is quality made by TRW Repa in Germany/Austria with VW/Audi logos all over it.  I noticed some VW parts numbers that begin with 165. I'm not sure but this means Jetta right? The actual date of the manufacture along where it says it passes FMVSS 209 was covered up with a black marker so I can't tell.

There was almost no kit as the bolts and spacers for the D-ring were already attached and held in place by rubber o-rings.  To get the door to close I had to use the 2nd hole in the mounting plate which didn't have the bolt through it as it came in the package.  The instructions said to drill another hole but you don't have to (they don't provide a nut in the kit like the one attached to the wheel well anyway).

My only complaint is that one of the plastic side pieces seems to be missing.  This could be because there is a left and right retracting unit although it's sold as L/R in the catalog.  I tested the swivel seat to see if it could still rotate and there was no problem.  The receiver is longer than the original which is nice but it doesn't lie flush with the seat like the old one did (not really a problem).

It's a little bit of a weird feeling not being held back by the shoulder strap all the time.
