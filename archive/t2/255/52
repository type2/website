HI Folks,
	For those with bodywork ambitions I reccommend this site.

http://www.tinmantech.com/

Excellent tools, tips, and schools.  Having observed the sheetmetal folks
at the airline where I apprenticed (in avionics, not sheetmetal alas) I
can assure you it is time and TECHNIQUE with a few simple (inexpensive)
tools that gets the job done.  Minimal filler.  Our aircraft were polished
aluminum from the waistline down so every imperfection showed.

I recommend this link from that site for a breathtaking "what you too can
do in your double garage" http://members.aol.com/COUPECHUCK/index.htm
