Hey there Volks,

I just got emailed an "ok" from the author (Ron Maxon) of the article
on "Jalousies in a Vanagon" so anyone wanting to take look at the
article should go here:

http://www.everybus.com/dworkin/vgon_jalousie/

Mr. Maxon also said in the email "Glad to see people interested in
the window conversion, hopefully next time we buy a vanagon they will
already be installed"

Steve, thanks for hosting the scans.

Enjoy,
