There was a factory block off plate for vehicles that didn't even get the AM
radio. You would need to standoff the mounting behind the dash so the radio
could be inset deeper so the plate can be flush with the dash. If you have a
newer untit, there's not much spare behind there to begin with but I think
it can be done.
