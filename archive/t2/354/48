Greg,

Not wrong.  Both extreme's will cause hotter running than normal if not
calculated into the overal engine basics.

IIRC, VW started using retard sections on their distributors to get 
the engine to pass emissions...wanted it to run hotter at idle IIRC
so that emissions would be down.

The only departure from that rule is a'la Berg when using very low 
Compression Ratio's...advand 2-6 degrees more.


Cheers, dave
