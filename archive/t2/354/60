>Phil,

Call Gord Potts, he has not left yet.

I just talked to Greg Potts.  The bus is running well but his speedo 
stopped working. They are 30 miles outside Morgantown, WV.  They are going 
to camp at a state park and drive over to Harpers Ferry tomorrow on 
68.  They are going to meet up with my wife and head down to The Plains, VA 
to my lacrosse game.  We will be leaving around 6:30 is to head down 29 to 
Greensboro.
