Use the german method to inspect your oil, by
comparing a drop from the dipstick to a drop from a fresh bottle. 

SIGHT:

does it look dirty/crappy/significantly darker than when new?

SMELL:

does it smell like gasoline?

TOUCH:
when you rub a drop between your fingers, does it:
	- feel gritty?
	- feel like the "new" oil?

SOUND:
when a drop of oil falls, and no one is there, does it make a sound?

TASTE:
not it!
