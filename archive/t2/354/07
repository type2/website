Subject: Westfalia Tow Hitch ball covers

I just bought about 50 of these from Germany.

They are black plastic cups with white Westy logos on the sides and a molded
westy logo in the bottom of the cup. They press fit over the ball of the tow
hitch when not in use.

I'm thinking of bringing the whole box to the next BNNTA and selling them
for a couple of bucks each . If there are any listmembers who don't plan  to
attend the next BNNTA and who absolutely MUST have one, send me pmail and
I'll see what I can do.... just be sure you are willing to pay the cost of
mailing.
