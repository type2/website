Hello list, I always take this week off work for E-bus. I just bought a bus last Sunday. I have done a complete brake job. Cleaned up lots of extra wiring. Got every thing working.lights,horn,wipers,bought 4 new tires,etc. I am going to tag it tomorrow morning and try to head out sometime in the afternoon. Everyone wish me luck. It`s kinda scary taking off in a bus that you have only driven 20 miles. Oh well whats 800 miles round trip right. See Ya at Everybus.
