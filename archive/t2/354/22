Subject: Idle Issues

Hi,

I'm new to the list and have a quick question:

Our '80 Camper is exhibiting some strange idle behavior. When warm it idles
fine, but when cold won't idle properly, usually stalls out. The problem is
intermittent, though, for example yesterday morning on first start it idled
fine, keeping the revs up to warm up. Then after a 50 mile drive and sitting
for 4 hours, it wouldn't idle for the first few miles. Same thing after
another stop. This morning died on the first start but then after circling
the cul-de-sac, idled.

Aux Air Regulator? Idle Setting? Anyone have an idea?

Btw, the engine is new, as are most accessories (plugs, wires, filters,
coil, cap, rotor, points).

Thanks..
