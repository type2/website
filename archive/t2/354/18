Subject: Poorly running bus - gettin ready for EB

List,

I need help ...

Here are the symptons:
74 bus with dual carb (Solex) 2L engine, built by Kummetat with high
compression pistons (not sure if they are flat top or dome top - it's
the kind that usually lives in a Porsche 914).

On Christmas Eve my bus started running poorly - missing on at least on
cylinder, especially at idle - basically no idle, engine would die
without keeping revs up. Around 3000 - 4000 RPM the problem seems to
disappear (or is no longer noticable). Bus has been parked since, but I
now want to get it ready for EB.

Ignition is fine - I replaced wires, plugs, rotor, and cap because it
was about time anyway. I did not replace condenser and points. Timing
seems to be fine - I cannot verify it, but it starts right up and timing
and dwell were adjusted with Steve Dolan's help a few thousand miles
ago.

Compression test results:
185
160
155
180 (as I said it has around 8.0 comp ratio)

All plugs fire (tested with timing strobe).

Can this be a carb issue? What do I check first?

Should I be concerned about vacuum? It should idle with vacuum
diconnected, right? It's vacuum advance dizzy - the same as on a dual
carb 1800.

Can this be attributed to a bad condenser? A friend hinted at this, but
it does not seem to make sense to me.

Thanks,
Marcus
