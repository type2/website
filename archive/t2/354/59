I'll stop by some of the local RV places here and see if I can learn
something about it.  Though with the Masters Tournament coming up at the
Augusta National, I'll probably put it off until traffic up that way thins
out after the "foreigners" go home.

Oh joy, and this year we get to dodge protesters.  Let's see, we have those
protesting the men-only policy of a private club for, you guessed it, men
(sort of like getting sued because you won't let someone with a Humvee join
a VW Bus-only club)...

[deleted non-VW and extremely controversial comments related to protesting.
