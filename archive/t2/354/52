Phil,

I am glad you are going to make the trip to EB!!!!!!! I apologize for 
getting a late start and doing a lome-o job on the carabus list this 
year. I did not realize how much people used it until it was too late.

However, print out an AIRS list just in case. If you arrice at EB 
after the dark, the gates will be closed but not locked. Let yourself 
in and close the gate behind you.

See ya soon!
