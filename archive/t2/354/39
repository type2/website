Subject: Trying to understand about that part...

To save Karl some heartburn, I'll fill in:

Here's the exact path your fuel travels if you're set up stock:

I'll note connections to vacuum/elec as (###) as well:

1 tank

2 filter

3 Pump (elec.)

4 #3 injector (elec.)

5 #4 injector (elec.)

6 cold start valve (elec.)

7 #2 injector (elec.)

8 #1 injector (elec.)

9 fuel pressure regulator (vacuum)

10 back to tank

That's all there is and there ain't no more. Your pressure regulator

gets vacuum from the engine to do it's job. If your mechanic tested it per the
Bentley (official) manual, then your problem is somewher else. What are the
symptoms again?

Hi Billy,

As far as I know, the fumes coming from my tailpipe are darker (not belching
black, but dark), and that it is possible I'm consuming more gas than normal,
which he tells me is because the fuel regulator isn't working because this
other part isn't working.

The other part might be described as a positive vacuum valve, although I don't
know. It is disc shaped with one male connection on one side and two on the
other. Two tubes attach to one side and another on the other side which leads
into the fuel regulator. It's a Bosch. I called the Bus Depot to get the part
(with the part number) and they said it is obsolete and not produced anymore.

Maybe I don't even need it. I was just trying to get my fuel consumption down
it it was possible. The mechanic sucked on the tube that he detached from the
mystery part and then poked his tongue in it. There was suction in the tube
(leading to the fuel regulator) because the tip of his tongue was being sucked
in. He said if there was no suction then the fuel regulator would not be
working.

My engine is a pancake, fuel injection, 2000 c.c., built in Canada. The
mechanics here in Mexico have never seen this type before. All the buses down
here, new and old, have 1600 c.c. engines.

Anyway, I appreciate anything you can tell me.

Dan
