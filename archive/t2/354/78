Subject: Detuned exhaust?

This may sound silly -- it does to me -- but yesterday I sanded the rust off
my stock tailpipe and spray-painted it with a high temperature aluminium
paint.

Today it sounds different, louder and lower pitched.

Is this my imagine or could painting have "detuned" the exhaust pipe?
