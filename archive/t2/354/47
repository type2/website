Subject: Tarp for sale at EB

I bought a 20x30" blue tarp a few weeks ago to cover some holes in my 
roof that were from the recent ice storm. I had a Homer Simpson 
moment on the roof in a wind and lightning storm and decided on a 
smaller tarp instead.
Anyway, I have no use for this and it has not even been used though 
it is unpacked. I know some list members are tarp crazy either for 
covering their bus in the driveway of make bus awnings for camping so 
I will offer this new $40 tarp to the first person who agrees to 
trade me a crisp $20 for it.

Let me know and I will bring it to EB.
Thanks
Chris
