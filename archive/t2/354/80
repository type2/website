Guys,

I have an 81 vanagon sitting in my drievway that *has* a front
tow bar...since it is a parts car, I haven't looked at how it is attached 
yet(welded or bolted).  We pulled it home with the hitch setup and it 
worked great.

I can take some pics and if it would fit a bay, it should be obvious.

It would be for sale!...weighs a ton though.

Cheers, dave
