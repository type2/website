Chris,
The lights that came with it had 2 bulbs and a red/amber lens but don't know
if original. The wiring harness is brand new from Wiring works out of Cali.
Pretty good quality overall...

No fog lights, just regular backup lights were included (SC was a basket
case when I got her)

As for the mcodes, I will have to check when I get home.

Peace Brother,
Snoopy
