Good Lord, just what happened?!  It sounds like VWoA hired "thugs" and
knocked down people's doors!

BTW, I'm making sure that I don't misuse their copyrighted material, which
is what I usually do with any repro's that I decide to take on as a CF&Son
project.

guards for the propane tank.

Looking at my own bus it looks as if one set of flaps can be made that will
fit both front and back; IF the flaps are made so that the excess flap that
would get in the way installing them in the back could be easily identified
and removed by the DIY'er.  Maybe a cut line included as part of the design.
I'll try to locate a flap or two down here and see if it's a workable
project.

In your valued (blatant buttering up [grin]) opinion, do you think that
making the front and back flaps the same width (as your front flaps are)
will work for the back flaps?
