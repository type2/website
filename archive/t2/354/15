Snoopy,

Is the single cab a Euro market delivery vehicle? You can check the 
M-code Plate and translate it from a link in the type2 library.  EMDV 
had two bulds in the tail housing and a red/amber lens. Typically, 
where the left back up light is there will be a red lens. This is 
actually a rear fog light. The right side will have clear for the 
back up light which either market is run off a switch from the 
tranny. You will find a  black wire with an inline fuse holder to 
power those. BTW, Many EMDV did not have rear back up lights.

If indeed you do have a EMDV then there may be differences in the 
turn signal arm, the e-flasher and the fuse box. Thom has euro spec 
wiring diagrams posted at www.vintagebus.com.

Good luck
