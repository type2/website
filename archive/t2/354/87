Subject: Re: [T2] Broken into again. (fed up)

I wonder if I could get a fake stuffed pit bull for the back seat, and an 
alarm that I could program to bark and growl instead of siren.  It probably 
wouldn't really deter a thief, as it would be fairly obvious the dog wasn't 
moving.  It would be funny to imagine the look on the the thiefs face when 
the first bark happened though!
