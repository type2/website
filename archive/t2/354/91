Subject: RE: [T2] Broken into again. (fed up)

I've been broken into a few times over the years, right in my very save
middle class neighborhood.  In all cases the thief was after small
change that was in the various little spots on my dash.  I have one of
those Vanagon dash accessories and one year I found it down the street
under a street light with everything spread out on the ground.  I rarely
bother to lock my van except maybe in downtown Baltimore, D.C. or New
York.  I never leave change in sight anymore.
