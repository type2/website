> My fuel pressure regulator has a vacuum tube size nipple which has never
been connected to anything.  I was under the impression that the connection
is there to vent fuel in the event of a mechanical failure in the regulator.
Does it really control the regulator's function??

 I was going to hook it up to a vacuum line in any case...

Yes, it controls fuel pressure.
The presure controls mixture.
High pressure = rich mixture.
The ECU controls the duration of the injectors by time. It has no idea how much fuel volume is going thru the
injector. [unless you had a 79 Cal version with an O2 sensor]
With manifold vacuum on the regulator, you should be running 28-30 psi.
Without vacuum, the pressure goes up to around 35 psi.
Manifold vacuum is present at idle, goes away when you open the throttle.
The pressure regulator works just like an accelerator pump on a carburetor.
When the vacuum drops, the system runs rich.
Tee into the line that is connected to the nipple on the right side of the plenum between #1 and #2 intake
runners. It should also go to the decel valve.
