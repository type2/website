We just received a FAX from the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality
regarding House Bill 2501 (this is the one that was signed into law in 2002,
but needs to be approved by the EPA).

There is a stakeholder meeting to discuss the protocol under development by
ADEQ on methods to determine the impact of exempting motorcycles and
collectible vehicles 1967-1986 from vehicle emissions tests.
It is scheduled on Wednesday April 16, 2003 at 1:30 pm in Room 250, AZ Dept
of Environmental Quality,
1110 West Washington Street, Phoenix.

Visitor parking is available in the parking garage, east of the ADEQ
building. Enter from Washington just west of 10th Ave.

If you have any questions or need further information, you can contact
Nancy Wrona  602-771-2308   or
Theresa Pella  602-771-2375

Hope to see at least a few of you there.
Melissa and Jerry Jess
