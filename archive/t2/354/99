Timer on the electric fuel pump. Let them get about 10 seconds down the 
road and have it stall. The thief will bail so he's not caught with a 
broken down vehicle. Disarms with either a remote (generic remote entry 
kit) or hidden key switch mounted in steel.

Maybe also causes flashing lights or beeping horn or discharge of MACE into 
interior. <grin>
