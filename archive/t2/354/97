Subject: Oil pressure relocation - VDO kit

I am looking for the VDO kit 150752 to finally install the oil pressure
sender that has lived in my glove box for about 7 years now. It consists
of a hose with fittings and a clamp.

Bus Boys and Busdeopt do not show it in stock. Does anyone have one
they could part with or know of a supplier?

Marcus
