Subject: That part I need...Please try again Karl

To save Karl some heartburn, I'll fill in:
Here's the exact path your fuel travels if you're set up stock:
I'll note connections to vacuum/elec as (xxx) as well:

1 tank
2 filter
3 Pump (elec.)
4 #3 injector (elec.)
5 #4 injector (elec.)
6 cold start valve (elec.)
7 #2 injector (elec.)
8 #1 injector (elec.)
9 fuel pressure regulator (vacuum)
10 back to tank

That's all there is and there ain't no more. Your pressure regulator
gets vacuum from the engine to do it's job. If your mechanic tested it per the Bentley (official) manual, then your problem is somewher else. What are the symptoms again?
