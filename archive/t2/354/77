OK, now HERE'S a neat thing for Mr. Casting Fool to make, and sell for 
$10-$15...


A radio BLOCK OFF plate!!

Then you could install your radio in your glove compartment..

(Anything more than $10-$15 would make it more practical to get a junk yard 
radio replacement.)

Yes, I can now see the messages...  'man, some dude broke into my VW and the 
only thing they stole was my custom made radio block off plate...'


Oh, BTW, I 'came across' a Vanagon radio block off plate two weeks ago, but 
I don't have one for the bay...  And I would not need one since I have the 
'junk yard radio replacement' already installed.


The radio block off plate would also be a prime candidate for customizing 
with a whole bunch of holes for gauges.   Perhaps even a digital tachometer 
could be fitted there.  And there MUST be some digital gauges for oil 
pressure and oil level (yes, there is a gauge for oil level, digital I don't 
know) and ambient air temperature and kool looks and especially one that 
will measure the weight of the passenger sitting next to you so you can tell 
your SO that they seem to be gaining a few lbs/kilos.

Keep those cards and letter coming in.  The list is going to be a bit quiet 
while the Eastern half of the continent is on the road to EB 2003.
