There is Pertronix version I and version II. I think the later version may 
require a specific coil. I have a bunch of Pertronix specific info at home 
if you want it. Check the archives b/c I think I may have sent the list a 
very specific breakdown of the two.

As of yet I have not tried them personally though I have a kit for my Corvair.
