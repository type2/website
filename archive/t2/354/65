YES!
leave it unlocked. Possibly getting a removeable or detachable stereo would 
help. Take away the reason they want to get in and minimize the damage they 
would have
to inflict if they still feel the need. You cant really stop a thief.
The damage is usually more expensive then whatever was stolen.

Sorry for your rotten luck!
