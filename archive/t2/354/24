Look for their Universal Tow Bar ($101). I bought one way back in '95 and 
it is a great stout bar that is collapsible. It will disassemble and fit 
into it's own bag.

To work on my bus I plan to put together a bracket plate (much like a 
receiver hitch in the way to attaches to the frame) that bolts under the 
nose to the frame and/or the front axle. Then all I will have to do it 
assemble the towbar and install it to the brackets (two bolts for that 
phase). Mounting plate remains on the Bus al the time, towbar goes on and 
off as I need it.

Cheaper than a tow truck.

Be careful what you pull your bus with. I've pulled a bus with a Beetle (on 
a rope) in a pinch but on a tow bar where I would have to stop the bus as 
well with my tow vehicle's brakes, I would be very, very picky about what I 
was towing with. Something big and probably SUV or 3/4 ton pickup related.
