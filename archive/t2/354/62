Scroll down the list until you get to Inlet system (FI). Click on it.
In that pic will be all the pieces Billy listed in his reply. I will put the illustration number after each
one.


1 tank    ~ not in pic

2 filter    ~ not in pic

3 Pump (elec.)    ~ not in pic

4 #3 injector (elec.)    ~ 40

5 #4 injector (elec.)   ~ same as 40 but next to it

6 cold start valve (elec.)   ~ 57

7 #2 injector (elec.)     ~ same as 40, but on other side

8 #1 injector (elec.)    ~ same as 40, but on other side

9 fuel pressure regulator (vacuum)   ~ 3

10 back to tank   ~ hose that atttaches to end of 3 where #35 grommet is

Now look at the pic. #63 is the manifold vacuum line that goes TO the regulator. Hose # 74 is tee'd off of 63
and feeds the decel valve that is ghosted in. If #3 leaks, fuel will be sucked into the plenum thru hose 63.
Thats all that is in the system. Go back and find out exactly what he is talking about. The regulator does NOT
create any suction.
