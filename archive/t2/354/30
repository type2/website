Frank,

30 PSI at 220F is not horrible. You may see it drop a few more pounds 
is you approach 230F. If it drops below 20 at cruising RPMs then get 
worried.

If you were running a steady 40 psi at 220F and suddenly you see a 10 
psi drop then do some checking.  Sounds like your bus is really 
loaded down. Is that the only change sense your last reading?

*Valves adjusted correctly?
*Good points with correct dwell?
*Timing spot on. You may try retarding it bit to get the temp down 
(pressure up)
*Check fan and tin for birds/rats/mice nests. Seriously, a friend 
fried a nice motor because mice built a nest in it in a matter of 
days.
*try straight 40w oil.
*Check around for vacuum leaks which will lean out the mix and get 
the heads really hot.

Good luck!
