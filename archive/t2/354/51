Subject: Everybus for sure.

   Well we were going to go to Everybus this year then we backed out at the
last day before the Canadian's left.
Guess what? We now think we will go! Anyone along this route I'm taking in
case of major breakdown? I'll print AIRS.
Crossing either at Port Huron or Detroit crossing.
I94 to I75 to I289 to I71 to I224 to I77 this will be the long stretch of
highway.
I74 to US52 then through Greensboro to Pleasant Garden NC
Any concerns taking this route?

Think we'll leave early tomorrow and maybe drive straight through.
768 miles door to door.
