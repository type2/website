Subject: Broken into again. (fed up)

Hello everyone,

    Right now i am extreamly frustrated and angree.  I live in a small town 
about an hour north of toronto and we aren't knowen for alot of car theft or 
break and entries(i know it can happen anywhere).  Well this is the SECOND 
time my van has been broken into!  It happened while i was working tonight 
in our local Canadian Tire store.  they tryed for the stero again and failed 
to get it this time but with the amount of damage they caused they might 
have well of taken it.  So now i sit here wondering, What can i do to stop 
them from getting into my van (i don't have enough money for an alarm).  So 
thats my question to  everyone..... What can i do to stop this without 
spening alot of money?

    Just to warn you all i determined that they stuck a screw driver in 
between the side vent window and the rubber.  They flipped over the half 
closed (semie seized) window latch(i don't know what its called right now, 
not thinking right) and stuck there arm through the window and unlocked the 
door..... no slim jims nothing.  So i just wanted to warn the rest of you 
and i hope someone has some tips for me to stop this from happening.  
Thanks.
