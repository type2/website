Subject: 1600 motor turn-key for sale.  Everybus?

Hello,

I have a turn key 1600 motor for sale.  I acquired recently from the local
vw dealer who had it rebuilt a few years ago for a customer that never paid
his bill......they thus are cleaning up the parts house and sold it to me.
I got it running after only a few minutes of checking things.

Bad news It is an AH case, so no bosses or holes for a bus moustache bar.
But, good for a bug.

$700 cash.  in Charleston, SC..........I am going to Charlotte, NC this
coming Saturday, so perhaps could hook up with someone on their way to
everybus........
