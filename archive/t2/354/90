Subject: Anti Theft Deterrent System ATDS

I have:

(1) a very desirable VW (ok, joke suit OFF now!!)

(2) more extra keys in my VW than I can find/count

(3) an extra overhead panel for the driver/passenger compartment

(4) a toggle switch for starting/turning over the VW.  It is reachable from 
the driver seat.  I do not have to use the last twist of the ignition switch 
to get the VW started; I use the ignition switch/key to unlock the steering 
column and to complete some circuit to run the VW.  By using the toggle 
switch, I save wear and tear on the 'electrical' ignition switch plastic 
unit.  Of course, the 'electrical' ignition switch, when twisted to the 
'gentlemen, start your engines' last twist will also disconnect other 
electrical drains, such as your lights and other things like this.  But I 
now have enough power to over come such power drains, and enough brain power 
to turn the lights OFF if I do need the extra power.

(5) more imagination and time on my hands than legally allowed = makes me 
'dangerous'


Here is my ATDS plans:  to mount various LOUD, screamingly  L O U D  
speakers and sirens in the overhead panel, right over the drivers head. I 
would need to cut out holes in the panel, so I need this extra panel [see 
(3)]

then, since I am NOT using the last twist of the electrical ignition switch, 
I would use that position to activate the horns, sirens, speakers 'hidden' 
in the overhead panel.

What I need is some advice on how to create continuous sound after the ATDS 
victim releases the key.  I would like the sound to blow for at least 15 
seconds.

Yes, I would also like to release a stun gun probe, and various other 
chemical agents, but this would be for version II, not on the beta version.


Any ideas on the switch/relay I could use to create a timed continuous 
blowing of the alarms???  What could I use.

Yes, this system would need to be automatically rearmed, not with some fuse 
that would burn, because is it quite possible the ATDS victim would not 
recognize that the problem comes when they turn the key, and they might 
re-try starting the VW again.  Of course, it would NOT start, but I don't 
want to upset them so they would damage the VW in frustration.  I would 
rather permanently blow out both (OK, I WILL settle for just ONE) ear drums, 
and I can clean up any personal body fluids/solids which were left by the 
intruder.  (Man, I could get DNA readings on this, right!!  I could take the 
samples to a lab and ask 'could you give me a DNA reading on this crap!!'  )

Suggestions??


OK, now, any 'serious' suggestions???

PS.  My previous ATDS was a sign that said 'Please don't sit on the baby 
snake.  It really pizzes off his MOTHER !!'  Not only was this an effective 
ATDS (with a real snake skin on the dash), but it also served to keep the 
renegade elephants away...  Alas, the sign faded over time, and the snake 
skin really did not help my 'pick up artist' image any.  So I want to 
upgrade from a PASSIVE ATDS up to a REACTIVE ATDS.  And I promise to replace 
my double knit polyester leisure suit with something more appropriate, like 
a Nehru jacket???  (Need a ride, honey?)
