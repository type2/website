What?  If I read this correctly, Gonzo recommends that you twist the wires
together and shrink heat-shrink tubing over the twisted wires _without_
any other method of securing the wires!

Gonzo at Superior Auto Electric won't be getting any of my business!

Heat shrink tubing is for insulation, not mechancial security!
