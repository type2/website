I bought the bus in 1990 and it had approximately 82,000 miles on it.

Yeah, I tend to agree with you.

I'm pretty aware.  I've owned an aircooled VW continuously since my 
first car, a '65 beetle that I bought used in 1975.  I've often thought 
that I knew a fair amount about these vehicles, but my head/valve 
problems of the last few years have left me humble.

So as far as my original question, does the broken advance spring 
resulting in excessive spark advance seem to be a legitimate 
explanation for the burned valves I've seen?

best regards
