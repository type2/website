Subject: RE: [T2]WAS- fuel line hoses- NOW Fire extinguisher

Hi Mike,

I have an extinguisher about twice the size of the one shown in the link, 
bungee-corded to the parking brake arm.  It's secure while driving and it 
doesn't interfere with the parking brake operation.  In an emergency, I can 
just grab the handle and pull it free of the bungees, not having to worry 
about flipping open the little catch on the holder.

An extinguisher mounted to the rear Westy cabinet might be a good idea for 
fires inside the Bus, but I think that fire coming from the engine area 
would prevent you from getting to it from the back hatch.  I would think 
that extinguishers mounted closer to the front of the Bus would remain 
accessible a little longer.

Make sure your fuel lines are new and make sure they aren't rubbing on any 
sharp edges.  Once those dangers are diminished, the need for a fire 
extinguisher drops significantly.

Good Luck!
