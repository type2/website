I read your archive post. I was wondering why you switched from a Gene
Berg dipstick sender to a modified VDO dipstick sender. You indicated
that a fellow listee modified the VDO sender for you in some fashion.
Curious why the GB sender wasn't usable, and what mod's you made to the
VDO one.
Thanks,
