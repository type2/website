When the flapper valves are turned off, ALL the heat that goes thru the 
heater boxes vent out the flapper valves....right at the 
transaxle/starter/axle area. TOO much heat!  In late 77, for the 78 and up 
models, VW made different valves. The new style has the exhaust heat exiting 
a hose and then going out pipes to the rear on each side. Go here and look 
at the valves. The ones with a mushroom head dump right there.

#12 are 72 to 77.
Now look at #11A, 39, and 41. These are the 78/79 set-ups. The 41 pipe runs 
down the outside of each frame rail. The rear support bracket bolts to the 
rear hanger front frame bolt.
I have left and right of #26.......


Damb Karl where have you been all my life? That is the answer I was looking 
for, the picture I needed and you have them, too. Unreal! I love it. Is #28 
on that page a cover for a different year or is it something else?

I need them just tell me how much.

Thanks,
