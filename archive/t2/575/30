Subject: '78 Westy weight - Hints from Heloise

I just weighed my '78 Westy at Fort Belvoir.  Fully loaded sans 
driver/passengers, with the daily junk that I carry around with me every 
day,  and a full gas tank = 3520 lbs

OK, now the rest of the story..  I was registering a vehicle at Ft Belvoir, 
and someone asked at the vehicle registration office where could he weigh 
his vehicle.  Well, it seems he was doing a self help  PCS move and he 
wanted to get the empty weight and later, the loaded weight.

I just followed him, and I put my '78 Westy on the scale after he got off, 
and I got off the scale, and they gave me a printout with my VW's weight and 
date and signed it to verify...

Of course, there is NOTHING on the weight receipt to indicate WHAT TYPE of 
vehicle was weighed!??!?!  The guy before me had some tiny car, and I'll bet 
when he came back for the loaded weight that he was bringing a semi or 
something like that!!  Probably bringing a U Haul full of furniture for the 
loaded weight...

((His Virginia  license plate was 91 USNA, if you know what that means.  ;-} 
  I have a Virginia vanity plate for the '77 VW bus that reads    ARMY 08    
Of course, I don't HAVE a '77 VW bus amymore, just the title and 
registration and dashboard VIN and non-removeable stickers from the driver's 
side door jam that I removed,   ...   and vanity plates.  Man, I just have 
to get insurance on it...))

This was done at the recycle center at Ft Belvoir Virginia, but I expect 
that MANY of the major military installations have the same service.  I 
didn't need any ID card or any paperwork.  And most anyone can bring their 
VW on base now-a-days if they have photo ID, valid registration, driver's 
license and proof of insurance. And a destination (PX, gas station, library 
are always good, including the NCO or EM or O Club.  OK, the 'weigh scales' 
if you must..)  Call ahead to find out where and when the "PCS self help 
move weigh scales" are on base.  If you ask for the EMPTY WEIGHT the first 
time, you should have no problem going back the next day for the LOADED 
WEIGHT (The second time back, load a spare engine in the VW [RCB]  and find 
out how much it weighs!!!)


Full tank of gas - and as we all know, H2O weighs approx 8 lbs per gallon, 
and I doubt gas is much off that mark, so that 10 gallons of gas I put in 
was about 80 lbs.  It adds up...

Hey, do you want to have some fun?!?!?  Do a Google on 'netstumbling'  and 
pmail me back if you found this tech message interesting or of value.  There 
has GOT TO be a bunch of  military retirees out there that would like to 
know their VW weight before and after loading it up for a major camping 
trip...

PS..  Dolan, I've got your fire extinguisher.
