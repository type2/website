Personally, I concluded that oil temp sump senders don't work very well in type1 engines (and only in type4 w/ a special, hard-to-find Porche sump plate).  I posted my rationale here:

sorry for the screwed up format of the post in archives--its my fault.

The basic conclusion was that sump senders in type1 motors are not accurate and dipstick senders are much more accurate.  I now use a VDO dipstick sender in my van....

Hope this helps someone.
