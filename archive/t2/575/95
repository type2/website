the 72 engine is a carbed engine
the 79 engine is a fuel injected engine.

Just in case you aren't very familiar with the engines yet...you can remove
the FI from the 79 and put your (dual) carb(s) on that engine. Most people
prefer the FI over a carb setup. It's a lot of work to retrofit the FI
system to your bus, but Greg Potts just did his and it is very possible, but
make sure you have all the FI parts available. If you are just beginning
it's a lot to take on for a newbie (I am just assuming you are so you will
get the most info I can give).

Now that you know you can actually get the engine in there you will have to
post your queries about what is involved and let us know what all you are
working with.
