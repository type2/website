Hi Don,

Years back, I mounted my speakers near the bottom of the doors (1971 Bus). I
cut an oval hole in the door panel about 8 inches up from the bottom where
there is a break in the door frame metal for the speaker to go into. I
drilled small holes in the door panel for mounting screws. Now, that being
said, I would *not* recommend doing it this way. This weakens the panel
which is not too strong anyway. Over the years the weight of the speaker has
caused the panel to deform to the point where the bottom of the panel is
just flapping loose. It didn't help that it is easy to inadvertantly kick
the speaker when getting in or out (my speaker cover protrudes about 1 inch
from the surface of the panel). One of the projects on my list is to
eliminate the speakers from this location and redo the door panels.

Good luck,
