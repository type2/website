Subject: RE: Fan Shroud and flaps & covers

Hey there Barry. All is good. The questions have been answered. I don't 
think air flows over the engine I meant around the engine directed by 
cooling tins I am very familiar with how this works. "The heat exchagers 
being closed off", I meant that one would not allow the air to travel from 
the HEs by closing them off, also I was told that the air has to pass 
through the HEs and continue to do so or they would get to hot and that the 
valves at the connection where the air would pass to the cabin allows for 
the escape of the heated air when you do not want it in the cabin. =0 
(Breath)

Ok this being said I definately want to have them on there. For winter and 
summer. I was told you only need them for heating to help that air to get to 
the cabin. Apparently they need to be there regaurdless to help cool off the 
Heat Exchangers and help Stabilize the Vibration / Support the heavy Heat 
Exchangers. There is a left and a right and they do have seals/gaskets. 
Little tin flaps there work like a check valve and do not let air from 
electric fan blow back into the fan shroud.

Thanks to all who helped in this one I promise that I will put something 
there until I get the correct pieces. The little tin flaps I am going to 
fabricate. I post some pics if they turn out W.A.S.

Best Reguards to the List and all Who make it what it is,
