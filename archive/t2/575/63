Marck; 

I just did this job last month on my 74 Westy. On my bus, it was all 5.5mm
hose. There are some buses that use 7mm hose from the fuel tank to the
filter, mine was not one of them. I have a BN4 gas heater, and it required
a section of 3.5mm line from the electric fuel pump to the heater. 

All told, it was at least 3.5m, probably closer to 4m total length of fuel
line. I was surprised at the quantity; 

Conti grey cloth covered 5mm hose is perfect. 

Make sure to use proper hose clamps. I like the squeeze-band smooth
Oetiker clamps, recommended to me by far more knowledgeable VW people.
They squeeze shut with wire cutters. Regular worm band screw-clamps can
predispose to failure of the hose. 

Hope this helps; 
Dan
74 Westy
