Subject: 76 CA FI bus.........cold idle issues.

I am having a tough time finding a lot of info on this bus, for it is a CA
model.  It is early 76 model at that. They changed parts of the fi mid way
thru.

Prior to now.........i had running like a champ, drove it 300 miles no
problems to a buddies to store.  It sat for 6 months, and then just would
not crank and stay running.  Did tests, found AFM to be faulty, replaced,
and now it fires up.  But it is weak at cold idle.  By this i mean it lopes
at around 300 rpms for 15 seconds and dies.  You gotta sit in the car and
keep it going until things warm up some.  And it is 90+ degrees outside here
in SC!!

It has a dual advance distributor on it.  I have no idea what to set the
distributor (timing wise) and how to be sure that the vacuum is hooked up
right.  Front side of the can (away from dizzy body) is going to the
throttle body, while the back side is "t"ing into the little nipple right
next to where the brake booster hose attaches to the air distributor.  I
want to make a daily driver out of this thing, for i have done a lot of
mechanical work to it (i rebuilt motor, brakes, etc).and just want it to run
like it should.

I have tested for vac leaks, and none are present.
