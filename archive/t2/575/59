Subject: my wife wants a price/amount estimate

For paint for a 1970 bus, the bus is completely "disassembled" (all windows,
seals, lights, interior, ect. has been removed), and is practically rust
free!!!!!!! There is some small spots of surface rust ( < 6sq in TOTAL) that
I'm going to treat with POR-15, then use "Tie-Coat Primer".

The primary color is red (below the gutter)
The roof is white (above the gutter)

Cost is a concern, but the equipment and know how (her uncle is a painter)
is available.

Any info/recommendations appreciated on:
Paint Manufacturers, where/who to buy from, how much paint we need, how much
it should cost (max/min)

Thanks,
MikeL
