Dave:

My thought is that the broken spring results in more advance than if 
the spring were intact.  The weights pull outward against the springs 
due to centrifugal force as they spin.  The springs resist this pull, 
but stretch in proportion to their intrinsic spring constant allowing 
the weights to move outward thus advancing the spark.  With only one 
spring to resist the centrifugal force, instead of two, you would 
experience more advance.  right????
