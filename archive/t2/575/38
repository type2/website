Subject: Parting out 79 westy

Hi all,

I am parting out my 79 Westy (I bought it for the engine, currently in 
my 72 westy).  It still has a lot of good parts but I need to get it 
out of my garage.  No reasonable offers will be refused for all or 
part.

I am in Fort Collins, Colorado (for shipping purposes)

Let me know if you need something,

Dave Williams

79 Westy (on life support)
72 Westy (soon for sale)
76 Hi-Top
