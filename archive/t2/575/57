Subject: Help needed: Fuel line replacement

Hi!

I am looking to change my fuel line hoses on m y 74 westfalia. I read
the article on the type2 library, but it did not cover the dimension of
the fuel line from the fuel tank to the pump, and also the fuel lines
of the fuel vapor system...

Anyone have changed their fuel lines on a 74? What are the correct
dimensions (and quantities).

Any help is appreciated!

Thanks!

Marck
