Subject: Re: [T2] A question of conversion

Bob do you mean that the non FI buses do not have the slot/hole for the 
ECU(brain) of the FI system? Or are you reffering to the lack of the return 
inlet on the gas tank? Neither have been mentioned so I can throw my 1 cent 
with yours and make 2. Besides the flywheel and the others, the fuel tank 
will not have a return line for the FI system. This can be remedied with a 
few minor fittings that will allow it to work properly. The slot/hole for 
the ECU could be cut into the body if not there, I guess. To answer the 
question is not as easy as black and white. But yes you could "throw" that 
'79 Type IV in there....

IT JUST DEPENDS ON YOUR WIND UP. Think breath release. You can do it.
