Subject: RE: [T2] fuel line hoses

When I put my new engine in, I am going to replace all of the fuel lines 
with solid stainless steel lines and Swagelok (or Tylok, or Letlok, etc.) 
fittings, especially where the fuel line runs through the cooling tin 
upstream of the injectors, where I will use a bulkhead fitting and a low 
spill volume quick release fitting.  Sort of like an air hose fitting, but 
neither side leaks.  The whole setup should be leak-proof for the life of 
the engine, and no more wear when that rubber grommet pops out, which I am 
paranoid about.  I still need to check the outer diameter of the injector 
hose barbs to see if they will work with a compression fitting.  So long 
hose clamp, golf tee, vice grip, dripping gas down my arm engine removals!  
I work at a stainless steel fabrication shop in the food and drug industry, 
so I get a pretty good deal on stainless steel tube and compression 
fittings, if anybody else is interested.
