Subject: SF to Seattle

Moving is soooo much fun <serious sarcasm>.

The wife and I are almost done packing up PT ('75 Riviera) and our 
borrowed Honda. Tomorrow morning we'll leave San Francisco North on the 
101, staying Tuesday night at Mackerricher State Park (Fort Bragg 
area). Wednesday we'll try to camp somewhere in Southern Oregon (any 
suggestions?). On Thursday we'll visit the Tilamook cheese factory and 
spend the night with friends in Portland. If everything goes well, 
we'll roll into Seattle on Friday.

The bus just got new kicks (capitol sv-820's - thanks to jason for the 
recommendation), an oil change and a whole lotta cargo weight. After 
lurking on the list and spending two years getting to know my bus I've 
got some repairs planned- but they'll have to wait a few weeks. The 
(d)PO thought dual baby-webers, and an 009 would make the bus really 
rad. Other than this sweet spot at WOT in third gear, this bus is 
really a pain in the ass to drive. It's my first aircooled VW and for a 
long time I figured everyone else's bus was similarly testy and 
difficult to drive. Oh, to be FI'ed with a stock dizzy...anyhow, one 
question:

Should I be looking for an 050? After reading a recent thread, I think 
switching back to FI is a bit beyond my learning curve right now. And 
I'm looking for any suggestions that make this rig more "drivable." As 
is, my wife refuses to get behind the wheel and I can hardly blame her.

Well, if anyone spots the tomato red with white rivvy topped slug, 
being trailed (perhaps impatiently) by a gold colored honda accord, on 
the 101 in the next couple of days...honk and wave.

Thanks,
Mark D.
