Wiring advice:

Make sure that you have a good mechanical connection first.  It doesn't
have to be bulletproof, but the strands of wire should not move while the
solder is solidifying.

Use good rosin core solder.  I prefer Kester "44" in .031 diameter.  Rat
Shack solder doesn't stick or flow so well.

Use a good strong soldering gun.  Pencil soldering irons aren't hot
enough.  Keep the tip clean by wiping it on a wet sponge.  I prefer a
Weller gun, which some consider old fashioned, but it works well.

Heat the wires to melting temperature before applying solder.  The only
time you should apply solder to the soldering gun is to tin the tip with a
bit of solder to facilitate heat transfer to the wire.

Support the connection while the solder is solidifying.

Be sure to install the heat shrink tubing before soldering the connection!
:)

Use a heat gun (paint stripper) to shrink the tubing.
