That's why I specified 5.5 mm hose, as opposed to the 7mm found on FI
buses. Just be aware that SOME 74's use small sections of 7mm hose from
the tank to the filter. 

Not that you'll be pulling the firewall, but all the tank breather hose on
a 74 is also 7mm. 

On my 74 - 5.5 mm hose everywhere, except fuel pump->gas heater, which was
3.5mm.
