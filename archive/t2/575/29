I can vouch for those  cloth covered fuel lines looking good and springing a 
leak.
It happened to me about 3 weeks ago. I had not driven my bus for a few weeks 
due
to a brake fluid from a defective brake light switch on the master cylinder. 
I replaced
the switch and then was going to drive around the block to see if the brakes 
were
ok. She fired right up but died about 50 feet down the street. I went back 
and looked
at the fiter and it was bone dry. Out of gas. I put in a half-gallon of lawn 
mower gas
started back up and went to the closest gas station and filled up. I pulled 
back into the driveway, crawled back under to see it the new stop switch was 
leaking brake
fluid.  Thats when I noticed the gas running in a steady stream onto the 
ground. The
gas line had a hole about 8-10 inches from the connection to the tank behind 
the engine. I ended up draining that entire tank of gas into various 1 and 5 
gallon cans
by siphon hose. That gas line looked great. You couldn't even see a hole under
the cloth covering. I'm just thankful I didn't take it out on the freeway or 
it would
have ended up just like those burned buses in the photos.
