Get an SVDA from aircooled.net, install it, and time it to 7.5 BTDC.

Lessee... I can never remember... is '75 1.8L or 2.0L?  Anyway, making 
sure the carbs are jetted properly for your engine size is important.  
Getting them properly synchronized is also key.

If you weren't leaving San Francisco, I would suggest you bring it on 
over to my place for the day... I'd be happy to try and help you get it 
running better.
