Yes, Tim, that is correct, kinda.

The broken spring *may* have been the cause of his heads melting down. 
However, an interesting note is that if the spring was broken, that 
could leave the weight to the outside and the distributor in an advanced 
state at any RPM (including IDLE).  When the engine was timed at idle, 
he would have been timing the engine when the distributor was in that 
advanced state, which would ultimately give him LESS total advance. 
That's why I said *may* have been the cause.

Regardless, that is why everyone always says you NEED to test for max 
advance for your given engine type.  If your max advance and idle timing 
aren't matching up to the prescribed numbers, it's time to start 
checking things out.
