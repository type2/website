I've been wondering about this for a while, where is the "best" or not so
best place to have mount your fire extinguisher?????

I have three fire extinguishers 2 mounted and one "stashed" the big one I
have mounted like this: (thanks for the Idea Don T.)

And a not so big one mounted in the "stock westie" spot on the base of the
backseat/bed.

Is it worth mounting one in the rear cargo section, on the cabinet over the
spare tire well??? Would you be able to get to it in case of an engine
"issue"???

Come on folks lets hear some thoughts on this!!!!!!!!
