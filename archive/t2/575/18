Subject: vdo oil drain temp sender 323-055 vs. 323-888

Hello, 

I am preparing for a cross country move, and am
placing an order with cip1 today. I'm getting gauges
and senders for oil pressure, temperature, and cht. 

They have two oil drain temp senders: 

http://www2.cip1.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=VDO%2D323%2D055
which is in stock 

and 

http://www2.cip1.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=VDO%2D323%2D888
which is out of stock 


Bus Depot only sells one sender, the 323-888 one. I
just tried to call VDO in Pennsylvania....what a joke.
Only voice mail, even for the operator. The guy at
cip1 was trying to help me, but he's not sure either.
He saw something indicating the 323-055 sender might
be for type4 engines. They are both listed as 300
degree, m14x1.5. 

Any help will be appreciated. It's getting down to
crunch time, if I'm going to enjoy cip1's free 10-14
day shipping. 

Also, when people talk about running the sender wires
to the dash through a "wiring loom" what are they
referring to? Is 
it just protective plastic tubing to put the wire(s)
through? I'm planning on keeping all three wires
together and running them along the frame underneath. 

Thanks, 
Jon

70 Westie

PS I'm leaving June 26th, mostly going i-40. If you
see a faded red westie with a sailboat and bicycle on
top, and two yellow cats trying to get out the
jalousie windows, that will be me. I'm normally just
an uninformed lurker, but I'll probably need some more
help as I prepare for departure. 

PPS Yesterday, I called some of the AIRS folks along
my route, and a lot of the phone numbers are wrong.
Does anyone have an updated list they've confirmed
recently?  Is it considered poor form / overkill to
post the same message simultaneously on here and
thesamba ?  If so, whoops. happy monday!
