Michael, I did not CC: the list on my original message to you because I did 
not wish to seem I was critical of a typo.

Michael, the dash board lever does not close the air entering the heat 
exchangers.

In fact, nothing closes the air going into the heat exchangers, or going out 
of the heat exchangers.

The air that exits the heat exchanger (1) is directed to the front of the 
bus, or it (2) is spilled out of the flow at the front of the engine (That 
is, if you do not have the original tubes to direct the warm air to both 
sides of the bus).



then the air that was
>flowing through there is now added to the stream of air that is flowing 
>over the engine.

This redirected warm air would be flowing from the front of the engine to 
the sides and below the engine.  It would not be flowing over the engine.  
The engine is pretty well contained at the bottom and sides by cooling tin 
and the heat exchangers and valve covers, so there would be very little 
negative impact of the warm air on the engine WHEN THE BUS IS TRAVELING OVER 
THE ROAD.  Of course, when stopped, the warm air might accumulate under the 
bus to a negative effect.

If the covers/coffers(=D) are not there,
>when you close off the HEs

Again, the heat exchangers are not closed off.  The air continues to flow in 
and out of the heat exchangers (when the engine is running or the fan is 
on), and from there to a pair of riser tubes into the heater control boxes.  
These heater control boxes (1) direct the warm air exiting the heat 
exchanger to either the front of the bus, or (2) dump the warm air under and 
around the engine as the bus is traveling over the ground.


then the air that would be added is lost
>by way of open air where covers should be. Or is there some type of release 
>at the front of the HEs when they are closed off?

The absence of the covers  would cause less of the ambient air from the 
engine compartment from entering the stream that goes through the heat 
exchangers.    I am sure the technical experts on the list would be able to 
show that some air 'pressure' to the flaps (top of heat exchanger) would be 
reduced because of an open environment in the fan shrouding.

To be complete, the fan shrouding at the rear of the bus has one or two more 
outlets that must be considered; the cooling air to the alternator, and on 
my '76, there is an outlet that it rear-top-left that feeds into the 
charcoal canister system.

You are right, of course.  I was trying to keep with the terminology of the 
Virginia inspection officials.  They have asked to feel the air coming out 
of my 'defroster'


It is not so much the weight of the heat exchangers that

OK, glad I had some input that had value.
