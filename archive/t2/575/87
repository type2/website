Subject: Need a spare

Anybody in Orange County, CA (I live in Anaheim and work in Orange)
have a spare rim & tire they want to sell for my 73 bus? I haven't had
time to haunt all the junkyards, but am getting increasingly nervous
about not having a spare. Especially after my tire separation last
week.

Thanks!
