Subject: A question of conversion

Hi -

I'm in the process of restoring my 72 Campmobile and wondered if anyone knows
where I can get a replacement icebox?  I understand ASI is still in business,
but not doing VW's, per se.

I'd also like to know if I can throw a 79 type 4 engine into the 72 space
without modification.

Thanks,
