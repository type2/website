Timothy,

Re-examine the idea behind weights and centrifical advance...

More weights, advance faster...less weight, advance slower or not  
all the way....at least this is how the 009 works.

Centrifical force spins the weights faster causing more advance quicker.

Not all engines die from being advanced too much...wink,wink.

Too much retard gets you almost the same problem as too much advance.


Cheers, dave
