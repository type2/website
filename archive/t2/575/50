Subject: re Throwout bearing clips with loops

Hello, Mark Dearing recommended the throwout bearing clips with loops that can
be safety wired on. I installed a pair yesterday, but I am wondering about
them, since the action as the throwout bearing rotates in the shaft doesn't
seem smoooth- it's kind of like the clips bind up a bit where they go around
the back of the fork. The 2 sides are identical, and it almost seems like
there should be a left side and a right side. I'm trying to make my bus more
reliable with this mod, and I don't like the feel of the binding the bearing
is now doing. Advice? The stock clips were fine, but they have been bent and
rebent many times, may be time to replace them?

Where do you attach the safety wire to?

Also, I am drawing a blank looking for safety wire. People have no idea what
I'm talking about, it's like I'm asking for a unicorn or something. Where to
get it in Canada? I want to get this baby done SOON.
