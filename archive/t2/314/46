Ben,

It is a bit complicated, but not really all that bad.

Here are some tips:

1/ you can buy your travel insurance in texas or one of the other border
states. Sanborn's is a well-known company that sells mexican car insurance,
I would recommend them. Once you get close to the mexican border, you will
see many signs for insurance, find a sanborns, or do the research and find a
location near you.

2/ you have to have a credit card in the name of the vehicle title, without
this, the border crossing into mexico will be difficult.

3/ when you cross, use a less-travelled border crossing. For instance, NOT
laredo or tijuana. Nuevo laredo is close to laredo and less busy. There are
many others, but just stay away from the busy ones.
