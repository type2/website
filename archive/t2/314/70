Subject: steering box

My steering is getting sloppy, actually not "my" steering but my bus's 
response to my steering.... you get my drift  ;-) .  Some background;  I 
have checked out the drag screw on the box and it is adjusted per 
Bentley specs.  I also put on new tie rods from the Bus Depot, thanks 
Ron, and had the alignment done by Goodyear - reliable mechanics and a 
good job.

Are there any good steering boxes out there?  I know that most, if not 
all, are rebuilt just looking for suggestions on whom has a well 
re-built one.

Thanks
