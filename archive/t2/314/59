You can order them online from Bus Depot and the other online places, but I'd be very surprised if you aren't able to find them in town at a vwflaps and even at other parts stores that advertize Bosch parts.

I just found a place nearby that sells that stuff along with Mahle air and oil filters so I'm in heaven. Online will always be cheaper and sometimes quite a bit, but you have to consider the shipping costs if you aren't adding to a larger order.
