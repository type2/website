Subject: re: [T2] Updated alt/regulator trouble

Charles,

This sounds suspiciously like a huge headache I had with my 78
Westy while travelling this past summer.
I *strongly* recommend you check the wiring harness which leads
from the voltage regulator-to-alternator-to-starter solenoid.
Investigate the hole in the tin through which the
alternator-to-solenoid wires pass - is there a rubber grommet?
What condition is it in?

If the above does not reveal any bare wires or poor connections,
then it's time to get familiar with your alternator, and its
removal.  I managed to pull my alternator, engine-in (T4), four
separate times in the span of one afternoon (in a hotel parking
lot), so it can be done... Once the alternator is removed, check
the wire-to-post connection behind the alternator's tin cover
(back)... somehow, the distance between the tinware and the top
of the post shortened over the years (mysterious...), and I found
my problems lied there.  At bumps in the road, the alternator
would short to the tinware, causing all sorts of electrical
gremlins, including those that you noted.  The catalyst for my
discovery was an apparently *bad* short which ultimately caused
the whole darned harness to melt, creating much smoke and fear.

Hope this helps!
