No, especially at vw speeds.  For tight turns,
the lockright locker disengages.  I believe that
the locker is barely perceptible unless you're
going way too fast.  Limited slip, unless you
have the absolute newest designs (which aren't
available for VW AFAIK), provide only a fraction
of the power to the other tire and do not kick in
until the rear end is spinning.  

Here's a link, though it isn't the one I was
looking for:

The article reminded me that limited slips diffs
(actually the clutch packs) wear and degrade over
a fairly short period.  As little as 25,000
miles.

You'll never have a rock crawler with a 2wd 60hp
vehicle.

I wouldn't spend the money on LSD.  Either open
or locked for me, thanks.  Besides, I'm not aware
of a limited slip available for the vw tranny
anyway.  Anyone?
