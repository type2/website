Subject: South Wind gas heater

Hello all,

A couple of weeks ago someone with a bus barn shared with us that he
installed a SW heater in a double cab. I saved the post and I was wondering
if it is proper list ettiquette to contact this person using P-mail.

And on the subject of SW heaters, has anyone installed one in an air-cooled
Vanagon. I'm interested on where these things can be placed and also which
model or type would be a good canidate. My only exposure to  these heaters
has been from viewing them on that worldwide E-business marketplace.

Any comments or suggestions would be helpful.

Thanks, Craig
