Hi Bradley,

Before you replace the steering box,  be sure to inspect the rubber 
bushing at the bottom of the steering.

Mine failed about two years ago while parking in my driveway. Dad's 81 
Vanagon chewed one up (Vanagons have two) a week after he brought it 
home.  As these break they tend to get sloppy first, then let go 
entirely when you put some torque into them.

It's a fairly inexpensive part, and can be replaced in about half an 
hour or less.


Happy trails,
