I'm running 10-30w. Unfortuantely, I don't have an oil pressure gauge, so I
can't tell what's up there (it's on the to-do list).

The seals are about one month old with less than 1000 miles on them. I
tore-down the engine over the Xmas holiday (see the thread about the damned
distributor drive spring falling into the engine...).

My oil pressure switch was leaking before - this is definitely a different
leak. I replaced the switch during the overhaul.

Thanks for the input though.
