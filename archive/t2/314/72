how is this possible?

i did not think that disc brakes had any type of adjustment built
into them. the pads wear down & 'self-adjust' through the lifetime
of the pad.

just my opinion, but i think the problem lies somewhere in the fact
that the booster is not hooked up(which was stated in the
original post), or as others have suggested, gunk somewhere
in the brake lines.

good luck,
