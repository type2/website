The space under the seat is a plus. I carry the spare tire, jumper cables, 
tow strap,
electric air pump, safety triangles, wheel chokes, the stock jack, tools, 
work clothes,
a spot light, various cans of liquids, and spare parts.   In the old times 
we even used to carry
"contraband" meat from France into Switzerland in the spare tire space.
