Subject: Exhaust & Heating advice request

All,
     I am tired of dealing with heater boxes, controller flaps, control 
cables, and all of the stock heating parts that are just a pain to deal with 
and don't work all THAT great even when perfectly maintained in a well 
insulated bus.  I was thinking that since some of my exhaust pieces are 
pretty bad off, and since the stock heating stuff is such a pain, that I 
might just switch over to gas heat in my 74 standard.
     My thought is that I could maybe sell the good parts (elbows, control 
flaps, connection tubes, blower fan) at a reasonable price, and the bad but 
repairable parts (heater boxes) at a very discounted price, and use the 
money made from the sale towards a good gas heater.  I would then install 
the gas heater, ducting it directly into either the rear Y pipe or right 
into the big center pipe (controlling the heat only by whether it's on or 
off), and use gas heat exclusively.
     Since I want to replace most of my exhaust anyway, I was just going to 
go with stainless steel so I hopefully don't have to worry about it again 
for a while.  I was thinking of just buying this exhaust: "Complete Exhaust 
System, 72-74 bus (OEM style) with STAINLESS STEEL Bodied Muffler", from Bus 
Depot.  Is that a good way to go (I know B.D. is the bomb I just want to 
make sure I'm buying the right product from them)?  Is it ONLY the muffler 
that's stainless?  Does this include everything to replace my exhaust, 
including the heater boxes?  If not, what (other than hardware and gaskets) 
am I going to need?
     Is this a bad idea, or a good idea, or somewhere in between?  I have 
heard so much both good and bad about gas heaters.  I would bet that if they 
are properly re-built and maintained that they are pretty safe and superior 
to the stock system, but I don't know that much about them personally.
     Advice, personal experience, conjecture, even derisive laughter are all 
welcome!

Thanks,
