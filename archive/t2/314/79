Dave,

I have done this switch, from '79 to 72-74. It works perfectly. Everything
bolts up. I got the heater boxes from busdepot, one german and one danish,
and a leistritz muffler from thesamba. The interesting thing is that the
german heater box had flaked paint and surface rust before the dansk one. Go
figure. But the german box has a much better heat manifold inside - much
finer fins and more of them. The muffler is excellent, much better quality
than the danish ones I have seen, and the fit is superb on my motor.

You need some different tin to make it work, depending on what year exhaust
you have now. I needed one bottom air deflector, one rear left rear cover
plate and one front lower left cover plate. On my setup there are no fit
issues with the heater control flappers or hot air pipes, it all fits. If
you are going from 75-78 to 72-74 there will more parts to swap, I believe.

I put this system on the motor last fall, and ran the bus for about 11k
miles. I recently had to pull the motor to fix a bad cam, so I took the
chance to ceramic coat the entire exhaust to prevent it from rusting. Here
is a link to what it all looks like:
