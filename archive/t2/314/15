Hello David and the list,

I talked to Mr. Dolan about a week ago I think. He
said that he had some things that needed to be done
around the house this winter and somthing had to give
so he could get them done. (the list) He says not to
worry that he would be back on the list before he went
on his  cross country trip before June. You are right
though. I miss his insight on the list too. He has a
knack for keeping you interested and makeing you
think. :) 

Have a great day!
