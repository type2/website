Subject: Restored '79 For Sale

Listees!
Thank you to all who helped save Otis last month!
Unfortunately, the ultimate and best solution is to find an owner that has the
time and expertise to
keep him running and in good condition.

Some of you may remember Otis from 5 years ago when I restored him. Here is
the web site I posted
to show what was done.

The results were a pristine bus inside and out. Ran great as well.

In the last 5 years the salts used in Maryland have taken their toll. The
exhaust system is virtually gone
and some rust lines are starting to come into the arches around the wheels.
One of the mirrors has rusted.
The inside still looks great.
Needs a window crank and maybe a couple other details. We had to inflate the
tires and use starter fluid
to get going but then ran fine (although kind of loud without an exhaust).

Before I saw the bus earlier this month, I thought $3K wasn't unreasonable but
considering the rust spots
and the fact that Randy is paying the monthly storage fee I thought $2K would
find Otis a worthy home more
quickly. I welcome comments as far as this price is concerned.

Please respond to me at my email address. The bus is in Baltimore, MD and I
live in Denver. My son Randy can
meet with interested buyers to show the bus.

Thanks,
Joel
