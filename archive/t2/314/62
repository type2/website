This is what the mechanical version of the valve looks like in pieces:

The valve can be found at junkyards for $5-$10 in as is condition, in fact I saw one with a slghtly bent lever at the South San Jose pick-n-pull last week. It was on a 77 CA engine sitting behind the bus.

I've heard that <http://www.smogparts.com/> may have these rebuilt but they won't be cheap because they know you're coming to them as a last resort. Search the archives for prices.

I found ithe exploded egr diagram on that site a while back (it shows the nicest example of a stock engine I've ever seen). It's like a time trip to the dealer in 1978:
