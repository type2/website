If you can assure me that nobody will EVEN want to steal a 30 
years old Bus, well, I will maybe take the chance of going 
there with only a liability coverage, but I don't like it at 
all!!!!

you could tape a sign in the window that says:

For Sale
($year) Volkswagen Kombi
engine runs, but needs work (rod knock ?)
$3500 obo
[some fake phone]
