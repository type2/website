This is replying late, and I know others probably already have sent in
their two cents, but heres mine:

I liked platinum plugs. I put them in and forget them. Really.
Once they are in I dont bother to look at them again. They have
lasted in some engines of mine for 10 years or so. They mat still
be in those engines I dont know, by that time I had sold the bus.

HOWEVER: My friends have not had such luck. They fouled out often
and became a pain.

SO: I needed to figure what the difference was here are they differences:

1. Engine size: Mine were always on a 1600 or up to a 1641
2. They often ran dual carbs, I used single.
3. I always used a pertronix ignitor instead of points.

I think number 3 was the main difference. As you said in your post
A different ignition system would work better then stock for
platinum plugs.

Maybe thats the case.
