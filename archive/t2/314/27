It is also possible that you have junk in your master cylinder.

When you push fluid out into the wheel cylinders, it has to be able to 
come back as well.  I have seen(71 bug MC) where there was minute garbage 
in the MC and the fluid would not flow back correctly(or quickly).

If you stop the bus and don't press on the brakes for a while, do they 
release the rotor?....probably junk in the MC blocking the return valve.

Cheers, dave
