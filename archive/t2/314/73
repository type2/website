Subject: renting a vw aircooled bus in the states

Hi folks,

coming october I'll be visiting Chicago. After visiting Chicago I'll 
probably fly further to California. That's where I would like to rent an 
aircooled vdub bus. Or maybe, if I'm not gonna fly to California, drive from 
Chicago to California...

Are there some places where you can rent an aircooled vw bus??

Thanks in advance!
