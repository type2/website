Pardon my ignorance,  but where might I find this "M-code plate"?  Also, do
you know what code to look for on the tranny (and where)?  Can I have the
LSD unit (if it is indeed such) rebuilt like any other, and can I order an
LSD replacement complete, and from where?  Transform? Good/bad?  TIA for any
help.  I'll check wheel bearings, too, but since the whine is VERY
high-pitched and happens at extremely slow speeds, I think it's tranny.
There's gear noise at higher speeds, too, but it's not bad (I hope) yet.
