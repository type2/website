Subject: Updated alt/regulator trouble

Hello everybody --

Last night I replaced the voltage regulator.  No dice.

I believe I have a bad ground or loose connection somewhere.  The reason I think this is because on the drive to work this morning, I looked down, and the alt light was entirely dark, no faint glow at all.  But when I would hit bumps the alt light would flash brightly.  So tonight when I get off work, I will check all the connections on the alternator.

Thanks, 

Charles
