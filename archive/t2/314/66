Subject: Neat bay window bus toys

Hello List,

I was surfing EB(-at-)Y when I found this toy distributor
that did some business on that auction site. Well, I
started looking at their websight and found some
pretty nice bay window toys. They are new metal toys
that are made from the origional vintage german toy
molds. I especially liked the single cab toy! I just
thought I would pass this link along for all those VW
toy collectors on the list. My first thought is that
these would make excellent door prizes or raffle
prizes for a vw event or camp out. Their prices are
alittle high since they are selling to toy collectors
but not too bad. Here is a link.

Well, I hope someone likes them. If this site is
common knowledge, then I appoligize. I am usually the
last to find out things. :) Have a great day!
