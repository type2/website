From the factory the vacuum hoses on FI busses were made from short pieces
of cloth-covered rubber tubing at the nipples and tees, interconnected with
longer pieces of hard nylon tubing. The hard tubing fits inside the rubber
tubing. The two-piece construction can only have been used so the rubber
tubing didn't collapse under vacuum. I think it is fine to use rubber tubing
alone, especially as the nylon tubing is not available, though I suppose a
good substitute could be sourced if you were so inclined.
