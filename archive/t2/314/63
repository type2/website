well some comments
 I have Michelin 205/70R14 all season tires on my 78 
 and with an auto tranny I deffinately don't have a limited slip rear end

But this week up in the mountains near Somerset PA, I got out every

vehicle,  now if starting at -7F would be as easy....But it did start
every time (so I helped a little with a shot of ether)
