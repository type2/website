Here is my thought. Before you go and swap the fuel
pump, try removing the gas cap and then take readings.
This could show that your fuel tank is not vent
properly causeing the erratic readings. You could also
plug off the vacuum nipple on the fuel regulator and
see if this makes a difference. This is just
speculation but it would be easy to test. Could a
leaky cold start valve or injectors cause these
readings? Those are the only oter things that I could
think of. I assume you don't have fuel leaks. Good
luck. I hope it is somthing cheep and easy to fix! :)

Have a great day!
