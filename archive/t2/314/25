Yes it is having some problems. Our provider installed a new, faster server
and ran into some trouble. For the last day or so both the order form and
the search functions have been down.  You can put items in your shopping
cart but you can't check out. You can pull up items on most of the pages,
but you can't search by part number or description.  Also, the Cables &
Hoses and Steering & Suspension pages are displaying parts for multiple VW
models even if you specify only one.

The problem should be resolved by early afternoon, or so I'm told.
Meanwhile, you can use the various product category pages to look up items,
and you can even put them in your shopping cart.  Hopefully you'll then be
able to check out, which will mean they fixed the problem.  But if not,
since you already have the parts listed on your shopping cart, you can just
call toll-free (1-866-BUS-DEPOT) and read them off to the operator instead,
who can enter them for you in a few seconds. (We open at 11 eastern time.)
If you need part number lookup assistance, call Customer Service instead, at
215-234-VWVW.

Sorry for the inconvenience but hopefully it will be resolved in a few
hours.
