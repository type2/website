Subject: heater boxes..again

Any folks out there who have purchased Ron's(busdepot) left and right
heater boxes for a conversion from late bay to 72-74.

How well do the replacement heater boxes work?

Do the original control boxes still fit up to the new ones well?

Did you buy the heavy duty vw german left one and the "heavy duty danish" 
right one?

I have some T1 Dansk heater box replacements and they are nowhere near as 
good as the original german ones....not bad, just not too good below 
freezing.....and it was 6 degrees yesterday morning. 

Cheers, dave
