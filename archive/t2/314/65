Subject: Re: [T2] Anti-seize

	I have always used a #2 pencil to 'lube' the threads of my spark plugs.  
Graphite keeps them slippery enough, and won't evaporate and/or cook like 
many machine oils do.  Just a light coat does the trick.  Anti-sieze tends 
to become glue-like after awhile, and can gum up threads that are in a 
high(or low) maintenance application like spark plugs.
