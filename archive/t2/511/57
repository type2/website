If you're trip will involve ANY backing up at all get the flat trailer.
Just drive down your road with it, unhook it, turn it around by hand, get
your tow vehicle around it, and hook it back up. I assume that's what
you're doing with the tow dolly.

Option #2 -- use a tow bar. Same rules regarding backing up -- DON'T! But
no troubles getting the front wheels up on the tow dolly and easy to unhook
from the tow vehicle and shove it back by hand if you get in a situation
where you do need to back it up.

In all cases having the engine in is not necessary. If there is "slop" in
the shifter you may want to find a way to make sure it doesn't "bounce"
into gear (engine in or out). You will toast the tranny if it does. If
you're feeling energetic crawl under and pull the drive axles out to avoid
that possibility. Shouldn't be necessary though.

I just towed a '73 Riviera camper from Concord, CA to Beaumont, TX 
(2003.6 miles according to maps.yahoo.com). Towbar, 4 wheels on the ground,
engine in pieces in the back of my pickup. It has a stiff shifter so I
wasn't worried about that. Had a nice time at BBB and had my own place to
sleep this time.
