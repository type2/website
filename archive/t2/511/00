Subject: Re: [T2] Battery Drain

Rus,

there have been some good threads on this lately.

here's a good starting point:
1) take battery to FLAPS for a free test to make sure its good.
2) go to Radio Shack & buy a multi-meter for about 20 bucks.
3) hook multi-meter up to battery while in car & make sure that 
something is
	draining the power.
4) pull each fuse one-by-one & see when the drain stops by checking the 
multi-meter (a helper would be ideal for this)

if the drain stops when a particular fuse is pulled, then you have 
isolated the problem.  also, if you have any aftermarket electronics 
installed in your vehicle, it might be a good idea to check those 
before pulling fuses.

good luck,
