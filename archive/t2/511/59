Subject: Re: [T2] 71 Fuse Box

 I have a 71-only fuse box, complete with all the wires still attached [I cut them 2-3" from the ends].  What
kind of picture do you want? A pic of the fuse is kind of worthless......
I have a couple of flashers. I am east of you in Fresno.

 nightmare.  Where is a good place to buy a flasher relay, my local stores don't have it.
