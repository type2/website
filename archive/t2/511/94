There are quite a few stretch buses out there.  There was one around here
made from two 21 (or maybe 23) window buses, making it something like 29
or 31 windows!  The interior had a major teen-pleaser stereo system.

I've seen at least three stretch buses at BBB.  Two had mid-engine V8s,
solving the power probem.  The other was an original paint bus from a VW
shop that had been recently saved from a back lot somewhere
