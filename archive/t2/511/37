The pictures have been tampered with. Never trust the
brochures. If you decide to make a collection of
brochures or if you simply browse around on the net
you will see that they use the same pictures through
different years. They altered the pictures a bit to
make the vehicle look like the bus of that modelyear.
In a lot of cases it is quite clear that the picture
has been changed. Check out the door handle for
example, this one has been drawn with a pencil
obviously:

and indeed has the 1968 door locking mechanism but the
1969-1979 doorhandle.

another detail they forgot is the padded dashboard
rim. Is goes upward at the steeringwheel. This was on
1968-1969 models only!

And then the colour combination! On 1968-1970 models
the border between the two colours was at the rain
gutter, after 1971 it was at the belt line
approximately 10cm below the window just like this
picture shows...

...I just can't stop pointing out the errors in the
picture. May be these brochures are a nice source for
one of those puzzle-holiday books to keep your kids
quiet during your the trip: "what's wrong in this
picture"...

or: "spot the differences" in these two pictures:

The VW-brochure-artists did a fine job!
