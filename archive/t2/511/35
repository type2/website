Subject: failure in brake booster

--C&B,

Remove master cylinder. Make a dipstick and verify that there is less than 1" of fluid in the bottom of the booster.  Karl taught me this test. Fortunately for me, I had a bad MC, but had not leaked much yet.

No? Booster diaphram probably shot. Rebuild. 

Use the folks in texas recommended. They are list-approved.
