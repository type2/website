Great, glad you/he were able to resolve the problem so quickly.

I was about to also suggest checking the + and - straps from the 
battery.  The symptoms sounded an awful lot like my little adventure 
with a + strap that was not properly secured over the terminal on the 
solenoid ("hey it ran when I parked it here yesterday, and now no 
warnings lights or anything??").  Once I fixed that connection, my cold 
start and rough running problems also went away.

In my case, it's very likely that the bogus solenoid connection had 
been that way since the PO of my Bus and another listie (who shall 
remain nameless :-) replaced the solenoid several months before I 
bought it.  Guess he was just luckier than most people :-)

Cheers!
