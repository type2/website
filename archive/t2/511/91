Boy, is this a Friday topic!

I was at a major airport recently and saw a lot of limos. The usual lincolns
and Caddies, but also a PT Cruiser. So here's my question:

Has anybody ever lengthened a Bus? Preferably a camper. I don't mean
lengthened to limo standards, but adding two or three feet to the passenger
compartment. I can't help thinking that would make it 'campier'.

Just a stray thought; flame suit on.
