Is a link to someone who put a westy and a syncro together, but it's 
vanagons, not T2s. This is apparently the second time he's done this, and 
there should be pics on there for a splitty he did a number of years ago. 
I've also seen shortened busses. I think there was one on ebay last year...

It seems like a cool idea, but you'd probably need a subaru motor to get it 
up hills at any respectable speed. still, he says this van handles pretty well.
