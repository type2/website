I ordered tires online once. They price was incredible because they were
blowing out stock but the mounting costs made it not worthwhile.

Some places include mounting and balancing but if you ask them to match
someone else's price they will sometimes try to charge you the M/B cost that
was previously included so you end up paying the same ammount and their
commission isn't hurt. I'm never happy going to the tire dealer and having
to negotiate. The up-sell of chrome valve stems and mag wheels is really
distasteful.

The last time I tried to get a tire alignment at Wheel Works on the other
car they only wanted to replace the tires. It's a low mileage driver but
their little trick to it read the date of manufacturer on the side of the
wheel and tell you the tires are worn out or too old regardless of when you
bought them or how much tread is left.
