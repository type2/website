Your's is the last year to have that style of wiper posts before they went
to the style held on with the nut. Sometime around 1969 Volkswagen
actually had a factory recall of sorts for that style of wiper (for all
models) and they came out with a redesigned wiper arm that uses a bolt
with special nuts that are perpendicular to the shaft and pinch the shaft
(like you grip your finger after you slam it in a door). An added benefit
is that this arm could be used with posts that have been mangled by the
other style arm. This new wiper arm was apparently available to any owner
who requested it but in my experience there never were a whole lot of them
distributed. When I find them at swap meets I usually pick them up because
nobody seems to be aware of their existance and I can usually find someone
who needs them. I believe that your arms may be a 1 year only item with a
hook on the end to hold the wiper blade so your search for such an item
may not be easy. When I was at BBB8 I did see one of these for an earlier
Bus (without the hook) but I didn't buy it because I couldn't think of
anyone who would need it.
