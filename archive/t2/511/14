First, it's pronounced pernts, not points. Any mechanic or roadside assistant worth his weight in single grade oil pronounces it that way. ;-)

Maintenance is simple: regap them or replace them and regap them to 50 degrees of dwell. You can file them down to get rid of pits before regapping but when new, the tungsten has a nice radius to it so it's not quite the same as filing them flat.

And carry a spare set.
