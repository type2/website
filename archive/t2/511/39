Subject: Good price for tires in the SFBA

Hey folks...

Managed to get a pretty good price on 185R14C's for my '76 Westy over 
in Berkeley at the Firestone shop on University.

The brand is Capital, tires include a 50,000mi warranty.  Total for 5 
tires including tax, mount, balance and a road hazard warranty 
(~$6/tire) came to $389.23.  Base price per tire was $48.99.

That's better than the quote I got from tiresplus.com (best base price 
there was $60/tire for Yokohama Y356).  tirerack.com has the Y356 C for 
$50/tire.  You still have to deal with shipping costs.

The guys at Buslab recommended the Firestone place to me, claiming to 
have gotten many a tire from them and always being happy.

Anyway, just figured I'd pass the information along :-)
