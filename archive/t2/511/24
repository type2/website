Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum leak in brake booster

I had similar problems and I did have an internal leak in my booster.

If you need to get your booster rebuilt, I recommend:

H & R Auto Parts Rebuilders
10328 Oakwood Dr, Dallas, TX 75217
Phone: (972) 286-5516

Mine cost $81 including shipping and they did it the day they got it and
sent it back the next day.

It is pretty much impossible for anyone but a booster specialist to replace
the diaphragm.
