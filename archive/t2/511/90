Subject: Re: [T2] Keeping a Manual Transmision Alive

Once again thanks for all the great replies.  It helped me to not listen to
local mechanics once again, and somehow still manage to keep my vehicle
running with little cost.

This week my tranmission was acting up, to the point I thought the part and
maybe vehicle were a write off.

Mechanic #1 - Wanted to remove the tranny and send to a rebuilder for
evaluation $$
Mechanic #2 - Refused tot change the fluid for me, said the tranny was gone.
(Canadian Tire) $$
Mechanic #3 - Somehow got the vehicle to run a bit.

I went to mechanic #4, got the tranny fluid changed, and it's been running
great all week.  Maybe there *is* something to changing that fluid ??  I think
I'll do all my vehicles of 150,000+ miles, just for precaution sake..

Total cost, under 100$ for all four (4) garages and the car's running great !

Best regards to all,
Shawn.
