Do you mean the "roll-on-automatic" seat belts? They
don't need extra mounting points. You can fit them in
any T2 made from august'67 until 1979. The only
problem is that the "roll-on-automatic" thingy is
mounted with a piece of metal that makes a 90 degree
angle with the top of the wheel well. That's all.

These automatic-roll-on seatbelts were mainly ordered
on German buses. I don't want to bore you with
M-codes...but I'll do it anyway ;-)

M525 - The USA/Canada-only seatbelts
       (were these 2-point during all
       the modelyears?)


M184 - 3-point Seatbelts in cabin
       with roll-on/off automatic
M549 = 3-point seatbelts in cabin
       (these must be horrible without
       the 'automatic' you are really
       strapped in possition)

This was an original setup, also on the T2. So no
worries I guess.
