Subject: Use of Mobil 1 75-140 gear oil NOT!

Spurred by a recent post about gear oil here is what I asked for and got
from Mobile

"Mobil1 Synthetic Gear Lubricant 75W140 is not recommended for your
transmission due to  high sulphur content that can corrode your yellow
metals that are present in your transmission."

never GL5 because GL 5rated oils will corrode bronze and brass and any other
yellow metals.
