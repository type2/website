Although I'm not exactly in the wet weather capital of the world, I do get
to drive in the rain now and then.  I'm surprised that some folks who
drive buses actually explore the wet weather limits of the tires.  Bus
tires are small and heavily loaded, so they should be less prone to
hydroplane than the wider and lightly-loaded tires of other cars.

I guess I'm just getting old!  :)
