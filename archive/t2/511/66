Jason,

If you are going to go Michelin (which I think is the right choice) go all
the way and spend extra for the $104 each for Michilin Agilis. I've had
them for two years and they are superb. They are 185/14R as factory
presribed. 

I went to the Tirerack web site and swiped a few of the reviews, reprinted
below. You can go there and read all. I will concur that the only fault
they seem to have is higher road noise, but, hey, with our busses ... more
noise?

These are the tires that are engineered for our tall, heavy, narrow busses.

Cheers.

Arathorn

I am looking for another set of these now that my OE Agilis are approaching
50K miles. There is really nothing else that does the job for these vans.
Dont even consider a non-reinforced tire for the Eurovan. I had a set of
non "C" rated BF Goodrich tires on my previous 1993 Eurovan and found them
to be unstable in hard cornering. Last summer, with over 40K on my Agilis,
I had to swerve hard to avoid a car that ran a stop sign. Even with this
tall, heavy van, I had good control at about 50 mph and was able to avoid
an accident. Snow traction was excellent for the first 35K, but is now to
the point where performance has noticeably decreased. Overall, treadwear
has exceeded my expectations for the Eurovan.

THERE IS NO BETTER TIRE for the Eurovan~! NONE! These C-Rated tires are far
superior to the OEMs. The first replacement set came at 32,000 miles and i
made the mistake of buying bridgestones as i was on summer vacation and had
limited choices. After driving these 100 miles, i was shocked at the
differnce. My wife, to my amazement, commented about how much better the
Van drove, "night and day" as she said. An amazing tire, and im another set
now with new wheels just in case these are discountinued for some less than
sane reason. These should have been the OEM tire from the start, perhaps on
the new microbus. A+++ HIGHLY REC!
