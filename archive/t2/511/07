Greg,

I know it's probably too late at this point, but I *highly* recomend
a ground cable like the new cars use..."lead free".

I have started replacing every ground and positive cable on every VW that 
I own with the new style...clamps better, fits better, runs better.

Both the positive and negative cables of this sort seem to work soooo much 
better, that it is amazing.

Give it a try...


Cheers, dave
