Subject: early bay doors on late bay?

Hello esteemed listees,
will early Bay doors fit directly onto my late bay without hassle?  I'm
referring to all doors, the drivers and passenger, slider and rear hatch.  I
know that the driver/pax doors have a slightly different door lock mechanism
between early and late models but would this be a problem?

Thanks!
