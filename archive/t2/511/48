Subject: Monsoon Car Covers

I just bought a pair of car covers for the Super Beetle Convertible and my 
'71 7 passenger deluxe. I have a couple of questions:

1) Is the bus cover supposed to be this tight? It is stretched tight 
against the bus from top to bottom. The only place it is a little loose is 
around the rain gutter. It is pulled tight against the mirrors, the wiper 
pivots and the bumpers. To get into the sliding door I have to wiggle the 
cover up a tiny bit at a time from all 4 corners to get to the handle. 
There are no pockets for the mirrors, so I had to fold them back against 
the body. Plus, what am I supposed to do about the antenna. I collapsed it 
all the way down, and it fit, but it is also straining against the cloth. 
If this is correct, I will prob. glue another layer of material inside 
where the sharp wiper pivots press against the material.

It would have been nice if it had another 3 or 4 inches of material around 
the bottom as well, it barely covered the bumpers. Barely. I doubt they 
will stay covered.

2) The beetle cover fit much more loosely, more like the RM Motorworks 
cover that it is replacing. But, I thought it kind of cheap to have only 
one rear view mirror pocket on a Super Beetle cover.
