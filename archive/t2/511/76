Subject: Re: [T2] starter motor troubles -update

Looks like the problem is gone. I replaced the starter motor and 
solenoid with a spare and the bus starts up just fine. Most of the
suggestions were that it was probably a weak solenoid, which makes
perfect sense now. I did cleanup my electrical connections just a
few months prior so there was not much corrosion buildup to clean
off. I also went ahead and tested out the 'bad' solenoid with a
pair of jumper cables and it seems to work...  Also I did want to
mention that a dremel works great for cleaning up electrical
connections. I used the small wire brush attachment to clean up
the starter connections, etc. Sure works well and saves a lot of
 time.

Thanks for the help
Alex
