What regular maintenance needs to be done on the points to heep them
healthy.He said they dried out from the heat.

A white bus parked in a gas station lot off of I-5?
A fellow in a green Westy helped you?

That was probably me......on my way home to Fresno.

I don't remember saying the heat got to them. Your problem was the rubbing block was dry and it wore down,
closing the points. You need to keep the rubbing block lubed with point grease. And at the same time, remove
the rotor and put a few drops of oil in the center of the distributor shaft.
