when in college some guys took two splitty buses and cut em in half, one
behind the front wheels and the other in front of the rear wheels
they welded the two long halfs together (and the two short halfs too) 

it was a bus with 4 doors on the side, looked strange and with only a 40hp
motor it didn't have much get up and go, but it handled reasonably well
and last I saw of it, many years ago, it was still running. may even have
a photo "somewhere"

unfortunatly the short halfs didn't work out quite so well, could hardly
steer the thing the wheelbase was so short, don't think they ever drove it
over about 5mph.
