Subject: Re: [T2] Advice needed, towing my bus

Thanks for the tips, everyone.  Much as I like the idea of flatbed
trailering the Bus, I've scoped things out and there literally isn't
anyplace within 1/2 mile to turn it around, even disconnected.  I
don't have a towbar, don't have time to get a towbar, and since I'm
renting a moving van at the same time anyway .. might as well, its
cheap enough and it'll keep them happy.

It looks like the plan is:  Pull the CV axle I just reinstalled, tow
bus on the dolly by the back wheels (front on the ground) downhill
for a half-mile where there's space.  Drop bus from dolly, turn bus
around, reload bus (rear on ground), hit the highway.

Fun fun fun.
