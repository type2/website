Subject: Early bay front emblem?

One of the fine students at my school apparently took a fancy to my front
emblem and it's probably hanging around his neck on a chain by now.

Anyone have a chrome 10 inch emblem for an early bay they'd like to sell
or trade?  I have an original painted splitty emblem if you'd like to
trade.
