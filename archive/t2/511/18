side windows and a guard to keep luggage from hitting the passengers:

Very strange is that the brochure is dated 1970 and the yellow/white bus on page 1 has 68 doors with 69 and up
outer door handles. It is the only one in all the pics with the lock knob on top of the sill [68 only and 75?
and up]. 69 to 74? had the lock lever above the inner handle.

I want the rear seat bars.....
