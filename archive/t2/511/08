Can someone shed some light on the application of the jailbars?  I saw 
some on an older bus once ... beads were hung off them, being sold 
(Phish show parking lot :-), but I don't imagine that was the intended 
use ... I've never seen a German engineer selling hippie beads :-)

On a slightly different subject... are those factory-installed 
retractable seat belts I see in that photo?  I wonder where they 
mounted the reel.  Also, it seems as if they use the same swivel-loop 
at the top as the Vanagon used, with a stand-off to get it past the lip 
on the door post (which is what I did, but some people sent me mail 
concerned about the torque placed on the bolt that holds the swivel.  I 
ended up leaving the stand-off in place, rather than cutting the lip on 
the door post).
