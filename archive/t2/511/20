Subject: Yes , That was you

Yes it was us, I just wrote what I could remember, And I simplified the story 
by saying I broke down on the freeway instead of a gas station,  my wife was 
with me.
Being a recent Volkswagen bus owner I`m trying to learn as much as I can to 
keep my bus up and running.
I must say again ,    Thank You Very Much,   If you didn`t come by, we would 
have been stranded.
          Sincerely
Vincent & Teresa Moreno
