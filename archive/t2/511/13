Subject: points,Maintenance ?

I have a 1971 bus. I broke down on the freeway once and I was lucky that a 
fellow volkswagen bus owner stoped to help. He said it was the points and after 
five minutes I was on my way.
What regular maintenance needs to be done on the points to heep them 
healthy.He said they dried out from the heat. 
Any advice will be appreciated.
Thank You Very Much
