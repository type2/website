Subject: AMP meter and shunt

Hello.  I recently bought a 4 amp meter that has these instructions:

" Westinghouse panel meter manufactured for RCA with a range of 4 amps DC. 
Please note that a .25 ohm (-at-) 5 watt meter shunt is required. The basic 
movement of this meter is 1 MA. "

I understand that if I go to Radio Shack and get a .25 ohm (-at-) 5 watt meter 
shunt, I can get the meter to read on a 4 amp scale.

However, I would prefer to have the meter read on a 1 amp scale.  What size 
shunt should I install to get a one amp reading?

I want to track down some minor power drain on my bus
