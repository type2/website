Has anybody ever lengthened a Bus? Preferably a camper. I don't mean

lengthened to limo standards, but adding two or three feet to the passenger

compartment. I can't help thinking that would make it 'campier'.


Just a stray thought; flame suit on.

BTW, most of the limos you see are not really over the road vehicles...
They're stretched by custom body shops without much thought to
handling or longevity since most of them only get short term urban
use...
Haven't seen any stretched type 2's, but I've seen photos of at least 
one that was shortened...The idea of even more side area for wind
buffeting is scary tho'... ;-(
