Hi Folks,

Thanks for the responses about the tires.  Despite the higher price, I'm 
probably going to go with the Michelins.  A friend of mine had them on his 
'71 Westy, and they performed very well.  I'll probably go with the puncture 
protection, though, since I'd hate to have to replace them at $90 a tire 
(www.tirerack.com).

Thanks again!
