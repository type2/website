Doh! Forgot the important stuff again.

The grease is relatively hard to find. I have a devil of a time locating it at the local parts store. Eventually I found a NAPA and they gave me a small capsule of point grease the size of a pill from an old stash. We never found the part number in their catalogs.

The alternative, if you still want to use the correct stuff, is to buy a lifetime supply in a large tube from Bosch. Bus Depot carries it, as well as Gene Berg and Pelican Parts (which has the best price). Pelican's description states, "This specially formulated grease won't interfere with your ignition spark, or catch on fire inside your distributor. Bosch distributor grease will also not putrefy with age and exposure to the high electrical charges inside your distributor. One tube is a lifetime supply".

The Bosch part number is 5 700 002 005.
