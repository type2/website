Subject: Camper parts

I met a gentleman in Ballard today who has a bunch of parts from a camper
and he would like to know if anyone is interested in having them...for free.
I saw a toilet, a propane heater, and a large fridge that looked like it
could be powered three ways.

If you are interested, give Grant Morris a call at 206-784-9822.

Enjoy,
Sluggo
