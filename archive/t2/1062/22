It was sort of a moot issue with the original fan motor shot.  I'm working
on a design for the blocking plate that will facilitate the air movement.  I
just have to make sure that the spin of the guides on the plate match the
direction of the air passing over it.

If the Attwood fan isn't powerful enough, I'll try another one.  It's just
that the Attwood fan fit the shroud perfectly, as well as fit the mounting
bracket in the bus.  I had to cut two little holes for the mounting bits and
it went right together.
