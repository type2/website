Greg, my replacement bulbs for my 1157's and 1156's plug directly into the bulb holder on my motorcycle (which I've got them in, although it is the same setup as a Bay tailight, just sideways). They sit perfectly where they should for fresnel lenses. I've attached a link to a similar type I'm using, which have all around LED's, not just facing backwards. They work VERY well for my running light/brake light on my bike.

========================================================

 If the the light source is not 
 located 
at the focal point of this lens, the resulting light will be far 
 too 
 dark. For that reason I would NOT recommend an LED replacement 
 for the 
original 1157 bulb.
