I have some sort of kit from the 60's that did just this for the early
beetles..  I should get it out and scan the instructions...

My 74, type 4, 2liter engine with stock heating will raise the temps from
outside ambient of ~15 degF to about 70 degF at the ashtray.. <that is where
my temp gauge sits> mind you,, I have to be driving at high rpm for a
constant time.. not stop and go traffic or around town driving..  of course
it won't  heat the rear cabin ,, cargo area to much more than cold... from
stone cold..

Hey Tony...  on the other hand,,My airconditioning is working a little
tooooo much right now...  do you have a fix for that!
