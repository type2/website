Yeah, it's nice that it fits, but the angle is just kinda odd.  Seems 
like the direction of the air entering the fan housing is going to cause 
a bunch of resistance and lose whatever benefit you might be gaining.  
Don't get me wrong - I'm all for experimentation, I'm just wondering if 
the impeller design of the original fan is going to provide more CFM.  
That said, you might end up spending more money on more powerful fans 
that don't provide as many CFM when another blower can be had for $55.  
I played around with a bunch of stuff and every time I still came back 
to keeping the stock fan.  I've been tempted to put something inline 
with the main pipe, but I don't want to be sucking air from the heat 
exchangers faster than it's being supplied running the risk of sucking 
in exhaust fumes.  Plus it would probably melt ;)

Also, make sure you have the little flaps in place in the blower fan 
housing so you're not pumping hot air into the engine compartment when 
the fan is off...

good luck!
