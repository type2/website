That's pretty much how the factory did it on the air cooled Vanagons. If you
think about it, what you want to do will improve the engine cooling, in a very
slight way. Currently you are taking a little of the high pressure air in the
engine compartment and routing it into the cabin, via the heater. This robs
the engine of a small amount of cooling air. By recirculating the cabin air
through the heater, you are now dedicating every cubic foot of cooling air
that comes into the vents on the side of your bus to cooling the engine.

  the cooling of the engine... ?-(?
