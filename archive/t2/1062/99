Yes, the plastic strips can be softened very quickly in even hot tap water.
But they re-harden almost as quickly, not usable for re-installation of the
canvas.

I took all four plastic strips and heated them in the deep sink and rolled
them into four belt-type rolls.  They now fit into a small plastic 1/2 qt
container.

Easier to throw out!  (I did remember to drill two holes through the rubber
strips I made and installed last night.  The front brace needs a bolt to go
from the outside, through the fiberglass pop top and rubber/plastic trim and
canvas.)
