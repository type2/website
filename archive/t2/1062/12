I took my fan out (the bearings were wallowed out) and modified the fan
motor mounting plate to accept a 3" bilge fan.  I still need to create a
plate to cover up the hole on the other side of the fan housing.

My plan was to route a duct that came out in the spare well to recirculate
the warm air just like you described.
