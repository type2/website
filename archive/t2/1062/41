Subject: New Door Seal In and ......

I replaced my passenger door seal ( from WCM) - got it in as good as I
could- now the door takes a little effort to close it - also the door sticks
out about an 1/8 of an inch at the corner at the top of the dogleg where the
seat belt is mounted. 

 

Do I need to adjust the door to close better or will (in time) the seals
conform better? 

Thanks

Trey
