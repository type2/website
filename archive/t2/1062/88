Subject: Lube for cables??

What are recommendations for lubricant for my parking brake cables?

What are people using for throttle cable lube?

And I suppose that the clutch cable lube would be the same as the brake cable lube?

Just kinda want to know what others are using and if you have a specific reason for using it. Thanks.
