I think since the day it was invented 10 years or so ago that Prestone's
yellow de-icer windshield washer stuff is the utter best product known to man
for air cooled VW's.  A total FWIW.  In AK I'm using it in everything, even my
big ole Suburban that has enough heat to kill you in the winter.  I hate
Rain-X products myself and although their windshield stuff isn't as bad as
regular Rain-X I agree it still makes for smearing, my wife got a gallon of it
and put it in her Rav4, I hate it.  People either love or hate Rain-X in
general.  I tolerated it on my TR-4A last summer because the wiper motor was
dead until I got around to rewinding it, but I scrubbed it off the second I
got the wipers working.
 
Oh to the original post, did WA not use salt routinely, sounds like salt spray
to me, but maybe they are using something else as well?

Having said that, I find the Rain-X De-Icer DOES make for more smearing. My
wife
hates it in her Mazda 3, and only uses the non Rain-X washer fluid. HTH.
