Tim, I am glad to hear that you are well enough to attack the bus again!!

For me, I am on the uphill climb on the '78 Westy.  And just like you, it
seems to be two steps forward and one step back.

Finally, I am going to attach the pop-top tent (new) to the fiberglass top.
The top is in my garage, upside down, on the wife's side.  The top has been
painted and cleaned, no small feat, and the new canvas is spot
tacked/stapled to the inside of the pop-top to get it into position to
finish it off with the plastic strips.

Well, I was planning to use the original plastic strips that I took off the
VW two years ago.  Not so fast! They have SHRUNK since I took them off, at
least 4 inches on the smaller  (4 ft) sides, and about the same on the
longer (8 ft) sides.  And my power stapler only had 3/8" staples, which,
after looking at a staple as it was pushed JUST through one of the plastic
strips, there didn't seem to be much of a bite left for the canvas and the
frame.  And it was very difficult to get the 3/8" staple flush when I did
try to staple through the plastic strip, canvas, and into the frame.

So I went off to find some 9/16" staples, the longest my small electric
staple gun could handle, and something I could use in place of the original
plastic strips, which are aged-solid and very hard to staple through.

Success on both parts!  I bought two heavy duty rubber stair threads ($2.96
each (-at-) Home Depot), 4 ft long and the same thickness as the plastic strips.
Now I am going to cut some 4 ft strips to the size of the 4 and 8 ft
originals.  This should be easy with my recently purchased, official carpet
& rug 'box cutter'.  I can get 10 pieces from the two step threads and I
only need six pieces

BTW, I tried to stretch one of the original plastic strip by heating it and
pulling it out to a full 4 ft and securing the ends on a 2X4 until it cooled
to settle in at the 4 ft size.  That worked for the first 4 ft strip I
tried, but it was so tedious I gave up on the idea for the other three
plastic strips.  If I didn't find a replacement, my plan was to cut the
original 4 ft and 8 ft plastic strips into three pieces each so I could get
to the corners with the strips, and then have a pair of 2" gaps on each
plastic strip, each around 1/3 of the way on the strips.  I guess you can
imagine.  And then just heat the strips to get then flat / straight, since
they were stored in rolled up coils. (If I heat the plastic strips with my
heat gun, they will become VERY soft and rubbery, but that condition only
lasts less than 30 seconds.  I had to heat the 4 ft original plastic strip a
section at a time, and continuously pull the original plastic strip to get
the 4 inches shrinkage back on an even basis.  I guess I could have put the
original plastic strips in very hot water and pulled them to size.)

Tim, you probably will not need to clean the flock on your ''69's pop-top,
because I think you have none.  But I found an excellent treatment for the
mildew that accumulated on my pop-top as it sat outside on the deck for 2
years.  It looks like new, and there is no loose rain of dried flock
particles ready to come down on the passengers.

And I still have the pair of rear bumper brackets and splash plates from an
early bay that you can have, if you can get someone to pick them up before I
lose track of them.  I got them free from Jay Ollom in Maryland, so they are
free to you.
