I was planning on doing this.  I bought a duct to put just behind the 
cabinet in the rear-left corner of the bus - that useless space.  
Doesn't really need to be high-temp hose either because the air being 
sucked through is warm at best.  I was going to improve on your idea by 
adding another bilge blower fan to suck more air and force it into the 
stock bus fan for even more airflow - I just haven't gotten around to 
doing it.

That said, after I got all my heater stuff in tip-top shape, the air 
coming out of the front vents is so hot that it will burn your hands if 
you hold them there too long.  I changed all of the ducting from the 
rear to front and wrapped everything I could in that foil-covered bubble 
wrap.  I also got rid of the mid-bus junction box as I don't really ever 
need to heat the back of the bus and that helped out a lot.
