Subject: Deluxe trim

Hello.

I tried to find anything related to this subject on the archives, but I found
nothing, so here it goes:

Is there any difference between a 68 - 71 Deluxe Belt line Trim and a 72-79?
At www2.cip1.com they sell two:

VWC-241-898-111-B - DELUXE 72-79 BUS MOLDING KIT
and,
VWC-241-898-111-A - DELUXE 68-71 BUS MOLDING KIT

Can anyone tell me where's the difference between them?
Thanks.

Cheers,
Joao
