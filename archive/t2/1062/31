It occured to me that there is a big difference between the stock fan (a  
squirrel cage blower type) and the bilge blower fans (axial type).  I think  the 
static pressure capability (ability of the fan to develop pressure when it  is 
dead-headed with no flow) of the stock fan is much higher than that of the  
bilge blowers.  If I got this right, the bilge blowers are really designed  to 
discharge to atmoshperic pressure, and are not intended to push the  air 
through a bunch of ductwork.  Squirrel cage blowers typically have  much higher 
static pressure capability - that being determined largely by the  airspeed of 
the fan wheel "slats" - which is what you need to move air  through the 
resistance of the ductwork.  That's why I think, all else being  equal, the stock fan 
is better suited to the job.
