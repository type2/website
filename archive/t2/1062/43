If you are really trying to get good heat up front, I'd get another 
impeller fan instead of the attwood fan ($55 for a stock fan from 
thesamba).  My guess is that you'll be pretty disappointed with it's 
performance.  Granted, most of the airflow is due to the main engine 
fan.  The other thing is making sure all of the ducting is in top 
shape.  Replace all the paper stuff and wrap it with insulation and the 
air will be too hot to hold your hand in front of the vent.  Also, if 
you're not routing air to the back of the bus, remove the junction and 
put a reduction duct in its place - that helps out a lot.

I'd be surprised if you get much airflow from the attwood fan, 
especially from that angle, but let us know how it works.
