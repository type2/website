Hi Jason,

The VERIFIABLE accounts that I have read all required the use of 
high-test fuel to get the MPG benefit. But then no-one (that I have 
seen) tested the results of changing to high-test by itself as a control.

Acetone will absorb water and it can damage your fuel system. It also 
costs about 4X what gasoline does.

I wouldn't bother.

Happy Trails,
