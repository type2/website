I'm against attachments on an e-mail list, it's so easy to up load a 
photo to a site and pass the URL to anyone who is interested, when I 
was on dial up photos took forever to load.
Attachments on an e-mail list are not a good idea IMO.

Is there any way for the individual to turn them off? Do they still 
come thru if you are in digest?
