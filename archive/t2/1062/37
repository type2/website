Hi Volks,

While working on my westrailer project, I discovered an interesting fact 
about the 72-79 bus tail-light lens, which is quite important if you are 
planning to mount an LED bulb.

In my work fitting bus turn signals onto the westrailer I discovered 
that the late-bay turn signal lens integrates a fresnel lens in the 
brake and turn signal segments. If the the light source is not located 
at the focal point of this lens, the resulting light will be far too 
dark. For that reason I would NOT recommend an LED replacement for the 
original 1157 bulb.

I've seen Access Bob's solution, it avoids this problem by surface 
mounting the LED's on the outside of the lens, and it's quite effective.

Happy Trails,
