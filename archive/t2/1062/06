So I'm sure that this question will immediately cause a HUGE explosion of
"Don't do its" and "don't be stupids", but here it goes:

I have read a few pros and cons of adding an ounce of acetone to ta full
tank of gas to increase vaporization and gas mileage. I know that acetone
dries out rubber and what not, but I just can't help wonder how harmful it
is when it is so heavily diluted.

Anyone actually done it? There seems to be a sizable amount of people that
swear by it.

Now I run and wait for answers from afar...
