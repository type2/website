Trim and upholstery shops have a method for fixing cracked dashes. I 
have seen before and after examples and a good repair is hard to see.

Unfortunately I do not know how they do it. I say this just to give you 
hope for your dash issues.

Anyone reproducing these dashes yet? Maybe some company would like to 
get into the business???
