if you re-circ that air..  and it does get up to 80 deg F .. at that point,,
you will probably turn off the re-circ fan anyway

?????????? Actually, I sorta did this before...With a 71 and an upright engine...I capped off the doghouse (so the
?????????? engine fan only cooled the engine) and mounted a three speed fan IN the spare tire well and ducted
?????????? interior air thru' the heat exchangers...Once the engine got warm the Bus got warm, even hot enough
?????????? to melt ice on the outside of the windshield with no scraping...;-)
