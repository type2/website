My first use of rain-x did cause the water to bead but I found that  
before the heavy beading that would cause the water to run, the  
beading would start out as a fine mist. This would require me to  
increase the rate of the wipers (wife's car) in order to maintain  
visibility negating the usefulness of the product.
