Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield smearing in snow driving???

I find I really have to wash my wiper blades down with a cloth dipped in 
methyl hydrate. I suspect ammonia based stuff like Windex might work too. In 
any case, the buildup on my wipers always makes them smear. A good wipe down 
always helps. Having said that, I find the Rain-X De-Icer DOES make for more 
smearing. My wife hates it in her Mazda 3, and only uses the non Rain-X 
washer fluid. HTH.
