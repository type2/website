Subject: 1978 Westy Project or Parts $400 in Grand Rapids, MI

Hello Bus Pilots,

Just wanted to spread the word incase anyone in the Grand Rapids, MI area is
looking for a project or parts bus. I know where there is a 1978 Westy for
$400. I know the guy that owns it and he called me wondering if I knew of
anyone looking for one. The body is a  4 out of 10 and the interior is a 2
out of 10. Poptop is there but canvas needs to be replaced. Floor boards are
not rusted through. Door track is intact. It has rust around the wheel
wells. Looks like prior body work rusting through. Westy interior is gone
and replaced with a home made futon apparatus. Would make a great first time
bus for someone that didnt have much money to put into a bus.

If you are interested you can call Clarence Birch on his cell phone at
616-308-6629.

Wishing you many miles of smiles in your bus!

Todd Olson

Grand Rapids, MI
