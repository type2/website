Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield smearing in snow driving??? 

I found Rain-X to almost work, but if you use wipers
on a windshield coated with Rain-X the wipers stutter
like the surface was sticky of something.  I swore
off the stuff.

Anyone done enough experimentation to have a "best buy"
for wiper blades themselves?
