Would spreading the LED's out in a little mound cause the light to 
spread out a little too?

My replacement tailights have a black plastic housing. Plan on at least 
painting them silver. Maybe I could use aluminum foil like gold leaf and 
"coat" the areas around the bulbs.

I'd love to have LED lights though. I really like the "instant on". Take 
it one step forward and have the lights begin to rapidly flash during 
hard stops.

I think good lighting is a very important part of the safety equation 
even if some automakers insist one bulb tripling as turn signal, brake 
light and taillight is good enough.
