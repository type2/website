I bought LED taillights fromB superbrightleds.com a few years ago and
ran with them for about a week before removing them and putting them
in a small drawer nextB to my workbench, where they have been ever
since.B  They were indeed bright but were too focused and could not be
seen well from the sides.B  Not worth compromising my safety over a
few watts.B  Maybe they have improved since then?
