It spins at 1/2 the speed of the crankshaft as there are 720 degrees of 
crankshaft rotation for one complete engine cycle.  The other way to 
think about it is how many times the piston has to make a stroke to 
until it fires again - 4 times (4stroke).  Up to compress, down firing, 
up exhaust out, down sucking in fuel, and we're back to up to compress - 
by that time, the rotor is back where it started.
