I've had less than desirable results with the RainX blades.  They  
don't seem to handle the curves on the ends of the bay windshield very  
well after a month or so.  I'd be ok with just an inch or two being  
missed, but it was larger than.  I've stuck with wipers that have the  
external skeleton structure to them.
