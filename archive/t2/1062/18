on which one of NZ's top engineering profs comments:

An electric car needs about 150- 250 Wh/km
A typical lead-acid battery holds about 40-50 Wh/kg
This makes about 3-6kg/km
So 875 mi  - 1400km - the range alleged in the 'history' item  - 
would take upwards of 3600 kg.
  In THAT van?

I'm just off to the beach for a swim.  I tested the allegation that 
T2 List now accepts attachments will be hereby tested by my attaching

a boomerang:

<type2(-at-)type2.com>:
ezmlm-reject: fatal: Sorry, I don't accept messages of MIME

so I can't brag about our sunny seaside swimhaven    ;-)
