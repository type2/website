So are you replacing the moter with the attwood fan?  I don't think that 
would be very efficient because the thrust direction is going to go 
against a plate and then have to disperse sideways.  I have one of those 
fans and they aren't the most powerful, either.  That stock fan seems to 
put out more CFM than the attwood blower...
