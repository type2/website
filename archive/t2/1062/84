as soon as it stops raining I will go out and take a few photos of my
taillights.  I have not used a new bulb but rather an entire assembly
in my taillight housing.

I think it works pretty good.

I currently don't have any place to post the photos but could send
them to anyone who wanted to see them or if someone wanted to post
them for me.
