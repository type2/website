	Neithammer is correct.


	This diagram is surprisingly little known:-

	In attempt to prevent 'reject reject  -  too much copied 
material' I waffle on somewhat, to increase the ratio 'new/copied'.
	An axial fan gives the max flow rate (for a given shaft hp) 
-  but only if it's not up against serious drag in the inlet or 
outlet ducting.  Among the quietest and cheapest are those out of 
junked computer terminals  -  very carefully made as quiet as 
possible for people to work on top of them for hours  - 
motor-in-hub, compound-curve blades, some 12V but most 110V or 220V, 
a few dollars from retailers who buy up batches.
	A centrifugal fan (same codicil) can't generate nearly as 
much flow rate, even when unimpeded; but it can overcome 
back-pressure far better than an axial and keep some flow going when 
the axial is more or less stalled by resistance.
	BTW these principles were evidently not well understood by 
Whittle, developer of the first British jet engines, whereas die 
Krdute went straight to the axial compressor which became standard 
within a decade.  Similarly, Hamilton who invented the jet boat kept 
trying centrifugal pumps, while his friend Prof F M Henderson kept 
trying to explain the above graphs to him.  In the end Henderson had 
to make the first axial-pump jet boat to convince Hamilton (who then 
did at last understand, and went on to make multi-stage axial 
versions which still rule the world of jet boat propulsion).
