Subject: So I shot myself in the foot...

Driving to work this morning the alt / batt light came on. I couldn't help
thinking how stuff keeps on coming! I pull over and wiggle some wires, batt
cables, etc. Light goes away. Continue on and the light comes back on. This
time I was more deliberate. Wiggle a wire, check the light. Wiggle a wire,
check the light. It was the battery cables! I somehow managed to NOT clamp
them down very tight, or they came loose (yeah, that's the ticket! They came
loose all on their own!) and they oxidized or something in there.

Sigh.

Off to Wallyworld for terminal cleaner and a wrench to tighten the silly
things down.
