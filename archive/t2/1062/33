I believe the biggest difference is in the Rear Hatch door width - it's a
bit wider on 72-79 models, so the appropriate trim piece is a bit longer.
That's also the reason for there being two different Rear Hatch Seals -
64-71 and 72-79.  I'll have to verify this with a friend over theweekend who
owns both a 76 and 71, just to be safe.
