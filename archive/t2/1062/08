Hi Tony.

I am thinking,,, <dangerous eh?>  The temps inside your bus in the SUMMER
are say 80 DegF and that air gets circulated thru the heater boxes...

now.. in the WINTER,, or lets say cold weather... the temps inside your bus
is about.... ah,, I dunno,, stone cold.. or at least COLD... like  65
degF...

if you re-circ that air..  and it does get up to 80 deg F .. at that point,,
you will probably turn off the re-circ fan anyway

If you run a CHT gauge, you will know right away if the engine is getting
hot.

Hope that helps
Happy New YEAR!
