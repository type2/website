Subject: T2] Windshield smearing in snow driving???

I have gone for over three years on the same set of wiper blades.

Here's what I do. I use a piece of 2000 grit wet/dry sandpaper to clean 
the edge of the blade. Get the blade wet, then simply "sharpen" it 
again! Since it's the narrowest part of the rubber, it oxidizes faster 
than the rest of the blade, and develops tiny cracks and irregularities. 
There may be a few streaks at first as the windshield itself can have 
impurities on the surface, but after a few minutes of good, heavy rain, 
the blades work like new! Of course, snow may give a different result...
