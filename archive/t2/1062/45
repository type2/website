Subject: Windshield smearing in snow driving???

I have noticed that my windshield has been getting smeared with something that does NOT clean off. At first I thought it was my de-icer windshield washer fluid by Rain-X, so I switched brands, fully flushing the tank in between. I have never had this problem before this winter. I also have never noticed my bus "turning white" from road spray in previous years. Can it be that the WA DOT is using a de-icer in really massive quantities and that salt water is smearing my windshield? This stuff looks just like when I spend a week at the ocean beach and have to use a good amonia-based glass cleaner to clean the side windows and mirrors. The windshield washer seems to cut it - it just takes so darned much of it - and then the pressure in the tank drops!

Anybody recognize it from areas that have traditionally used salt? I am about to install a motor driven washer pump and maybe a bigger reservoir!
