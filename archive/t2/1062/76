It's one of two problems since the factory seals allowed the doors to  
close more easily that new seals seem to:

- the seal is misshapen
- the interior is so air tight the escaping air is fighting the  
closing door
- both

In time you'll figure out what is to blame.

If Bus Depot is still selling "GVWG" front doors seals, I would  
always spend the little extra for those.
