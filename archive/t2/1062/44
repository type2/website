I played with a very large 12V squirrel cage fan fro WW Grainger, played with a bilge blower from West Marine and finally found a stock fan and it worked best of all (tho not very well!) Bought an Espar and set it up with a remote so I could start the heater from my living room window a half-hour before time to leave for work. By then, if it was 15 degrees ambient, the bus was t-shirt toastey! Since converting to the Subey, have not yet re-installed the Espar but will eventually.

I think Robert hit the nail on the head - multi-stage axial fans should do it. Something like three bilge blowers in line a few feet apart, maybe. Something like first, a 3" stock, 2nd, a 3" with cupped blades and third, a 4" model. Of course the amp draw and the noise would be prohobitive!

Perhaps a small jet engine?

 Whittle, developer of the first British jet engines,
 whereas die 
 Krdute went straight to the axial compressor which became
 standard 
 within a decade.  Similarly, Hamilton who invented the jet
 boat kept 
 trying centrifugal pumps, while his friend Prof F M
 Henderson kept 
 trying to explain the above graphs to him.  In the end
 Henderson had 
 to make the first axial-pump jet boat to convince Hamilton
 (who then 
 did at last understand, and went on to make multi-stage
 axial 
 versions which still rule the world of jet boat
 propulsion).
