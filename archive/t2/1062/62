My original door seals lasted 30 years.  I replaced them after 35 years with the 'best' seals from Bus Depot.

The front doors were like yours.  Hard to close and slightly proud of the
door jamb by the door handle.  After a few months this went away.  No need
to adjust the door in my case.  Give it some time/use and the new seals
will settle in.
