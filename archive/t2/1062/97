Subject: plastic strips

I've had good luck reusing the plastic strips that hold the tent to the pop
top even though they've shrunk.
If you can coil them up enough to get them into a pot of boiling water you'll
be all set.  Boil them for a while and then stretch
each piece to the desired length.  Make sure to hold them at that length while
they cool.
