Yep, those are the kind of strips I was talking about.

However, look at the ad, particularly these points:

What is Tack Strip?
 and then stapled in place. While you can certainly re-use the original tack
strip, it looks much nicer to replace it with new tack strip so you do not
end up with old staple holes showing.

***  What means 'looks much nicer'?  When the top is up, you don't see the
tack strips.  Or I REALLY screwed up!!! Barry

Install tip:
Our aftermarket tack strip is not identical to the original, but it is very
close and works nicely.

It is a little more brittle than the original, so

*** Hey, they can't be more brittle (OK, I mean HARDER) than the original.
I doubt I would get my 9/16" staples through the original.  It was hard
enough going thru the rubber strips I used/made up.  Barry


 if you are using a pneumatic stapler, be sure to turn the pressure down to
avoid cracks as the staple penetrates it. Staple size is also very
important. Take one of the original staples and match is as closely as you
can at your local hardware store.

*** What, do you think you are going to get a large choice in staples?!?!!?



Sold in a 30 foot roll. This length is sufficient to install one tent.

***  I only needed 24 feet.  Barry
