I think it could have worked if the LEDs had not all been mounted in the 
same plane.

That ought to work, but be sure to aim some of the LEDs to the side or 
you will have the same problem that I did.

Personally I am waiting for the double-superDOOPERbrightLEDs like the 
ones they have on cop cars to become available.  A few of those in a 
spray pattern ought to make an acceptable substitute for a stock bulb.
