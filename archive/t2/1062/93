Subject: Heater box tin questions

I put earlier style heater boxes on my '77 2L project bus to eliminate the troublesome later style exhaust.
I got only the heater boxes from the earlier engine, and?I? need the tubes to complete the heating system.? Most of what was original on the '77 was junk.
What years of tubes will work between my '72-'74 heater boxes and the heater control boxes (flappers)?
I also need the short metal tube that goes on the passenger side, at the rear of the engine, that goes between the heater box and the ducting from the electric heater booster fan.? Needs to be round on the heater box end, and sort of squared off/oval shaped at the upper end.? (the one that I have from the '77 is sort of squared off/oval at both ends)
The last piece I need is also from the fan end of the passenger side heater box.? I need the small piece that covers the top of the seam where the heater box attaches to the fan shrouding, right above where the flapper is.? It is pretty square with 2 captive nuts, about 3 1/2" x 1 1/2" or so.? Is this piece specific L & R, and what years will work?
I don't have anything else here to compare to, so any help would be appreciated.? Once I know what need I can start trying to find it.
Thanks,
