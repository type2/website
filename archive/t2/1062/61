Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield smearing in snow driving???

I actually LIKE using the RainX liquid on my windshield. It really does make the rain bead up, and I almost never have to put my wipers on. In fact, my wiper motor went out about 2 yrs ago, and for about 2 months, the RainX was good enough without even having wipers. :-) Just apply it like it says. I actually put two coats on, and it lasts almost half a year. And that's up here in the PNW!
