I'll bet my fortune you are running into Magnesium Chloride, "the  
other white salt". It dries quickly and smears. It won't wash off  
without a large amount of washer fluid. I have tried almost every  
brand, and the "mag chloride" just requires a lot of liquid to clean  
it off.

When I was driving my 70' DC, I hooked up a hose to a gallon jug of  
cleaner and used an off the shelf washer pump. It looked pretty  
sketchy, but it was the only way to keep the huge Type 2 window clear.  
The stuff also destroys the metal on buses, etches aluminum wheels and  
kills chrome. Hose it off as soon as you can!
