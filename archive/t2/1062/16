Tony goes to say, and old, old, old idea, long discussed and done.  I did it
my first time 15+ years ago, and we've posted about it many times.  It is a
FANtastic idea, pun intended.  Doesn't need to be high temp actually, regular
paper or low temp parts store hose fine.  It is hard to get it to stay on the
fan, the lip is very small.  I siliconed it out of the car and used a narrow
VW style hose clamp off of something laying around.  For the interior bit I
used a bus "eyeball" dash vent with the flapper popped out.  I was driving a
'78 Westy about 50 miles each way to work through western MD over Keyser Ridge
every day one winter.  It made things somewhat tolerable.  For a Westy putting
2-3 inches of foam up into the hole in the roof is a must as well.  Do realize
though that at cruising speed more than half the air is coming from the engine
cooling fan certainly, probably much more, BUT whatever you can recirculate
helps.  And at idle/in
 traffic the electric fan is probably the bulk of your air movement.  Do the
standard things of course like check all joints, and just hard wire your
flapper boxes open for winter if the cables are stretched.

Just a thought...I was lookin' at the fan hangin' in the engine
compartment (79 Bus) and the thought struck me...
