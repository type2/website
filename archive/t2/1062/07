Subject: Heat (it's 15 F.out...;-(

Just a thought...I was lookin' at the fan hangin' in the engine compartment (79 Bus) and the thought struck me...
What if I ran a length of hi-temp hose from the intake of the fan thru' a hole in the spare tire well (spare's on the
nose of the Bus) to recirculate some air from inside the Bus thru' the heat exchangers...In theory this would allow
some air to be reheated again and again (like using an AC on recirculate)...My question is...Would this compromise
the cooling of the engine... ?-(?
