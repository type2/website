Subject: No fuel on really cold start

When I don't run my bus for a few days or more it becomes very hard to
start.  I am most certain that it's not getting enough fuel to get it
going.  After about a dozen cranks and extra heavy juicing of the gas pedal
it events roars to life.  Can someone please tell me what the problem is?
Note:  Once it gets going it runs great and will re-start first try, over
and over again - even 24 or 48 hours later.  I am baffled.

Thank you,

P.S.  Billy - That fuel line article is great.  Excellent addition to the
library.
