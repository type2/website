Subject: rekey ignition switch

It's not difficult to disasemble and rekey, but it's also not a measure that 
should be done by someone untrained.  For one, there are two basic types of 
the locks that disassemble differently.  Some parts interchange, some don't. 
  Why not get your local locksmith to do it?  If he can't get it apart, I'll 
advise him gladly.
