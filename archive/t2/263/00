Back to the tool store.  they sell a chisel that is specially shaped for
removing bushings from blind holes.  It has a flat side to protect the
bore, and flutes to bend the cut bushing edges inward.

Alternately, a dremel tool with a 1/8 carbide bit is an easy way to cut
the bearing shell.  Be careful, as the carbide tool will cut the crank as
easily as the bearing shell!
