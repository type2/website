Subject: 914 engine vs. bus f.i.  f.i. question

Hello List,

I worked on my 914 engine some today and am almost
ready to install my bus f.i. So I sat down tonight and
starting going through my big box of f.i. parts thanks
to Steve Dolan. I carefully took each piece and
cleaned them, started replacing all of the hoses with
new ones, painting parts, and inspecting everything.
Any how, after I painted the intake manifold runners,
I went to test fit them on my engine. I already knew
that the 914 has 3 intake manifold studs on each side
instead of 4. I assumed that I could simply drill a
hole in between the 2 center holes on each set of
runners and they would fit perfectly. Boy was I wrong.
The outer holes do not match up either. I could fudge
it and drill 3 new holes in each runner, but knowing
me, that would take all day and they would never line
up correctly much less seal down on the heads. 

>>>>>>>QUESTION<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Here is my question, can I just use 914 intake
mainifold runners with my bus f.i. plenum? Any body
had experience doing this? Does any body have a set of
914 2L f.i. intake manifold runners that would work in
my situation? Oh, by the way, the f.i. came off a 79,
non electronic ignition bus. Any other ideas? Anybody
want a set of 79 bus f.i. runners that have just been
cleaned and repainted???

Thanks in advance for the help. Please forgive the
wordy post. Thanks!
