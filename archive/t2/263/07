MPC= multiprong connector.  I did the dignostic test for terminal one
and it was ok.
The final flowchart I used said brain was bad if injectors didn't get
pulsed ground from brain.  However, I will check or swap resistors and
must check if injectors are getting continuous 12v, as the brain just
provides the ground signal?

 MPC?  What is that?
 The coil trigger wire comes from the #1 terminal of the coil. It should
pulse
 voltage when the points open and close. The injecters do not run
continously,
 they open when the points open. Terminal 1 on the ECU. It is a long
single
 white wire exiting the EFI harness about 6" from the ECU plug.
