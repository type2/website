hot start problems are not unusual in the VW bus, BUT!  your problem does
not sound like the usual hot start problem where the "bendix" does not
engage and thus it will not "shoot out the gear"

this sounds like a bad starter more than anything else (maybe combined
with the usual long wires)

did the starter "Try" to crank the engine or did the soenoid(sp) not push
the gear far enough out.

automatics have the additional problem of not being able to be push
started.  (I have a 78 automatic)  what I have done for mine.

.  had the starter rebuilt by a trusted firm
.  put in the Bosch hot start relay
.  ran a wire from the starter to a switch in the engine compartment.

this has solved my hot start problems,  and the switch in the engine
compartment is a lot of help when you need to "bump" the engine while
servicing it.  but if the starter itself is bad nothing else will help

remember the auto starter is DIFFERENT than the manual starters in that it
doesn't have a nose support and is bigger

good luck
