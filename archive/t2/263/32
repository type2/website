Subject: Re: Mechanical Ignition Switch - Rekey

Kevin and Bob, thanks, but I can get the mechanical ignition out of the 
housing OK.

It is just that I cannot figure out the next step; how to take the 
mechanical ignition switch unit itself apart, so that I can get to the key 
cylinder and the wafers.

I have concluded that my housing/mechanical ignition switch is buggered, and 
I will be searching for a replacement of both. When that happens, I would 
like to know how to take the mechanical ignition switch apart.

BTW, the best I can see in the library under 'I' is for the earlier bays, 
not the late bay, like my '78.

Come on people, someone out there must have a description or pictures..


For HSD:  the steering column I went out to get on Friday was sitting in a 
'73 camper.  Wrong version!!

Go to the Library in http://www.type2.com/  Go to I and then pick
ignition switch.  There is a great articile with great pictures called Bay 
Ignition Lock Cylinder Replacement by Mike Howles.  I used it and it was 
very helpful.
