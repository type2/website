Subject: Four Questions regarding:  how do I reconnect vacuum hoses?

I have scoured the archives, and while I have found tidbits of advice,
I would like collect some comprehensive information before going
further.  

** all parts mentioned in this post are "named" according to the
illustration at www_dot_bus-boys_dot_com/emission6874_dot_htm **

Vehicle:  1973 bus, dual solex setup with automatic transmission. 
Stock, except for the now-absent Smog Pump, "Pressure Relief Valve",
and "Air Injection Tube Assembly".

Decisions so far:  

1) I will connect the distributer's vacuum advance to the left carb and
leave the identical port on the right carb plugged.

2) I will connect the distributer's vacuum retard directly to the
"Mixture Distribution Assembly" (which leads to the vacuum ports on the
manifold).

3) I will cap the 10 mm opening at end of the "Mixture Distribution
Assembly", where it used to joined to the now absent "Pressure Relief
Valve".

4) I will connect both "EGR Valves On Manifolds" with a hoses and a
T-fitting, then connect that T-fitting to the "Emission 2 Way Valve"
bolted next to the fan.


Four Questions:

1)  There is a single outlet (inlet?) at the back of the "Emission 2
Way Valve" mention directly above.  To what should that be connected?  

1b) Can this "Emission 2 Way Valve" be completely removed and the both
"EGR Valves On Manifolds" be plugged? 

2)  There is a single outlet (inlet?) atop the Thermostatic valve
(which is afixed to the right side of air box).  To what should that be
connected?

3)  There are two outlets (inlets?) on the underside of the airbox arm
that feeds the right carb.  One is brass, the other is plastic... what
should be connected to these two outlets/inlets?

4)  Underneath the vehicle, above the rear left axle, there is a Y
fitting spliced into the line leading to my brake servo.  Attached to
that "Y" is a 3.5 mm ID hose left hanging loose and plugged.  There is
a .5 inch factory hole in the firewall near this Y fitting.  Should
this 3.5 mm hose go back into engine compartment?  And, if so, to what
should it be connected?

Thanks in advance for any and all answers and advice.

(I promise I will post the solution so the next guy doesn't have ask!)
