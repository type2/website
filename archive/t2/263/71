Mike:

With the key off try to measure the resistance between
the front and rear terminal on the injector connector
and the positive post on the battery.  That will tell
you for certain which is which.  I think you are right,
one lead is connected to 12V and the other is swtiched
to negative to power the injector.

Myabe you jsut have a leaky injector though.  It might
not be electrical??
