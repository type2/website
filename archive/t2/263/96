Subject: Re: [T2] smelling gas

I've never replaced mine but it's still there. Someone on the list was 
talking at one point about canister refills. Sort of a rebuild your own 
canister project.

I think they were supposed to last longer than 3 years.

I had tears in the vent lines (there are some behind the firewall), cracks 
in the filler pipe at the gas tank, and a tear in the filler neck.

All sorts of leaks. Once fixed my van hasn't smelled of gas since.
