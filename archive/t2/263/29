Sounds like a sticky pinion gear on the starter.  Starter spins, but the
pinion doesn't pop out to engage the ring gear.  It doesn't work when hot
because something is expanding with heat and sticking the pinion  Remove
the starter and either replace it with a rebuilt or take it apart and
make sure that the pinion gear is free to move and lubed.

With an automtic bus, a starter should be in the spares kit for trips into
the boonies.
