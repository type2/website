VERY, VERY important addition. Thanks George.

To the original poster: sorry, apparently missed your point that you can't 
do it due to distance or parking lot rules or whatever. Any competent 
mechanic - and not just an import specialist can do this job. I was 
replacing starters when I was 12 years old.
