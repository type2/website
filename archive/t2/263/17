Subject: Source for Wavy Washers?

I pulled my left rear shock off on Saturday as a precurser to replacing it.
When I pulled the mounting bolts, several of the spring/wavy washers fell out
in pieces. Is there a source for these or should I just go to Lowe's and find
some equivalent size flat and lock washers?
