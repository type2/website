Subject: ADMIN: New Library article - fuel lines

All,

Billy Price submitted his fuel line replacement write-up to the type2.com
Library.  It's now available at 
http://www.type2.com/library/fuel/fuel-lines.html .  Thanks Billy!

We are always looking for more great articles like this one!  If you write
something you'd like to submit to the Library, email the address on the
Library index page - currently mroberds(-at-)att.net - and we will work it out. 

Thanks!

Matt Roberds
