If it just needs a starter then the expert I would use is YOU.

The starter is held on by 2 bolts, it has maybe 3 wires.

Procedure:

Acquire replacement.
Remove old wires, 2 old bolts, remove starter.
Install new starter, replace wires in same position, replace 2 bolts.

Done.

Save yourself the money!!!
