Not stock, but the stock screen holes DO let no-seeum gnats in at the
shore! (:

 I replaced this very screen many, many years ago on my '69 bus. If I
recall I
 followed these steps:
 
 - remove grill
 - remove old screen and throw away.
 - cut a piece of standard aluminum screen to overlap the grill a bit.
 - center screen over opening and screw down the grill
 - remove the grill again and now the screen is creased so that is is
obvious
 where and how to trim it for a perfect fit.
 - trim screen and then replace screen and grill.
 
 This of course is not a 'stock' solution.
