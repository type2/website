Subject: RE: [T2] Using Kads in place of stock Solexes

  I just completed a Kadron carb to 2 litre type 4 engine conversion. I had
to modify the linkage center pivot mount (SCATS) and make my own linkage arm
pieces for on the carbs. Once I got it all set up and synced, it runs
awesome. Cost way to much money to do using new parts, but if you have all
used stuff the biggest expense will be on the intake manifolds and the
linkage, approx. 125.00 to 150.00 dolars.

  EMPI is still working on a type4 kit and hopefully will be available soon.

Agreed the stock linkage is awful, but Scat makes a replacement linkage that
is excellent. I am surprised that there have been problems. If set up
properly with a unisync (use an appropriate size piece of PVC pipe, or juice
can to raise the height above the air cleaner bolt) these carbs provide
trouble free service year round for me. And I live in the frozen north of
Canada yet they start in the mornings in cold, or hot days. I don't
understand this, I've used them on Type1 and Type2 engines.
