Fiberglass matting and polyester resin--the same stuff it is made of
will repair it permanently--

Forget about "cavin and pavin" the top with bondo--it won't last a
week---

 With a little time and effort with the right stuff--it will be as good
as new---

Later,

Terry

On the front of my 78 pop top there are two cracks about 2 inches long.
They are on either side of the latch. How would I fix them? Bondo? or do
I need a new top? 
Thanks.
Brennan.
