Subject: Thrust bearing ?

When I take my foot off the accelerator, Ashley makes a high pitched squeal
from the back end. Putting my foot on the clutch stops the noise so I
assume it is clutch related. I've checked the adjustment (took the time to
replace the nut which has made adjustment as easy as it says it should be
in the book) and that's OK. Noise goes away when the power is on and when
idling.

Haynes says nothing about this, Muir says that the thrust bearing is on its
way out but he says only in 1st, this noise happens for me in all gears at
speeds from around 10mph to 40. Only happens when engine has been running
for a five+ minutes.

Questions

Does a poorly thrust bearing sound a sensible cause of this noise ?
What does the thrust bearing do ? (Just curious :-) )
How long can a bearing last and what happens when it fails ? The noise is
intermittent. No clutch slip and changing gear is OK. No noticeable loss of
power.

I'm going to get my mechanic to do the job (why didn't it fail when the
engine was out for head work 4 months ago :-(  ) but like to pre-diagnose
problems if I can not 'cos he can't work it out but 'cos it makes me feel
better and I suppose is cheaper if I can point him in the right direction.
I will take the opportunity of engine out to paint the tin this time so I
suppose this is the silver lining to the cloud.

Thanks
