Hey Jay:

Funny you should mention the bilge fan.  I saw one
advertised for bugs and was wondering about the bus.  I
will look into that. Are they one speed or variable?

I need to measure the outlet temp tomorrow (its
supposed to be cold too).  At 30mph its too hot to put
my hand over it for more than 30 seconds.  It drops off
when you idle.  It was about 48F today.

I have an electric heater in the van on a timer to
defrost the windows.  My cord keeps getting shorter
because the insulation is not too flexible at -30F.

I remember last year the coldest I ran it was to help
my sone and the neighbour kid with their paper route in
January.  I plugged it in for two hours and it ran
fine, but I counldnt keep the front window clear!  It
was about -30C (~-20F?).

This year Id like to make it my daily driver over
winter, since it is such a pleasure to drive on snow
and ice.  The mustang is very unstable on cold fresh
snow/ice.

By February, if Im still driving it, then we will have
something.  Plug it in and it starts no problem, but it
was always too cold to drive.  I used to bottom out
about -15C (~6F??).

Thanks for your help
Logan
