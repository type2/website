Yes, they sit too high, and have a stud sticking up out of the 
center.  Fortunately,
ABS pipe comes in just that size, so it is easy to make an adapter.

No joke.  Mine looks like it was made on someone's first day on the 
job--first time
they'd touched a welder.  The bit that the accelerator cable connects to is 
welded
about an inch too high.  I just made an adapter to get on the road.  One 
day I'll get
around to cutting it off, and welding it where it belongs.

Or...........I might just buy the exceptionally nice linkage Gene Berg 
makes...........
that'll put a huge hole in my beer budget, though.  8o|

>4. They run rich, or are hard starting, take your pick.

Mine don't have that problem.
