Subject: Re: [T2] smelling gas

Does it smell when you fill the tank up absolutely
full??

If so its the rubber filler neck tube on the gas tank. 
I had to replace mine after I bought the 78.  It was
easy to do, just tedious. And you need to keep thinking
of your "happy place".  If you need to replace it look
I can help with instructions.
