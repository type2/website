Subject: Re: [T2] Starting Problem

Wayne,

Your problem is very common. Luckily, the fix is common as well, and very
cheap.
You need the Bosch WR-1 hard start relay kit. It costs ~$10.50 and installs
in minutes. You can get this from most local VW shops, or peice together
your own from a Karmann Ghia horn relay.

I wont go into depth on the causes of this, as there are plenty of written
documents that will explain it in more detail. I'll attach some links.

Have a great day!
