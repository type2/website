Subject: Seat Rebuilding

Has anyone ever attempted to rebuild the seats in their bus?  I don't mean
simply new padding and covers, but actually replacing broken springs, etc. to
bring the seats back to their original level of firmness.  I put new cushions
on my old, tired out seats, and it made a big improvement, but I noticed that
a few of the springs on the seat bottom along the front edge and outer side
were broken, causing the seats to sag and not provide adequate support.  I
tried to patch the broken springs (these are the springs that look like "s"
stacked on top of each other) with some steel tube and light brazing, but it
didn't hold up for long.  The other day while at the fabric store I noticed
some spring material that looked almost the same, and probably would work just
fine.  I also just thought about replacing all the spring material in the seat
bottom with a big foam cushion.  Anyone have experience in this area?
