your bottom air deflector from 3&4 clean it good, run
it, park on the hill, look for the leak. If this does
not help, do a compression test, a piece of tin could
have gotten pinched between the head and cyl during
the head change. This could give you blowby which will
look like a oil leak. Good luck Phil
