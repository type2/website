Could this apply to other carbs as well? My 72 came to me wearing a set of PO 
installed DellOrto FRD 34's. Some time ago i aquired a carb sync tool, a bottom 
of the line Uni-syn with the little red bead in the tube. Before I used it, I 
verified that sucking on the little hole made the bead move. When I tried to 
put it on either carb, the engine slowed down and just died no matter what I 
did with the little thumbwheel. The little red bead didn't move either. When I 
put the palm of my hand over a carb throat I can feel that the carb is 
definitely drawing in air. 

Does this indicate a vaccum leak? The engine is out right now. I plan to 
replace all the intake gaskets along with pushrod tube seals, rear main, etc 
befroe I put it in the "new" bus. Anyone have any ideas out there?
