Subject: Re: Need source for Screen behind Grill

Andrew,

I replaced this very screen many, many years ago on my '69 bus. If I recall I
followed these steps:

- remove grill
- remove old screen and throw away.
- cut a piece of standard aluminum screen to overlap the grill a bit.
- center screen over opening and screw down the grill
- remove the grill again and now the screen is creased so that is is obvious
where and how to trim it for a perfect fit.
- trim screen and then replace screen and grill.

This of course is not a 'stock' solution.
