No kidding I finally got my valve covers leak free and
they rusted over like frost on a October morning in
Canada.

Now I wish I had painted the *&^ things prior to
getting them sealed up.

If I take em apart (next year, Im done for this year)
they may start the leaking process all over again!

Im going to use black barbeque paint on mine.
