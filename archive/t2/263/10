I re-read your 1st message and you wrote:
"Checked terminal one on the MPC and it has power- means coil trigger wire is
continuous and OK?.  Checked terminal 10 to 5, 17, 18 and there is continuity
so "brain" has ground."
You either checked the wrong wires or wrote down the wrong ones. They should
have been 10 and 5, 16, and 17.

You are misreading something here.  The pulsed signal test is B+ from terminal
1 on the coil. The test is to:
1) pull MPC off ECU
2) test light between term 1 and ground
3) crank engine, light should flicker or blink

The next test is the ground test:
1) ECU disconnected and MPC plug disconnected
2) test w/test light from terminals 10 and 5, 10 and 16, 10 and 17.
Test light lights up = bad ECU
Test light off = bad ground or open wire between term 10 and double relay term
88b

Ground is either on or off, NOT pulsed...
