Subject: Engine Tin

Hi Gang,

As I prepare to re-install my AVP rebuild in my '77, I've been tracking down
all the missing cooling parts (thermostat, etc).  I've come to a dead end
trying to find the bottom left tin that goes directly under cylinders 3/4.
I've tried several used vendors, and I was wondering if anyone had such a
thing laying around that they'd be willing to sell? It's for a '77 2.0L with
the CAT in line with the muffler.

Thanks,
RickG
