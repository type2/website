Subject: loosing brake pressure!!HELP!!!


Help!
on my last road trip the brakes started to loose there pressure so bad I
could feel it as the pedal went slowly to the floor inch by inch. the fluid
level  hasn't changed its full. any clue as to what I need to look for? its
a 74 with a 2.0l and a single Webber setup if that helps any.

thanx
Ian
