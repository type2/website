That's typical. I thought they were all the same. I never encountered
this problem when I interchanged doorhandles between my buses.
By the way: the door handles of the passenger and driversside are the
same. Just fix a driversside doorhandle upside down. The only thing is
that old doorhandles often have the chrome corroded on the lower side
which will become very visible once you mount them upside down.

You might even use the doorhandle of a VW 181 ('thing').

You have to make sure that the lock cylinder is the same type as the
key. The difference is the profile of the side of the keys. If you have
original VW keys you can see this by the letter in the locknr. For
example:

  25 L 043   is the L-type used in modelyears 1968-1970
  35 R 056   is the R-type used in modelyears 1971-1979

On the doorhandle this number is also visible but can only be relied on
if the lock has never been tampered with. The number is stamped on the
little lever that is screwed on the cylinder on the back. The part I
mean is nr 34 on this page:

Adjusting the cylinder to your key is not so hard, but take some time
for it to make sure it works properly. There are 9 slots in the
cylinder. 8 of them contain a metal slide (I hope I used the correct
word). There are 3 different metal slides. One of the 9 slots is always
empty simply because there is no slide that would fit there in relation
with the key. (don't ask me why but that's the way it is with al the T2
locks). The trick in making the correct match is that when the key is
totally inside the cylinder none of the slides should be sticking out,
that way the cylinder can turn around in the doorhandle and thereby you
can unlock your door.

Before you start get a few locks from the junkyard so you have a nice
collection of metal slides (preferably T2 locks, maybe 181 locks will
also work, but the slides out of certain beetle-locks won't fit). Also
be aware that the position of the empty slot could be different and this
means you might have to add a spring to the cylinder.

Oh yes: the empty slot is always on the side of the cylinder with 5
slots (at least, that's my experience so far).

Good luck!
