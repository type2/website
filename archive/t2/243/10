Subject: 78 Engine and Trans into a 74 Body

I am wondering what details I have to pay attention to If I try to install the
2.0 L engine and trans , out of a 78  into a 74 body.

I am thinking that I want the 78 trans for the matching gear ratio to the 2.0L 

I am mostly concerned about shifter linkage problems,, as I know I have to add
the air box support bracket,, fuel pump and relay and wiring, change the exhaust
etc, 

Do I have to change the trans nose cone?  Or the Bell housing? 

Thanks!
