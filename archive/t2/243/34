Oh Oh !!
I just noticed this same thing on my NewBus #3 plug the other day
when I had it out and was trying to determine if it was practical to insert 
a CHT sender under that plug.

I have been wondering about those small blisters I saw, as I had never 
noticed them ever before on any other plug anywhere.
