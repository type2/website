Subject: Re: [T2] 78-79 tranny

My research on a rebuilt manual tranny for my '77 Westy showed that the
76-79 buses all use the same tranny (manual).  Should be the same for Westy
and Transporter.  Bus trannys are geared differently than other VW's due to
the heavier weight.  I'm sure someone else has more data on tranny life, but
I've HEARD that a late-model tranny will outlast a couple of engines.
