Ahah!  I just had this funny feeling that something was
missing... I don't have
the dust covers for the backsides of the assemblies.  Are these
available somewhere?
As I don't know the proper name, nor part #, I can't effectively
search for them
at places like BusDepot.

Which brings me to another q:  rainwater which enters the
compartment
from the air scoops - obviously collects around the battery
trays.  My driver
side tray is rusted very badly (to be repaired in Oct.) and the
passenger side
is not exactly pretty.  Where is this water supposed to drain? I
couldn't see any
obvious holes, at least not *intended* holes which would prevent
the water
from pooling.

Just thought I'd ask, as I'll be welding in new trays in October
and want to
make sure I'm doin' the right thing...

Cheers!
