Justin,

If it has been wet there when you parked and it has been awhile, they may 
be slightly stuck to the drums.

Try at fairly serious tap on the drum/wheel area with a hammer...make sure 
you emergency brakes are off and wheels chocked first!

Sometimes the brake pad material likes to bond with the drum after being 
wet and drying off while they are pressed together from the emergency 
brake.

Cheers, dave
