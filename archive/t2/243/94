Subject: VW part #s, was Rear Tail Light Assemblies

Don't buy the positive battery cable that is listed with a VW part number 
either. You'll get the same cable you can get blister packed off the wall of 
of any FLAPS for half the price.

I bought one from The Bus Depot and it was drop shipped from Rocky Mountain 
Motor Parts. At least Ron was nice enough to take it back and give me a 
choice of a refund or credit.
