Richard,

No question there is a front and rear system on the bus. My measurements on 
ONE system (73 Datsun) indicate that when one circuit fails the surviving 
circuit loses some (most) of its normal pressure past a seal in the master 
cylinder so don't count on full up pressure in either curcuit in an 
emergency.
