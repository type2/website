Subject: Media or Sandblast?

Hi,

I have recently purchased a very restorable 1972 westy. Therefore, my first 
concern is ensuring that the underside is solid and clean. So I am 
considering either media or sandblasting the underside, before repainting 
it.

Any recommendations on which is better? Has anyone done it out of there own 
garage? Any nightmare stories I should know before I start?

Thanks, Phil.
