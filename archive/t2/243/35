OK, Bob, how about taking a picture of the blistering and posting it.

If it is not in your camera capabilities, does anyone offer to capture the 
'microscopic blistering' with their setup??

Barry sends (unlike John Wayne Bobbitt, I would not like it published that 
'my' most private member was reattached with the miracle of modern

use ice thongs and a jack hammer!!!')

Hey, man, it's all in the wrist!!
