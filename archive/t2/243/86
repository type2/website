Subject: solid or hydraulic?

Hello all,

I'm finally on the road and holed up in beautiful
Bloomington, Indiana.

The bus is running well, but there are some valve
issues.  It is a recently rebuilt engine with about
1500 miles on it.  There is some confusion as to
whether I have solid or hydraulic lifters.

According to the archives hydraulic tend to have
brownish colored steel 3/8" rods.  Solid have 1/2"
silvery aluminum rods.  

I'm not sure either way.

I took a picture and I was wondering if you guys could
help me out.  I'm currently off list, so please cc me.
