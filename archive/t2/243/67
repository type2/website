Subject: Fuel Pump Install

Hey Y'all,
On a 1600 Dp engine, is fuel pump installation as easy as simple removing the
two bolts at the base of the fuel pump and removing it, then reverse for
install? Or are there other parts (push rod) that actually go INSIDE the
engine, thus creating an internal engine procedure (out of my league!)

Peace, John Baker
