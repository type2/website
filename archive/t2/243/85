Subject: VW Trademarks?

With the Barbie Microbus--It IS authorized by VW--But I do have a non-bus
question regarding VW trademarks--I found a new black gym bag with the word
"BUG" on it, and a small "tm" next to the name, which means trademark--
Does anyone know where this  black bag came from?, or is it a VW item? uj
