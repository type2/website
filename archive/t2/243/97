Hey, finally one I can answer!  This is the same set-up I have in my bus. 
My 71 tranny went belly up. Took one from the 69 parts bus. All I had to do 
was change the throw-out bearing and pressure plate. It's been in for about 
5 years and going strong. As far as I can tell it must be pretty close to 
the same gear ratios.
