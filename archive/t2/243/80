Tim,

Just got thru doing this on my bus.  While the housings appeared to me
to be an exact match, I didn't like the new metal parts that came with 
them.

Mine originally had two of the 1/2 size lugs on one bulb while the new
metal holders were different.  The new metal holders had the lugs all
pointing straight away from the metal while the originals were at a 90
degree angle.  This would have kept me from being able to get the rear
dust/water protective cover to fit right.

I poped the metal parts out of my old housings(they were in excellent 
shape) and the fit exactly into the new housings...appear to work great!

Since the new housings did not include the back cover, the original ones
snapped on perfectly.

Mine came from busdepot.

Cheers, dave
