Subject: RE: [T2] Dual circuit brake safety?

When one of my  brake circuits failed, it took out both front brakes.  The
rear ones still worked, but being drum brakes and not having much traction
in a braking situation, they didn't help much.  I'm pretty sure that the
front and rear brakes are on seperate circuits.
