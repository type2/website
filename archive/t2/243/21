Subject: Emergency Flasher Installation

Jason,
I don't have the manual handy to verify, so this is from memory on my '77
bus. The only parts involved in the emergency flashers is the switch to turn
it on/off on the dash and the normal turn signal flasher relay on the fuse
box.
The wiring from the turn signal in the steering column goes to the emergency
flasher switch, then heads to the fuse box where it connects to the flasher
relay. It would be difficult to remove the emergency flasher switch without
upsetting the normal turn signal.
It could also be the relay on the fuse box, there are many different types
that will plug into the fuse box, but not all of them will support the
emergency flash function, check you have the correct one?
If you still have the original emergency flasher switch installed, it may be
the switch itself not working?
