"
Kinda like the people who think they can go mountain
climbing with just 
a cell phone as 'support' "

Kinda like people who have to throw in thier 2 cents
without the facts!

Fact: The bus was checked by a mechanic.
The bus was further checked by a number of other
people.
The suspect bad part was in the bus which was the
voltage regulator.
Fact: the bus has been owned and driven by her for a 
number of years.
Fact: she has more experience with buses than 80%
of the people on this list.
Fact: She made it.
 I thought AIRS was to help not to attract this kind
of criticism!
