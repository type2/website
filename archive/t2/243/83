Subject: need 72-74 stock muffler at Bug-o-rama

I am helping my friend put the motor back in their 72 camper....

somehow the muffler disappeared (hey its only been out 2 years)

so if anyone has a cheap stock muffler for a type 4 motor and is going to 
bug-o-rama....

please let me know......

I might find it in the swap meet but did not find one at Pomona last Sunday

thanks
