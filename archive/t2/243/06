Last year, after travelling for the entire year,
6 months of which had been in our bus,
we passed through Jerome around mid October.

What a really awesome cool place.

To those going, please have a cool one for me.

Take a nice cool beer up to your lips,
say "Here's to Bob"......... and then, just a small swig.

Maybe I will feel the transmission.

Have Fun !
