Subject: Re: [T2] knocking sound from back left wheel.

Hmmm.  Sounds maybe like a CV joint.  Mine started intermittently, and was
more prominent in a turn.  It also seemed more pronounced when hotter.  You
probably want to check it out before one drops...I understand this can
damage your tranny.  The fix is to remove your axle half-shafts,
disassemble, clean, inspect, replace(if needed), regrease, and re-install
your CV joints.  Makes for a long Saturday if all 4 are bad...

Good Luck,
