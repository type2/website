Subject: heater tube gaskets?

I finally have the heat hooked  up and working in my 71 westy.  I =
noticed on the accordion tubes that run from the output of the heater =
boxes to the Y-pipe that one of these accordion tubes has a rubber =
gasket that makes everything fit together tightly, while the other side =
does not.  Also, this gasket only fit one of the heater boxes.  Should I =
have these on both sides or is this a year/model specific part?  The =
heater boxes are definately different from one another, and it might =
even be that I have 2 lefts or 2 rights if that is possible.  On the =
right side the cable and clamp hooked up on the outside of the heater =
box, while the left side hooks up on the inside of the heater box and =
required the cable to be bent a little.
