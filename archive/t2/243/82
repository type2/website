Subject: Re:  [T2] One more question..

Regarding used California vehicles, the real question is: Does it have a
recent (60 days) smog cert?  Any recently smogged, running car in CA is
worth at least $800 - $1,000.  If no smog, it's not legal to sell, and the
new owner would not be able to register it.  The seller is responsible for
getting it smogged before sale.

$800 is probably a good price if smogged; if it can't be smogged, the owner
won't get more than a couple hundred $ for salvage.  If salvage is your
plan, that might work for you, but don't pay $800.

Just because it passed smog last year, doesn't mean that it's any good now.
They ALWAYS say "It'll smog just fine"  If so, have the seller get the
certificate, and reimburse him as part of the selling price if it passes.

Cars older than '73 don't need smog checks (Why the hell did I get a '77
????)
