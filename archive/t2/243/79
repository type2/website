Subject: main seal ? one LAST time

ok so i talked myself out of going camping this weekend. so the plan now is 
to pull the engine out of the bus (71 type 1 eng.) in the morning to replace 
my NEW main seal. it did not leak b4 i replaced it. now it leaks alot, but 
only when i turn it off(?).
my questions are:

1. where in the bently is this covered? (i could not find it didnt look too 
long)

2. the guy at my FLARS told me to use the old seal to drive the new seal to 
the bottom of the seat. the guy at the VWFLAPS told me to just make it flush 
with the case. what is correct?

3. are the threads for the spark plug standard? can i use the thread chaser 
they sell at the FLAPS to clean up buggered spark plug hole?
