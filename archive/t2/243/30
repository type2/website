I know this guy and have bought several items from him direct, they are
always good quality for Brazilian parts.

I Installed the same exact tail light assemblies on my 72 and had no
problems. They went right in in 10 minutes.

This guy is also working on getting window seals for 412's. Since the molds
were lost for the 412 window seals the next closest car is the Brasillia (A
car manufactured in Brazil and sold to the South American and Central
American Markets only, but VERY similar to the 412)
