Subject: Magfire electronic ignition???

California import parts sells this apparent knock off
of the compufire electronic ignition.

Does anybody have any experience in particular with
this electronic ignition kit (Magfire)?  It is $39.99
- $20 cheaper than Pertronix.  What about California
Import parts in particular?
