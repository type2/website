>Now what do I do??

Cut out the old one and weld in the new one. . .

I used a Dremel and lots of cutting wheels. The only part of the old battery
tray that I left was the lip of the tray that is spot-welded to the outside
of the body (quarter panel). So all that is left is a narrow strip with no
lip. I left this as a mating surface because it provides an area to weld the
new tray to with less fear of welding through to the outside of the body.

Test fit the new tray and do any tweaking and bending until you get mating
surfaces aligned. Grind or sand all the paint and rust from the mating
surfaces and spray a weld-through primer on the mating surfaces only

Drill or punch 1/8" holes about every 1.5 - 2 inches around the lips and
mating surface of the new tray.

Position the new tray and fill in your punched holes with a MIG or gasless
wire welder.

Prime, paint and you are done.

To do it right it's nearly a full day job.
