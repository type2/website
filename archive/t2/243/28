Subject: oil leak main seal can i drive far?



re: oil leak main seal

I wouldn't recommend it, but I once drove from Yakima Washington all the
way to Mexico on a leaky seal.  It required approximately 20 bottles of
oil, but we got there no problem.  Down there it cost 20$ to fix it,
cervezas and fish tacos included.

Just follow the golden rules : keep it cool and filled with oil, and you'll
be fine.
