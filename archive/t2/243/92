I am looking for directions to the show this Sunday. I went last
year, but can not remember how to get there. Also wondering if
anyonelse is going? Looking to trade a mint front beam for either a
front bumper,interior stuff,or rust free doors for my 78 Westy.

Hey there Bill,

Directions are 95N to 295 north to route 114N (exit 11). Follow the
VW signs. http://members.aol.com/plwjack/map0811.html

I would guess that the "usual suspects" will be there. I've got a fr.
bumper from my 78 you can have, and I have a few peices of the
interior from the 78 left too. Pmail me what you need, and I'll bring
it to the show. I'll be bus-less (avp motor is on it's way). 

Later...
