If you guys are referring to blisters on the white insulation of the center
electrode; I ran into this back in the mid 70's when I had my own repair shop.
I asked Champion about it then. Their engineers said it was caused by using
too cold a spark plug. They said to go up one step in the heat range.
i.e. if you are using a Bosch plug and it is a W7, then you need to go to a
W8.
This worked on all the cars that I had the problem with then. Almost all my
customers came back to me so I could see changes.
