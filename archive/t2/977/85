Subject: paint bubbles

I got all the icky latex paint off the van last night , and today I  
was power sanding the old base coat down to a smooth finish to  
prepare it for primer and a new a base coat.  I know that van was  
painted at least one before because I have paperwork all the way back  
to the original sale.  While sanding down a few trouble spots I found  
old areas with lots of little bubbles in the layers of paint.  I  
sanded them smooth and found no rust underneath.  I just makes me  
aware of how important preparation and finding a good paint shop is.   
These bubbly areas look like spots where the painter ran out of paint  
in the paint gun and it started to spatter.  But instead of  
handrubbing out the orange peel after it dried, they just painted  
over it again.

I've painted many a vehicle in my day, but have never seen things  
like this in my jobs.  The old paint jobs were from those discount  
places.  I guess it's worth either doing it yourself, or spending the  
extra bucks and getting a decent paint job.
