Subject: Throttle Body Seal

For those on the lists who were inquiring a few weeks back about the
non-availability of 74-later Throttle Body Seals, Airhead Parts just
got about 2 dozen or so in from Europe this afternoon.  These aren't a
repro, these are OE.

Note: Ignore the "Temporarily Out Of Stock" Message.  They're here :-)
