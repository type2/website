I have a friend who wanted the locking handle also. He drilled and small
hole the size of a quarter behind the tag. He had a rubber plug that fit
perfect. So in the event of a fire he could bend the tag up a just push his
extiguisher hose in and pull the trigger. The handle will get hotter than 
the  tag.
Another problem with opening the lid in the event of a fire is the fire 
will
come out as you open the lid. Always be careful. Also carry a big 
extiguisher.
Those little ones are cool because they are small but, better to  have too 
big
of an extiguisher then to run the little one out and then have  nothing.
replace those fuel lines. Replace those fuel lines.

WOW,, a lot of very good points here!

I have seen a couple of home made versions of engine lid locks,
one that was pretty slick...  install a barrel bolt latch

instead of using the smaller half of that latch,, you set the sliding bolt 
up so it catches on the inside lid of the body,, where the seal is ,, then 
you run a small cable from the trigger on the sliding bolt up into the cargo 
area thru a small hole basicall right above the barrel bolt.. terminate the 
cable in a key ring,, or something similar. The barrel latch fits nicely on 
the left, or right side of the inside of the engine lid ..

The idea is.. you have to unlock your rear cargo hatch... open that door.. 
pull up ,, and hold up on the cable key ring... and then use the stock latch 
to open the hatch.

it is really slick, and easy,  only requires a couple of  holes made in the 
inside of the engine latch lid.. and one tiny hole into the cargo area...
