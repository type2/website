You pretty much need to remove all the rear tin, the fan, unscrew some 
of the screws that hold the big tin pieces to the housing, the bracket 
that holds the housing to the muffler, the covers that connect the 
housing to the heat exchangers, and I think there's a screw on the left 
side that holds the oil cooler or something over there, can't remember. 
  You'll probably also want to disconnect the flap cable, as well...
