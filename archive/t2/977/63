Subject: Qu re "bouncing" engine

75 bus, runs ok, sounds good after warmup, power ok (considering it was 
full of college room stuff, and highway milage had dropped from usuual 
22 to 18))-while on 800 mi drive home while napping in the back I 
thought it "vibrated" when it was stopped for traffic, so we looked at 
engine when stopped but idling- it noticably was bouncing up and down, 
about 1/4" I'd say-and you could even see the antenna shaking.  What 
gives?  It had had a loose alternator mount that was tightened last Dec, 
if that gets loose can it cause so much shaking?
