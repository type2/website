Subject: RESOLVED (was Re: [T2] Weber Progressive advice required.)

Hi Volks,

This afternoon Dennis Jolliffe and I managed to get the Weber sorted  
out and it's running much better now. There was simply too much pull  
on the vacuum advance line at idle for the distributor to handle.  
Another issue was that the return spring wasn't bringing the linkage  
all the way back. With the vacuum line off and the return spring re- 
routed the engine was much more manageable. I have it timed to 7.5  
BTDC and find it idles great but there is a definite sag in the low- 
range powerband compared to dual solexes or FI. Feathering the clutch  
a bit will get you moving well enough, and once it's off the line  
it's not a problem.

I am still not a fan of the weber single setup but it'll certainly do  
well enough for the time being.

BusFusion is coming up on Friday and I am looking forward to seeing  
this bus make its first campout under its own power.


Thanks to everyone who responded to my earlier emails, your  
assistance was greatly appreciated.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
