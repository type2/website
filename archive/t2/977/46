By Jove, Jamie, I think you're onto something!  Instead of pulling the bike with the bus, I'll pull the bus with the bike.  Brilliant!  Better aerodynamics and better power to boot.  But uh oh, what happens in one of those nasty crosswinds??  Maybe not. :)

 Cheers...KR

Ahhh,, the point of owning a bike is to ride it....   ;)
I don't make hitches for Goldwings....
so I am assuming you are going to put a hitch on the Bus,, and tow your 
Goldwing??
your motto...??  we haul our rides everywhere.  I won't tell you the acronym
