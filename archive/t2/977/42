But that's an upright engine, is it not?  That's all you can get out of Mexico now.  Well, I guess they made Type 2's up until a few years ago.  In 1995 I was in the Yucatan and came across a VW dealership just south of Cozumel.  It was like going back in time.  Bugs, Busses, etc., all brand-spanking new.  Wish I had made a picture.  That was before I had the Bopmobile.  Cheers...KR

at least a little oil?  I'm sure there are varying degrees, but just
about everyone seems to have some kind of oil leak issue.  Just curious.

Well, my Mexican engine seems to be oil-tight, at least for the last few
years.  Pretty amazing, really!
