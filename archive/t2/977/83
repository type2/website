Subject: Re: [T2] Qu re "bouncing" engine

Lessee...'75 bus has T4 motor... EVERY time and I
emphasize every, any of my T4 engines started shaking
they also ran hot. The connection? Something got
sucked into the fan and was riding around and
upsetting the balance and the airflow. If not that,
then determine if the frequency of the shake matches
the crankshaft or not. If it matches the crankshaft,
it's probably pretty important to diagnose before any
more trips. Could be anything bolted to the crankshaft
- either end. Does it go away with the clutch
disengaged? Or change?

Alternator would be at a higher frequency than
crankshaft. Not thinking mounts or anything like that
cuz it happens while stopped. You've already done a
power balance test (disengage 1 cylinder at a time,
watching rpm drop for each)- haven't you?

There was a "flutter" that occurred at extremely high
rpms but you really don't want to hear about that!

 in the back I 
 thought it "vibrated" when it was stopped for
 traffic, so we looked at 
 engine when stopped but idling- it noticably was
 bouncing up and down, 
 about 1/4" I'd say-and you could even see the
 antenna shaking.  What 
 gives?  It had had a loose alternator mount that was
 tightened last Dec, 
 if that gets loose can it cause so much shaking?
