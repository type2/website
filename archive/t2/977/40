I agree to a point.  The massively-integrated and proprietary systems used
by BMW and VW can be a nightmare if they are released with glitches.
Anyone who has run M$ software knows the havoc that can be wrought by the
"release it now and we'll fix the bugs later" attitude of the computer
business that seems to be newly adopted by the German auto manufactuerers.
I never hear of Toyota or Honda suffering from these problems.

OTOH, the simple aftermarket engine management systems seem to be very
reliable.  The software is simple enough that it can be made error-free.
The tunability of these aftermarket EFI systems make them a very
attractive alternative to carbs and distributors.  Tuning one of these EFI
systems is like having an infinite supply of carb jets and advance
springs that you can swap on the fly.  You can dial any combination you
like without having to assemble, disassemble, test, repeat repeat.

The current stumbling block is cost, but a set of aftermarket carburators
isn't exactly cheap either.
