Subject: Can't win, now not running right after I washed the bottom

I put the rocker arms back on, and the valve cover, then I degreased the
bottom of the engine. Now it appears to not be running properly at idle. Still
has plenty of power but just at idle, it's as if one cylinder isn't running
right. When i hosed down the pushrod tube area on each side, and the block
bottom, could I have gotten a sender somewhere wet? It has always run like a
top. I am 99 percent sure I put the rocker arms and pushrods back on properly,
with them seated in the rocker arm cups. I am getting REALLY p***ed off !!!!!
with this!!!!!!!
