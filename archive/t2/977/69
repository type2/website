Subject: Part Question

Stopped by an old friends house the other day to get some of my extra
parts out of his garage, and I found this (see attached) Can anyone
tell me what it is? At first I thought it was a compressor, but it has
a funny rubber boot on the bottom/end. i forgot I had it, when I
bought the bus 2 years ago the guy said it worked, but I cannot
remember for the life of me what it is....
