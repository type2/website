Subject: Re: [T2] Decel valve, 81 air cooled

Disconnect the decel valve and plug both the
connection points with corks or whatevers. It will
still backfire. It will react better when you back off
the throttle though, and that was why I disconnected
mine many years ago. If you are getting a genuine
backfiring, there is air getting into the exhaust
somewhere. It can be anywhere from where the header
tubes bolt to the exhaust ports on down. No air = no
backfire. -BaH
