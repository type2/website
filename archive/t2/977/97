Just out for a 10km walk, and while out there, wondered why the pre-'74
"lids", opened a different way than the '74 and later?  Was it due to "Westy
management "showing they knew better, than VW or was it by "kitchen "design,
below, or just "design" change, because I believe at that time of production
VW was going through a "management issue", with "Bigger players", yet they
persist.  There just had to be a reason!!??!!??
