Subject: Re: [T2] Possible areas of oil leak?

my engine leaked a little till i put in all new pushrod tubes and
seals.  i just used seals and no permatex.  as of yet i have had no
leaks but i have less than 500 miles on the top end rebuild.  honed
and debermed the pistons, all new lifters, new remanned heads, i think
that's a top end rebuild, though three years into owning an acvw i'm
still pretty new to it.  i have changed the oil once since the rebuild
at 100 miles.  filthy, dirty oil.  just went on a 200+mile trip and
checked the oil during and after.  no fluid loss and the oil looks
incredibly fresh and clean. still no spots on the ground when i park.
keeping my fingers crossed on that one.
