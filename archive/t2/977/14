Subject: Vanagon Brake Part

Hello Volks,

I'm searching for a part on my 84 Vanagon.  The Samba has not yielded much.

I need the push/adjusting rod from the passenger rear brake.  I think I 
could use an adjusting rod from Vanagon 80-92 and maybe late bays but 
I'm not sure.

If anyone has anything, please send me a p-mail.

Thanks,
Andrew
