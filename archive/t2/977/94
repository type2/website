Subject: Trailridge Road Run

I'm taking the kids camping this weekend in Estes Park.  The plan is to 
take Trailridge Road through RMNP and spend a few hours in Grand Lake. 
Anyone up for a cara-bus up through the national park for some lunch and 
chill time in Grand Lake?

There are still sites available at www.jellystoneofestes.com for anyone 
that would like to join us for some very kid friendly camping.
