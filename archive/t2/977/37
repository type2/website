Subject: RE: [T2] locking engine hatch for a 78?

my appologies... the latch i was sent was a 71 thats why it didnt work... i thought it was a 73 but i looked at it again and it is a 71....the latch its self is off by just enough to not make it work..
   
  so the one that bus depot sales is it R code as well so when i get it i can have it rekeyed to fit my bus...
  thanks

--------------------------------------------------

72 to 79 engine lid latches are the same dimensions.

72-75? is chrome metal.

75?-79 is black plastic.

Since they were an option, you got a 2nd key that did
not match anything else. But being as they are R code,
they can be disassembled and recoded to match your one
key for the bus.
