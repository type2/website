Subject: RE: [T2]crankshaft bolt break downs

Chai, remember, these bolts were installed and torqued DRY at the
factory. Any amount of oil residue or whatever will significantly reduce
the amount of torque required to bring it to spec. I usually spay the
bolt holes, nuts or studs with brake cleaner and allow them to
completely dry before installation. Even then, I would be a bit
conservative, say 20 ft/lbs for a 24 ft/lbs fastener. Hope this helps,
Timo
