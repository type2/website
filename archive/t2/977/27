Subject: Oil leaKS ON TYPE 2

How do you drive a Type 2 owner crazy?  Make sure you point out the oil
leaking from his ride for two weeks, do a "ceremonial" dance around his ride
in front of him, sneak out every night for 2 weeks and "spic and Span under
the ride, then stop doing it and bring his attention to it, and this time
CHARGE for the dance!
