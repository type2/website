Subject: Re: [T2] Decel valve, 81 air cooled

Hi John,

Like Busaru said, backfires on deceleration are caused by air leaking  
into the exhaust stream and igniting excess fuel vapors in the  
muffler. I have seen this condition on both FI buses and on  
carbureted engines, and the carb'd buses don't have a decel valve to  
take the blame.

Take a hard look at the exhaust system and gaskets ASAP.

Happy Trails,
