Subject: RE: [T2] locking engine hatch for a 78?

karl i still didnt say what i was trying to ... after i reread what i wrote.. sorry yesterday was crazy.. i broke down again adn got towed home again...
   
  so here is what i was trying to say...
   
  my appologies  the latch i was sent was a 71 thats why it didnt work... i thought it was a 73 but i looked at it again and it is a 71... the latch its self is off by just enough to not make it work..
   
  so the one that bus depot has then   IS IT R CODE??? i am not saying it is i was asking if it was? if it is i was saying i guess i should get that one and have it releyed if it is a r code one..?
  thanks
