Coutney,,, take a minute to double check your valve clearance..it takes less 
than 10 min,,, I don't even jack the bus up.. 

one thing to look for ,,,, make sure the rocker cover gasket is in place.. 
if it has slipped down on the top.. you won't notice an oil leak,, but there 
is a vac leak for the EFi system,, and it won't idle properly with an vac 
leak. 

hope that helps
