get all the oil galley plugs tapped and plugged w/ threaded inserts, get
everything that rotates balanced (fan, crank, flywheel, springplate),
get rods balanced, pistons balanced... umm.. can't think of anything
else off-hand, but that above shouldn't add any significant cost and
will keep things running nice and smooth.  .. oh.. Get all new bearings
regardless and have the machine shop check for wear on the crank and get
new crank bearings where appropriate.  You might as well get some new
rings and put a new crosshatch on the cylinders.  ..can't think of
anything else offhand..
