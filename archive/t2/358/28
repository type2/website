Subject: Re:FI fuel pumps/running out of gas-qu re inlet screen

My fuel pump went the full 240,000 mi until last week, when the bus was
left to pump up the lifters (sat for a month).......came out and the bus
had died-tried a few cranks, checked the spark, and then juiced the
pump, noting it was noisy. Added a few gallons of gas.  Pump still
noisy, fuel pressure gauge showed it seemed to work but it did not do
well at full throtttle and a pressure gauge jumped around a lot.  Pulled
the filter and found a piece of silicone calk in the filter inlet. 
Likely the pump was running dry/starved until bus quit and AFM opened
the pumkp contacts. Fuel ran clean out the hose so I put new filter on. 
Bus ran, but pump was still noisy.  I replaced it with my spare.  Now I
must ask, I noticed that out of 3 pumps I have  about, only one has this
little screen in the inlet end- as this a stock inclusion in the fuel
pumps?  I don't see its need if you run a filter before the pump.
