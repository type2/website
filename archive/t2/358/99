it isn't the duct openings per se but rather the friction of the air
flowing thru the entire cooling path you need a more powerfull fan to push
more air than the fans rated max flow.

sure, and if I knew all of the heat/cooling airflow characteristics I
could..but the seat of the pants guage and oil temp is all I to go on but
with enough observations a pattern can be determined

but there is still the ability of the duct to handle additional air, this
changing of the pulley probably has the most effect at lower rpm and
diminishes as the rpm goes up, this may be a good thing depending on your
driving habits.
