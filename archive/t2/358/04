Subject: help re-installing cylinders/heads on a two litre engine

Hey guys I'm feeling a bit stupid, been a while since
worked on an air-cooled flat-4 engine, and am a bit fuzzy.
I had removed the heads and taken to the machine shop to
have them re-welded back up and new seats in teh two
damaged places...had a three angle valve job to boot...
Now gettng ready to reinstall, I slipped off the cylinders
and honed them, than attempted to pull out the piston pins
to remove the pistons to put the new rings in....here's te
trouble...fought to get teh circlip out, but pin will not
budge! any suggestions?
Oh! and I was trying to do this with the engine in situ
this is in the '80 that needs to e finished before I can
put the engine in my '78.....I'll be pulling the shortblock
right now,
but any suggestions for teh pin removal and reinstall of
cylinders, just realized I do NOT hve the special ring
compresssor for aircraft/vw's anymore and know I wonlt e
able to borrow my dad's aircraft ones even if they were the
right size

suggestions..help etc?

thanks
Paul
