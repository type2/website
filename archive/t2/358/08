We were on our way to BYOB/Kelly Park headed up 101 and we stopped in 
Santa Margarita (just outside Attascadero, north of San Luis Obispo, CA) 
yesterday to trade for a brazilian tilt for the 68 double cab.  We heard 
a terrible noise in the engine.  Turns out the gland nut backed off the 
front of the engine and has wallowed out the 4 dowel holes in the crank 
and flywheel.  So here we sit.  Safe place with a fellow VW nut but not 
home.

Can the crankshaft be redrilled for 8 dowels in place???

Can the crankshaft be redrilled for oversized dowel pins in place???

Any other suggestions?

Otherwise we are looking for a high end stock SP motor with universal 
case (needs mustache bar attachment) for the b*y.

We have found a source for flywheel and crank but it means a major 
engine tear down and would rather do that at home.

Still working to get to BYOB on Friday.
