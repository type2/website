Bob and all,
Maybe I should clarify what I am trying to do.

Bob you said >" right but rpm is not the only measure of enigne work, the
rpm might go

This is true, but my concern is to keep the rpms down for cooling puposes.
I have a 1904cc in my '71 that was built for torque. I have been
experimentingt with the rpms and reading the temperature and found that my
engine runs cooler at 3200 rpms.  I would like to reduce the rpms for
cruizing on the highway to keep the engine cooler. Currently, the rpms are
3750 at 65 mph which IMHO is too high.  I would like to get it down to 3200
at 65 mph but this will take more that changing tire sizes.
