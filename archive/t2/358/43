Why don't you make a disk image or a bin and cue of that CD so people
could download it? I know a lot of people out there would love to have
it available for their laptops they now travel with and it might be
easier to see if people have a larger monitor over the book which has a
set font size. I know I have used a magnifying glass once or twice to
read the directions carefully. Plus there is the grease and oil
factor... a cd goes into a small case and hopefully you like your pc as
much as your veedub that you will clean your hands or have someone else
insert and operate the pc.
