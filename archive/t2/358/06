> Does anyone have source other than Bus Depot for a
 rebuilt distributor--VW 039-905-205C or Bosch part
 0237 022 009. This is for a 79 type 2, California
 Emissions version. Apparently the Vanagon 80 - 83
 Calif Emissions use the same distributor.

I have at least a dozen good used ones.

What is wrong with yours?

At one time I was putting together complete set-ups to
convert to electronic ignition using this dist. and
the coil and the module w/heatsink but I have not had
good luck finding good used harness's. Their weak
point is the connecter plug going to the distributor.
The 3 wires self-destruct
