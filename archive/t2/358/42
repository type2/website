Tends on the neighborhood.  In 20 years, I've had only three occurrences
where the gas "evaporated" overnight.  I always replace a gas cap with a
locking one when the cap needs replacing anyway.

The one on "G" was a generic 2" across deal with the finger/thumb tabs
sticking up on it.  Every time that you took it off the tabs bent, and you
gave your wrist a hernia.  It also looked terrible.  The new one fills up
the filler opening and is very easy to remove with the key.  I'm happy.
