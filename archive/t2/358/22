Subject: Misc photos/FI grounds

I hope everybody with FI took note of these. They caused me 3 weeks
of total frustration after my fuel line replacement job inadvertently knocked one loose. Bus no start.

Upside, got to see Karl work an automotive voltmeter over my system and find it in under 10 minutes.

That puts the Billy/Karl troublshooting speed ratio at:

3024:1

Not bad for starters,
