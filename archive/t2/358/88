Correct, but you also get more work output!

think of a tire as a lever extending from the axle to the ground.  If you
make the lever longer you will increase the torque required to get the
same force (that pushes the car)  This will require greater torque from
the engine.

However, you also need less RPM from the engine since the axle is turning
slower at the given speed.

The result is that you are pulling the same power from the engine.

If the engine runs cooler at lower RPMS, this is a good thing.
