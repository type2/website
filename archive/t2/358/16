the way actual hybrids work is that they put in a gas/diesel engine that
is large enough to power the vehicle in normal crusing mode, about 1/4 the
hp of the engine that is usually installed since most power is used for
acceleration. then the battery pack is used for an electric "boost" to
cruising speed and can be recharged by the generator or by deceleration so
it also saves on brakes.

 the BIG hybrids used in buses work the same way but they have electric
drive and the diesel engine runs at a constant speed running the generator
to constantly recharge the batteries that are powering the vehicle. by
running the diesel at a constant speed it can be optimized to run
efficently at that speed.  thus the small size of the engine and the
optimization of the power plant can reduce emissions by more than 50% and
can usually at least double the fuel economy....

the gas/diesel powerplant is designed to handle the full cruising speed of
the vehicle and if lots of stops and starts are made the regenative
braking will recharge the batteries enough that the fuel tank is the
limiting factor in the range, and only a few batteries are needed
