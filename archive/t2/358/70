Im sorry Fay or Scott but you have seriously failed physics.
The deal with a lever (fulcrum) is that you trade off distance moved and
force needed. The work force x distance is still the same.
A bigger tire moving at the same rpm  requires more power input.
Even you cant change the laws of physics. Thats why they are LAWS and not
just theories.
