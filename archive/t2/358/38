Hi Volks,

OK, my EveryBus trip report is finally complete. I'd like to take this 
opportunity to thank Chris for holding the best VW event of my year.
Thanks also go out to Jeff Stewart for being such a gracious host, and 
to all the people who came out and helped make EveryBus such a great 
time.


I have posted the reports online as they are just too big for email.  
There are two reports, one page for the pics with descriptions, and 
another with the story and a few pics to illustrate.

http://www.pottsfamily.ca/VW_type2/EB2003 for the pics

http://www.pottsfamily.ca/VW_type2/EB2003/tripreport.html for a 4,500 
word epic saga.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
