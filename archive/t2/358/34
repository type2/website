Marcus/List,

Very interesting.  I wonder if they increased the compression ratio on
these motors?  I used to have a '69 Toronado that ran 10.5:1 CR and had
to use 100LL aviation fuel mixed in the gas to get it to run well.  For
a while it ran a "dual fuel" carb set up and did much better on propane.
Would the lower CR bus motor "waste" the very high octane of the propane
(I think its between 115-120)?  Just a thought...
