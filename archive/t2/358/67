No. not 185/60 but 185/none/14.
I looked up a typical 215/50/16. Firehawk. 850 revs per mile. much smaller
than a stock 14 inch tire. 5% smaller than yoko 356s.

No your wrong here too. The work is the same. But the engine turning
slower  could be an advantage depending on your driving habits
and location.
