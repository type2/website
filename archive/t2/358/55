Honestly I am not 100% sure of the rims on my bus other then knowing the
size as one of the PO put the rims on. They look like the EMPI cookie
cutter but I never have seen a small 5 (the 5 on 112) pattern. A friend
of mine who is a Porsche fiend said they came off a early 912 Porsche.
If anyone has info I would love to know so I don't feel stupid on that
point as they do look good. As for my husbands wheels he got them in
Phoenix,Az from a  Mexican Tire dealership. They rims are made by Prime
and the tires a yoko's.

As for you bob... yes and no.. Physics apply but rules can be bent... do
a conversion over on the link I gave earlier (
http://www.miata.net/garage/tirecalc.html ). if you go from a stock VW
tire (185X60x14) and go to a larger rim and tire say a 215X50X16 the
difference is about 7.6% to slow or a speedometer difference of about
4.5 miles faster at 60mph. so if your speedo say 60 you are doing 64.5
mph. but your engine is only working as hard as it did before to get to
60 on the older rims and tires.
