Subject: Web page updated & EB & Darlington

Ok folks i had some pic content this monthe so there are 10 pages of Doug
Hartsook's 67 standard. A little over 2 week job doing some rustoration.
I visited Everybus on Friday for a bit and goofed off, met alot of old
friends and some new ones, had a blast then i came home repaired Jamie's
muffler,(btw how did that work out ?). Finished up a parts order for Rob
Laffoon, which Bryant was picking up for delivery west. I retured to EB
after dark, met a few new people who had arrived while i was away. Actually
met Bob with his funky low ride bus, the bad part was i didn't realize who i
was talking to at the time,,,DOH. Sorry bob. I left around 11 pm or so
headed home met Bryant at the gate as i was leaving, told him who had the
parts he was supposed to get the i shagged.
I left Sat afternoon traveled to Florence SC via the Binz, tooling along at
around 60 to 65 most of the way. Hit the KOA campground and crashed in a
rented cabin there. Several of the Drag racers from around NC were staying
there, to we chatted a bit ,then i laid up with my laptop watched a dvd then
crashed. Sunday morning i headed out to Darlington Dragway, for the North Vs
South meet. Met alot of old friends as normal, and also made some new ones.
Had a great time then headed home that afternoon, Around Society Hill SC i
hooked up with the group from Greensboro (Good OLe Volks club), and we
booked along at a god clip to just near home where i dropped out of the
trail for a much needed stretch and a nature break. All in all a great
weekend , ok later ya'll
