Alas... Las Vegas is too worldly to understand the mystery and charm that a
child percieves in the simpler and purer things in life.
Actually, it's kind of the same way in Los Angeles. Not too many people are
impressed. And there are still enough of them around.. just enough.. that
not too many people get excited to see a VW bus. Then again, you can still
pick up a sound and restorable running bay window for under $1,000 here. So,
maybe it's a good thing if not everyone is thrilled at the sight of a T2.
In our part of the west, the SUV is king. They can have the SUVs, and I'll
take the buses.
I do get a real bang out of the almost knee-jerk reaction that some of the
kids have when they see a bus. They'll be the future collectors, I suspect.
I remember one kid saw me coming up the road in my old rusty Sundial
conversion '69, and he looked as if he was beholding something beautiful and
precious. He seemed to be thinking to himself, "Wow! I remember when I was
concieved in one of those!" LOL.
