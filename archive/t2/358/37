Subject: Yellow manual vs. CD

I finally got a look at the "Yellow" book, the Type 2 factory repair manual
from VW. The content of the 2nd ed. is exactly the same as the $100 CD that
Bentley sells except the manuals go up to 1978 and the CD includes info on
1979 models. Of course the book is easier to read and more portable than the
CDs.

As a reminder, Bentley only scanned the pages, no OCR, so you can't search
them.
