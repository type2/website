I realise that we have wandered off of the practical path here. If you want
a modify you van to be highway cruiser, go for it, but theoretically  isn't
cooling of a Volks engine also a function of the speed of the fan? (ie:
higher engine rpm=higher fanspeed=more cooling air?) Wouldn't asking the
engine to create more torque (more output, thus more waste heat) at a lower
RPM and reducing the amount of cooling air cause the engine to run hotter?
Cheers,
Matthew
