Subject: Sliding Window?!

Hey guys,

	Someone told me that I should look for a "Sliding Window" option.
From what I understand, this installs in the window opposite of the sliding
door (or maybe it fits on the sliding door as well?). I currently still have
that same problem I had before. I have the two smaller windows in the rear
that need the vent windows to be installed. I am short 2 vent windows.
However, I was thinking I could install one of those sliding windows in
place of the window on the side, and then I could take the vent window and
install it in one of the windows that's missing the vent windows.

Does anyone here have a picture of the vent windows? I think that would be a
neat idea.

I'm trying to figure out though, how the SLIDING WINDOW option would look
when the rest of the car has vent windows. Would it look completely not
original and ugly? Anyone have any pictures?


Thanks!
