ahh, this is different, I understand, however the engine will probably be
making slightly more heat to disapate

right but will changing tire size help since the only thing that really
matters is the total rolling size, so if tire is smaller but wheel is
larger the total may be the same, there is only so much that can be
stuffed into a type 2 wheelwell.....years ago when I wanted to do
something similar I found I had to cut out the wheelwells to get the
larger wheel/tire combo in there...(my 65westy) since I hadn't built an
engine to handle this the engine longevity was affected I'm sure.
