Subject: RE: [T2] Sliding Window?!

Thanks Andy... I'm psyched. 

	I just ordered a set of TWO sliding windows. One to install on the
sliding door, and the other to install on the opposite side. This seemed to
me to be the most cost effective way of sealing my car. Like I had mentioned
before.. my rear windows are currently set up to accept vent windows (I know
about the sliding door thing). That's the way I got the car. AND... my
center windows currently have the vent windows and the glass installed.

With this idea.. I can install the two sliding windows, both on the sliding
door and on the side opposite, and then have the vent windows on the rear
windows.. and my window problems are solved!!

By the way, the one thing that made me nervous was that the guy at Wolfsburg
West said that the gaskets for the SOLID windows and for the sliding windows
were exactly the same. He assured me that was the case. I REALLY don't see
how that could be true.. but I took his word for it. 

Is this true?

the sliding windows were in both middle positions of later bay window
busses. with a little effort you should be able to find a pair they are
not uncommon.
Im not sure if the rear wing windowa are the same as the middle ones.
offhand Im thinking not.
I still think lose the rear wing and put 2 solid rears you can get the
seal from busdepot.
If you can put the sliding middles youll have plenty of air flow.
the vents anywhere except the front are IMHP a pain and not that
functional/
