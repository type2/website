Subject: Distributor - 79 Calif Emissions

Does anyone have source other than Bus Depot for a rebuilt distributor--VW 039-905-205C or Bosch part 0237 022 009. This is for a 79 type 2, California Emissions version. Apparently the Vanagon 80 - 83 Calif Emissions use the same distributor. 
Thanks,
Jaxon
