Subject: Infrared Temperature devices

I think this has come up before, but I'm curious to know what the current
thinking is, RE: what is the best choice of infrared temperature "gun".

I was thinking of the Raytek MT4, which is their entry level unit with laser
sighting.

This seemed like a good deal:

as they supposedly include a free holster at this price.

Besides the obvious uses for keeping VW's up to snuff, I've been running
into a number of non-VW uses lately, and now I want one.
