Nope, that's why they call them rules.  :)

You are wrong - the engine has to work harder to get the bus to 64.5mph.  This should be obvious.  I think you mean that the engine is turning at the same RPM as it would have at 60 with the smaller tires.  This is true.  It will however require more power to get up to that RPM.  And since the cooling system has not changed, the engine WILL run hotter.

VW engineers know all this and they designed the tire sizes and gear ratios to produce an optimum balance between reliability, performance and efficiency.  Don't think you can second guess them and increase one without decreasing the others.

Did you also know that your mpg will go down when your headlights are on?  Laws of physics again.
