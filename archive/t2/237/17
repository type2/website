Subject: front wheel play and....

Correct me if I am wrong.. but if you grab the top
of the front tire and do the push-pull thing isnt
there supposed to be a little play? I was lead to
understand that no play at all indicated that it was
to tight. hhmmm
  New bus: Put round headlights back on it and
I frankly like it. Course I like pickled herring in
mustard and dill sauce too! Välsmakande!
