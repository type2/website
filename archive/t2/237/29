Get the clips from a junk door. Requires a screwdriver to slide them 
forward or backward a bit and then they fall out.

I put them in place in my door add a little more squeeze, and then install 
the new felt strip with my hands and sometimes with a light tap from a 
rubber mallet.

Not alot of info but if you have questions, holler back at me.
