Subject: RE: [T2]  S A V W - new microbus

I got a Eurovan a while back, mostly because of how it reminded me of my 78.
An evolved 78, but it seemed that the designeers hadn't looked out the
window for the past 25 years and had kept refining the same design over and
over.  Sits high, wheels are way forward, and there is just crazy room
everywhere.

It has a watercooled engine up front, and AC, but it is still simple and
utilitarian.  Seats pop out, table and flouescent lite, snap on curtains, it
hauls stuff - it's beautiful familiar in its way.  Completely unlike a
modern minivan, with the shocking lack of space, storage, headroom, etc.
compared to a old kombi.

The new microbus worries me.  If you take a split and evolve it, there is a
smooth linear progression through the bays, to the vanagon to the eurovan.
Its sad that the new van seems to be a break in the evolution of our box on
wheels, driven by market forces instead any loftier reason.
