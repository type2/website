I believe the timing is advancing as I increase speed... I'll have to
double check.  I am setting the timing with vacuum attached.  By no power,
I mean the bus is sorely underpowered across the whole spectrum; at full
throttle the bus limps along.  When I set timing to 7.5BTDC, everything
is magically better and the bus is responsive.

Other oddities still persist, which may or may not be related.  The gas
milage (checked yesterday for the first time since the rebuild) is about
11mpg, city driving, with timing set at magic optimum.  Also, high
temps (260+) continue with sustained usage.  I'm just trying to isolate
what is happening here...
