Subject: easiest shocks ever done

just did the rear shocks on the westy.  had to be the easiest shocks i 
have ever done.  just jack up side about 4 inches, reach over tire with 
impact wrench and then from underneath with impact wrench.  change new 
for old, reattach bolts, and then go to the other side. Took longer to 
run the air lines and  pressurize the compressor  than to do the job.
then an interesting surprise.  They were very probably the original 
shocks. 160k plus miles.  And some people were wondering why  i usually 
pay the price  and put BOGE on my vehicles.
