Subject: Re: [T2] Window Felt Install?

Hiya Jim,

Just did the entire window seal & felt replacement thing earlier this summer. 
 Installing the felt is a pretty straightforward affair, but you have to have 
the clips.  WCM probably has the clips.  If they do not, I know that 
Wolfsburg West does - that's where I got mine.
