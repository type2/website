[...]
    later halls sender dizzy were used to replace earlier ones.  a digi
1 halls sender operated independantly from the computer so would
probably be a plug in replacement with only a slightly different
curve.  (just looked it up  and the only difference is the curve and it
is slight.)  both time at 5ATDC  and use the same internal and external
parts with the exception of the vacuum pot. This would provide that
slight difference in the curve.  Always follow your hood stamps.   they
may reflect a change that is not in a general purpose manual.
