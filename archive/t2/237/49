Subject: Re: [T2] How to wire stove for 1978 Westy ?

It's super easy, Dean.. The brown wire goes onto a chassis ground screw at
the back of the sink.
The long red wire goes all along the baseline where the wall meets the
floor, making the corner and fastened with a couple of clamps. Then it goes
through a hole with grommet at the back of the seat base, past the master
cylinder reservoir, out a little hole in the front, under the floor matt,
and direct to a fuse holder just under the fuse block. The stake on fitting
goes directly into the fuse holder.. It is black.. the kind that you twist
and it comes open into two pieces, the fuse held between them. Back to the
sink, don't be confused by the two wires. They are the voltage in/ voltage
out for a simple twist on/off switch on the counter top. The switch applies
current to the pump, which sends water to the sink. Very easy. Jan B
