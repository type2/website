Rick,

I'd forget about trying to clean and paint the tin myself and go and =
have it powder coated.  It will still look good in five years when you =
plan to do your major restoration.  The beauty of getting it powder =
coated is that you don't have to do anything except take there.  If it =
is greasy they put it in the oven first and bake off all the crude, then =
it is easily sandblasted.  The sand blasting gives the surface some =
"tooth" or roughness for the powder to adhere to.  At least that's the =
way my local powder coat shop does.  If you have some little cracks and =
such in the sheet metal, they will have to be repaired first.  Either =
braze, mig or tig them up and let the powder coaters have a go at it.  =
Many colors are available, but having done mine in bright yellow, I'd =
recommend black or at least a dark color.  The light colors show up too =
much crud.  Also, the more common the color, the sooner you will get it =
back.  The powder coaters do a lot of black and white.  They can load up =
a big rack with all kinds of parts using the same color and then roll =
the rack into the oven for baking.  If you pick an uncommon color, you =
may have to wait until they have time to do only a few parts.

My $.02, YMMV
