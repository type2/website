Quoting from the South African press (dated early this month):

" Farewell to Volkswagen bus range as production ends

Hundreds of Volkswagen South Africa employees gathered on 21 June 2002 to
say bon voyage to the last Volkwagen T3 Microbus to roll off the production
line at the Uitenhage-based plant. The final T3 Microbus to come off the
production line after being built at the Uitenhage plant for more than 20
years was a gold-painted Microbus 2,6i.

So popular was the T3 Microbus that it became part of local motoring
folklore - even the name "Kombi" has for many become a generic term for any
minibus. It is not surprising with more than 265 000 of these vehicles
having been built in South Africa.  Managing Director Hans-Christian
Maergner, speaking at a special function to mark the end of production of
the T3 Microbus, said that it was with "a hint of sadness and nostalgia"
that the T3 Microbus era had drawn to a close at Volkswagen South Africa. "
