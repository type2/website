Subject: RE: [T2] Shift-rod Linkage

Follow up report...the engine's out! Yeah!  I used vice grips on a standard
socket extension to loosen the set-screw on the shift-rod coupler.  No
socket, just the square female end of the extension (it's about 8mm, like
the set screw).  Only problem was, the same guy who locktited the screw
locktited the couple to the tranny rod.  I was able to disassemble the
coupler, and remove the tranny/engine with the coupler shell still on the
tranny.

BTW, I found a cheap engine adapter for my floor jack... I was pondering the
best design for a plywood/2x4 endgine holder, and was passing through
Manny,Moe&Jack's....they had a beefy $12 mechanic's creeper that was
basically what I was going to build anyway.  The creeper, a small floor
jack, and my wife to help balance was all it took.  Did have to jack the bus
up to roll the engine/tranny/creeper assembly  out the back.

Next step is dissasembly, and ship the block to AVP for rebuild...I can't
wait to start.  I hope I don't have to work tomorrow (I'm a pilot, so I'm on
call a lot)

Thanks for all the advice which has helped me get to this point!

Have you removed the safety wire?
If so, just hit it with your choice of penetrating oil, wait, and try again.
