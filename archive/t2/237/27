Get over it.  No, it's not an old Bus. There will never again be an old Bus.
But, if the New Microbus is a success, it is a good thing for old Bus owners
like us.  Like the New Beetle, the New Microbus will likely cause a
resurgance of interest in the original Bus.  For a while, this will result
in an increase in the popularity (and, incidentally, the resale value) of
old busses, just as the New Beetle did for the old one.

Why do you care?  Well, let's face it - there are fewer busses on the road
every day.  This means less demand for parts, which means that some parts
are going out of production or getting scarce.  Over time, this translates
into substantially higher prices for bus parts, or lower quality, or both.
Not a good thing.  For example, we had a close call recently, when Pagid
(the only remaining German brake shoe supplier) decided to discontinue all
Bus brake shoes due to declining sales - a decision that they eventually
reversed (for now).  Had it happened, only resurfaced shoes would have been
available for busses - not for a while, but forever!  What's more, the
resurfaced shoes would have gradually gone up in price; right now the
existence of new shoes at a certain price imposes a "ceiling" on the price
of resurfaced ones.  So within a few years, you'd be paying more for
resurfaced shoes than you are now for new ones.  This trend toward reduced
parts availability is already well underway with splitty parts, and will
happen with later bus parts as well (as it does with parts for any vintage
car whose numbers on the road are declining).

Anything that brings with it a renewed interest in old busses will slow this
inevitable process.  Lots of media attention about the Bus will keep more of
them on the road.  Suddenly they're "classics" to more people, worth
repairing, rather than being sent to the junkyard as a worthless "jalopy"
when the engine drops a valve or the rocker panels rust.  Suddenly that bus
in the backyard under the tarp is worth uncovering and restoring (or
selling) rather than being left to rust into oblivion.  The more busses that
remain on the road (or get put back on the road), the better it is for bus
owners.

So is it going to make a huge difference?  Probably not.  But there's no
downside to it, either.  Renewed interest in the Bus can only help, not
hurt, bus owners.

The better question is, will the New Microbus be successful like the New
Beetle was?  That's a good question. VW is pretty sure of it, as they're
planning some pretty serious production volume for the U.S. market.  But the
New Microbus (as presented so far) does have a couple of notable flaws that
the New Beetle didn't have.  One is the styling, which is not nearly as
evocative of the old Bus as the New Beetle was of the old one.  Merely
calling it a "bus" does not guarantee that it will tug on the heartstrings
of people who fondly remember the old bus.  Secondly, pricing.  While other
successful "retro" vehicles (Miata, New Beetle, PT Cruiser, New Mini) were
priced very affordably, the New Microbus will be somewhat expensive (about
$28k).  I think that Volkswagen may be underestimating how much of a factor
the low pricing was in the success of other popular "retro" vehicles
(including their own New Beetle).  So I think VW will have a steeper road to
climb this time around.  On the other hand, the New Microbus couldn't
possibly be as big a commercial failure in the U.S. as the EuroVan was, so
things can only get better.  And besides, it will draw the media's attention
to busses for at least a little while, regardless of whether it flies or
fizzles after that.

So bring 'em on!  I don't think I'll buy one myself, but here's hoping lots
of people do!
