Subject: '73 auto transmission mounts?

<PRE>   I'm looking for the front and rear bonded rubber mountings for my '73 
Camper's auto transmission. I've been to places locally and online (even the 
VW dealer!) to no avail. We've been told to "just swap it out for a manual" 
but, after reading your archives, this sounds like a bit of a reach. Any 
suggestions on where I might find these or any material/non-VW part that 
might work? Thanks, G. Tarango
