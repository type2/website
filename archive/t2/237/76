Late 1971, right?

;-)

[flame suit on]

With regard to the Audibus, I can see the argument that it's possibly a natural modern iteration of the splitty.  I see plenty of bus "purists" who see 
nothing wrong with bopping from show to show in their Vanagons or EVs.  Old farts.  Just cause they have AC and oomph.  As several have pointed 
out, it's not just whether it looks like a "microbus" but all the modrin geewhiz stuff on it.  (Think I'd rather git me a T*yota pickup.)  But you can argue 
that the "real" transporters died in 54, or 61, or 67, or maybe 71, or 79, or whenever those boxy vehicles got radiators ... just depends on what makes 
'em real to you.
