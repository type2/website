Subject: Re: [T2]  New Microbus ( S A V W )

I like the new Bus, ( I wish it had round headlamps ) It will most
defiantly be much more dependable, drivable, and contain the creature
comforts that my 74 lacks.
When I purchase the new Bus, I then can bail out out of the
undependable, labor intense, parts sucking Wasserleaker's I am now
doomed with, and get back to the other pleasures in life besides
maintaining the Vanagon's.

Then my 74 will be just a toy---not required to get me anywhere in a
hurry,or on a schedule.

This is the plan---
Getting back to the fast lane--
