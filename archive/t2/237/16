It sure doesn't have that friendly, cuddly quality of the old VW buses, does
it?
I keep thinking that it will grow on me, but so far, it leaves me just
thinking how great the original VW buses were. I'm sorry.. I just don't like
it. Chrysler made an immensely popular retro in the PT Cruiser.. Why can't
we have a retro VW bus?  Jan B
