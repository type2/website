The heater boxes will fit 72 to 78.
The 411 muffler will fit on the 72 to 74 heater boxes BUT the flange is a
different size for the EGR filter. If you use it on a 75 to 78 with EGR, you
cannot bolt on the filter. The 2 studs are closer together.
To use the 72-74 boxes on a 75 and up, you will need additional pieces from
the 72-74 engine:
the alternator adjusting support,
both pipes that go between the flapper valves and heater boxes,
both front lower cylinder tin,
both lower pushrod tin.
both heater pipes that go thru the upper tin from the blower fan.

As far as a value on the carbs..... I have seen them sell for next to nothing
on ebarf. This annoys me because I can't buy them from self-serve yards for
less than $60-$75 complete with manifolds, tubing, and linkage. Add the
aircleaner and it is up to $75-$90. But they are used and kind of unknown as
far as how worn out they are on the shafts.
