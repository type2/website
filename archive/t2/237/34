Por-15's Marine Clean works rather well. What is your 
reason for not wanting to use the hose? Are you 
concerned with washing the grease/oil down the sewer? If 
so consider the local self serve carwash, most recycle 
the water. IMHO using mineral spirits or kerosene would 
leave your driveway a big mess, not to mention the time 
you'd spend breathing those lovely fumes.
