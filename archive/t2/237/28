Assuming you have a stock 75 w/ FI it's similar in design to my 79.
While I'm not sure this is the best place I usually attach it to the
vacuum line that goes from the manifold to the decel valve. OK I
confess, I hook it up this way b/c I lost the little tee fitting for
my gauge :)

I have the same type of fitting & havent had any problems using the
hose to loosen it after checking the cyl.

I think you are actually wanting an ignition w/ accessory position. I
have seen these at RMMW but cannot say how good they are or even if
they fit in our busses.

I would check two things first. Look for a vacuum leak & test the cold
start valve per bentley.
