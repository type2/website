Subject: Haynes description of test plug

I've been wondering about the small test plug in the engine compartment and
I came across a description of it in the Haynes manual. It says that it
wires to a sensor that can tell if the flywheel is rotated to TDC.

Does anyone understand the pin out for the connector or have a description
of the "computer" it plugged into?  What else can the connector do?
