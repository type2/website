It can certainly be done. You're going to have to deal with a pro I 
suspect. Basically find all the spot welds and drill them out or cut them 
out. Do this on both busses. Transfer the steel to your bus from the old 
bus. Ensure that nothing - NOTHING - has moved or sagged and weld the new 
back in.

Because of the crucial measurements needed I would consult a pro.

I have used frame shops that simple measured everything. I have also used a 
shop recently that had a laser measurement system that was VERY accurate.

And you can't take the body off the frame like a Beetle or an old Ford. VW 
Buses are the unitized body types - the frame members are welded to the 
body panels. You could separate the two but you wouldn't want to. Work 
locally - remove only what you've got to.
