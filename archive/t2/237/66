Subject: RE: [T2]  New Microbus ( S A V W )


  According to S A V W site they just introduced a new syncro Vansgon and 2
other models with bigger engines. I just searched the site trying to find
them. It shows all 3 models, the prices and all the options available.
Maybe this is the last year. They also show a streched syncro Eurovan on the
same site.

Actually, they have just discontinued it.
