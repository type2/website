Not so. In Brasil and Mexico they refer to the Bay Window as the Kombi. In
Argentine the Transporter is a Rabbit like pickup with a hard shell on the
back, in South Africa there are several "Buses", the T4Caravelle which is
like our EuroVan, the Bus which is a Vanagon, in Austrailia they do indeed
call the Eurovan the Transporter,

So when did it lose its bus heritage? Or, for that matter, did it?  The body
style change from Bus to Vanagon was not that much more dramatic than the
change from splitty to breadloaf, and the Vanagon remained aircooled and
rear engined, so it would be hard to say that the "heritage" was lost in
1980 when the Transporter's second body style change occurred.  And adding a

That was not a Beetle engine but a jointly developed Engine by Porsche and
VW called the Type 4 Engine, When the water jacket was put on it became the
WASSERBOXER.
