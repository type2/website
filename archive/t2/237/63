Subject: Re: [T2] Por 15 Question, welding

Bob,

Here is a lesson in welding 101---

For a optimo welding surface all the POR, paint, primer, rust,
corrosion--whatever-- must be ground clean as a whistle---
Makes the welding much easier, as well as not contaminating the weld
with garbage--

You can burn into garbage---but it is a better idea to clean as much as
possible where you can get to----then  run the weld into the ca-ca if
necessary---at least the majority of the weld will be clean and strong-- 


Later,

Terry

if one uses Por 15 on a bus (say the frame) and then later needs to do
some welding on an area that has been treated....how difficult is it to
weld. 
do you need to remove ALL of the Por 15, or will it burn off as you
weld. 
??? 
Thanks
Bob
