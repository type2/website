There is nothing for me "to get over". I never said that the new bus was
trying to be the old bus. All I was saying was that people are going to
think they are in the "club" of buses when all they have is a souped up Audi
with none of the Bus heritage.

Great so those of us who have been buying buses because they are a cheap
good vehicle will now have to pay alot more for them, what's so good about
that?

That made alot of die hard VW people happy, prices for Beetles and parts
went up alot when this new "Beetle craze" happened.

I will agree to that.

This is true also, but you can still find parts for MOST cars that people
collect.

So what you are saying is that all the points you have made dont really
matter and that if the new bus hurts or helps, things wont change.

Actually it can, for those of us that are looking to buy another bus in the
future. How does it help me when I am looking at a bus now that is $1000 but
it will be $3000 in 3 years just because some yahoo thinks it would be
really cool to do up a 73 just like his new 2004 VW "microbus".

> The better question is, will the New Microbus be successful like the New
Beetle was?  That's a good question. VW is pretty sure of it, as they're
planning some pretty serious production volume for the U.S. market.  But the
New Microbus (as presented so far) does have a couple of notable flaws that
the New Beetle didn't have.  One is the styling, which is not nearly as
evocative of the old Bus as the New Beetle was of the old one.  Merely
calling it a "bus" does not guarantee that it will tug on the heartstrings
of people who fondly remember the old bus.  Secondly, pricing.  While other
successful "retro" vehicles (Miata, New Beetle, PT Cruiser, New Mini) were
priced very affordably, the New Microbus will be somewhat expensive (about
$28k).  I think that Volkswagen may be underestimating how much of a factor
the low pricing was in the success of other popular "retro" vehicles
(including their own New Beetle).  So I think VW will have a steeper road to
climb this time around.  On the other hand, the New Microbus couldn't
possibly be as big a commercial failure in the U.S. as the EuroVan was, so
things can only get better.  And besides, it will draw the media's attention
to busses for at least a little while, regardless of whether it flies or
fizzles after that.<

I agree with that, Bus owners have always been viewed as Hippies and losers,
now is a good chance to show we are normal everyday people who just love the
old buses.

Well if they have the money to buy one, more power to them.
