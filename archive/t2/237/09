Subject: The The 75 bus (idle for 5 yrs) roars! 

Well, finally got around to functionalizing the 75 bus we got for our
daughter back in 97.  Supposedly had 65K mi, certified as true by PO on
title, but today I noticed a sticker behind the engine lid that showed an
oil service at 100,096 mi- oh well. Explains how he could have ruined second
gear so quickly.
    Back then I drove it home, and it was started here and there,  but had
black smoke/stallout upon accell.  that I finally traced to bad connector on
temp sender.  Basically it has sat for the last 2 yrs.  Today, Being lazy, I
wanted to verify a functioning spark and put a strobe on it and had it
turned over.  Yup, all wires showed  a flash.  Did not start, though, and I
needed the starter umph to get the bus to rollinto into the garage, which it
did, with signs of catching here and there.  Put starter ether up the air
intake pipe and  turned it-  cough, cough,  roared to life, and warmed up
fine- friend couldn't believe it.  Dropped the oil, pulled the screen,
noticed gritty stuff under the strainer, and am now cursing the fact that I
have to painstakingly scrape the old gasket off the engine.
Gonna be changing a lot of gaskets on this engine.
