as well as deluxe versions.>>
Whoa--!!

What is way off?
A Geo Prism is 10g's plus---
A Mini S is 20g's and some change--
If this new aborition is 28g's--it would be in line with the price of
the rest of the stuff available.
 
<< unfortunatly VWOA never gave the EV the chance it deserved. It was
priced high>> 

Talk about unreasonably priced equipment--38k is a lilte rich for
anybody---this was the downfall of the EV---

This whole thing with the new Bus is a period of adjustment thing---

I used to think way back when, "who in the heck would own one of those
things", when the first Splities began to be seen--and the same with the
Type 2's---and then the Vanagon's----
Each new model just took some time to get used to---all except the
EV--which I still think is Butt Ugly, and is right in there with the
Chrysler market--Yuck-- 

At least VW is trying to get close to it's roots and appeal to a few
more folks that the EV never touched---round headlamps would still
help--:>)  ---
