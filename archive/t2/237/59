Subject: Re: [T2] timing question

The distributor reference page is great!  This morning I pulled out my
flashlight and dentist mirror and got my dizzy model #: 0237 022 025.

According to the chart, this is a distributor for a "Vanagon 1983-1984 *
1900 Digijet".  It is supposed to be timed at 5ATDC.  Is this the wrong
part for my '79 CA bus?  Is that why I had to monkey with the timing to
get it to run decently at all?
