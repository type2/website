I suspect what you have is a cheap tool. Remember what I've been saying=20

A leak down test MUST be done at TDC, because the greatest cylinder wear is=
=20
at the top of the stroke. I have never had a problem with getting the=20
piston to within 1=B0 so it can't move under pressure, as the rod is lined=
 up=20
perfectly. If the air pressure pushes the piston down, you weren't at TDC.=
=20
For two of the pistons you have the pulley mark. For the other two you must=
=20
use a screwdriver to feel TDC. Once you get it to hold, then mark the 180=B0=
=20
position on the pulley for further tests.
