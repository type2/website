Subject: Re: [T2] Front Beam Question

Yes worth it.

It is a bolt in repair - no reason to trash a whole bus.

You need to either order a rebuilt beam from the catalogs or locate a good 
used one.

I would rebuild it before you install it.

The used beam maybe as cheap as free (I know where a cheap FREE beam is for 
a '70 model), or as high as $300.

This is a job YOU can do for yourself with some help to lift it in place. 
You need a jack, some good jack stands, a concrete surface, etc. A lift 
would be even better.
