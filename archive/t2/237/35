There is a port between the two right intake runners on the air distribution
box.  On my bus there is a vacuum hose that goes to the fuel pressure
regulator.  Disconnect the hose, plug it, and connect your gauge to the
manifold.

I'm told 15" of vacuum is on the low end of acceptable. This is at sea level
(vacuum drops 1" for every 1000 feet above).
