Subject: "Blown Jug" on '77 Westfalia Van

My mechanic tells me my van has a blown cylinder.  I live in N. 
Wisconsin and far from any dedicated VW mechanics.  My mechanic is a 
competent, honest man.  He will remove the engine but hasn't worked 
on a bus since the early '70s and is hesitant to take on a rebuild 
(he is the guy everybody goes to and can't cut the time from most of 
us desperate ones that need work done right now to get the clunker to 
work).  He suggested getting a "long block" and having him install it 
as he can find time.  There are other guys in the area that have 
worked on aircooled engines...he is checking with them on the expense 
of a part by part rebuild, but I do not know their expertise.

Suggestions of where to get a long block that is likely to be worth 
installing in the van?  I looked around on the internet and have 
found prices from about 1100$ to 1500$.

The van is a '77 Westphalia with 190K miles.  I had the engine 
rebuilt at about 85K and have had the manual transmission replaced. 
I drive it only on camping trips in the summer and just love this 
thing, having owned it since 1982.  I am a single guy 55 years old 
and have 2 little autistic kids and would pay to cut the chances of 
breaking down a thousand miles from home.

Your experise/experience/advice/suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

Dan
