Easier than that - wire it to wire that is hot when the key is off. The 
main red wire coming from the rear of the bus comes to mind. PART of your 
fuse panel is hot all the time. Move the radio power wire to one of those 
circuits.

They make a nice little piggy-back terminal that allows you to slide off a 
female spade terminal, slide on this adapter, and then you have two male 
spade terminals - one for the original female and 1 extra for anything you 
want to wire it to.

Any of your local electrical supply houses will carry this.

Carburetor or fuel injection?
