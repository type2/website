Yes, buzzers drive me bonkers, too.

I took the cube buzzer box found below bottom of fuse box base . . .

and I bought a 'ding - dong' chime from Radio Shack (a couple of bucks). I 
wired the 'ding -dong' chime to the guts of the buzzer box. I needed the 
base of the box for the prongs to go back into the fuse box base.

This was the smallest chime I could get, but still much too loud.  So I 
glued some foam rubber on the chime body to reduce some noise.

Not overly loud, but just annoying enough.

Key in ignition (on or off), and driver door opened, and 'ding - ding'...

I really, really needed a buzzer to warn me when I left my lights on.

Thanks to someone on the list, I wired a tiny, tiny buzzer to my light 
switch (no soldering needed).  Works great!!  Excerpt if I push the head 
light switch in 1/2 way and only the parking lights stay on.  No alert then.

Time to go out and wire up my backup lights to a musical alarm . . .
