Nikki-
Check to see if you have snow tires or big 4X4 tires !

No?!  OK, then-
Grab the front wheel at the top and wiggle very hard
( or jack the front and hands at 6 and 12 0'clock ).
Any play indicates wheel bearings /adjustment / replacement.
( Hands at 3 and 9 will show play in steering components ).
Only one side fails at a time, but pull both wheels and
clean/ repack/ replace bearings ( get new wheel seals ).

As for the squirrely noise, check the engine fan for rodents:)
Have you oticed more power recently ? 8^)
