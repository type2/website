are you meaning the front as the end closest to the driver or closest to the
tranny? The one closest to the driver is the one I am having trouble with.
It's old bushing is down inside the tube and no matter where I put the
shifter the bushing only comes about an inch closer. Should I just bugger
the heck out of the old one with a screwdriver and needle nose pliers and
hope I get it all?

Thanks for the advice
