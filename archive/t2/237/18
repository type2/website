I cant wait for these things to start showing up at shows and the owners
bebopping over to me to discuss our "buses". I think the first thing out of
my mouth will be "thats not a Bus, thats an Audi with some serious issues."
I mean where are the round headlights??? Did they just miss the fact that
for it to be truely retro it needs the round headlights? The freaking
article couldn't even get the location of the Kombi correct. They are
building the VANAGON in South Africa and the Kombi in South America
(Brasil). From what I have heard they will build the new Micro in South
Africa, Germany and Mexico. (The golf production was recently moved to
Brasil from Mexico so the plant could be retooled).
