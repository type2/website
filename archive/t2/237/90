Complete exhaust systen with crossover both heater boxes, both headder
pipes with both good U bends (no muffler)  Price $120.00
Heater flappers with the oval inlet $30.00 the pair.
One pair 0220101-372-6 VW OEM Deep Recessed Oval Exhaust Port Cylinder
heads, boy are these ugly. One looks to be OK and useable after a
cleaning and the other has a seat dropped back into the port but appears
to be rebuildable. Price for the Pair $90.00
If you need anything else out of the engine bay let me know.
I need the crank but I'll take $80.00 for the case, rods, cam, lifters.
