Subject: How to wire stove for 1978 Westy ?

I have a 1978 Westy deluxe that was missing the sink / stove cabinet
when I purchased it. I found a new cabinet in good shape and want to
install it. I see a long red wire with a push on connector, and a short brown
wire with push on connector (I take it to be ground ?). 

Just to make it more confusing, the long red wire is connected
in the middle to a 4-way small square black connector.
in the bottom is one red wire, other red long wire with push
on connector out the bottom. Out the top are two 6" black
wires that today are not connected to anything ??

Can someone advise me on how to wire this up ? Is there
some documentation on the site I have missed ?

Thanks!
Dean
