Subject: Re: [T2] One version of why we are "orphans" of VW

Been listening to my (free) Opera browser read to me a series of 
articles called the "GM Death Watch". VW is not the only brand 
wandering around in the dark. http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com

Led to some interesting reading about the UAW and management indicating 
both were at fault (imagine making $65 a year to mow the grass or sweep 
the floor, A++ benefits too)... Guess I'll just keep what I've got. A 
'99 CR-V with 125K miles - flawless performance since new, and a '97 VW 
Cabrio (also 125K miles) with very good service for 25K miles... Old 
bus, old Beetle too.
