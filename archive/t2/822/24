<True. However, I'd bet the folks that turned that car back in were 
happy to take the loss and walk away. Hopefully someone at that dealer 
recognized that they will never sell a car to that couple again.>

tell the whole world about the experience. We tell all about our 1999 
experience of buying a new Honda. We got a deal after a month of 
shopping and wading through the lies... Chris
