Subject: Re: [T2] Which dizzy - crazy shipping prices!

Little word about CB to everyone from someone who used to live a few miles
away (they are in a small farming town) and is friends with Claude's (Claude's
Buggies = CB) Great grandson.

They serve a very large crowd of central california dune folks and hotrod
craptastic bug/type3 drivers with stinger pipes.  They sell a lot of 009's,
chrome fan shrouds, ignition kits and lime green sparkplug wires.

Then they manufacture/resell some higher end stuff.

Point is, in a tiny town, with locals working, an entrenched internet business
and the dune crowd, they just don't approach busdrivers like the busdepot or
the busboys (why don't we hear about them?) do.

What about type2parts.com?  I bought a transmission from them, shipped, from
AZ - CA and was quite satisfied, service after sale while I was up to my butt
in tranny fluid was excellent.
