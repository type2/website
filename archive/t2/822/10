The dealers did this to themselves.  Not satisfied with simply maintaining
the car to the manufacturer's specifications, they decided to make service
a bigger profit center by creating their own "recommended service" that
includes many unneeded items.

I don't have a modern VW or BMW, but our Scion is a great example.  Toyota
gives three free oil changes with the car, but new owners found themselves
being presented with $100+ charges at the first "free" service.  The
problem was that they were asked "Do you want the regular service?" and
answered "yes".  Well, the dealer's idea of "regular service" was
"any charges the dealer wants to tack on" including tire rotation, topping
off the windshield washer fluid, lubing the muffler bearings, etc.  In
order to get just what the manufacturer recommends, the owner has to be
careful to specify, in writing, that they want the "manufacturer's
recommended service only."

When the customer has to resort to legalese to simply get a reasonable
service done, it is no wonder that Jiffy Lube is so popular!
