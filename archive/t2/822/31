Subject: Re: [T2]Fuel filler hose

You're calling it a hose(rubber), but are you talking about tube/pipe(metal)?

Check the archives.  I believe there is an American size for this hose
Maybe 2 3/8"? (Gas tank to metal fuel filler pipe, right?)
that is a workable solution.

Or are you talking about the metal tube itself?

Bustedbus(CO) or the Busco(WA) should be able to come up with a tube.

There's nothing stainless steel on your bus, by the way, nor are chainlink
fence posts (Al?).

Stainless is expensive, and generally reserved for applications that require
it's anti-corrosive/sanitary properties.
