Subject: Engine Install Question (Leaning)

Thanks to all who replied to my previous question regarding the 2.0L into a 
74 westy.  I install the motor and tranny this afternoon but it appears to be 
leaning towards one side??  It leans towards the passangers side by about 2" or 
so.  Everything is snugged but not fully torqued.  Are there any adjusting 
points? Here is some background.
 Ive intalled a 78 2.0 into a 74 westy.  Converted to a 2brl carb, and 091 
tranny.  Everything fits fine, its just leaning??  Any suggestions, where I 
should look, what may cause this or is there a way to adjust??  One more thing, 
the bus is still jacked up and the passangers CV is still disconected.....

Any suggestions would help..
thanks in advance
and have a HAPPY TURKEY DAY.
