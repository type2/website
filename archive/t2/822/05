Subject: Re: [T2] One version of why we are "orphans" of VW

I find this irritation with VW a little misplaced. Yes, they have been 
hostile to their legacy cars at the corporate level. But look at the 
list of car companies that have completely withdrawn from the U.S. 
market (or vanished completely) since our buses were new:

Austin (okay, BL)
Fiat
MG (BL again, then MG/Rover)
Peugeot
Renault
Sunbeam
Triumph

In other words, all the cool (exotic but affordable) cars of the 60s 
and 70s. No dealers, no presence. I find that fewer and fewer people 
under the age of 40 even know what an MG or a Fiat is.

It's Thanksgiving. We should count our blessings.
