We have a Nissan Quest (94, with 222,000 mi now, made in USA) and a 2004 
Subaru Forester for its 4WD, bought for home business use.  re the $40K 
comment, the Forester was/is a great vehicle for $24,000- we passed up 
the tax break on the heavy Toureg as it was TOO new and a gas guzzler. 
Over its life the Quest has cost a lot more to operate than our 78 Westy 
with its 245,000mi.  Micky mouse stuff that seems simple is a lot of 
labor and always ends up to be $400 to fix- like fuel pump inside the 
gas tank, ex. manifold that warped and leaked, struts (not as simple as 
a shock), radiator mounts that crack (plastic and not replacable), all 
designed it seems to me with the assumption the vehicle will be traded 
in before anyone needs to fix it. But the SO loves it- comfort, heat, 
AC, 7 passenger, and amazingly, still runs as an automatic.  (We won't 
mention the time it stopped running and it was a cracked crank- luckily 
a junkyard engine was available with many less miles). Or recently, the 
odometer quit and involved an expensive electronic sensor in the 
transmission of all places!
    Bus content: I just scratch my head at what it takes to reach the 
spark plugs in the Quest- give me the simplicity of the FI bus! All it 
needs is a $4 cable between the wheel and odometer!
