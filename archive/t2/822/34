Subject: Re: [T2] One version of why we are "orphans" of VW

 At the moment the Honda Element looks to me
most like the VW bus of the 1960-1970s. Some of Honda's concept cars include
mesh seats, laminate flooring and integral pet carriers. And it wouldn't be
much of a stretch to envision a Dormobile camper conversion on an Element
platform.



As the owner of a 2004 Honda Element and a '75 Westy, I couldn't agree more. You couldn't give me one of todays Volkswagens. Ironically, back in the 80's I had a friend who drove nothing but Hondas. He and I constantly traded insults about each others cars (Honda vs. VW). We lost touch for about 10 years, 3 weeks ago I ran into him at the grocery store, me in my Element and him in his...Toureg!! (SP?) We had a good laugh over me driving a Honda and him driving a VW, but when I asked him how he liked his Toureg, he went on and on about what a POS it is, and he was about to put it in the shop for the XXth time for transmission troubles, and when he got it back he was going to get rid of it. His wife has a new Beetle that has also been a POS. Luckily, when my wife wanted a new Beetle a couple of years ago, Stohlman VW it Tysons Corner Va. treated us so poorly we left-they treated us like crap BEFORE we were about to buy a car from them, what would they have been like after? On a side note, I do have to admit the parts guys at Stohlman are great, if a part for an old air cooled is still available from VW, they will get it for you, more than I can say for other VW dealers in my area. They found me a set of retaining plates for the front disk brake pads on my '75, when everyone else (except Scott (-at-) German Supply) told me they were NLA. I have to agree with the previous post that said VW started going downhill after Heinz Nordoff left.    Jeff
