Subject: Re: [T2]Fuel filler hose

I went to a marine shop and got a piece of hose there.  Then I got some 
hefty clamps and cinched that sucker on there.  That hose is made for 
cooling water/engine exhaust so it's super tough stuff.  It's got steel 
in it so it makes it a little bit difficult to work with, but it'll 
probably last forever.
