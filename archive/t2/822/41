Subject: heater Y

Hi all,

I have a bit of a delimma concerning my heater plumbing.  I 
checked the archives and was unable to find a description of 
what muxt be done to remove and replace the metal Y shaped 
collector where the heat comes from the two heat exchangers and 
collect into the one large duct that goes up the middle of the 
bus.  It appears that it is some how welded onto the underside 
of the floor.  Has anyone had success removing the old one (mine 
is swiss cheese) and replacing it with either a servicable used 
one or some adequate substitute?  Thanks, in advance.

Jeff
