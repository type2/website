Subject: Re: [T2] One version of why we are "orphans" of VW

I was going to stay out and just enjoy this thread, but the comment 
below reminded me of what I was told by Obie Bradshaw, owner of Obie's 
Domestic and Import Auto Repair in Pendleton, OR.

Up until 2003, Obie's was a VW Authorized Auto Repair Facility. In 
2003, Obie declined to renew his association with VW.  The reason? VWoA 
insisted that he purchase $160k of new 'approved' tools to deal with 
vehicles like the Phaeton.  Obie ended a thirty year relationship.

Can't say as I blame him.

And he's still the very best shop in the area. A shop that you could 
send the in-laws to.
