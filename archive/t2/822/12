my wife has a saturn and I have to say they have great service even
unscheduled stuff, and in her case a rocker arm broke, towed it in, next
day picked it up $0 bill.  now when it goes in I always take it and
specify exactly what I want done, they give me this long reccomended list
and I check only those jobs I want to be done.  they,ve never done
anything I didn't tell em to do.

now my 78 bus I took to a dealer about 2 years ago for a factory recall,
and they told me they would get the part needed and call me when it came
in,  (I finally did the repair myself) I'm still waiting for the call....
