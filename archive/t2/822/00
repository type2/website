Ron,  tell me about it.  I bought a 2004 Touareg with moderately high 
expectations and VWoA and its dealer network missed every one of them.

Great concept; mediocre implementation (too many nickle/dime problems that 
never should have made it out of the factory); rude and offensive "service" 
from dealers that treat you like dirt (based on four different dealerships 
since Weatherill sold his franchise to Fred Beans).  I am getting really 
tired of being sneared at by Philadelphia-wise-guy-wannabe mechanics when I 
report a problem with a truck that should not have any.  It's almost like 
I'm bothering them and disturbing their day...

Fortunately, Philly is home to a law firm that has its own VW-only Lemon Law 
practice.  This coming March, VWoA will see what insulting service and 
crappy quality does for business.  We confidently expect a full buy-back.

No buy back will erase the ill-will I feel for VW.  I've driven VWs or Audis 
almost exclusively since I was still 15 years old, driving my 1961 Beetle in 
the big field next to our house.  Between this shabby treatment and the 
agressive way they went after VW-enthusiast websites and suppliers a few 
years ago, they have done a great job alienating me.

The Phaeton was an answer to a question nobody asked. Nobody spending that
much money on a luxury car wants one with a HUGE (and I mean almost
Bus-sized) VW emblem on the grille. This is a status-symbol price range,
after all, and the VW logo on your car does not exude "I've arrived." That
said, the article's statement that "As for the Phaeton, it was delivered to
tepid reviews" is factually inaccurate. Generally the Phaeton received rave
reviews compared to other cars in its price range. What got less stellar
reviews from the auto mags that did long-term reports on the Phaeton were
the VW dealerships that serviced their Phaetons under warranty. The dealers
tended to treat Phaeton owners as if they were $20k Jetta owners. They
nickeled-and-dimed them, trying to squeeze $30 out of them on items that
should have been warranteed when they already paid $80k for the car six
months earlier. Failed to wash the car after a scheduled service
appointment. Screwed up the same warranty repair two or three times in a
row. Basically they had no clue how someone who spends $80k on his car (and
is used to Mercedes and BMW service departments) is accustomed to being
treated. This is the "tea and krumpets" crowd. They want to be treated like
they are important. VW has lost its strongest dealers over the years due, as
they have moved on to more lucrative marquees.  Many who are left consider
their VW franchise hardly more than an afterthought, and treat their
customers accordingly.

I noticed the difference myself. Besides several Type 2's, we own a Passat
4motion and a Mini Cooper convertible. The Passat 4motion cost more than the
Mini; before the Phaeton and Touerag came out it was the top of their range.
The Mini, by comparison, is BMW's entry-level product. I get treated much
better when I bring the Mini in for repair than the Passat. The Mini/BMW
dealers are accustomed to the expectations of high-brow customers who own
$100k cars, and this extends to their treatment of Mini owners. The VW
dealers treat their customes indifferently. The Passat has generally been a
great car, but I've had to fight with VW over every little defect, and then
bring the car back three times to see it fixed right. By comparison the BMW
dealer gives me a loaner, offers me coffee and donuts, thanks me for my
business, and fixes the car right the first time within hours of my arrival.
This experience has been consistent between several VW and BMW dealerships.

Some are saying that the Phaeton will be a bargain in a few years, its
failure having driven the resale price to rock-bottom on what is
unmistakably an excellent car. Unfortunately this is likely to be offset by
the fact that service and parts support may be nearly nonexistent or
expensive. BMW prides themselves on the fact that if you own a vintage BMW
2002, you can still get 90% of its parts at your local dealer. That shows a
real commitment to their owners. VW cannot make the same promise to owners
of 1984 Vanagons, much less 1970's models like a BMW 2002.  They are
distancing themselves from their roots rather than capitalizing on and
embracing them. Therefore, while the Phaeton itself may be a bargain on the
market in five or ten years, I fear that you'd might as well own a Lancia or
Delorean when it comes to getting parts or service for it, given VW's recent
history.

The sad truth is that VW is in a very tough situation right now. Low to mid
priced cars are not particularly profitable for auto manufacturers, so even
companies such as Hyundai are trying to move upscale to where the profits
are. But with the current value of the Euro, it is almost impossible for VW
to compete with cars made in Korea or even the U.S. (where many Korean and
Japanese branded cars are made) in the low to mid end of the market. Even
Mexican production only helps so much, since so many components are German
made. VW can't compete price-wise in the low to mid end, and can't compete
image or service wise in the high end. Obviously, their future is returning
to their "people's car" roots, as the New Beetle's success clearly proved.
(That and their TDI, given the current price of gas.) But they need to do
some serious streamlining to make this profitable.  Unfortunately, German
manufacturing won't get them there, as much as I wish it would. Neither will
rebadging Chrysler minivans. (The Minivan craze is over; if VW was going to
capitalize on their invention of that category in the 1960's, they should
have done it 15 years ago when the category was experiencing its
resurgence.) Neither would the $50,000 "Microbus" concept, had they decided
to run with it. It needed to be half that price, even if that meant forgoing
the DVD players and heated seats.

Of course nobody wants VW to succeed more than I do. But at the same time I
have to admit that I wouldn't buy stock in VW today. They have drifted for a
very long time. They need another success in the direction of the New
Beetle, but are late to realize this. I really do hope they can make a quick
about-face now that there is some new blood. I am still rooting for them,
despite the fact that as an aftermarket VW parts supplier and a VW owner for
the last two decades, I can't say I really feel like they are rooting for
me.
