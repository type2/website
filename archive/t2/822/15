Subject: Re: [T2] Living out of a Bus on the road with Kids 

One of my tenants tells me that his mom&dad
bought not a bus but a motor home and then
volunteered for a (US) National Park Service
program wherein if they man concessions stands,
sweep this or that, or otherwise do odd jobs
at parks selected for them by NPS then they 
can live in their motor home at said parks
free of charge.  This couple sold their house
to buy the motor home and put some cash in the
bank, and have thus been living out of that
vehicle for about a decade, all in national
parks.  Apparently assignments are seasonal
and not necessarily close to each other, but
that pleases them and their new-found vagabond
tendencies.  ("We booked for two months at
The Black Hills and have a week to get there,
great!")  Program is aimed at retirees, as
one might guess.
