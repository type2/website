Subject: Re: [T2] Which dizzy - crazy shipping prices!

CB burns Canadians too Lee, don't take it personal. It seems that they aren
t really into shipping stuff out of the U.S. as far as I can gather, as
their prices are ridiculous to ship stuff to the same continent. The same
thing shipped to Washington state is 1/4 the price. Ship it across the
border to me and it's 4 times as much. Go figure. Try BusDepot, they are
awesome, and they don't screw us foreigners. In fact, Ron ate the shipping
on something he sent to me one day, because the online quote was way lower
than what it turned out to be. That made me a believer in BusDepot

Take care,
Courtney



Thanks for the distributor info guys, and it looks like the best one to
go for is just an OEM stock single vac advance, for example:

Unfortunately CBP want $75 to ship a distributor to the UK!!!...

and I thought they had decomissioned Concorde <salutes> ; )

How much do you reckon it really costs to ship something the size and
weight of a distributor to the UK ? (I just received a whole Westy tent
and that only cost $115 to send!)

wow
