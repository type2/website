it is the hose that connects to the gas tank and runs to the fuel filler neck hose bit that connects to the actual backing of the gas cap....

i have replaced the one behind the gas cap(rubber elbow) so its good but the actual hose is now busted leaking lots of gas....

i thought of buying a stainless steal pipe same size and using the good off the hose on each end to make up for the actual hose ...
thoughts on this or a link to the hose would be nice..?

i just cant find it if i could i would have replaced it when i replaced the one behind the gas cap....
rubber elbow thing..

there is a stainless steel pipe that connects from the rubber elbow and then into the great big fuel hose that connects to the tank...
i need the great big hose ....

thanks
peace
