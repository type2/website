Subject: Mythbusters european car

Anyone knows what is the model and name of the car that allegedly got busted
between two semi in the Discovery Mythbusters show. They kept saying that it
was a "Small European Car" but i wasn't too convinced . The poor guy who
gave the small car to the show got his 2 minutes of celebrity...

BTW, these guys would need a bit more mechanical engineering background in
order to properly smack cars.

Bus content : at some point i thought it was a Porsche 914
