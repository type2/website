for the education of the children ;8*} in our midst Heinz Nordoff was head
of VW (CEO, VW Germany) from 1948-1968 dying after collapsing on the
company plane while still in charge.  he lived long enough to introduce
the Bay Window bus and the 411/412.  maybe the high point in the history
of VW....the 412 held on until 1974 and the bus until 1979, thus endth the
Nordhoff era.
