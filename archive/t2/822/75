Actually, that would be a big stretch.  The Element has a fraction of the
interior volume of a bus in a much larger footprint.  You gotta pay for
those crush zones!

You're right about the "practical car fans" though.  Several people on the
list have acquired Scion xBs, a Freidolin built by Toyota.  It isn't a
bus, but it has the combination of huge interior room on a small footprint
that appeals to a lot of us.
