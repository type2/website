If you are desperate (first try Tractor or truck supply stores for large 
hoses) you can wrap over the leaky area- in my case it was split hosing 
near where it joined the metal, and one could smell it in the rear- : 
Take flashing and cut so you can wrap it around the bad hose with 
overlap.  Glop the flashing and hose with a gas resistant silicone. 
Messy because I was reaching through that big accesss hole- Fasten it 
with large hose clamps and let dry.  It is not under pressure if venting 
is proper.
