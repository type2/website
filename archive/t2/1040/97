Subject: RE: [T2] Broken rear carrier mounts on a 1600 DP... What to do?

Excellent info and much appreciated.  One question: Would the Bug engine
adaptor plate work as a complete replacement for the messed up "bosses"?
(thanks for my new word for the day: "Boss: The reinforced extension on
a part that holds a mounting pin, bolt, or stud."  Who knew?)?   In
other words, would it fit despite the fact that there are two existing
(though unusable) bosses?

Two part answer

#2 the rear carrier is just for the bus and you most certainly could
install this engine in a Beetle

keeping that in mind

#1 an adapter plate is available which allows the use of a Beetle engine
in a bus.  Repairing the broken boss is not cheap.
