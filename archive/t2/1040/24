Subject: Westy Luggage Rack Buffer Rods

Well, after a little research I found out what they are called but I was
wondering where you folks get them or what you have used for them.

I need new "buffer rods" for my 1971 Westfalia's luggage rack (those six poles
on the top).  I thought about using some electrical conduit, but drilling all
those holes seems to be a chore.  Not to mention, my rack is not only missing
the rods but also the spacers between the fiberglass and the roof.

Suggestions?

Thanks,
