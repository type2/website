Subject: question about conversion to vanagon brakes

I had some strange issues with the rear vanagon-to-late bay drum-brake 
conversion yesterday.  First, when we put the drums on, they were 
rubbing against the backing plates.  My guess is because the guys at the 
yard banged on the backing plates instead of the alignment pin.  I'm 
going to pull off the shoes and check all the tolerances to make sure 
it's bent back into place - yes, I am using vanagon drums.

The other weird issue was when I pressed on the brake - it wouldn't lock 
up the rear wheel.  I had my friend press hard on the brake and I could 
still spin the wheel with a big wrench on the big nut.  I would think 
that pressing on the brake should be able to lock up the rear wheel, so 
that was kinda strange... and this was after bleeding both rear brakes.

Any thoughts on what's up?  I'm wondering if there's some air in the 
lines somewhere.  A good amount of fluid drained out of the rear lines 
while we were doing the change-over.

Thanks,
mike
