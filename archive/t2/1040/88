Was written: My 71 Westy (all stock), despite having had much recent TLC and
newly rebuilt carb, is still acting up a bit. This happens when the engine is
hot, after having been driven for a while. When you step on the gas right off
idle, it want's to die and has not pickup. After the RPM's come up just a
little, it's fine and accelerates briskly (relatively speaking). Before I
rebult the carb, I had a Brosol 34PICT-3 in - same thing. The carb I rebuilt
is a Solex, had the throttle shafts redone and everything. Not sure where to
go from here.

All stock including the correct dual vacuum unit dist, part # 211-905-205Q,
timed at 5 after WITH vacuum working on the retard side?

Or are you running the NOT stock 009, centrifugal advance only, dist that
consistantly has this stumble problem?
