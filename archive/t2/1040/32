They are plugged into the bottom of the fuse block under the dash.  You
have to unclip the thing and lift it up to expose them.  Be careful, the
plastic is fragile and you're disturbing a lot of wires.  Disconnect the
battery ground before fiddling with this, as it is easy to ground things
out on the body.
