Great article.....Actually, however in the song the magic bus is a city
bus.  "Who" cares though, the soul of the article comes through loud and
clear.  I've always found that the "magic" of the bus attracts at least one
or two people at every campground I've been in on a daily basis.  It never
ceases to amaze me.
