Subject: Broken rear carrier mounts on a 1600 DP... What to do?

I finally got around to pulling the motor out of a junked '71 I've had
sitting in my yard for 4 years.  The Bus had been wrecked as a result of
a runaway flatbed truck hitting it by the left rear wheel and while I
knew its running days were over (twisted axle, crushed left side, etc.),
I kept it around for parts and its strong and relatively new Brazilian
1600.  My intention was to transplant the Brazilian motor into my
replacement '71.

Unfortunately, when I yanked on the engine to extract it from the
rusting hulk, the rear carrier bar came right off into my hands,
presumably as a result of the impact to the body.  One of the two big
bolts had sheered in half, leaving a chunk in the case.  I assume that I
could find someone with an easy-out or something similar to get the
offending stub out.  More problematic was the other bolt.  The blow
broke part of the short, stubby "tube" that makes up the female side in
the case, completely freeing the bolt.  There doesn't seem to be any
damage to the case other than this one piece but its days as a mounting
location are over.  (note: this case never had a hole for the third and
smaller carrier bolt but I've run Busses for years like this without any
problems)

I have two questions:
	(1) Is there any way a new female "tube" mount could be welded
on the case or should I just assume that this engine will never go back
into a Bus again?

	(2) Aren't the rear carriers just a requirement for Busses?  In
other words, could I use this motor in a Ghia or a Bug as is?

Thanks for any advice!

Nick
