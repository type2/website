Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Servo differences

I have a '77 booster in my '73.  The later booster is slightly larger 
and will press up against (I think) the axle tube when installed, but it 
does fit.  The later booster provides more assist and makes the bus 
brake like a more modern vehicle.  I don't think I will ever go back to 
the older style.  I assume the '73 booster is the same as the '71 booster.
