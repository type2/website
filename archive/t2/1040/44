Subject: 71 Westy Brakes

First...  I want to thank everyone who has helped me thus far with my brake
saga on my 1971 Westfalia.  Maybe I will get this fixed soon but I am not
there yet.

To bring everyone up to date...  here is where I am at...
-1971 Westfalia with 1776 single-port
-vacuum obtained via a tapped port on the intake (about 3/8" in size)
-new shoes and brake cylinders on the back
-new pads on the front calipers
-new master cylinder
-I just rebuilt the calipers
-I just (I thought) bled the brake system and fluid appears to flows freely
through the system

The problem is that while the back drum brakes will engage when you hit the
petal, you must be almost all the way to the floor before the back drum brakes
catch.  I have jacked up the vehicle to check to see if the calipers will
engage.  They will but you must pump the pedal two or three times before the
front calipers engage.

So, to stop you currently press the pedal and right before it gets to the
floor the back brakes catch. (good thing I just adjusted the back brakes)
Then if you still haven't stopped, you pump the pedal and the front calipers
start to catch.  This is not a real safe feeling.

Suggestions?

Thanks ahead of time,
