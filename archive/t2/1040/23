Subject: Mystery Wire / Intermittent Engine Failure...

During the process of tracing wires and trying to solve an intermittent
engine failure where my fuel pump is not working, i've run into a mystery
wire, up-front, under the steering wheel, very near the fuse box that seems to
go nowhere.  This is on an automatic 77 westfalia camper, no ac.  It is a wire
that comes out of an in-line fuse connect, the wires for the fuse are red, and
on one end, this black wire with green and white stripes comes out.
I've
posted pictures here: http://www.lifeasbob.com/2008/05/31/MysteryVWWire.aspx
The wire is about 8 inches long, and ends in a blue crimp device looked like
to splice two wires together, not a male or femal spade type of
connector.  Everything works fine in the bus, except an occasional engine
failure (hah !), maybe this is related, maybe it isn't, so I'm hoping someone
can take a look.  It looks long enough to reach just about anywhere, up into
the steering column, to the back of the fuse box, or up the dash panel, might
even be able to reach the wiper motor.
I wasn't able to find the wire on the
wiring diagram, somehow reading the diagram for my 69 bus is so much simpler
than the 77 !
Anyhelp is appreciated.
Thanks
Bob

Hmm... I don't know what that wire is. My 78 doesn't have
one like
that. It could be a westy thing, or if your bus came with A/C or an
automatic trans there could be different wiring.

Post the pic to the list.
Chris or Richard should know what it is.
