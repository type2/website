Subject: Re: Time to rotate the tires... YAY!!!!

Jason said:
Though it may seem like little reason to get excited, my need to rotate
mytires can mean only one thing... It's actually being DRIVEN!!!!! Even with
the high price of gas, I still love my bus too much to park it. So here's my
question... or rather questions: This being the first time Ihave ever rotated
my own tires, and tires on a very nit-picky vehiclenonetheless, is there a
specific pattern I need to rotate the tires in? Also, once the tires are
rotated, do I need to reset the air pressure forall the tires? It seems as if
the rear tires have more air since they carrythe brunt of the weight. With
that, do I go with the air pressure suggestedon the tires or the frame of the
bus? Any recommendations on air pressure? I am driving Hankook RA08s and I
would just like to make sure that I rotatethem properly so that I get the best
possible wear out of them.

I would rotate them front to back on the same side.  Yes, the pressure is
higher in the rear. Never go by the max pressure listed on the tire. That is
only the tire makers max pressure for that tire. Always go by the vehicle
makers recommendation. But in your case, with RA08's, the general consensus is
the 40 in the front and 48 in the rear.
