Subject: Time to rotate the tires... YAY!!!!

Though it may seem like little reason to get excited, my need to rotate my
tires can mean only one thing... It's actually being DRIVEN!!!!!

Even with the high price of gas, I still love my bus too much to park it.

So here's my question... or rather questions: This being the first time I
have ever rotated my own tires, and tires on a very nit-picky vehicle
nonetheless, is there a specific pattern I need to rotate the tires in?

Also, once the tires are rotated, do I need to reset the air pressure for
all the tires? It seems as if the rear tires have more air since they carry
the brunt of the weight. With that, do I go with the air pressure suggested
on the tires or the frame of the bus? Any recommendations on air pressure?

I am driving Hankook RA08s and I would just like to make sure that I rotate
them properly so that I get the best possible wear out of them.

TIA!
