Subject: Excellent windows

The '68 I got the door parts off of has excellent
windows - all except the windshield. The left side,
both mid and rear have opening wing windows in near
perfect shape, the slider has one also. The gaskets
seem to still be resilient also.

Driver & passenger wings and roll-ups appear very good
but rubber is slightly to moderately deteriorating.

How would a person remove the gasketed windows without
destroying the gaskets (seals)? (Working alone!)

Is there any interest in these windows? I'm still
wavering on them - not my first choice for Bus2 - I
want sliders.

I have taken photos of them I can e-mail if yer
interested. -BaH
