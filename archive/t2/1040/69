Subject: Gas Smell - 71 Westy

Pretty much all the time, I get a pretty strong  gasoline smell in and around 
the engine compartment. I've replaced all the evap  hoses, except the one 
from the canister to the metal tube up near the gas  filler, and the charcoal 
canister looks to be intact. I'll put a replacement on  for that last hose 
tomorrow. I don't see any gas in or under the engine  compartment. I mostly notice 
it when the bus is not running, but maybe that's  because when I'm going down 
the road I'm just leaving a trail of fumes behind  me. 

My carburetor is newly rebuilt including rebushed throttle shaft by  RIMCO. I 
noticed this even before I re-did the carb. 

Everything is stock  and all the bit are there.
