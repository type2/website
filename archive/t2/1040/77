Subject: Brake Servo differences

What are the differences in the brake servos (boosters) on the various year
models?  I have a 1971 Westy and a 1976 Transporter parts bus.  Would the
servos interchange?  If not why?  I know the motors were completely different
but would the later model servo work on the earlier model?  All the bolts and
placements look the same.

Thanks,
