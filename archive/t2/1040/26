Subject: RE: [T2] Westy Luggage Rack Buffer Rods

I went to Home Depot and used the poles that hold up shelving. I made it so
there are a few more than the stock poles and they are fairly light but still
allow me to put some weight on my rear rack - I'm storing my spare tire up
there.

I just had to cut the poles to length and I used bolts to secure them.
