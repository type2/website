Subject: Brake Booster air direction

My understanding is that the check valve is there to hold vacuum on the  
servo if the engine stalls, so that you still have booster vacuum for a few  pedal 
strokes even if the engine is not running.  The original check valve  on my 
71 was completely roasted, not holding vacuum and as soon as the engine  
stalled, the brake pedal got stiff.  Now, with a new check valve, I get 5  or 6 
pedal strokes.
 
Of course, the engine is not supposed to stall.  I more or less have  the 
under control now, too.
