Thanks, Martin.  I managed to verify last night that power (12 volts) is
getting to the emergency flasher (with key off).  Battery terminals are
very clean, haven't yet gotten to the solenoid terminals.

However....  (and here's a real rookie question)  Where in the world are
the flasher relays on a 71?  I have a Haynes (yes, I know I should get
the Bentley, but I needed something and that's all they had), and it
just mentions where they are on a 68-69.

>Any ideas out there on what might be bad?  Could I still have a bad
ground on the turn signal relay that would exhibit itself this way?  Or
a bad ignition switch or bad relay?  *sigh*  I spent much of my day
yesterday in the driveway fiddling with things and running to the FLAPS
for bulbs and battery.  If I had a spare relay handy, I would try
throwing it in there.  I didn't have any electronic cleaner spray,
either, and I need to remember to go buy some of that for better
cleaning the turn signal assembly.

Yes, the emergency flashers should come on regardless of the key
position. I would first use a multimeter to check the voltage at various
parts of the system such as at the relay and the turn lights so you can
at least work out if they have voltage, no voltage or low voltage.

From your earlier symptoms it would be worth cleaning the major points
in the system: battery terminals, generator terminals, solenoid
terminals, and coating them with some sort of anti-corrosion stuff.
