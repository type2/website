Subject: vanagon drum brake life vs late bay

So, I noticed that the vanagon self-adjusting brakes really only adjust 
on the top half of the brakes, not the bottom half, which is the same 
half as the cylinder.  This was also confirmed in Sean Bartnik's drum 
brake shoe replacement and his rant about this issue.

So, how does the life of the vanagon drum brakes shoes compare to the 
late bay shoes?  Is there a significant difference?

thanks,
Mike
