Subject: Re: [T2] What's So Bad About 009 Distributor?

I'd collect more mileage data before drawing any conclusions.  One data
point can be misleading.

I use a 009 in my bug with a 30PICT.  Works fine.  In my bus with a
30/31PICT (which is more like the 34PICT that is stock) the 009 wasn't
good.  A SVDA distributor was better.
