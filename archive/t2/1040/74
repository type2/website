Andrew, the idea is to get vacuum to the booster, so the test would be
to apply vacuum to each end of the valve, and which ever end provides
the most flow goes toward the source of vacuum (manifold/carb).

Haven't had to replace one yet, but most cars with vacuum assisted
power brakes use some sort of check valve. Check the regular type II
vendors first.
