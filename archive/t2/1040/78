Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Servo differences

Hey Martin,

According to Richard Atwell, they did change the servo size in '74 
(http://www.ratwell.com/technical/FAQ/FAQContent.html) (scroll down to 
6.9).  I'm sure it is only inches in difference but I am not sure if 
they are interchangeable through the years.  Although, Bus Depot has two 
different boosters listed and they do look differently
