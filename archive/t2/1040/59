Subject: Why Stalling when hot?

When really hot (3 hrs into  driving from Savannah to NJ, at her 65+
speed) we stopped to switch drivers on an on ramp.  Stopped her FI 75
bus as we dug out some drinks.  She started the bus, and said it did not
seem to rev up, let it idle, and it stalled.  Resisted restarting (would
catch ok, then stall).  I checked the hoses, especially the one to the
brake assist that had a cracked connector under the bus that I siliconed
and taped up in Savannah when she had complained of poor braking and
some stalling until hot. The dipstick was not too hot to hold.
     We let it cool to under 200 on the oil temp, then started it and it
stayed revving, so we took off and drove another 100 mi fine.  At the
gas stop, we decided to let it run (idle) while filling, but it went
slowly from normal idle to slower and slower and stalled!  After the
fill it started OK and off we went.  We then kept it around 60 and
watched the oil temp, keeping it under 240.  No problem until home, an
800 mile drive.
     So what when it gets really hot would provides symptoms of dying at
idle but runs fine?  Can't be fuel pump, never hesitated. Got her usual
22-23 mpg on the highway.
