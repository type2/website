So, I pulled the drum off today and I notice that the pistons had 
retracted back into the rear brake cylinder.. that's kinda weird.  I 
figured they're supposed to push out and stay out and then push from 
there as the pads wear.  Yes, I know this is different than on the late 
bay because the late bay has the adjusters at the bottom that push out 
and compensate that way.

Anyways, any advise would be appreciated.  I'll have all the parts off 
for the next couple hours and will check back in a few..

Thanks!
