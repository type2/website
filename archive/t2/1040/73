Subject: Brake Booster air direction

Hey Volks,

I have a question about the function of the brake booster servo on the 
disc brake bays.  My girlfriend has a '72 Rivi that is receiving a new 
motor.  While I was preparing the engine compartment, I noticed a 
new-to-me air valve on the brake booster hose.  This is a one way valve 
that looks like this 
(http://www.ratwell.com/technical/EngineRemoval2/14-BrakeBoosterHose.jpg) 
and has an arrow on it to mark the direction of flow.

I have never seen this valve before and on my '74 Transporter, I just 
have a straight connector.  So, my question is, which way does the air 
flow on the brake booster?  Toward or away from the booster?  Also, is 
it better to have this one way valve installed over just a straight hose 
and where could I get a new one?

Thanks,
Andrew
