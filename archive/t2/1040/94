Subject: Vanagon to late bay swap

Hey Everyone,
Just thought I'd post up my progress updates on the Vanagon brake swap. 
  At first I was having problems after I initially changed out the 
brakes as I had a mushy brake pedal and a vibration when I pressed on 
the brake.  I even had my shop turn the drums twice and the vibration 
was still present.  The only new item were the shoes.

So, I then purchased some new drums and new wheel cylinders and re-bled 
the entire brake system.

Now it works great!  It stops like a champ and the self-adjusting seems 
to work - vibration is gone, too.  Thanks Karl for posting this mod as 
it's a awesome one!

... now I just gotta put the electric windows in ;)
