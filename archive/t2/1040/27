>Thanks, Martin.  I managed to verify last night that power (12 volts)
is getting to the emergency flasher (with key off).  Battery terminals
are very clean, haven't yet gotten to the solenoid terminals.

>However....  (and here's a real rookie question)  Where in the world
are the flasher relays on a 71?  I have a Haynes (yes, I know I should
get the Bentley, but I needed something and that's all they had), and it
just mentions where they are on a 68-69.


Sorry, can't help you there. I have a 76
