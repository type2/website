Subject: Re: What's So Bad About 009 Distributor?

 Andrew said: I've often read that the 009 Distributor is not a good match for
a Bus. I just switched to a 009 and saw my highway gas mileage go from 22 mpg
to nearly 27 mpg. Here is the description of my bus: 1971 Westfalia Pop Top
with 1600 DP. The carburetor and distributor are from a 1973 Beetle. The carb
has only one port which is connected to the advance side of the distributor
diaphragm. Because I don't have any of the emission control stuff that came
with the 73 Beetle, the retard side of the diaphragm is open to atmosphere.
The engine is a Boston Engine rebuild with less than 5000 miles. Bob did some
minor grinding to the heads to lower the compression slightly to accommodate
current lower octane gasoline. He also recommended that I time the engine at
32 degrees BTDC at 4000 RPM. When I do this my timing at idle is about 7
degrees BTDC. With this configuration I usually get about 22 mpg on the 200
mile return leg of my camping trips which is nearly all highway driving
averaging about 57 MPH. Just before I was to leave before my first camping
trip of the season to Vermont, I started the bus. It ran for two seconds,
quit, and then would not restart. Using a timing light I determined that the
distributor had failed, probably the condenser. I didn't have time to check it
out so I swapped it with an old 009 that the previous owner had given me. I
timed it to 7 degrees BTDC at idle which gave me about 27 degrees BTDC at 4000
RPM. This time driving back from Vermont to Connecticut I got 26.7 MPG while
trying to keep my speed between 55 and 60 MPH. Based on the behavior of the
Gene Berg dipstick and my oil pressure readings, I could notice no change in
engine operating temperature between the 73 Beetle distributor and the 009. I
was also unable to detect any power performance difference between the two
distributors. The weather conditions were the same as when I made this trip
last year. Given all that I have read concerning the 009 flat spot and how the
009is not the right distributor for the bus, I was surprised that the
improvement in gas mileage I got with the 009 with no change in performance.
Anybody have any ideas as to why this happened?

I looked at the map...... Vermont is above Connecticut...... so it was down
hill
all the way :)

I have a question about this statement:  "I time the engine at 32 degrees BTDC
at 4000 RPM"

Is this with the vacuum advance line on or off?

That 73 Bug dist has about 8 degrees of vacuum advance. If the hose was on and
you rev the engine, you will get both vacuum and centrifugal advance. That 32
is not correct. If you minus the 8, your real down-the-road total would be 24.

If you look at the specs of the 73 manual trans bug dizzy:
Timing Set At:: 5deg ATDC (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose(s)
connectedAdvance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 5-8deg Adv, 11-13deg Ret; Centrifugal:
6-12deg (-at-) 1500rpm, 22-25deg (-at-) 3800rpm

At idle 5 after is with vacuum retard connected. If you disconnect it, the
timing will automatically advance to 6 to 8 before. Splitting it gives you 7
and if you add the 25 centrifugal, that gives you the 32 Boston Bob said to
time it at. You do not have the advance side connected.

I believe you have been running slightly retarded for a while......
This will hurt mileage.
