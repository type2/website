Before replacing the coil, you might want to first look into putting a 
ballast resistor in the circuit (between the Pertronics and the coil). 
The internal points replacements (like the Pertronics) operate near 
their maximum spec, they have a hard time staying cool (all cooling is 
done through the distributor plate, which gets hot from the engine). 
They get too hot, and the spark gets weak. Adding a ballast resistor 
will decrease the work the ignition module has to do.

They're installed between the hot wire from ignition switch and the 
coil's positive terminal. Go to NAPA and get an Echlin ICR23 (1.2 
Ohms). About $10. You'll also need to put together a short jumper wire 
with 1/4" quick disconnects at each end.
