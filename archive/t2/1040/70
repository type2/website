Well, I got the tires rotated (boy what a pain in the butt that was). Got
the tire pressure set to 48 and 40 and everything looks good. Bus seems to
sit a little higher which tells me that the guys at Discount Tire probably
under-inflated them.

Now I am just excited to see how it effects my fuel economy! When I was
keeping the speed at 65 tops, I was getting 22MPG. When I filled it up
today, I got 18.5... I guess I better stop keeping up with traffic and
trying to pass people :)
