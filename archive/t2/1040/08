Subject: Re: [T2] What's So Bad About 009 Distributor?

I've not tried an 009 on a DP, but on a single port, I've found it is no
good.

The 009 in my config (1600 SP)  will lug at low RPM, so I have to rev the
engine at a stop to keep from almost killing it. Once at speed, the 009
is no problem.

The Late Herr Muir says that vacuum advance distributors are for "lazy
American drivers". I'd not say I'm lazy, I just like smooth engine
operation. Hence, I like the vacuum advance features in a bus.

I've not seen a mileage difference between the two, but I was not really
keeping track.

Bottom line is that the "driveability" of a vacuum advance unit certainly
is better than a 009.

On the other hand, I'm a home built aircraft guy. I use a 1600 with
Magneto on my VW airplane engines. But, many folks use the 009 with great
results.

Different application entirely, since RPMs stay fairly constant in
aircraft use.
