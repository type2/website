Sounds like air is in the system. The pedal should be hard at all times in the
same place - if air is in the system it will be spongy like you describe.
Also - I installed a new Varga MC on my bus and it was fine - but on my beetle
I went through 2 brazilian MCs that both failed while bleeding. A german one
worked perfectly.

It can help to bleed the MC at the lines connecting to it to be sure it's
completely bled. Sometimes you have to go around on all 4 twice to get it
totally bled. I can be a PITA to get it right sometimes.

Also - even new/rebuilt parts can be suspect - if say the calipers are sucking
in air it would create your symptoms.

Just keep at it and you'll get there.
