 #11 and 12 here: http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Microfiche/t207600.gif was
used up to vin 2x6 2035 000. Your 78 only uses #2 and #14.
_________________________________________________________________  Karl, do
you (or anyone else) happen to know the bolt size for #11? I know someone with
a '73 who is missing this part. From what I can tell,  the nut is an M5, but
the bolt is listed NLA.  Thanks!

It was part number N 14 272 1   screw, fillister head, BM5 x 60  now NLA from
VW.
