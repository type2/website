My 71 Westy (all stock), despite having had much recent TLC and newly  
rebuilt carb, is still acting up a bit.  This happens when the engine is  hot, after 
having been driven for a while.  When you step on the gas right  off idle, it 
want's to die and has not pickup.  After the RPM's come up  just a little, 
it's fine and accelerates briskly (relatively speaking).
 
Before I rebult the carb, I had a Brosol 34PICT-3 in  - same  thing.  The 
carb I rebuilt is a Solex, had the throttle shafts redone and  everything.
 
Not sure where to go from here.
