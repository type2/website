I spent 5 years at a front end shop in Minnesota and I cannot count 
the number of times we had tires going bad because of low tire pressure.
Low pressure in a tire generates heat, the heat breaks down the glue 
that hold the tread on and the tire goes bad.
This was a real big problem on some of the Ford Explorers, they would 
run tires that maxed out at 44psi with a door label that called for 
28psi. That is low pressure.

Does this have anything to do with your VW tires? That's your 
decision and those are your tires.
