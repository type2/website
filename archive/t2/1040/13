My '78 Deluxe Westy is exactly 3740lbs with a full tank of gas and a 170lb
driver.

The '78 Deluxe completely stock, without A/C.

Weighed my bus today at the Ennis Bug-In show.

3790lbs total
1840 Front
1950 Rear

That weight includes me and I weigh 180lbs so the real total of the bus 
and contents was 3610 lbs.  Details on the contents:

1.6TD water cooled engine in place of original (+80lbs?)
It's a highroof bus
Equipped with A/C
1/2 tank of fuel
I was carrying a toolbox, large spare battery and a floor jack.  That 
stuff and the rear folding seat are all that's behind the front seats.
