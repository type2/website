Subject: Buses at The Bakerosa - FREE Bus Campout!!!

Allright, here's one for all you cheap Bass-Turds!!  It's a FREE bus campout event.  
Featuring FREE camping! FREE Dinner!!  FREE live band(s)!!  It all happens on Saturday, July 19 at "The Bakerosa" (John Baker's house) in beautiful Pleasant Plain, Ohio (about 20 miles northeast of CIncinnati).  Feel free to come in on Friday and make a camping weekend of it.  The last one we had was a ton of fun!  Now, after a year off, the Baker Bus Bash has returned!!  Plenty of kids stuff and plenty of green space for bus camping, so bring the whole Famn Damily...I have set up a web site with all the pertinent info, check it our here:
