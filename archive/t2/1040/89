I'm glad you found the problem! The ironic thing is that I had something
similar happen to me with fuses falling apart when touched but it hadn't
caused me any problems by the time I found it. At the time I wrote a diatribe
exhorting everyone to check and replace their fuses as necessary. For some
reason I forgot to mention it in my response to you. :(
