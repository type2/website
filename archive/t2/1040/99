Subject: Re: [T2] Broken rear carrier mounts on a 1600 DP... What to do?

hello Nick  as has been said it will work in a bug and no adapter  plate or 
anything is needed.  . You could have a welder weld that boss back  on if you 
wanted to.  Also I would think that just the 2 big bolts would be  enough to 
carry the rear of the motor as the broken one is only 8mm bolt it  couldn't have 
been much of a real load carrier. If needed you could get the  adapter plate 
and then you would have the smaller bolt in place, you would still  have to 
remove the 2 broken bigger bolts  later  mark dearing   Salem imports servive
