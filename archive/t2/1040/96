Subject: Re: [T2] Broken rear carrier mounts on a 1600 DP... What to do?

Two part answer

#2 the rear carrier is just for the bus and you most certainly could 
install this engine in a Beetle

keeping that in mind

#1 an adapter plate is available which allows the use of a Beetle engine 
in a bus.  Repairing the broken boss is not cheap.
