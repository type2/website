A common cause of this is fuel tank sender cover on the top of the fuel tank.  The O-ring gets old and dry and allows fumes to escape.

Technically, you have to pull the fuel tank, which would mean an engine pull first, or maybe just remove ALL of the stuff on top of the case.

The shortcut is to cut a hole in the rear deck over the sender for easy access...if your lucky a PO already did this.  Details are probably in the type library or archives. 

The O-ring is cheap.
