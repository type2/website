 Hey Martin, According to Richard Atwell, they did change the servo size in
'74 (http://www.ratwell.com/technical/FAQ/FAQContent.html) (scroll down to
6.9). I'm sure it is only inches in difference but I am not sure if they are
interchangeable through the years. Although, Bus Depot has two different
boosters listed and they do look differently

The 2nd one you list is for a Vanagon.

Here is the 71 booster:

but no picture.....

Besides a diameter difference, there is also a difference in how the vacuum
line connects. If I remember right, the early one has a smooth pipe for the
rubber hose to slide on to.

The 11/73 cut-off date is not correct. It was mid 74 at vin 2x4 2110 465.

71 to 2x4 2110 465 was made by Ate.
2x4 2110 466 to the end of 79 was made by Bendix.

74 is a crazy year. A LOT of mid model year changes were done at different
numbers.  The steering wheel change was done at vin 2x4 2164 060..... after
the booster change.
