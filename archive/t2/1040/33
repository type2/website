Subject: Tranny input shaft sizes

Volks,
yes, I know this is discussed in the archives and library (isn't just about everything in there?), but I didn't find exactly the info I was looking for.
I'm posting this to the vanagon site, too. 
What is the difference (or is there a difference) between the input shaft diameter and shape from a baywindow to a vanagon? I know there are at least two different lengths. 
Here's the background:
I'm going to convert a vanagon to full electric. The company I'm ordering from needs the input shaft specifics to make the motor coupling. They don't have the dimentions for a vanagon, but they do have the dimentions for  baywindows.
Thanks for your help.
Joel
