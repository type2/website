um, If I had to guess it sounds to me like your timing/distributor might be=
 a bit off.  Also have you checked the vaccume lines?  If your carbs are go=
od to go (and if you rebuilt them then they probably are) then that is the =
only other reasonable alternative to me.  I don't know what else you are ru=
nning but I highly recommend a Petronix ignition if you don't have one alre=
ady.  That just makes life a whole lot easier and gives you one less thing =
to worry about when you are trouble shooting.  But if you do get one take y=
our time installing it because if you don't do it right they are easy to fr=
y but its well worth the 80 or so bucks or whatever they cost but YMMV.

On a side note, the petronix doesn't wear out it just stops working with no=
 indication before hand so a spare set of points is never a bad thing ;)
