Joey,

Make sure the white fuel injector trigger wire is on the negative side of
the coil.

I've gotten to the point where the 75 starts and runs well on all cylinders
for a few seconds everytime I turn the key.  Points and a condenser were the
key.  What I suspect is happening is that the fuel pump is working when the
starter tells it to but the connection between the AFM and the fuel pump
relay isn't there.  Activating the AFM with the key in the ON position (via
removing the air filter and manually activating the flap, which moves
freely) gives me nothing in the way of noises indicating the fuel pump is
working or being told to work.   I am pretty well convinced it's running out
of fuel after the starter bows out.  My question is whether disassembling
the AFM can possibly help me with this problem.  I'm not concerned about
taking it apart, I'm not sure I can cure the problem by taking it apart and
what I'll disturb internally in the process.  Is the switch for the fuel
pump relay accessible or embedded in something else?  Should I just bite the
bullet and get a used AFM from the Bus Depot?  
 
Thanks to all the members who have given me advice and suggestions.  We're
almost there.  
 
Joe
