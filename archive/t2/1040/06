Subject: What's So Bad About 009 Distributor?

I've often read that the 009 Distributor is not a good match for a Bus.  I just switched to a 009 and saw my highway gas mileage go from 22 mpg to nearly 27 mpg.
   
  Here is the description of my bus:  1971 Westfalia Pop Top with 1600 DP.  The carburetor and distributor are from a 1973 Beetle.  The carb has only one port which is connected to the advance side of the distributor diaphragm.  Because I don't have any of the emission control stuff that came with the 73 Beetle, the retard side of the diaphragm is open to atmosphere.  The engine is a Boston Engine rebuild with less than 5000 miles.  Bob did some minor grinding to the heads to lower the compression slightly to accommodate current lower octane gasoline.  He also recommended that I time the engine at 32 degrees BTDC at 4000 RPM.  When I do this my timing at idle is about 7 degrees BTDC.  With this configuration I usually get about 22 mpg on the 200 mile return leg of my camping trips which is nearly all highway driving averaging about 57 MPH.
   
  Just before I was to leave before my first camping trip of the season to Vermont, I started the bus.  It ran for two seconds, quit, and then would not restart.  Using a timing light I determined that the distributor had failed, probably the condenser.  I didn't have time to check it out so I swapped it with an old 009 that the previous owner had given me.  I timed it to 7 degrees BTDC at idle which gave me about 27 degrees BTDC at 4000 RPM.  This time driving back from Vermont to Connecticut I got 26.7 MPG while trying to keep my speed between 55 and 60 MPH.  Based on the behavior of the Gene Berg dipstick and my oil pressure readings, I could notice no change in engine operating temperature between the 73 Beetle distributor and the 009.  I was also unable to detect any power performance difference between the two distributors.  The weather conditions were the same as when I made this trip last year.  Given all that I have read concerning the 009 flat spot and how the 009
 is not the right distributor for the bus, I was surprised that the improvement in gas mileage I got with the 009 with no change in performance. 
   
  Anybody have any ideas as to why this happened?
