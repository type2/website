Subject: Sliding Door Parts Interchange info??

I pulled a bunch of door latch / slider parts off a
'68 cuz they were in good shape and looked a whole lot
like my '79 pieces. Are any of them interchangeable? I
can easily see the outside door handle is different,
but what about all the working parts? -BaH
