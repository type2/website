Subject: Re: [T2] Broken rear carrier mounts on a 1600 DP... What to do?

go to atwell <http://www.ratwell.com/technical/FAQ.html>'s info and 
search for beetle engine and you'll find some adapter plate info.  Also, 
moustache bar is another term I picked up after purchasing my 71 westy a 
few weeks ago.  I had a new 1971 but that wasn't part of the lingo back 
then.
