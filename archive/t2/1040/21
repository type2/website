Hi John:

I had this on my '78 and after scratching my head, discovered a leaky 
windshield gasket was giving the fuse and relay panel a bath each time 
it rained.  Also discovered a flaky ground strap on the battery.  Fixing 
both fixed the problems.  Previously I had done most of the 
troubleshooting you had as well and came up empty as you did.

This is a long shot but it would be cool if it solved the problem.

Good luck,

BEN
