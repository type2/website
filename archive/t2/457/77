Subject: Re: [T2] 68 Baywindow Wheel Locked Up 

>>Yesterday I replaced the steering dampener and the drag link.  Vast
improvement in steering wheel play.  Now I want to allign my steering
wheel so the cross bars are at nine and three, not two and eight.  Was
told to take off the horn button and remove the nut in the center.  Pull
up on the steering wheel.  Then stick it back on, take a short cruise
until I have the bus going straight-dead-on-forward.  Stop the bus, do
not skip this step, and pull out the wheel and stick it in where I want
it.  Reassemble the collumn.<<

maybe i am not fully understanding the original post, but i def. have
some issues with this method of 'alignment'.

you said you replaced some of your suspension components. that alone
can possibly cause your alignment to be out of whack. however, if
your steering wheel was not aligned properly before that, just taking it
off & putting it back on after rotating it a few splines is not going to
solve your problem. in fact, it could make it worse.

don't mess with the steering wheel.  just take it to an alignment shop
that knows what they are doing.  shell out the money to have it done
right. your suspension parts & your tires will thank you.  so will your
wallet b/c you won't be buying tires that are worn out in 6 months.

& as far as your brake problem goes, i agree with the person who already
posted that it is likely the flexi-hose on that brake line. check
that first.

good luck,
