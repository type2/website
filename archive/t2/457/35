To answer my own question I found out what this unit does and it's
multi-purpose:

- magneto tester
- static timing light
- condensor tester
- distributor cap tester
- coil tester

The last two are the most interesting. It checks the cap by testing it's
dielectric strength.

The coil test is performed by wiring up the coil and battery and moving the
electrodes apart until no spark is produced. If the distance less than 9mm
then the coil is no good. I didn't see a scale and wondered why but then I
realized that the electrodes would degrade over time.

Has anyone seen a coil tester like this before?
