You want something that seals well, wears reasonably, and is very flexible
to handle the vibration.  Foam rubber will work perfectly and last for
years!  Your old one is probably 30 years old!

The tape should be able to flex.  Cloth duct tape seems to work well.  Get
the stuff the pros use, not the hobbyest "Duck" tape.  If it's not hard to
tear, it isn't the good stuff!
