Subject: RE: Who did my conversion

That looks like a safare custom camper.  I have one.  You have the same 
layout 
and the trim and mose of the accessories match, bucket, mirror, fridge, 
stove table, cabinets, rear seat and table, top, top windowsB.  I know of 
at least one other.  My is a 73.  There are some differences, you don't 
have a upper bed..
 
There should be a plate by the passenger door.  Though, it may have been 
removed when the bus was re-painted.
