Richard,

Once again, Awesome!  Just the fact that your spark should be able to
jump 9mm is an important fact to me.
  
So let's see, if I pull a spark plug wire and can't get the spark
to jump 9mm or more, then I probably have something wrong...whether
it is the wires, cap, or rotor....

Verrrrry  interesting...

Thanks for the info, dave
