Just a small nit to pick that makes the entire engine oil thing even
more complicated. The engineers that designed it, had a wealth of
knowledge of the oils of that era. However I bet I know 100+ times
more about the oils of 2003 than they did in that era (and I don't
know much about oil). Whatever you choose to run, I suspect that
consistancy is the best thing. Reading between the lines of most of
Tims posts seem to indicate this. If there is a published spec, and
you stick to it, you will remain consistant. Even across different
areas of the country and different techs. Just fact!!!!! :)
