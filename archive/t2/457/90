it depends on the filter. We have a BYPASS filter (not full flow) that
filters down to 1/2 micron, this was briefly covered in this months VWT
magazine. You have to remember that the finer you filter, the more
restrictive the "filter" is going to be.

In an ideal situation, you'd run a coarse full flow filter for "disaster
protection" and a very fine bypass filter to keep the oil CLEAN. Bypass
filters filter the entire engine's oil in 3-4 minutes. The biggest issues
are finding room for the 2 filters, and the adapter is about $225 to mount
both filters, though it does have the necessary plumbing in there (springs,
plungers, etc) to do what needs to be done.

The Holley filters which we also carry, have 3 different filtration levels
(28, 60, and 120 microns), depending on what you are going to do with them.
A race car (for example) uses a LOT of oil, and is torn down before any wear
causes by contaminants in the oil can do much, and a finer filtration can be
restrictive (dirty oil is better then not enough oil), you get the picture.

Most cars will work best with a 60 micron filter on the Holley/O'bergs,
which is the standard one supplied. If you use a 28, you can expect a lot of
filter cleaning for the first week or so, until all the dirt is filtered out
of the oil, then things are manageable. But remember (especially in cold
climates, or with single weight oil), a 28 is much more restrictive then a
60, so you better have hoses and fittings up to the task!
