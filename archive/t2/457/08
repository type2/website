That's like military intelligence. BRAND NEW is not rebuilt. Rebuilt is not 
BRAND NEW.

Unless you are in Nome, Alaska, 5w-30 is nothing like the proper weight of 
oil. WAAAAYYYY TOOOOOO THIIIIIINNNN!!! See the oil weight/temp charts in 
Bentley or the owner's manual and believe them. Only two things I know of 
create black oil. Heavy varnish and tar build up from inadequate 
maintenance, which should not be an issue with your motor, and rich running 
putting off excess carbon with poor compression. Verify timing and mixture. 
Keep the oil clean and proper weight for a proper break in period then run 
a compression test. The long sit just might mean cylinder wall pitting. Or 
the poor lubrication of the thin oil might mean glazing before breaking in 
of the rings. Both together are synergistic.

Verify the specs. See the charts given. The engineers who designed and 
tested your motor know 100+ times more about the proper weight oil for your 
engine than the whole list combined. Just fact!!!!!

See the VW factory oil charts. Find the general temp range of operation on 
the left and use the multi-weight oil that best covers that range. Any 
brand name oil in the proper weight will do, except for break in duty only 
don't use Castrol.  My bias says Valvoline, no matter what label it 
carries. NAPA, Car Quest, Parts Plus brands are all Valvoline, as well as 
most FLAPS private labels. If it says on the back either Mac' Oil or 
Ashland Oil, and Lexington, Kentucky, it's Valvoline. Two great features of 
Valvoline: more anti-foam additives for very small crankcase motors like 
the VW boxer designs and, available nation wide at economical cost in 
private label packaging. Many weekend FLAPS flyers will have 99 cent 
private label Valvoline available as a loss leader. Beats the daylights out 
of 2 to 3 dollar retail anything else.

Correct weight is far more important than dyno or synth or brand.

If you haven't trashed the bearings, your light will respond correctly when 
the proper weight oil is in play. The thinner oil is most certainly 
contributing to lower pressures than a proper weight will provide.

Search the archives for the "100 hour test". Tells of the great 
enhancements to basic specs and performance in the last 30 years for engine 
break in and maintenance.
