this coinsides with my last question concerning my
speedo, everything works and the miles counter appears
to be right on target although my speedo is fast..

i've done the math and it looks like my upright sp1600
is getting great mileage, after finally dialing in the
carb.. 

is this typical gas mileage from a 1600sp??

what kind of mileage are similar folks getting??

w/ gas at $2.15 for 91 octane my bus sure beats my GMC
5.7ltr. utility truck.. Yes i am using my van for
work, well at least for light commercial use..

peace and chicken grease,
