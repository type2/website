Subject: Camper Cabinetry

Woodwork is a bit of a hobby with me, and I'm thinking of installing 
camper built-ins in my '79 Transporter.  Does anyone know of any good 
sites for inspiration/specifications/plans?  Stylistically, I prefer the 
streamlined look of the Vanagon interiors rather than the boxy earlier 
70's versions.

Thanks,
Adrian
