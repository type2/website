Yeah, once I saw the word "Safare" I began my net searches and saw all 
kinds that are similar to mine. I really appreciate this list & the 
quick replies!

Sure. You can do that. If you looked elsewhere in my public directory, 
you'd see my dead and gone VW named Bart. He died in Jan. 2000 in the 
heart of a winter snow storm in Flagstaff, AZ. he was sweet in and out. 
So, now I am restoring this blue beast!

Yes, it is. I spent $415 for it. I keep kicking myself for that. I 
hadn't known the engine was not the type II, but is a type IV. The 
engine replacement alone was over $2100. The heads were ruined, the 
cylinders dead, etc. It was a scrapped engine, not worthy of core. The 
van is still in CA as it isn't roadworthy. It awaits a new suspension, 
front end, fuel tank clean out, etc. I won't even talk about the 
interior. The van sat in a police impound for 1-2 years before the PO 
decided to get it out of there and sell it off. Am ambivalent over this 
van. Buyer's remorse perhaps? Or just broke and stuck in AZ while my 
money is in CA? *sigh*
