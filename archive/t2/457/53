    Thanks for the pics Jason. The one thing that still remains un-explained
for me is where the crankase breather gets into the mix on my '72 1700
w/single Weber Progressive. I know that the fuel injected engines get the
crankcase breather hooked up differently. If anyone with can tell me how the
crankcase breather is intended to be hooked in for a bus with type 4 motor
and carb(s), I would appreciate it.  -Jeff
