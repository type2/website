Subject: '72 charcoal cannister and crankcase ventilation

    I'll try to keep this brief and to the point. I need to know how the
charcoal cannister on my '72 1700 Westy is supposed to be hooked up. I know
how the fuel tank vent lines are to be hooked up but don't know how the
Crankcase Ventilation,the hose from the fan and vaccum from the air cleaner
are supposed to be hooked up.
    I have seen it hooked up as follows: Fan shroud to the drivers side of the
can, Crankcase vent to the passenger side of the can via a Tee fitting, Air
filter to the passenger side of the can via the tee fitting. NOTE: Driver and
Passenger side refer to US layout.
    If anyone can confirm this layout, or even better has pictures of how
theirs is hooked up, I would appreciate it very much! Thanks, Jeff
