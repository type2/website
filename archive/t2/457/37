Yes, I remember that site too. It wasn't the actual
fiche but the parts book (it has only drawings in it
and no partnumbers) I think this page is offline, I
tried to look it up some time ago and couldn't find it
anymore.

However, there is a German guy (Michael Knappmann) who
has the entire partsbook on his page as well. The
description of the pages is in German but I think you
will find your way :-)
