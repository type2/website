Jeff,

Crankcase breather generally just goes someplace in the input air stream to 
the carbs, *after* the air cleaner.  The idea is to breathe(and burn) any 
fumes coming out of the crankcase by running it through the intake air.

On FI it is a little different cause you really probably don't want the 
gunk that is generated to try and flow thru your throttle body...of 
course, you *never* generate any gunk out of that hose, right?<grin>

I have seen aftermarket air cleaners that had a place for the hose and 
somethat didn't...YMMV!

Cheers, dave
