I agree with Tim! Using a single weight oil is good for you guys that only
change your oil every 10-15k miles, but if you are more sane on your
maintenance intervals, multigrade is fine. The engine will run cooler with a
multigrade then a single weight (look at how the oil cooler bypass system
works).

If you want to know what the factory recommends, look at the specs for the
2004 Mexibeetles, it ain't straight weight.
