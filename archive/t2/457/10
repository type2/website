The correct cleaning solvent for crud and rust and flakes and goo from an 
old tank is acid. At the proper dilution, it cuts into everything, 
including varnish, goo and steel. When properly done, nothing in the tank 
remains but bright steel. Then it must be coated with a proper sealant. If 
the metal is not too thin afterwards, you get another 20+ years of 
functional use.
