Subject: Deceleration Valve testing

I was attempting to test my deceleration valve by following the Bentley
manual. It says to pull the hose  from  to the AFM side of the connection .
Then start the engine. So I pulled the hose from the 'S' side and attempted to
start the van. The engine would die out after a second, so I couldn't run
around to the back to even attempt to find vacuum. Are the instructions wrong
or am I just reading them backwards, or is my decel valve bad?
