No.  If you look at a seal off the car it will be angled to act as a
valve.  Grease can flow out without harming the seal but nothing can flow
in.

Correct in theory.  In practice nothing is perfect.

No. As I said above, the seal is supposed to be one-way.  Of course that
is in a perfect universe.  As a result you need to change your grease
occasionally in the same way that you change your oil occasionally to
remove the contaminated grease and replace it with fresh grease.  The
"count the strokes" method is quite good.  Pumping until you see new
grease flowing out is also good.

Even in a perfect universe the grease in a front end is subject to intense
pressure from normal usage and does degrade over time.  In this universe
it is also subject to dirt and water contamination and to being squeezed
past the seals.

                             OOK!
