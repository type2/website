Subject: RE: [VB] Tailgaters

It cracks me up, especially on a double lane left hand turn. I get into the
outside lane where I want to be and I always notice people going to my left
from behind me thinking I will slow them up. When the light turns, so do I,
and aren't they ever so surprised when they blinding come around the corner
and attempt the lane change only to see me! Yes, admittedly I put myself into
dangerous positions, but then again, so do they! Looking slow and being slow
is two different things. But I guess my old days as a race driver always
stayed with me and when I get a green tree, they get dust.

I don't let tailgaters bother me.  They will soon pass.  Just make sure to
leave lots of room in front so you won't have to make a quick stop.
