Subject: Re: [T2] Calibrating my Speedometer..

I second this one! My speedo reads 55mph when I'm going 62. I have 185R14R
tires. Any way to adjust it? Tom

<hello,
i have a '70 bus which is approximately 20mph to fast,
poormans calibration w/ someone driving a late car
besides me..

my question is, is there an adjustment screw on the
speedometer? I would hate to crack it open to find
there is no way to retard the mph..

thanx,
