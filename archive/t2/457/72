Subject: what year muffler can I use?

Hi everyone,
I have a 79 with a stock engine. I need to put a new muffler on it and don't 
want to put on a crossover pipe and cat conv, etc. I remember that I can use 
a one piece muffler from an earlier years, but was not sure from what years. 
I looked in some parts catalogs, but just wanted to be positive I had it 
right. Does anyone have an extra one of these mufflers?
Thanks,
Kyle
