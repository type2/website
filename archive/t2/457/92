Subject: what year muffler can I use?

I have a 79 with a stock engine. I need to put a new muffler on it and don't

a one piece muffler from an earlier years, but was not sure from what years. 
I looked in some parts catalogs, but just wanted to be positive I had it 
right. Does anyone have an extra one of these mufflers? >>

Hey there Kyle,

You can use the 72-74 style muffler. I've got one on my 79. Check out the bus
depot's online catalog (or order one, it's a great reference):

The part # is 071 251 053E (page 34). You're gonna need gaskets and a tailpipe
too.

They didn't have the SS one in stock when I ordered, but even tho' my muffler
has been holding up fine, I regret not getting the SS one (071 251 053ES).

I did not like the extractor system that was on the bus when I bought it.
