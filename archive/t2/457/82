Subject: steering wheel adjustment

ok,

I read the posts this morning about the "steering wheel"
alignment.

But! this is the part that always gets me about "our" replies
to such questions...ya have someone here(including maybe me) who
doesn't know if their steering wheel was ever taken off and put back on 
incorrectly.

So, what is the correct "factory" procedure for putting the steering wheel 
on correctly?

Let's say that your front end is aligned as per factory specs...do you 
drive it and stop in a straight ahead position and then unbolt and rotate 
the steering wheel till it is at the 9 and 3 oclock position?

or what?

My bus steering wheel was carefully marked(by me) when removing for 
restoration....but it is *not* at the 9 and 3 position when driving 
straight down the road...not off too much, but some....and it was that way
when I marked it the first time too.

Inquiring minds want to know!<grin>

Cheers, dave
