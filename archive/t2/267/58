At .25/mi for the haul vehicle and .25/mi for the trailer (no wheels,
remember, I'd need a full trailer), plus gas for 2,500 miles...about
$1,000, which is how the trucking compaies get the fee they charge
to haul it back for you.

One other option I have thought of is to drive the '73 out to the west
coast next June on my biennial "roundabout", find a body, stop for a week
and work myself blind doing the swap on the road.  Not the vacation of the
century, but a definite thought :-)
