Great, Jeff!  Usually, when you run into this, it is simply a case of
"gasket-gluing thru force of habit" but take a look at the seating
surfaces and make sure that they are flat and not scratched.  If there are
scratches on the head.... Well, it's time to think cost/benefit analysis.
The only good way to get rid of the scratches is to take the head off,
take the studs out, then reface that surface.  Big job.  You really can't
sand that in place, as the grit is going straight into the intake.  You
can try stuffing and vacuuming, but the risk is there.  If you are talking
a worn engine and trying to squeeze a couple thou extra miles out of it, I
might.  The runner ends, of course, are easy to sand flat.
