Hey Noky,

You said that you couldn't find a throttle body
gasket. The Bus Depot sells them. Just enter the key
word throttle body gasket and It will come up or enter
part # C025 133 073. It costs $2.49. I just thought I
would relay this info incase you find that you have a
leak around your old one. Good luck!
