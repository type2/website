Subject: Ring compressor shortcut?

Anyone got a easy, fast, shortcut for a ring compressor 
aside from buying one (aside from ordering one or 
hauling the engine down to the shop)??  Trying to get 
the wifes engine together this weekend and I am to the 
point up putting the cyliders on....  TIA  Gerald
