Well you are in a VW BUS, like it or not they have a bad rep for carrying

What kind of stickers? Dead Head and Pot leaves, or just your average
generic VEE DUB stuff?

Whenever I get tagged and pulled over I just sit and grin while the cops
"search" for anything illegal in my bus, usually all they find is the mold
in the closet from those wet rags.

I usually wind up talking to the cops for 10 or 15 minutes about things,
usually VEE DUBS and they always let me go on my way.
