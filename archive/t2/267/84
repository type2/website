Subject: Re: Low vacuum was Re: [T2] removing intake runner gaskets?

Looks like we're all in the same vacuum mess here.  Still, 15in doesn't
sound too bad.  I finally got my intake runners torqued down this
weekend (had to replace two studs which were stripped by the crappy thin
nuts from the PO).  My vac is still usually under 10in :^(

Here's what I've done, beyond this I'm clueless (ready to call the local
shop).  First, some great advice from Steve Dolan in a post from a few
weeks ago:

You can find rubber corks at your local hardware store.  I did this and
still low vac.  So, I replaced the manifold boots, the gaskets that join
the runners to the head, and the small injector seals.  I replaced all of
the 3.5mm vac tubing.  I removed the throttle body and examined it.  Unable
to find a new gasket, I Permatexed the throttle body with the old gasket
(which actually seemed to be in good shape) back on.  I examined the big
"S" tube connecting the AFM to the throttle body.  I examined and replaced
most of the larger vacuum lines.  I clamped down all the large vac lines.

Huh... this sounds like my problem.  Readings are usually <10in and the
needle goes crazy.  Idle is super low.  No matter how many times I adjust
the valves (per Bently, used 2 turns), a clatter always comes back.  I
bled all the lifters at rebuild time (rock solid), and later on, bled ones
that got really mushy.  I even replaced one of the really troublesome
lifters that was always mushy (no amount of running the engine seemed to
pump up the lifter again).  Anyway, I always get a crazy loud clattering
that is driving me crazy!  The heads are new, so the valves/seats should
be good...  What should I be looking at with respect to the valves?

Jeff, good luck hunting down your vac problem.  Check all those
connections I mentioned above.
