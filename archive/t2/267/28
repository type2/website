Octobugfest is this next weekend on
Sunday the 13th. Puyallup Wa. Fairgrounds.
the sun will shine of course. 8-O

 Good deals can be had such as this
66 bug I saw at Springmeet, which as it happens
is still up for sale.
  I have no interest in this bug just a favor
to the owner by posting the info.
  wish I had the $$$! Very nice!
