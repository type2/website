Subject: Re: [T2] the canadian border

I havnt been over the border in a few years, but Ironically my bus always 
sailed right thru both ways. I had the deadhead stickers in those days, 
wonder why I wasnt bothered.

On the other hand, anytime I was pulled over by the cops the tinted windows 
of one bus and the curtains on others seemed to really worry them.  I 
remember one time seeing a crime and driving back to the site where the  
police were investigating to tell them what I saw. Two police came to the 
bus, one on either side. You couldnt see in the back because I had a 
partition to keep the cab warmer. One asks to search my bus! I said, look 
buddy I got a tag right about where you knee is that says this is a mobile 
home, get a search warrant. The other cop yells at the first one "He's a 
witness, he came back to tell us what he saw, you think HE IS HIDING 
SOMETHING?". He then leans in the window and whispers to me "Rookie, ignore 
him". I laughed so hard.
