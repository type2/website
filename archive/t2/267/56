Yeah, and there is nothing wrong with my body that Kelly could not fix for
$5,000 either, but I am thinking that $500 for a nice bare body plus
$1,000 for transport is less than $5,000 :-)  OK.... I know I will be
100+ hours of work into it before it is on the road, but I charge low
hourly rates( even to myself :)... ask anyone whose bus I have worked on!
