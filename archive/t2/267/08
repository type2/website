Subject: Allright Fine Ill Say what Oil I use:

I prefer to use a racing grade oil 20w-50. Thank you very much.

Before, my pressure wasnt really that low, bu was lower then it is now. It 
also is consistant and heat doesnt affect it much. Yes it dino by the way.

1776 with a heavy duty bi-pass (if clogged) oil filter as well. I work with 
computers alot and have been thinking about clamping heat sinks onto the 
filter. Who knows? It might help cool it down somewhat, and thereby cool the 
oil.
