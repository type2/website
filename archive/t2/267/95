Subject: Tricky Pilot bearing removal

After trying everything in the book with a pilot
bearing that only had the outside part of the bearing
left (this thing was TRASHED!) i was finally able to
get out the bearing using this technique and a pilot
bearing puller, which had failed miserably before.

1. take off the main oil seal
2. heat up the crankshaft around pilot bearing with
propane torch
3. stick an icecube in the pilot bearing hole, causing
it to contract while the metal around it expanded.

this loosened up the bearing enought that the pilot
bearing actually came out, EURIKA!
