Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Wheel bearing packing tool

Believe me, I thought over many different ways in order to find the simple
solution.  But in order to remove the old bad and sometimes even rusty
grease the only way is to push it out the back.  I don't think you could
drill enough exit plugs to get the bearing clean.

Those axle seals don't keep everything out and to do a good job, must be
replaced anyway.  It's not that hard to remove the gland nut and with a
brass hammer drive the stub axle out.  Then all you have are the two grease
seals and greasing the bearings.
