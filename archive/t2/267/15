In California, at the moment, its 1973 and older vehicles.

Currently, there are several types of vehicles that are exempt from
Smog Check: motorcycles, diesel-powered vehicles, all 1973 and older vehicles,
vehicles four model-years old and newer, as well as non-combustion engine
vehicles. SB 42 (Kopp), enacted in 1997 (Chapter 801), exempted 1966-1973
vehicles from the Smog Check program and created the 30-year rolling exemption
that will take effect in 2003. The 30-year rolling exemption will exempt
post-1973 vehicles from Smog Check when each model year
becomes 30 years old. Thus, in 2003, vehicle model year 1974 will be exempt.
In 2004, vehicle model year 1975 will be exempt, and so on. Prior to SB 42,
only pre-1966 vehicles were exempted from the program.

[Koop tried to get it passed 1st with a 25 year rolling drop-off but it
failed. He had to rewrite it to 30 years with a 5 year moratorium on 1973
vehicles and then the 30 year rolling drop-off went into effect.]

Here is SB42:

There was a bill introduced to drop the 30 year rolling drop-off.  This can be
read in its entirely at
http://www.calepa.ca.gov/Legislation/2001/SB1172.htm
But a search for SB1172 does not show it worded as above! It only pertains to
a Utility Co. and Gov. Davis vetoed it on 10/14/01.
