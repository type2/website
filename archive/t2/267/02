Hello List,

I want to thanks all those that responded to my
electronic ignition question regarding the condenser.
At least that is one more thing that I don't have to
worry about (or buy). I will probably just use my
stock blue Bosch coil as it has done a sufficient job
at making a spark so far. If it fails, I have a spare.
Anyway, Thanks again for the help! Have a great day!
