If you are talking about horsepower the 2L is still no a speed demon: the
bus still weighs 3500 lbs with you in it and a cd of 0.43 means the bus is a
rolling wind baffle.  However the torque increase from your 1600 makes it a
worthwhile upgrade.

If the engine and timing are near to perfect as possible you can keep up
with accelerating traffic using a lead foot but your gas mileage will be
terrible.

Nope. 60-65 is a leisurely highway bus speed with that engine IMHO. 70-75 is
really pushing the engine against the wind and with a cd of 0.43 the bus is
a rolling baffle.  Add to that the engine and exhaust noise especially if
you have an aftermarket exhaust and it's just too loud to enjoy the trip at
those speeds.

A stock engine, with stock trans with the correct size tires (no I will not
speak of that tire info ;-) will, I believe, achieve these speeds in 4th
gear:

RPM             2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 5500
27 : 24 (0.889)   36   45   54   63   72   81   90   99

Given the bus makes peak HP at 4400 RPM long before the rev limiting rotor
"redlines" at 5400 RPM and given that I've read the ideal RPM for engine
cooling is 3800 RPM and that wind resistance is great at those speeds, it's
convenient that the data seems to support my driving preference of 60-65.

However, if you must, figure on 80mph as top speed.  I once bombed down
I-280 for an hour at that speed in order to keep up with traffic. I wish I
had ear plugs then.

Have fun!
