In essence, yes.  More likely a volunteer's garage or field or a yard's
parking lot, but yes... roll up next to the "donor body" and drive it away
within a week.

If it happens, I'd certainly take some.


This would not be as hard as it sounds.  The VW comes apart in big chuncks
and goes together the same way.  Believe me, I've stripped enough of them
and put them together, too. Units I can think of are:
Engine/trans as a unit;
2 rear trailing arms w/torsion bar, halfshaft, wheel and brake assembly;
front axle beam with wheels on.
These four items and a couple hours hooking up brakes would get you a
roll-able vehicle.  Add the windshield and you are back on the road.  The
rest of the week is spent doing "fiddly bits" like the interior and seats.
