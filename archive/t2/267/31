Subject: bringing a bus back from Canada

Hello all; 

A buyer is planning on bringing my bus back from Canada to his home in
California. 

I was curious whether anyone has done this routine before? I am wondering
primarily about what happens at the border. Do I need to fill out any
forms/alert customs/etc? Can he just drive my bus over the border and home
to California, and then register? 

If anyone has border-specific info on the transfer from Canada to the US,
it would help greatly! 

Cheers
dc
