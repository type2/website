Subject: [t2] What will be the power difference from a 1.6 upright  to a

I just sold my 70 westy bus with a 1600 and purchased a 79 westy with a 2.0. 
What should I expect the power difference to be. My 1600 felt like it was 
doing alot of work all the time and was very slow power wise. Will the 2.0 
be alot faster traveling wise. Can I go 70-75 easy. The engine has 700 miles 
on it by the way. I am picking it up this week and want an idea of the 
difference.

Thanks
Casey
