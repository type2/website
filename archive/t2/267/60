Subject: Re: [T2] Painting Valve Covers:

IMHO it will not do anything to reduce the engine
temp.  You dont have enough real conduction to the
engine to remove an "real" energy (gasket gets in the
way/thermal break).  To make it work you'd need fins
right on the cylinder.  Oh yeah they are already there
:)

Besides it would be a waste to paint shiny alumn covers
with barbeque paint!

Oh yeah, I wouldnt paint alumn covers......

at -40 it wont make no difference.  And all I care
about right now is preping for the coming cold!
