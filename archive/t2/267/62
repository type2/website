Subject: Window won't go up!

Hi Folks,
I went to put my drivers door window up and nothing!  I pulled the door 
panel off to see what I could find.  The cable from the crank was 
dangling.  It looks like it is connected usually by a clip.  Where does it 
connect?  My Bentley was not too helpful.  Any suggestions?

Joy Thru Air,
