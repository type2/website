Subject: Low vacuum was Re: [T2] removing intake runner gaskets?

Hi All:

I finished replacing the intake runner gaskets (at the cylinder head) today,
but the vacuum is still around 15 in Hg. I have all new hoses, new boot on the
aux air regulator. I have plugged the deceleration valve and aux air regulator
hoses (not the brake vacuum boost yet), and used permaxtex (gas resistant form
a gasket) to reseal the throttle body and cold start valve gaskets. Timing is
spot on 7.5 BTDC and compression is above 125 Psi in all cylinders. Any other
suggestions as to why my vacuum is so low?

I have to adjust the valves (this is a 2.0L hydraulic) still and maybe that
will solve the problem.

But I know that there is an air leak somewhere as I can adjust the fuel
mixture screw all the way closed and the engine runs better.
