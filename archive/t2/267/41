Hi,

I am almost finished with my restoration, the body and interior are done, now 
just a few comforts.  Does anyone have experience with a multi disk CD 
changer and additional front speakers?  I want to add both, but don't want to 
cut into the panels if I can help it.  Is an amplifier needed to get better 
sound quality?  I don't want to thump the neighbors, just hear quality 
sounds.  

Anyone ever tried those heat/defroster boosters that are advertised in the VW 
mags?

Thanks for the input,
Rob
