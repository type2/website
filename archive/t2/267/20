Subject: thermostat ?

Well, I sent a long story to type2(-at-)type2.com and it never appeared, now I 
just wish I would have saved a copy in my sent folder...

anyway, fellow listmembers....

how does the thermostat cable connect to the thermostat itself?

I finally figured out what was causing my bus to run so hot. the thermostat 
cable is GONE.

I just can't believe that in the random checkups I have taken it to, always 
mentioning a problem with running hot on long trips, that nobody ever 
noticed. I excuse myself, because I don't know what the hell im doing 
usually, but tracing down other problems saw that little wheel with nothing 
wrapped around it and knew something was effed up.

right now the problems on my bus are becoming overwhelming, so im going to 
fix what I can, but I will need to get ol jasper into the shop pronto.
