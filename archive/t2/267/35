Correct, but the 1972 Without Guesswork book came with this description:

Technical data for workshop use, covers August 1970 (1971 model year) through
October 1972 (1973 model year), types 1, 2, 3, and 4, models imported to USA
and Canada. Contains measurements, clearances, wear limits, performance data,
etc.

It is on-line here: http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/
Scroll down and you will see it listed.....
