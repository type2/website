Subject: Wheel bearing or something else?

Hi all!
  Long time reader, first time poster.  I have a '78 Westy whose handling 
has always been less than nimble.  I replaced the cheapo car tires it came 
with with BFGoodrich Baja Champions (27 x 8.50 R14LT 95Q, load range C), and 
that helped a lot, but still not great.  I replaced the old, worn out shocks 
with new KYB shocks, but still the handling seems vague, like the air 
pressure is low in the rear tires, although I have tried many different 
pressure combinations, including the reccomended pressures.  Now, the other 
day I jacked up the car on stands and noticed that the rear wheels have play 
when I push and pull at 12 and 6 o'clock, but not at 9 and 3 o'clock.  The 
fronts are the same way, which I would think could be the ball joints, but 
the rear?  The play at the top and bottom of the tires is less than a 
quarter of an inch, but you can feel and hear it.  How much is normal?  
Would this affect my handling?  What would cause vertical play in the rear?  
Wheel bearings?

Thanks for any information!
