Richard makes several good points. I would only like to add that I 
once had a '72 with a carbureted 1.7 type IV which hauled butt. I 
would regularly drive 75 on the interstate without issue. That bus 
also had the best heat on any airc-cooled bus I have owned or ridden 
in . I put 40k on the bus and sold it a few years ago. It is still on 
the road with the original unrebuilt motor.

I have been through five buses with motors varying from 1500cc to 2.0 
and the fastest was the 72 with the original 1.7. Currently the 68 
bus will do 70 but I do not drive it that fast. These days I drive by 
oil temp and pressure gauge and try and stay out of the may of hectic 
masses :)
