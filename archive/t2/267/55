Jeff,

I don't know :-(  and I now find myself in the same boat.  This evening, I
was headed home and the '80 seemed gutless.  I hauled out the vac gaure,
dwell tach and timing light first thing and...
dwell 50
timing 7.5 vor
vacuum 9"!!!!!
I have a vacuum leak!!!! I will chase it over the next couple days and let
you know what I find.

BTW, your 15" is OK.  Nothing special, but what I regard as the low end of
acceptable for an air-cooled VW.  Do check the brake booser, it may be
tearing in the diaphram.  do check the valves, but the valves are probably
not your problem.  they never all go at once (unlike fuel injectors :-)
and if one is gone, then you get a vibrating reading on the vac gauge.
You have not mentioned this, so I am betting you don't have it.
