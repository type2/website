The auto trans self-supporting starter will work perfectly on the 79 engine if
you use the 72 210mm flywheel. It also works with the 74/75 215mm flywheel. It
will NOT work on the 76 and up 228mm flywheel.
If you put in a 76-79 transaxle, then you would need a 228 flywheel and
starter.

The engines are the same length. The 76-79 bellhousing is longer. A 79
engine/72 flywheel mated with a 72 trans is the same as a stock 72 set-up.

If this is a 79 Fed version, keep ALL the 79 exhaust parts on the engine. It
looks just like the 72-74 exhaust but the exhaust ports are square.
