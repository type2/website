Subject: My Story

OK: Here's my story:

I'm an Mechanical Engineer for a BIG company here is southern the US (and
the world).  Hence, I'm basically a number in a cube. Actually, for the
record, I'm  *exactly*  number  209017311.  

Well, as the way is with BIG companies in the US (and the world) I'm
fixin (In the south we're always "fixin" to do something) to get laid
off.   So I've been thinking of a plan:  why not get a bus and ride
around the country for a few months?  I'm not married; no kids, and very
few bills.  I don't know very much about buses, but I have been fixing
cars (mostly water-cooled, but a few Type 1s) for about 25 years so I'm
pretty adept at keeping things running.  

So here are some questions:  What kind of bus should I look for? Is one
(or several)  particular year(s) better than another?  Reliability is a
big deal with me too.  How about parts availability?  Is one particular
year or style easier to get parts?  What about cost?  I know, that's a
loaded question, but what could I expect to pay for a good running,
fairly reliable bus?   As has been my experience with other old vehicles,
the condition of the body is pretty much the main thing.     What are the
known trouble spots for rust?  My experience with body work has basically
limited to bondo and race car paint jobs.  Does anyone know where there
might be a good one for sale?

I've played in Bluegrass music  bands for many years, so I am definitely
used to living on the road *cheap*.  I'm also used to having to fix stuff
on the side of Interstate 40 with duct tape and aluminium foil at about 2
o'clock in the morning.  

OK there's my story.  What do y'all think?

Lemme know.......off list would be fine.

Thanks a lot
