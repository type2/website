generally believed that the 71 and 78 are the most reliable buses the 71
the last of the upright 1600cc engines with pretty standard parts. the 78
is the year with fuel injection, hyd lifters and decent power, the 79 is
just as good but have a lot of one year only parts

look for a Westfalia (camper) version

it has often been said that you will spend $5,000 either up front or in
getting it fixed up to be reasonably reliable.
