If it makes you feel any better, my wife and I were hassled at that same
border crossing, but at the time we were riding a full-dress BMW touring
motorcycle, wearing color-matched helmets and riding suits.  We were as
far from being "outlaw bikers" as you could get, but we were given the
full treatment.

"What is the purpose of your trip"
What we thought:  "to abuse your socialized heath system!"
What we said:  We're going to Banff, to see Lake Louise..."

"How are you going to pay for food and lodging?"
What we thought:  "By bumping off liquor stores!"
What we said:  "With this Visa card, just like all the other tourists"

"Are you bringing any pepper spray or handguns into Canada?"
What we thought:  "With carb cleaner, who needs pepper spray?"
What we said:  "No."

Fact is, they were bored and decided to have some fun with the tourists.
That was the only time they've gone beyond the stock "pepper spray and
handguns" question with us in a variety of vehicles.

Driving a bus means that you might be viewed as less than respectable.
That's just a fact of life.
