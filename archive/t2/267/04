Subject: Re: [T2] 'putting in new TC without removing engine

I mentioned last week that I was going to try to put a new Torque
converter in my 78 without removing the engine completely.

well to make a long story short, it probably would have been easier to
remove the engine, but it sort of worked....didn't remove all the wires
and only dropped the engine about 6 inches so I could pull it back far
enough to get the TC out and back in, but I couldn't do the one thing I
really didn't want to do, remove the tranny fill tube,  couldn't do it, so
had to drain (and spill) all the tranny fluid.   

BTW off the top of your head anyone know how much tranny fluid an empty TC
will hold...(a lot) 

thanks
