Hi Steve,

Why specifically a 73 Westy body? Doncha like the late bay camper 
interiors? The bulkhead-free front seating? Doncha like the stylish 
1972 wraparound front bumper?

If you're planning to swap as much as it sounds like, then it seems to 
me you needn't be as picky about the year you're swapping parts onto. 
Other than avoiding a '72 because of the lack of the upper rear hatch 
of course. But how hard is that to add, really?

Heck, why not go with a 68-71 body? Your front beam will still host the 
73 disks. Think of how much easier the engine drops would be with the 
removable rear valance. It would only be a minor headache to modify the 
tinwork....

I'm sure there are reasons I've not considered, but IMHO if you're 
serious about the project you're limiting the range of donors just a 
bit more than necessary.YMMV.

Happy trails,
