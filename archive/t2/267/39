Subject: the canadian border

Ok, REALLY off topic, sorry.

When on our trip from San Francisco to Glacier to Banff in Canada, the 
middle of nowhere border crossing east of Glacier national park was a real 
PITA.

They asked us to pull over, then come inside, then sit down and meet with 
some guy that cross examined us. Once we got to the part asking us the kind 
of car we had, he straight up admitted "oh, well that's why your up here 
seeing me then." - and made some wise cracks about stickers all over the 
back window, etc (hell no!)

I made a crack about profiling, but I don't think the dude at the desk 
understood. hell, I was just trying not to laugh when he ended every line 
with 'ya'

then, when we thought we were free to go, TWO cops followed us out to the 
bus and went through EVERYTHING. pretty deep to. smelled each of my eleven 
rolls of film (the canisters anyway) and took a few items inside to make 
sure they were allowed.

all in all, it was terribly annoying, especially knowing they were going to 
find jack sniff unless they had themselves a dog. and even then, just the 
dog food stuck under the rear bench seat from the PO.

coming back into the US, they asked us if we had anything illegal, we handed 
over our apples (they weren't so good anyway) and went on our merry way. 
with all the hubub going on in the states, I would have figured it the other 
way around.
