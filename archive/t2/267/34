Subject: re: [t2] What will be the power difference from a 1.6 upright 

You should notice what seems like almost a doubling of available power, when
switching from the old 1600cc engine to the 2.0 liter.

In my '79, I commonly cruise at about 65 mph, partially to keep oil temps in
the normal range and partly for better gas mileage. I occasionally build up
speed to 70-80 mph near the bottom of a hill if approaching a long, steep
uphill grade ahead.

r.d.
'79 bus 2.0 liter

I just sold my 70 westy bus with a 1600 and purchased a 79 westy with a 2.0.
What should I expect the power difference to be. My 1600 felt like it was
doing alot of work all the time and was very slow power wise. Will the 2.0
be alot faster traveling wise. Can I go 70-75 easy. The engine has 700 miles
on it by the way. I am picking it up this week and want an idea of the
difference.

Thanks
Casey
