Subject: Release Shaft Main Bushing?????????

Last night replaced the plastic release bushing with
the one that came in the mail that happenend to be
metal.  After having to pound the bearing in, i can't
get the hole to line up with the screw in the back
that keeps it in place, and it just won't budge.  Does
anyone have any suggestions?  thanks
