Subject: Re: [T2] the canadian border

Hey all:

I gotta chime in here.

I travel routinely to the usa and I do a fair amount of
travel in Europe for work.  (Its not all its cracked up
to be)

But anyway, the customs in USA and CANADA are the most
"inquisitive".  And Richard is right, if they are not
busy, you soon will be.

Highlights of my many crossings:

Into USA: Being asked for my business cards to prove I
was actually on business. (At the time I was travelling
down once per month over a period of two years)Into USA

Crossing in USA by car, and being waved through!  (Not
even a check of the Passport)  Same trip, being waved
through back into canada (Not even a check of the
passport) three days later.

Waiting for 2 hours to pay $7.98 duty on a VCR.
(Returning to Canada)

My recommendation:  Be nice, be polite, and have
nothing to hide! 

Cheers
Logan
