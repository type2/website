Subject: Vanagon seat arm removal

I dug through the Vanagon and Type 2 lists and have only found vague
mentions of removing the arms from Vanagon front seats.

I have the ones with the large knob to raise and lower it. The
archives mention a cotter pin. Is that right? Anybody have a pic or
better description?
