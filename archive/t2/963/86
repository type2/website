Subject: bad day

Boy, was yesterday a bad day.  I was chasing an elusive idler pulley for my riding lawn mower.  I won't get into that, but the bus played a part.  I've continued to putter around in it even though it blew a stud out of one head.  I don't like the sound of it and I won't drive it far enough to get it hot, but I don't want to just park it until I can get around to fixing it.  But then I don't want to warp the head.  Amazingly, it hasn't seemed to have lost much power, if any.  

Anyhow, I drove it about a half mile yesterday to a park-and-ride.  Right as I got there it crapped out.  I thought, oh boy, that engine drop is going to be sooner rather than later.  I took the (city) bus and got back to it later.  Warped head?  Nope.  Ran it out of gas.  Didn't fill her up as usual the other day because I thought I'd be dropping the engine.  Forgot all about it until then.  Even bad engines run better with a little gas.  But now I'm all out of carbon credits.  :(  Cheers...KR
