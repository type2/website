You can also see the relationship if you have ever seen a "fuel mileage" gauge, which is nothing but a vacuum gauge, my moms 1997 SL380 has one from the factory, which is the first time I have seen that, but you can also buy them from any auto parts store and install them yourself.

When you push the pedal to the floor at a low RPM it drops the vacuum to nothing, cruising along at 55 with the accelerator barely pressed you have a lot of vacuum and the gauge will show that you are getting good mileage.

Conclusion, with the butterflies wide open at low RPM, you don't have much vacuum at all.
