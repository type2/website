Subject: ADMIN: KILL THIS THREAD Re: [T2] Racist

I have already posted two times asking people to drop this subject and 
yet more posts keep coming.  I will try one more time.

KILL THIS THREAD.  And the other one.  And related ones.

No more posts on racism.
No more posts about derogatory terms
No more posts about immigration

ALL posts must have LEGITIMATE bus content.

http://www.type2.com/type2charter.  Read it.  Know it.  Etc..

Any questions?  Send them privately.
