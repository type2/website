I have to agree with Jules on this one.  If it is a 34PICT-3, my 
experience is that no amount of cleaning will restore idle if it 
doesn't to begin with. I can't explain. I have a box of those carbs 
on the shelf. Only one of mine actually idles, and it runs just fine.
I hope others have a different experience and can help you.
Who knows?
