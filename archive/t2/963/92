Richard Atwell has a really great site with resources.
http://ratwell.com/

Here are a few of the sites that may have some of the info you need:
Bosch L-Jetronic Technical Manual
http://bama.ua.edu/~darren/boschindex.html

L-Jet manual (Type4.org)
http://manuals.type4.org/ljet/

Bosch L-Jetronic Fuel Injection Manual
http://www.ratwell.com/mirror/potts/index.html

BTW if you need any parts, Ive got a good wiring harness, and a few other
goodies :)
and if you took a photo of the plug I may be able to help you.

good luck!
