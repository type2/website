Gentlemen and ladies of this list, I follow this list to become "educated" in
the workings of my "ride", yet, I am still amazed that we collectivly love our
rides, but diseminate all we appreciate, over what are "individual
preferences", outside the list items, and much as I agree that "politically
incorrect", is a euphamisn of convenience, if you lined all of the list users
up side by side, and asked them what was most important, in the theme of the
list, I would hope that the first answer would be, "because I have one"!  Let
the dust settle, appreciate what you have said, and through the "aspect" of
freedom of speech, let "us" move on!  Flame shields active!
Sid
