Oh back off with the Thought Police act, huh?

We're all adults here and Americans, too.  The political Left and its PC do
not have a monopoly on anything, especially Free Speech.

*I* object to sanctimonious censorship by sandaled, wanna-be dictators.

I object to this term being used on this list! It is a racist and belittling

term. I expect better from this international list.
Respectfully,
