I went to http://www.friendlyfoam.com/

I can't remember what I paid exactly but I got a piece for the back of
my 75. I do remember that it was cheaper than JoAnn and custom cut to
the size I requested....  They happened to be local for me but they
ship anywhere.  If you can give them a pattern they will also custom
cut and even upholster it for you if you want(for extra but I remember
it being very reasonable around 40 bucks or so).

I'm not affiliated in any way with them, just a satisfied customer and
fellow dubber who faced a similar dilemma.
