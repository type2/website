In most cases, this is usually caused by bad grounding.  But, there are
other areas to check.

All beams are individually fused, left and right, so I would start checking
there.  If yer running with aluminum fuses (these are real CHEEPIES), get
rid of 'em.  Always use fuses with brass, not aluminum.  Be sure the "tangs"
the fuses go into are CLEAN and free of corrosion.  Yeah, it could
be corrosion at the left and/or right low beam fuse, especially in areas of
the country with high humidity.  Another area of attention should be made at
the headlight connector itself.  Clean the female connections and the male
ones on the beam itself - use die-electric grease to protect the connections
and prevent corrosion.  Trace the Brown (Ground) wire at the beam
connector to where it grounds to the chassis and clean that up too.

Joseph Ames mentions the headlight relay itself, but if that was the case,
it would manifest it on the left and right low beams at the same time.  But,
to be safe, unplug the relay and again - CLEAN the connections.
