There are a few Southern states where I swear you could register a Radio
Flyer wagon with a Chevy V8.

As much as I would love to encourage you, your government is bound and
determined to protect you from yourself.  You could bring the vehicle in
"for display", but you have to post a large bond the is only refunded if
the vehicle is exported or destroyed.  Same applies for vehicles imported
for "racing" purposes.

Some have managed to fly under the radar by having vehicles imported by
Mexican nationals who "forget" to take them home.  This is not a safe
path, since if Big Brother finds out they will confiscate the vehicle.

You could play the "VIN swap" game, but in any state that requires
any sort of inspection your bus will kind of stand out, what with that
1.4l watercooled engine, tall roof, etc.  While the airplane folks can and
do get away with the "build a new airplane around an old data plate" bit,
the attitude of the automotive regulators is less forgiving.

For the price of that Brasilian bus, you could buy a late
model baywindow, restore the heck out of it, and have a perfectly legal
vehicle to drive, without the headaches of having to import "Brasil only"
parts when the bus breaks.  If you want more power, drop in a Subaru!  The
safety of the late model bays is on a par with the Brasilian buses.
