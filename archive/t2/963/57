Lol!  Talk about blowing a head gasket!

But you're assaulting the wrong Rich White Honkey -- my wife drives an Audi
Allroad biturbo.  Todd's wife wants the Mexi-Bus.

I don't suppose all the rich white racist honky's that drive Touareg's
would mind if I called them rich white racist honky's that waste
natural resources with their big unnecessary SUV's? Or would that be
politically incorrect?

Claiming someone's PC-ness is a tactic used by extreme right wingers
to stifle honestly held opinions and debate on public civility, Mr
Ames. As in, "ugh, that's too PC therefore it's not a valid opinion on
my racist comment that stereotypes Mexicans".

Bus content! Leave it to some rich honky to say that his wife demands
that they be the first on their block to find a way around the laws of
the US and other countries to smuggle a Brazilian Type 2 across the
border.
