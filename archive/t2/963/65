Subject: Door Rubber

Pumpkin II is coming home from the paint/body guy
tonight! Yeah!

I have LOT'S of body rubber ready and a couple
questions...

I understand that the window seals don't need any glue
or sealant, just maybe lube of some sort.  I read
about using dishwashing soap...I assume this won't
hurt the paint?

The door seals obviously need to be glued on.  I
assume normal weatherstrip adhesive from the Flaps
will work? 

Also some of my new rubber is covered with white stuff
(talc?) Do I need to wash this off prior to gluing?

Any other advice also appreciated...

Thanks!
