Well said Sid. I don't post much, however I must ask all of you with the stiff
objects up your backsides to get a life. I have friends of all ethnic
backgrounds and most tell me the only people who have a problem with terms
like wetback, spic, etc.. are the ones looking to impress others with the PC
view. Let it go and get back to the bus baby!!!!

Have a nice day all. > Date: Wed, 4 Apr 2007 20:52:21 -0700> From:
