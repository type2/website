Subject: Dayton Ohio Area - Everybus Attendees?

List,

i am looking to help out a customer move some parts from the Dayton,  
OH area up to me in Toronto. It is a set of drop spindles and torsion  
arms for a Bay Bus. These parts are not terribly bulky, but they are  
heavy and quite expensive to ship.

I was wondering if someone from the Dayton, OH area, who is attending  
Everybus might be able to collect them and pass them along to either  
myself (if we make EBus) or another Toronto E-Busser. The person  
lives in Dayton and works in Vandala.

Send me a personal email if you can lend a hand.

thanks,

Scott Lyons
