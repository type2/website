Here's the easiest way to get this done.

There are several staes that only require a bill of sale to issue a
title.
Write a receipt with the vehicles vin number, send $100.00 to a title
service in one of theses sates.
( I believe SO. Carolina is one of them)

They'll send you a title issued from that state.
When you get the title--transfer the title to your state.
Done.
No questions asked.

A friend of mine restores old Triumph motorcycles that he digs up and
they have no titles.

He gets a legit title for them when he's all done , and has been doing
it this way for at least 15 years.

It works.
