Subject: bus FI info 

I know there is info out there but having bit of a hard time finding it with 
this shop computer (lack of links)
I'm trying to decipher the pugs on a FI harness.
this I think is a older harness as it has the 2 wires for throttle switch 
.But the plug that I thought would be for the resistor is different than the 
other harnesses I have here.
instead of it being rectangle it looks like a cross an has some wires out of 
it to another black plug like goes to the afm.
I'm looking for more info on this complete injection set up
