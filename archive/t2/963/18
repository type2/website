Subject: Re: [T2] Throwing in the towel on my louvers

Have you attempted a rebuild of your louvers? It's a lot of work, but
my faith in them has been restored since talking to a bus owner while
I was in CA that recently did his. They move smooth as silk and have
no rattles, even when driving with them open.

I gave up mine for sliders on my 73 and never looked back. But if I
had seen those rebuilt ones I may have reconsidered.
