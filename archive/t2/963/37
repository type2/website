  If the "builder" is in CA, go for something smog exempt...

  here in CA the department of motor vehicles would never catch on...
just chop the serial numbers off an old bus, and stick it on the new
one.  If you ever get "caught", let them know it is a full
restoration.  You started with a 19XX bus, started cleaning it up.
More and more metal fell away, so you kept on replacing parts out of a
recent donor car...  All that is left is the original serial numbers
:-P
