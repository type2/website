 That sticker on the door frame, for one...

OK, in theory, one could take a VW bus 
across the Mexican border and transfer
all the necessary id's to a new Brazilian
bus and drive that back to the USA...
That was how old Beetles were "re-
tored" when Beetles were still being
made in Mexico.
The problem with the Bus restoration
is getting the two together. Unless
you've got a way to get the two Buses
to Mexico - Canada's out - I can't see
a way to do it.

BTW, don't get caught tryin' this...There's
some serious fines and probably a little time
in the bob-wire motel... ;-(
