Subject: Re: [T2] Only idles with choke closed

Carb issues? Which are you using? I've had this problem with a couple
of 34PICT3's. Sorry wish I had a solution, the only one I've found is
to switch carbs. Even replacing all the jets in one of the carbs
didn't help at all.

Hope you get an answer more specific then that, then I might be able
to take that shiny rebuilt /rebushed 34PICT3 out of the box and onto
my engine.

peace
