You "might" be able to bring one into the country for "display or show"
purposes, but you'd never be able to register it for street use. It doesn't
come with a vehicle compliancy certificate certifying that it meets ALL
the rules and regs for the USA...Importing a legal car into the country is
difficult enough... ;-(
