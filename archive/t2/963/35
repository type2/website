Only half way seriously...

What's to stop one from "building" a bus from "parts" around a salvaged 1979
dashboard?

You "might" be able to bring one into the country for "display or show"
purposes, but you'd never be able to register it for street use. It doesn't
come with a vehicle compliancy certificate certifying that it meets ALL
the rules and regs for the USA...Importing a legal car into the country is
difficult enough... ;-(
