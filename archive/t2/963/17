Subject: Throwing in the towel on my louvers

I think I am going to give up on the louvered windows in my '77 Westy and go to sliders, too noisy, too much work to make them work really good.

I have 4 louvered windows, I bought 2 extra off Craigslist last year because the one in my sliding door was falling apart, I would like to trade all 4 for 1 pair of sliders.

I have one brand new knob from Bus Depot I haven't installed yet and a few other knobs in varying levels of poor condition, they are included.

Anybody interested?

Thanks,
James in Portland, Oregon
