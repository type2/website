hehehe.. you're like me.  I hate those things.  They leak a ton of air 
into the back and rattle like crazy.  Keep your eyes open for some 
sliders and they'll definitely pop up.  I do know of a guy in riverside, 
CA that probably has a pair, but that's quite a distance from you.  If 
you decide you want to get some from him, let me know.
