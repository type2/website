Subject: Fuel pump testing

I went to start my bus the other to no avail. The engine is cranking
just fine but it's just not firing. I'm thinking that it's not getting
enough juice so I replaced the fuel filter which didn't make a
difference so next I want to move to the fuel pump. Although there was
back flow of fuel from the engine I hear no noise from the pump at any
time when the key is in the on position. After searching online I see
that pumps aren't cheap so before I go out and buy one I'd love to test
the old pump first, even though having a spare doesn't seem like a bad
idea. I read in the manual about using the 500cc pump test. Is this a
good way to test it or do any listers out there have a better method?
I've searched the archives but wanted to try the list too. Any advice is
appreciated.
