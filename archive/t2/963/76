The place that Stiles went to is up in Boulder, CO and goes by the  
name of Boulder Comfort.  We did an initial order from them and they  
seem to have the best price around.  However, make sure you double  
check what they are ordering for you as they did not get our order  
correct.  Customer service quality definitely seems to be hit or miss  
with them though.  Ultimately, we ordered all the rest of our foam  
from a mom/pop shop down in Colorado Springs.  The name is  
Timberline.  Great quality foam, great customer service, but at a  
slightly higher price.  Me personally, I'll be going back there for  
any other foam I need.  Great people.

I don't know about a discount order, since we have already ordered  
all of our foam.  If price is the only thing your worried about, you  
can give Boulder Comfort a try.  Although our experience wasn't very  
good, there are others that didn't have any problems.  We did not get  
your typical foam setup. We took a base foam with a firmness of 45  
and then added a 2" layer of memory foam.  Three pieces of this to  
cover the z-bed setup in the back came in a right under $450.00, to  
give you an idea.  Even without memory foam, if you want good  
quality, its going to be around $200 to $250.
