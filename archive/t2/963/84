Subject: Re: [T2] Angle Grinder and Door Handle Removal

Take off the interior panel and you can get to teh bolts for the  
doorhandle.  IIRC they take a 6mm allen wrench, and the rear one is a  
little tricky to get at.  Been awhile since I replaced the one on the  
passenger door, and I haven't gotten around to fixing the driver-side  
handle that started acting up last weekend.

FWIW, I've been much happier with the "flap wheels" for my grinder  
that TrueValue stores are starting to carry than I ever was with the  
Norton "stripping sponges".  They seem to work a bit better and in my  
experience last considerably longer.
