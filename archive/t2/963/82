  For those of you who dont see irony in this topic...ummm... how is it
  so many of you are offended by unPC comments, when the history of the
  Company who's vehicle you own and love, has its roots in the worst  form
  of unPCness in human history?

  And if usage of a term like "wetback" sets your panties in a bunch,  how
  do you justify owning anything VW in light of the companies  blemished
  role in history?

  Honestly, how do any of you sleep at night knowing the vehicle you  has
  its legacy in one of humanities ugliest atrocities?

  Where is your righteous indignation now?

  Enjoy your rides tomorrow, hypocrites.
