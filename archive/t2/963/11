Subject: transmission noise

Hello,

I have an 84 Vanagon that is making some kind of drive train noise. The
noise - which isn't always present - seems to happen more in low gear -
when starting off the line - and through second gear. It disappears,
however, when I push in the clutch. Today the sound was quite loud and when
I pushed in the clutch, (after second gear), instead of the noise stopping -
it sounded like something was spinning for a few seconds before the noise
stopped. It reminded me of what a bad throughout bearing sounds like -
except I don't have any problem shifting or using the clutch - and if it was
a bad throughout bearing wouldn't the noise happen when I push in the
clutch? Thanks for any advice in advance.

 

Rob
