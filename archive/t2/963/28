Subject: Brazilian VW Bus

My wife INSISTS that we buy a brand new Brazilian Volkswagen Bus. I told her I didn't think it was possible because they don't meet US safety and crash test ratings. Is there ANY to buy one and bring it over to the states? Even if it isn't legal to drive on the street, can I still bring one over? (and then maybe work something out in one of the states with more LAX registration laws?


Thanks!
