Todd -

It's not the states you have to contend with, it's the Federales.  Their
policies supersede most state rules regarding what's legal spec to bring
in.  Had a friend try it with California on a Vanagon Crew Cab Pickup - they
registered it (it had the legal FI powerplant & cat converter). But the
Federales caught up with him a year later because there wasn't any legal
documentation regarding bringing it to Federal Standards, confiscated the
vehicle, $28K fine and that's on top of the $12K he paid for the beast.

Although Tony mentions one way they did it with Mexican Beetles, the more
tried and true method was to transport chassis/pans down to an independent
shop in Puebla, MX.  They completely refurbished the pans and married them
up to brand new Beetle bodies and interiors (threw the original pans away),
drove 'em back to the states to legally re-sell them.  I have a friend in
North Hollywood that has a 99 Mexican Beetle on a 73 pan that he bought this
that way.

Back in the mid 80s, I collected pans to sell to people transporting them to
Mexico to do this very thing.  Violates the "spirit", but not the "letter"
of the law.  A bit more difficult to do with a Bus as they're quasi-unibody
construction - no pan to separate and exchange.

Get yer wife to insist on something else ;-)
