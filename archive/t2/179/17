Personally, I think such a unit would be too large and heavy for me to 
carry on my camping trips, unless I towed a small trailer behind my Type 2. 
But, to each his own!

I'd try some local sources first....Lowes or Home Depot if you have one. 
Then I would try the phone book locally, and look for suppliers to the 
building trades, as well as a recreational vehicle vendor (someone that 
sells and services travel trailers.) I'd also try a marine parts/service 
facility, if such exist locally.

I'd also go on line and use my browser to find a search engine, such 
as  http://www.altavista.com/  and type in "electric generator" in the 
search blank.


It would give me the following kind of information to extend my search:
