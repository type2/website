Rob,

You are absolutely correct

Except for one small item.

They are all in it for the money !!!!

VW perhaps is the victim of their own stingy ways, creating this VW is
in for themselves thoughts

They are all in it for themselves, and the public is the fools who buy
this crazy stuff.

Believe me, they will produce, and the fools will come--in droves.

It'll be a fad thing, like the PT Cruiser, the Prowler, and the stiil on
the lot,  still waiting to be sold Bugs, who's sales have slowed way
down to a trickle.

I think the interest in the Mini will be good for the first two years,
simply because BMW isn't going to flood the market with them right away.

Later,

Terry

I think the people at BMW when they made the new Mini cooper and even
Ford when they made the new Thunderbird and Chevy making the new Impala
said: 
Hey you know what would be cool? To bring back that old car! Plus it
would make some money. I think their hearts are still in it. I know they
want to make money too, and maybe they have me fooled, but I believe
they honestly feel like they are offering some nostalgia. 
But I think VW's people said: "Hey you know what we could do to make
more money? Design an expensive minivan and call it the Microbus". I
strongly think VWOA has no care for the old bus or even the beetle. I
don't think they are carrying on a tradition like the Vanagon and
Eurovan. 
I know everybody has their own opinion..some will like it and some will
not. There is no right answer, but it just ties in with my feelings that
VWOA is about making money and not about making a people's car anymore. 
I don't mean to upset anyone though. Just offering my opinion. I
apreciate your's too. :0)
