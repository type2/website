  I just switched over to Mobil 1 15-50 and am quite impressed with it. On
my last road trip, around 800 miles I had 0 oil consumption (usually burn a
cup or more), engine ran noticeably cooler (dipstick and spit test) and
seemed smoother, even though that might just be in my mind!

ps. also when checking the oil it appears to be just as clean as when put in


pps. A good friend of mine in Cali, has a Old School German mechanic work on
his 73 westy and uses nothing but Castrol synthetic 10-40

I hope there is no danger starting up the oil thread.

The Bentley shows similar temperature ranges for 20w50 and 15w40.  What's
the advantage of using 20w50?

Also, I asked someone about a single grade oil like 30 and 40 but they said
it has a hard time circulating.  What's good for our TypeIV engines?
