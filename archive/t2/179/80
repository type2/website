Subject: Trikes ? ! ?

A trike, with a type 4 motor.  How ² KOOL...

I would certainly love to have one of those.

Anyone know of one that might be available, or have any contacts they could 
share??

Seriously, in the DC area, you can use the HOV lane during rush hour if you 
have 2/3 occupants, or if you have a motorcycle.  A trike qualifies as a 
motorcycle in Virginia, so I could tool down the HOV expressway on a trike 
to the Pentagon, or swelter on I-395 in an underpowered LST (Large Slow 
Target) - type 2
