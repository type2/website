Simple displacement calculation.  Area of bore times length of stroke.
*Re2 X len for each cylinder. Knowing the dimensions of each cylinder,
you just adjust until the stroke available at the m/c equals the length
of stroke needed at the slave.

George Lyle will probably come up with an easier way, but that's it in a nutshell.
