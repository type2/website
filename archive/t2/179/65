I believe they(ford, bmw, etc.) do feel they are offering nostalgia, but
that they are doing it not for the sake of doing it, but because nostalgia
sells. VW screwed up at this point because if the new "bus" looks like the
concept there is nothing to be nostalgic about. It looks no more like a bus
than a toyota previa. At least the beetle looked like a modern beetle. The
only thing that would sway me is if they came out with single/double cabs
with drop gates on the sides and some towing capacity. Function over
ugliness and all.
