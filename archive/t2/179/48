Subject: Re: [T2] A new micro?  Don't think so!

I think the people at BMW when they made the new Mini cooper and even Ford
when they made the new Thunderbird and Chevy making the new Impala said:

Hey you know what would be cool? To bring back that old car! Plus it would
make some money. I think their hearts are still in it. I know they want to
make money too, and maybe they have me fooled, but I believe they honestly
feel like they are offering some nostalgia.

But I think VW's people said: "Hey you know what we could do to make more
money? Design an expensive minivan and call it the Microbus". I strongly
think VWOA has no care for the old bus or even the beetle. I don't think
they are carrying on a tradition like the Vanagon and Eurovan.

I know everybody has their own opinion..some will like it and some will not.
There is no right answer, but it just ties in with my feelings that VWOA is
about making money and not about making a people's car anymore.

I don't mean to upset anyone though. Just offering my opinion. I apreciate
your's too.  :0)
