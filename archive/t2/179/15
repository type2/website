Kyle,

I can't help with the alarm, but i can help with the screen.  If the frame
is not kinked, replacing the screen wire is a doddle.  Take a look at:
http://www.hgtv.com/HGTV/project/0,1158,BDRE_project_10685,00.html
for the basic instructions.  The only mod I would make to their procedure
is that I would keep the spline until you have new spline of the same
diameter in hand.  I could not find any of that diameter local to me,
others have, but YMM definitly V!  The old spline can be reused, I have.
