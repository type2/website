I hope there is no danger starting up the oil thread.

The Bentley shows similar temperature ranges for 20w50 and 15w40.  What's
the advantage of using 20w50?

Also, I asked someone about a single grade oil like 30 and 40 but they said
it has a hard time circulating.  What's good for our TypeIV engines?
