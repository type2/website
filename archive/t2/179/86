bummer, my mom has a 2000 TDI Jetta, another friend has a Wolfsburg
Jetta & yet another has a 2002 TDI Jetta. All three have expressed
good things about the service they receive at dealers both here in TN
& also in OR. But then again what they consider to be good service is
not necc what we would call good service. I will say this for the
local VW dealer. A few months I ordered a small part (<$5.00). The
person on the phone was very cordial & made no fuss about ordering
this part (gasket) from the warehouse. YMMV and all that.
