So, 50 years from now, on the holographic-OmniNet type-2 forum, will we see
posts like:
"So the flux capacitor on my vintage 02 type-2 apparently uses some software
that was originally written by a company called Microsoft - anyone know
where I can osmosize the data I need to refribulate it? Gee I wish they
