sure they couldn't pass the safety and emissions rules, that's the main
reason the VW van now has the engine in the front, crashworthiness, the
rear engine did not allow for the front to have enough crush room.

hey I'll make you a deal you can't refuse on some refurbished Skoda's
garaunteed to run at least 15minutes.  of course if you want to trade up I
think I've got a coupla Yugo's in the back lot.....

VW dropped the beetle in the USA when it stopped selling, wasn't worth the
energy to upgrade it to meet code,  sort of the same thing with the bus,
they tried to keep it alive with the Vanagon but it just wasn't the same
and the sales force was too busy selling and fixing rabbits to worry with
the buses
