I second that. I recently replaced the rear flex hoses on my 70, and they
were plugged! I cut them open after removing them, in 2 different places,
you could not see a hole in the middle at all. How the brakes worked was
beyond me. I got the idea from someone on the list who pointed out that all
the split bus guys were doing this, it is a good idea. BTW, the hoses looked
perfect on the outside. Tom
