Usually they just come right off. you might need to back the brake pads
off if the drums are worn badly. I usually pull the drum with the tire
on as it gives good grab area.

No. But I dont get the drums turned as I want to get max life out of my
bus parts. you can break the glaze with some sandpaper.

Nothing beats a 3/4" breaker bar and 46mm socket. I vought my breaker for
6$ at a Ga pawn shopand spent like 35 for an SK socket. :) This you can
buy japanese at a discount tool place like northern etc.

No. Is the jack tall enough? You need aither one of those monsters or an
SUV floor jack or you need to get creative. You will have to lift from the
beam or the jack point and its too tall for most typical floor jacks.
I usually use some extra wood block or something to get it up high enough.
good luck
