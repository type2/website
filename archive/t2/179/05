Joe--

My 74 has an automatic in it--a vacuum shifting auto---

It hesitated shifting into 3rd--but I found the problem---- a leaking
elbow at the engine side of the firewall---

I replaced al the lines, and fittings--and she's a sweet shifting unit
now---

I would trade the automatic for, 3 things, 2 Samba's, and a
Kubelwagen--:>)


Later,

Terry

Transmission-curse or blessing? 
Hi- 
I'm looking for feedback, bouquets or brickbats, on T2 Automatic
Transmission. I found a cherry little "weekender", a '74 for sale. I was
all excited, until I saw the automatic shifter on the floorboard. 
I dont know anything about these. Are they any good? Should I avoid like
the plaque? Or are they pretty decent units? 
=A0=A0I'd appreciate any and all candid opinions from those who may
currently have, have had, swear by them or swear at them. 
At first guestt, and knowing about the hassels of trying to convert
auto-stick to manual in ghias, I assume a conversion is totally out of
the question. Correct? 
Many thanks, 
Joe
