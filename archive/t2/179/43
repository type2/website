I agree and I hope it is a complete flop.

Lets hear it for a one year only production on the waterbus.

Well said,

What is this?  A microbus?  I don't think so.  What exactly constitutes this
being called a microbus, I mean, other than the marketing.  Early micros
were very much like a true bus of that era.  Engine in back, flat nose,
windows on top for scenic cruising.  This one is front engine, bulbous nose,
and I do not see the top windows.  Uuuuuuuugggggly!!!!!
So is it the 2 tone paint?  Once again VW is drawing on the old which was
once considered a fridge on wheels, and is now a "head turner", and using it
to sell it's product.
Now I am sure we will see these things at shows with our busses, and when we
ask the owner about them, I think we will be seeing some undersides of
noses.  Air is not water, and water, not air.  Excluding of course all the
wasserboxer Vanagons, though in my opinion, that is a van, not a bus.  So is
this new thing.  Let's face it, it's a mini-van!
