Sherri (and everyone else),

I dug around a bit and found a series of pictures I took for this article
that never got imcorporated.  The page that you see covers taking the rear
support/hinge off the bus.  I also took a bunch of pics of the
disassembly, cleaning and reassebly of the hinge block.  I have put the
pics at:
http://www.everybus.com/dworkin/rearhinge/
There is no text, alas, but ask questions and I will do my best to answer.
The pictures that start with "P1010nnn.JPG are the raw pics and are huge!
the named files have been editied and resized and may well be more useful,
thjo I did not get all the pictures edited by any means and there are some
gems hiding in the huge files, alas.
