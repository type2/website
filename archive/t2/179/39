Subject: 76 Westy tranny ground strap?

I found the stub of the corroded tranny ground strap and took out the bolt 
and cleaned up the contact surface......but I don't know where the other 
end of the ground strap attaches. I THINK it is to the body somewhere. Read 
that in another post. Can someone tell me where the non-tranny end of that 
braided ground strap goes, please. I'm under the car, and it will rain 
today, so I'm very interested in hearing from you.

(I'm on the digest, so please carboncopy me to doyt(-at-)nwonline.net)
