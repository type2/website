Andy,

I have not traced the wires really.  I followed the other three the other
day and saw that they were hooked up to something (did not really look that
hard) and found that the only one not hooked up was the green.  My engine is
out of a 72.  As far as I can tell, everything looks stock.  Where are the
alt. connections that I need to chcek.  I will check them out tonight while
I am fixing a fuel leak. I suppose that this could account for the fact that
before I had the engine swapped out, the battery was fine, but after ---
dead after about a week of messing around with it.
