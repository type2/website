Someone tried to break into my bus last night.  (Not like I keep anything=
 in it.)
It doesn't look like they ended up getting in, either that or they locked=
 up after themselves and didn't touch a thing inside.  They pried up the =
louvered windows and tried to stick their hand through the window screen.=
  They ripped the screen, but it is not easily patched because they rippe=
d it where it connects to its frame.  My first question is: is this repar=
able?  I couldn't find them for sale anywhere so I have no idea how much =
a replacement costs.
My second question is: has anyone installed some type of alarm or anti th=
eft device that actually works and doesn't send you running out to your c=
ar at 3 am every night every time a truck drives by.
Just another sign to leave this area.
Thanks,
Kyle
