I believe that wire goes to the oil pressure sending unit. You mention later
that none of the dash lights work? If the oil light wire is not connected, it
will not light. Look down from the top and forward of your distributor for the
little sending unit. Probably you will not have a wire going to it, just a
short lead about 6" long with nothing attached?

No, having an open cap does not effect oil pressure.
What you are feeling blowing out is crankcase pressure. It is formed by the
pistons moving up and down and compression going past the rings. A little is
normal. Too much is bad rings and is called blow-by.

Used is about the only way to get these parts. I can help.....
You mentioned having a 79 with a 78 engine. Is the engine totally a 78? Or
does it have 79 exhaust on it? Makes a BIG difference on the lower tin.
Totally different pieces.
