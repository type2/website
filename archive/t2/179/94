Bob,
I caught it this afternoon on a program called "Power
Lunch".  They showed a handfull of type 2's at the
start of the piece as the commentators described all
of us (type 2 owners and drivers) as aging ex-hippies
yearning for the golden days of the 60's and 70's
while living in liberal college towns such as Berkeley
and Boulder.  They then proceeded to discuss the
business aspect of VW's decision to introduce a
nostalgic vehicle for under $30,000!!!  From what I
saw of the new microbus, it looked to be very plastic
and fake.  Most of CNBC's attention seemed to be
focussed on the television consoles in the back seat. 
What a joke!
