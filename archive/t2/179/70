Subject: "Fun" sounds ;-P

I am a little concerned about two many noises coming from my '72 bus:

(1) When accelerator is fully pressed to the floor or mostly there, a 
rattling sound seems to be coming from the engine.  Closest I can compare 
it to is a piece of plastic in a dryer. If I let off the gas pedal a bit, 
it goes away (or at least it's low enough that I can't hear the rattling 
any more).

(2)  Primarily when the vehicle has been driven around a bit (most likely 
translates to --> when engine gets hot), there is a definite clicking 
sound.  I had a friend listen to it and he said it sounded like it was 
coming from #1 or there was something up with my exhaust system.  Bah.  I'm 
going to play with it a bit in my driveway once it cools down a bit so I 
don't get too fried out there, but I have yet to get a definite answer on 
what this might be -- except that a friend said he could take apart my 
entire engine and *hopefully* figure it out.  Hehe.


Any thoughts on either of these as to whether they are something common 
(which I doubt) or something you might have run into yourself at some point?

Thanks, folks.
