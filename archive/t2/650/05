Alternator? I already deleted the start of this thread.

Alternators don't start charging until they hit a certain RPM (3000 --
4000?) and their coils start interacting with the low voltage field
initially generated by the exciter coil from voltage provided by the
ignition circuit. After they reach that critical point they use a feedback
loop from the regulator  to increase the exciter field voltage to "self
excite" and regulate the output voltage.

All of the alternator equipped Type1 and Type4 motors I've seen required a
slight "goosing" of the accelerator after initial startup to get the light
to go out. Once they've started self-exciting though you should never see
the low-voltage "flicker" that you might with a generator equipped vehicle
if your idle rpm drops too low.

If it's a generator the light should go out as soon as it passes a
threshold rpm (about 800 or so). Generators use permanent magnets for the
field rather than a separate exciter coil that requires power.
