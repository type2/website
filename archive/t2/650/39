Subject: Mystery wire on coil -

Hi folks...

In preparation for installing my CDI, I'm currently rerouting all of my 
ignition-related wiring to a set of terminal blocks located on the 
firewall.  Besides getting all that stuff off the top of the engine, 
this will allow me to go from CDI back to stock by removing 3 wires 
from the terminal block and installing 3 jumpers in the appropriate 
places.

For the "needs to sense points triggering" block, I currently have my 
tach (a yellow wire I installed), the FI trigger (white) that goes to 
pin 1 on the ECU, and a mystery wire (gray/green).  Bentley doesn't 
really describe this mystery wire much... it shows it in the diagram as 
just a little stub, and at the end of the stub is a small circle with 
the number "13" in it.  You can see this clearly on page 5 of 5 of the 
1976 Models wiring diagram on the left side of the page, about half way 
down.  The coil is part N, the wire in question points down and is 
labeled with the color code GY/G.

I read the 77-78 Models diagram just to see if that could shed any 
light on it, but that diagram is just about as clear to me as the 76 
diagram.

The "How to read current flow diagrams" section doesn't seem to explain 
how to read that symbol.  Can someone help me out with what that wire 
does, and maybe explain how to read that symbol?

Thanks!
