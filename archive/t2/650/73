Subject: Re: [T2] Garage for rent?

high matthew not sure if anyone has a garage but a alternative could be checking into the little storage building sites that are all over the place for storing anything to boxes on up to boats and yachts....
 
i am sure you might be able to put your bus in one and work on it there ..
just a thought and trying to help.
peace and love

Hey, just getting back into busses after a couple year hiatus. Had to sell my
68 westy for financial reasons. Things are better. Hopefully aquiring a 70
westy in the near future for resto. Does anyone in the massachusetts
(merrimac valley/haverhill) area have some garage space I can use/rent? Drop
me a line, thanks!!! mlibby(-at-)mailshack.com
