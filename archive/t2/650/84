I'm referring to the ones in our vehicles in the T2 list. Yes Kettering.

That being said, I'll still put a wager for lunch that the 79-83 factory one
is a joke to a Mallory. I ran a garage for almost 20 years, worked on them
all (including the ones you are referring to), NO CONTEST.

I'm not saying anyone "needs" it, but the bosch distributors (all of them;
all is all) in the VW T-2s are not even close to "accurate". They do work,
but that depends on your definition of "work". 009s also "work" for most VW
owners.
