Again you don't get it. You DON'T ever answer any questions.

I asked you questions in my reply. What do I get for an answer?  "witty".....and name calling..

Where is your answer to this section??


">I said the Mallory has improved power UP TO 25hp (I suggest you re-read my
posts). I never guaranteed joe blow 25hp by putting one in. You have seen
one too many used car commercials, and could win the Olympics with your
Conclusions Jumping abilities.

NO where does the words UP TO appear. No, you can't answer anything.....
Wait, I take that back. You did say:  "since you seem to feel my position as selling more then any
other VW Vendor in the World is somehow making me cross the line into lying."
Yep, you did cross the line. I just looked again.... UP TO did not magically appear.
All you do is sell, not answer questions. 
I am done.
