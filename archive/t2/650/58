Subject: Weber progressive jetting

As promised, the jetting for my weber progressive running on a 2l is as 
follows:

             Primary    2ndry
Main       135         140
Idle          60           50
Air Corr   170         180

This is the jetting as is when I bought the bus. I haven't attempted to 
change it b/c it is working!

Cheers,

Martin Strandgard
