Subject: RE: [T2] Garage for rent?

<Somehow he found two other guys that are auto/motorcycle enthusiasts that
were in a similar situation.  They leased a very large commercial use garage
and split the rent three ways.>

We have  3 guys here at work that have done the VERY same thing. Like Seann said, lock up your tools... 

I rented a storage unit and used it for a garage when I was in the Navy. Didn't have power so I bought an inverter and worked during the daylight hours. NOT optimal but I built a Beetle in that unit and cleaned it RIGHT when I left. 

The funny part was one day when I was doing brakes and a spring jumped and weent through some crack in the way into the adjoining unit. I had to disasseemble the wall to get it. No, security was not great but it would take noise or time to get from one unit to the next. Also the inverter would occasionally require me to push start my CR-X when I left... Eventually I got a hitch on the CR-X and a towbar for the Beetle (and wheels/tires) so I could drag it over to the base and get into the auto shop. Lifts are GOOD.
