I'm am not sure if this kind of thing makes me sick to
my stomach or proud to have been on the "Bus
Band-wagon" before it became so trendy!!

Anything odd or unusual is fair game in advertising
photos...An avid car spotter can pick out plenty of
oddball/orphan cars in ads where the object is to
catch your eye...An Alfa Romeo spider in an insur-
ance ad...A Healey 3000 in an ad for "feminine
products" ...It all depends on what you think you
want the picture to "say"... A generic car in an ad
(Camry ?-) is just supposed to be a car, part of
the background noise...An iconic vehicle is used to
impart something else...Of course, that could de-
pend on the viewers feelings about the vehicle in
question, whether the image "works" or not... ;-(
The NY Lottery runs an ad with a "Woodstock"
theme and there's a Bay in the back of one of the 
shots...Despite the fact that Bay's missed the
original Woodstock by a year...
