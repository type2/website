Subject: Re: [T2]oil coming out of dipstick(pulling engine)longgggggggg

ok so i finally got the big mess cleaned up and enough time to spend with the little lady(bus).
 
been at it all morning and pulled dipstick from tube and checked level and surprising from all the oil on the ground was reading on the line of level..?
 
soooo i hooked a piece of gas hose to the dipstick tube and opened the cap on the oil filler cap and blew through it and got air back out the oil filler tube sooooo no resistance hombre.
 
ok. same hose hooked to dipstick tube i drilled a hole in the top of a peanut butter jar lid and attached the hose to it and sealed with trusty duct tape.
screwed the jar to the lid and started the bus up.
was a hard crank and sounded grinding like at first could of been hasnt been cranked in few days(battery?) but worried me the crank didnt sound lubricated in the engine? arg&^&^(*&6
 
usually starts right up...........
ok so now that she's cranked i let her warm up and at this time stepped back to check the jar...? nothing in it but air so far... no oil leaking except what i couldnt get to;; to clean up that is shaking off the mustache bar and such above that i now wipe from the ground so that when i back back up i can tell if it is leaking from where?
 
ok took trash off 2.5 miles down the road and by the time i went 2.5 miles to trash dump throwed trash away.(starting to sound like arlo guthrie here lol) ...
i checked under the engine hood of that litttle bay window bus and about lost my top(mind).
 
the 18.oz peanut butter jar was about 16 ounces full of oil already and i had to go back 2.5 miles home from the trash dump (where i took all the garbage)lol,...
 
got home and parked her as the oil dripped all out the bottom right hand side of the heater box and engine. this is where it had overfilled the 18oz jar of oil to maybe 25 ounces possibly?guesstimation.//./././././
 
SOultion....
going to put the loaner engine(club engine) in the bus sometime this weekend but dont want to drive the bus no more so am in the pickle of how to get the bus there now?
afraid there is some major damage going on here inside the engine that seems to be running so good now....arg&^%&^%*^
 
i got to thinking about something.
my dizzy bracket i found broken a few weeks back when all this started and my timing of course was out pretty bad causing the bus to run bad and well after the fix of a new/used dizzy bracket so it will stay tight now i have been struggling with this oil blowby problem.
 
kinda figuring that the timing being run so long out that it could of messed the engine up and ran her to hot .??? best idea i have came up with to cause this problem...?
if i remember correctly it was running on almost TDC cause the dizzy had been found loose. the dizzy bracket had broken sometime or another i guess when she started running bad and am guessing when i went to easely to help a fellow moonie out?
was hot that day really bad and bet it knocked my timing out that day cause i remember her running bad back up the road.
 
thanks for all the help
dont know why i didnt think about using a jar of some sort earlier..would of told me alot sooner if it was actual blwo by or not>?.?AND DID
peace and love
chris
wish me luck goona need all i can get to get my daily driver back on the road trying to make money with no transportation arg%&^*%&^%*^%^%







Peace and Love
