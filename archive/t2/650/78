Indeed.

I suspect I know how Richard feels on this topic.  For some of us, know 
that something works is not good enough.  We feel compelled to 
understand *why* it works :-)

I would love to see a graph of the stock advance curve vs. the curve 
that John C's Mallory configuration results in.

As Richard said to me the other day... ah, if only our VW engines had 
knock sensors.
