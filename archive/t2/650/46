Yup, sounds like it's down for the count, You should
have poured the oil caught in the jar back into the
engine and when you returned home it would not have
ran over. I'll be at Buddah's this Friday around five,
use the pour-back method to get to Buddah's. I have
several engines to work on this weekend, one more
won't hurt. The 1.8 that I am trying to work on here
just keeps getting put off, there are four pistons, I
have only gotten rings on one piston so far but I've
got a sweet running 1.6L bus engine built. It's going
to be the loaner engine for "FMBC" for the early
bay's. I'm taking the 1.6L to Buddah's for storage and
issue. Phil
