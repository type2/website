 I'm referring to the ones in our vehicles in the T2 list. Yes Kettering.

 That being said, I'll still put a wager for lunch that the 79-83 factory one
is a joke to a Mallory. I ran a garage for almost 20 years, worked on them
all (including the ones you are referring to), NO CONTEST.

You need to raise your level of education.

ALL 79-83 CALIF type IV's are electronic ignition. NOT a Kettering style.
You might have ran a garage but you are out of touch with reality.

Richard is not being hard-headed with his questions. He wants honest answers.
I agree with him, you are blowing smoke about the Mallory and NOT giving any facts
about what you are comparing it to. Sure, any brand-new-out-of-the-box Mallory will perform better than a worn
out distributor. Sure, Joe Blows rebuilt dist is a pile of crap with used up
mis-matched parts. But you cannot just put a Mallory in a engine and say it gives the engine 25 more horses.
Show us that will happen against a brand new  039-905-205C.
In other words, get off you 'You gotta buy this from me' soapbox.
