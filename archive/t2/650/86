Subject: Re: [T2] Mallory

I was making a point; I am aware of the Cal vanagons and the fact that they
do not use points. But they DO have the same sloppy bushings and oil control
that all Bosch distributors have. And their spark scattering characteristics
are similar to a points distributor with a pertronix/compufire in them.
Better then points, not even close to a Unilite.

I have used both Karl; and have the experience to compare them. HAVE YOU
USED A UNILITE? If so I'll shut my pie hole, but if you have not then you
are speaking out of pure ignorance.

I frankly do not care WHAT distributor you guys use, I really do not. Have a
crate of monkeys manually cranking a dynamo to each plug for all I care.

I piped in because I was answering some questions on the Unilite, and trying
to clear up the HERESAY AND MISINFORMATION on what they can and can not do.
If you want un-biased experience on them, I'm sure there are list members
will pipe in, since you seem to feel my position as selling more then any
other VW Vendor in the World is somehow making me cross the line into lying.
Sorry, I do not do that; ask around if you feel so inclined.

I said the Mallory has improved power UP TO 25hp (I suggest you re-read my
posts). I never guaranteed joe blow 25hp by putting one in. You have seen
one too many used car commercials, and could win the Olympics with your
Conclusions Jumping abilities.

I am done with this thread.
