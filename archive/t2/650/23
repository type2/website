Subject: Looking for website

Hello a few months back or so a list member sent a
link to his website where he built a trailer to tow
behind his bus. The trailer was red and he used a
pop-top on his trailer. Does anyone still have this
link? I seemed to have lost it. 

A friend of mine is going to give me her pop-top, when
she puts her high roof top on, and I want to build a
trailer with it. 

Thanks,
