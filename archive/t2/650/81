Subject: Re: [T2] Mallory

knock sensors are available (we have them in stock), but the $500-550
pricetag is out of reach or deemed "too expensive" for most VW owners.

much of the increased power from a Unilite is the timing accuracy. Ignition
"timing" is the timing, +- the accuracy of the triggering. The mallory is
6-8 degrees more ACCURATE then bosch distributors, with a
pertronix/compufire dropping this to 4-5 degrees or so. This coupled with a
better advance curve is
where most of the additional power is coming from.

Most people do not realize how inaccurate the bosch units are. They assume
their timing light is "supposed" to scatter as much as it does. Only after
timing a Mallory do you realize it's not your timing light that's causing
the erratic spark scatter, its your engine! Many people think their ignition
system "is perfect" even after putting a light on it. The clarity of the
timing marks when triggerring off a Unilite usually eliminates the "is
perfect" comments.

And lastly; out of hundreds of Unilites sold, we have never ever had someone
say they thought it was too expensive AFTER they bought one. They do say
this beforehand, but never afterwards.
