Subject: thermostat sold

Thermostat bracket set up sold. Still have the egr filter for sale and will even throw in a couple egr valves in usable decent shape,some connector pipes and a couple NOS vw gaskets for the valve for $30.00(you pay shipping on this lot though). I can get the part numbers of the gaskets later.
