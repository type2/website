Subject: RE: [T2] Gen light stays on -- goes out after engine revs

Sounds to me like you accidentally disconnected a wire from your generator
or your voltage control unit -- or it just happened to blow at the same
time. I have a 61 Ford Econoline truck that has had a number of
generator/alternator problems and when the control unit or the
generator/alternator go or a wire gets knocked loose, you'll get the light
staying on. Get out a volt meter, check to see if you're getting a charge at
the battery, should read 13-14volts or so. If you're getting a charge, but
the light is staying on, could be the control unit. If you're not getting a
charge, I'd check the wiring from the generator.
