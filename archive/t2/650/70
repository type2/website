You've got me curious because I'm also running mine on a 2L, but I run
black in the exhaust pipes. I have no idea what jets are in it!

 As promised, the jetting for my weber progressive running on a 2l is as
 follows:
 
              Primary    2ndry
 Main       135         140
 Idle          60           50
 Air Corr   170         180
 
 This is the jetting as is when I bought the bus. I haven't attempted to
 change it b/c it is working!
 
 Cheers,
