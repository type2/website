No, it felt like it was dry and binding but it did move.

D'oh!  There was no felt pad in the center.  Maybe I should have used my 
2nd-order spare - it had the felt pad and advanced freely and smoothly.  I 
didn't install it because it has some surface rust on the shaft and was 
missing points and condenser.  I guess I should have done a more thorough exam.

I just did all of that and it is still binding a little, though it is much, 
much better.  It is mainly the return movement that binds now - goes 
partway back and then stops.  I'm wondering if driving with it that way for 
a while might have galled it up.  I will see if an overnight soak improves 
things and if not I will probably swap it out with the other spare tomorrow 
night.

Thanks Karl, for your detailed reply.
