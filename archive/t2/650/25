Subject: Update on head leakage

Thanks for the suggestions and imput. Two heads ARE better than one.

I didn't lap the cylinders to the heads. The rebuilt head was not from my
vehicle. This will help alot.

A pressure test  of both cylinders only reached about 50 lbs. A hissing
sound could be heard at low idle but would stop when rev ved.

Will I still be able to re-use the heater box to head gaskets? Maybe with
some red RTV. Those things take awhile to get.

Thanks again,
Craig
