Subject: RE: [T2] Gen light on...please help

As it turns out...I spoke too soon. I put in new brushes and had my GEN
light go out. Well it came back on this morning on the way to work.
According to the test I did, it appears to be toast. I've gotten the
funding from the treasurer (my wife) to go for the alternator upgrade.
Can someone enlighten me as to what this entails. I'm assuming this is
an engine in operation or it's a no go for now. It looks like I have the
generic gen/alt stand already in place, but I won't know absolutely for
sure until I get into it I guess. I know I'll need a new fuel pump and
rod, is that it??

As you can probably tell from my posts, I'm not the brightest bulb, but
not a dummy either. I've pulled my engine and even got it back in (with
a little help), but I just want to make sure I'm not biting off to much.
This needs to be a Saturday one day job.

TIA
