Subject: Re: [T2] Gen light stays on -- goes out after engine revs

Hi Peter,

My '79 Westy does the same thing, and has done so since I bought it.  I 
replaced the alternator & voltage regulator and checked all the wiring, but 
it still does it.  It usually does it on cold mornings when the battery is 
weak, but a quick rev of the engine (up to 1500rpm) turns the light off.  
Battery is getting 14 volts with the light off, and battery holds a good 
charge overnight.

Maybe there's a relay that isn't closing right away?  Maybe the alternator 
is running below a certain RPM to cross a charging threshold?  It's not a 
big deal for me, since it's so easy to make the problem go away.

Please post if you find a solution -- I'd like to see what it is.

Good Luck!
