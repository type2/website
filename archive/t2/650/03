Hmmm...well I was quite careful when I connected all the wires to the 
alternator, and I tried two different regulators (I suppose they could both 
be shot).

My light only stays on until I rev the engine a bit. Then it goes out...

Well, I'm pretty sure the battery is getting charged, because I've put almost 
200 (mostly city) miles on since installing the new engine and it starts 
fine. I'll still check the voltage, though.
