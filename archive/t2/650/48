This is important to mention when folks says it fits because there are several mallory body styles as proven by the fact they don't use a universal cap for all models.

I would think spring selection would be the most important part.

On a stock motor, why would the two grey springs which produce a single stage advance curve have any hope of matching the original two stage advance curve? The grey curve advances quickly and the advance stop you set will tame it but it's too much advance too soon don't you think?

The spring kits seems tailored for V8 advance profiles.

When you said earlier you can tune the amount of vac advance but not when it comes in how did you compensate for it coming in too early or too late?

The Mallory while flexible to config, can the configuration even come close to the stock curve? Has anyone who has done the install tried to prove it?
