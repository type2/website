Three different motors/alternators in the '74 (before I dismantled it for
the the "forever and a day" restore) and the alternator equipped type1 1600
in a friend's '70 all behave exactly the same way.

I probably got the "goosing" RPM number high. Probably more like 1500rpm to
get the light to go out. Just a little over a high idle.

Maybe your starter spins the motor fast enough to kick the exciter at
startup?

Perhaps, as Jason suggests, it's a "corroded wire syndrome".

But 4 setups showing the same bahavior to me suggests it's fairly common.
And the fact that a light tap on the accelerator (or just normal "pulling
out of the driveway actually) makes it "go away" causes it to be a
non-problem.
