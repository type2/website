Subject: Was set screws in head - now: plug the smog control holes!

After weeks and weeks of burning my hands trying to get the holes plugged
reasonably, I followed some suggestions and went with a couple SAE bolts:
7/16" x 1" long. I could have gone shorter if I could find them, but that
was the shortest ACE had. A whopping 50 cents for both bolts - less than a
single M10 bolt of any size!

These threaded themselves into the head and made a really nice seal. I
would have liked to go shorter just so I could replace them if needed. I
still can. There's a good 2 1/2" inside there and I'm only using 1" of the
hole. If I have to do it again, I may just tap the hole out at 7/16" but
with luck, I'll never deal with this again until a rebuild or another
bus...

Thank you all!

-Eric
