Subject: more painting and bodywork and stuff

Bodywork questions...
OK, is it bad to sandblast the rust off?  It seems so much faster than 
sanding.  To fill in dings and pitts from rust, is por-patch what I should 
use or is there something better?  For the bigger dents, is the preferred 
method to weld nails in the dent and pull, cut out and weld in new, use a 
dent puller?  I'm not sure my welding skills are up for welding sheet metal 
where it will be seen. Is there a good detailed website for a person at home 
to do their own bodywork?

Paint and prep questions:
Do I sand down to the metal or is that not a good idea - can I just sandblast 
stuff until the paint is gone?  In between coats, what kind of sander do I 
use to make the job as easy as it can be?
I have painted a bug with acryllic enamel (and hardener) before and it came 
out well.  The paint was a little chalky after 5 years when I sold it.  Is 
there better stuff that is as easy to spray?
Is there a good primer that is recommended for the home painter?  I have a 
7hp 60gal compressor and a "cheap" craftsman sprayer, should I use this for 
the primer only and get a better sprayer for the paint?  What is hvlp? Is 
this stuff covered (in a simple, step-by-step mannor) in a website 
somewhere?  I'd really like this to look nice, but I have a "want" to do it 
all myself, even if it's not as good as a professional (this is my version of 
fun).
Thanks to all,

Jennifer
