Subject: Re: [T2] 205E distributor vacuum canister failure

I am assuming this is a 021 905 205E for a 72 bus?  [not a 211 905 205E for a
49 - 12/53 bug and 2/55 - 59 bus] Since you did say it has a dual vacuum
unit.......
Then you should have 885 on the arm of the vac unit?
This unit only fits 72 1700 and 73 1700 auto trans engines. Dist # 021 905
205E (0 231 173 005) and 021 905 208F (0 231 173 007).
Jim's dizzy sight also says 021 905 205Q (0231 173 008) but that number does
not appear anywhere else.....
The short Bosch number for the 885 vac unit is 07 101. The long number is 1
237 121 885. Good luck finding one.
