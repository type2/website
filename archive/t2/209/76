Subject: Re: [T2] re: Westy extinguisher size? Halon

i tried my hand at selling those halon extinguishers many years ago when
i was a struggling art student. i am not much of a salesman, so i didnt
make anything. you had to pay for the extinguishers you used. i sold a
couple and might have broken even. all i know is that i was very
impressed with the information they gave us. one thing people dont know
about regular "chemical" extinguishers is that they must be recharged
every year to be reliable. another is the corrosive element. it may put
out the fire, but then the chemicals will eat all your electronics (or so
they told us). anyway, if i could afford a halon, i would definitely
invest in one.

OMG! i just read the rest of your post... i didnt realize it had been
discontinued!!! CRIKEY! that sucks... they always take away the good
things, man! oh well,
