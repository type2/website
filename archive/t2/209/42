I think your assumption is logical, but incorrect.  If you remove the hose 
from the fan shroud, you will discover not vacuum, but + pressure.  This 
'blows' air into the charcoal canister, which is then routed to your air 
cleaner.  This creates a vacuum inside the canister, drawing vapors from 
within the fuel filler/tank, and burning the fuel rather than allowing it to 
escape into the atmosphere.
