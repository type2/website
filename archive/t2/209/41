Subject: Update: timing off at 20 degree

Thanks for the three responses.  They were helpful.

All this with the engine running . . .

(1) I put a vacuum gauge just before the distributor bisket and I was 
getting no vacuum at idle. Zilch.

(2) I pushed the throttle, and the vacuum went up (perhaps) to 1.

(3) I pinched off the vacuum tube from the air cleaner, pulled off the 
vacuum gauge, and sucked on the hose from the gauge. That is, I applied 
vacuum to the distributor bisket with the engine running. I then got the 
timing to advance from 20 to about 34, so I think the problem is before the 
distributor bisket.

Could I have screwed up the air cleaner when I removed and replaced it last 
week??

BTW, last night the Westy was throwing out copious amounts of heat from the 
vents.  My plan today was to simply undo the wiring open of the heater 
control boxes, but since I had the Westy 'open', I looked around and found 
this vacuum/timing problem.

BTW again, I have started experiencing the 'hot start' problem again, so I 
am going under the Westy to also install a Bosch WR-1 relay (again!!)  Thank 
heavens that last year I put in an extra hank of wire from the solenoid to 
the engne compartment.  I used the bare end of this wire to the battery 
terminal two times in the last two days....
