Gles,

What ever you do prior to even thinking of purchasing this Bus--do buy,
rent, steal,or borrow a compression tester.
This will on test tell you more than maybe possibly anything else on the
engines overall condition.
Low or no compression---forget it, unless of course your into engine /
head rebuilds.
Good compression---it may be a buyer---depending on the overall
condition of the Bus, and the mood you happen to be in that moment---you
have to lay out the cash for the purchase price.

Later,

Terry

Hello Friends, 
I'm new to the vintage VW scene and need a little assitance. I'm looking
at and have put money down on a 1978 Type 2 with the 2.0 engine. The
body is fairly good with minimal rust and the driver side door replaced.
Chassis rust is non existent and over-all it looks like a pretty clean
vehicle. I did give it a test drive which went well, tranny seemed fine
and although it drifted a little it drove fairly well. (I don't have
anything to base that on since it was the first one I've driven.) The
one thing that I neglected to do that's worrying the heck out of me was
a compression test. There was also a small leak out of the left side of
the engine which I'm told is probably the oil cooler. No leak while
idling but after running on the freeway for 1/2 hour it dripped for
about 3 min. a puddle a little larger than a quarter, then stopped. 
=A0=A0=A0=A0Is there any way that I can figure out from driving it how
good or bad the compression is? It seemed to have fairly decent power
took a little while to get up to sixty but like I said I don't have
anything to base that on. Should I be worried and do a compression test?
Any advice on the oil leak? 
Thanks, peace,
Giles
