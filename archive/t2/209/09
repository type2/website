Subject: Re: air scoops

FWIW, when the dealer helped us add a DPD AC unit to our 71 bus in 1976,
he recommended that we install air scoops (in the location where splitties
have louvers).  Had to cut a big hole in the rear quarter, of course.  As
far as I can recall that bus never ran hot.

I had similar scoops on my 62.  Don't recall any problems.  Neither of my
buses now (65 and 71) have scoops, though, and I'm not in any hurry to get
'em.  I think the folks who say keep the seals in good shape are probably
right, especially with stock setup.
