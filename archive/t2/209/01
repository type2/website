Subject: (ok, it is ALMOST friday...) car show

HOLY COW! did anyone else see the car show on ESPN2 tonight? (9ish PM
CST)
there was this army SUV and they made a video to promote it. it had
electrified door handles, pepper spray squirters above the doors and all
kinds of "james bond" sort of features. damn, i didnt catch the name of
it, but i DID catch the yellow bay window camper in the background on the
video!!!! this thing shot some small missiles or something, in the
direction of the bus, at one point... i thought it was going to blow up
the bus! aparently, i was so focussed on looking at the bus that i didnt
notice the military jeep in front of it. whew! i was about to scream!
"what did that bus ever do to you???"

ok, just thought that was neat... what weird concoctions auto
manufacturers are coming up with these days! EEK!

waving to all,
