I've read about 10K miles of fuel per new car. Can't substantiate that one 
way or another.

I was in the Navy and our ship supported the invasion on Haiti. We had a 
couple 500 gallon (I think 500 gallon) bladders (looks like a huge green 
marsh mellow) dropped each day from a cargo plane to run 4 Seal patrol 
boats. Awesome boats.

They had 2 big block V-8 engines that were punched out to 500 ci (or close) 
with straight exhaust right out the back. They ran on very expensive fuel 
of some sort. AWESOME to listen to. They were built on Cigarette boat style 
hulls. Can't remember if they had blowers on those engines or not but I 
think they did.

I thought to myself how they were using in a few days more fuel than I 
would in a decade or two...
