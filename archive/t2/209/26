Subject: timing off at 20 degree BTDC

The bus:
Stock '78 Fuel Injection USA 49 States model.

The problem:
Timing is seen at 20 degrees BTDC, and timing white mark
does NOT advance with increase in engine speed.

Also:
Dwell is 53, slight change from 50 over three months.

The engine is not known to slip the timing, even a degree.
Timing was checked 6  months ago (7.5 'ish) and the advance
was accurate (thanks HSD)  Only recent noticeable change in performance of  
the  bus is that it is dragging, particularly up hill.

I checked many of the hose connections, but they seem fine/new.
I suspect a vacuum loss, but all of a sudden??

I did remove the air cleaner to take out the battery,
but it looks like I put everything back as I found it.

What's the solution:  (I may reset timing to 7.5, but I am
concerned about the lack of advance.)

PS.  I have never changed the timing, so I only have second hand
and book knowledge.

I have replaced the points three times, so that is no concern.

Thanks for responses. I have the next five hours to bond with my type 2.

Then I have to hug the wife.
