Subject: Re: [T2] (ok, it is ALMOST friday...) Zits comic strip

The email address is zits(-at-)kingfeatures.com

I sent the guys a message last week letting them know how great it was to 
see a bus in the strips. I asked if they were going to take it on a road 
trip and his reply was "We're hanging onto the thought of a major road trip 
sometime -- salivating, really."

Maybe if enough of us encourage him, they'll get the boys on the road!

Later...

Sean,
1970 Microbus ("Mimi")
