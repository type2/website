Subject: Bentley's Bosch FI book, FI ? and Cool green camper 

Hello List,

Well it is friday, well almost. I wnet to Books (-at-)
Million  tonight and picked up the Bosch Fuel
Injection & Engine Management book by Bently. I am
reading up on the L-jetronic fuel injection because I
am getting a L-jet fi settup for my 914 engine. This
is a great book! I would recomend it to any one
interested in changing to or back to fuel injection in
their bus. 

I was told that L-jetronic fi from a bus would work
with the 914 engine if the fuel rails were swaped. Is
there anyting else that needs to be converted when
using this engine? 

Oh, I saw a beautiful sage green camper in the parking
lot of Books (-at-) Million in Wilmington, NC. I don't know
if the owner is a list member or not but it was very
nice nice bus! 

Well it is one week to High Country!!! I am getting
excited. I have so much to do to get ready! I hope
that it is cool and dry this year. Here on the Eastern
side of NC, the weather has been Hot and Muggy! Any
how, Have a great weekend and thanks for all of the
help!!!!
