Subject: RE: [T2] re: Westy extinguisher size? Halon

I read somewhere (I wish I could remember where now) that halon
extinguishers are nolonger sold except for very specific applications
(server rooms and boats I believe) due to the environmental impact they
have. It seems like all things that work really well end up being
outlawed for some reason or another.

It is my understanding, that your local firestation will refill your
halon 
extinguishers.  Look around for a used one.  What's the concensus here, 
listees?  Who still has their halon extinguishers from the 80's?
