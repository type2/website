Subject: Re: [T2] re: Westy extinguisher size? Halon

Folks,

It was my understanding that they were discontinued cause
halon is on par with freon for hurting the atmosphere.

You can still get fire extinguishers from the local suppliers($$$)
that are made specifically for computer type stuff.

I doubt that a halon would help an engine fire.  Halon is required to
"smother" a fire by excluding all oxygen.  Hard to do in an engine 
compartment!

Cheers, dave
