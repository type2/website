A bit of an early Friday post that I hope you all enjoy, as it just made =
my day.  So I get to work today and right away one of my coworkers asks =
me if there is a VW Bus gathering in town ( pop 7000 and I think I am =
the only Bay).  She tells me that there is 3 buses just like mine (my =
daily driver) cruising the streets.  In fact, she thought it was me as =
one is orange in color.  I tell her that it must be someone passing =
through.  Twenty minutes later another coworker arrives and ask me why =
I'm not at the local discount store as there is 3 buses there going =
through a morning inventory and breakfast break.  So, curiosity gets the =
better of me and I jump in my trusty 71 west and head on down to the =
parking lot and see that in fact that a small gathering of 3 Bays are =
indeed in the lot.  So, I pull up and all the occupants yell "hey, it's =
Steve"   My name is Steve though I am not on the AIRS or any other list =
so of course I thinking man this Bus community is not only cool but =
perhaps telepathic.  It seems this a group from Florida that has been on =
the road for about a month and there seems to be someone named Steve on =
the LIMBO list in Spearfish SD that they had been trying to contact for =
a place to park last night.  They great people and we had a really good =
visit.  There heading through Iowa then Ohio and eventually to the =
gathering in NC High Country gathering.  Just had to share this and if =
there is another Steve in Spearfish, South Dakota that's on the list, =
please contact me.  If not, it must have been Bus karma.
Steve
