I also keep an old halon extinguisher in the back of my westy, in one of 
the three little shelves behind the closet.  There's also an ABC dry 
chem behind my drivers seat.  Neither are mounted, but evenutally i'd 
like to mount them both, right where they are.  They are both smaller 
extinguishers (one came from a boat), but you'll notice i have two. 
 I've never had my own fire, but i've put out the neighbor's car once.
