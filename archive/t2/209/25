if you can't get the fire out with a smaller one, then the little bit
extra of a big one is probably only going to delay the inevitable.  I
always carry a jug of water too, most of the fire will be "stuff" lit by
the gas so the water will help cool things down so it doesn't relight.

still trying to figure out how to get a CO2 extinguisher in my bus but
they are getting pretty hard to find...would like to have a engine
compartment smother system but they are $$$$

nice thing about CO2 is they don't make much mess, the dry chem ones are a
real piece of work to clean up after..

dry chem mounted behind drivers seat where it can be reached from outside
or inside
