Subject: Re: [T2] re: Westy extinguisher size?

I blew out a really big engine fire on a XJ12 Jaguar about six months
ago. 
Expended a $42.00 extinguisher doing it. 
The guy didn't even say thanks.
I guess next time his insurance causes friction rubbing up against his
car note he'll have to burn his car where I can't find him.
