Terry,

I can't agree on this one....here's why...

To me, a body in good shape is a *find*.  I can fix just about anything=20
mechanical, but the bodywork/paint is what is expensive for me.

My 78 Champagne edition that is getting painted(professionally) right now
but has horrible compression...around 70# on #1 and 3 and 130# on 2 and 4.

It will still cruise the freeway at 75+mph and get around town fine.
Once it is painted and the windows and interior restored(parts on the way=
=20
now), I will rebuild the engine this fall and winter.

So, as Chris said...what's good for someone else may not be good for me.
If you are a professional painter, then a bus in great mechanical=20
condition but crappy body would be good for you, but not good for me.

A new bus is an adventure....enjoy the trip!

Cheers, dave
