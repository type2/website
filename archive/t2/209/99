It was my understanding that it was a safety hazard that got these pulled 
from the marketplace.  In fact, many industrial applications of halon are 
still in use.  They require oxygen to be nearby for anyone exposed to the 
gas.  It (being heavier than o2) and sinks into the lungs, causing the 
victim(s) to suffocate.  I think people were using the extinguishers 
improperly and killing themselves.
