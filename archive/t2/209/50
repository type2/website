Happy Friday Everyone,
My 80 Vanagon Westy is having a hesitation problem where it won't idle for more than a minute and now when you put it in first and let out the clutch it has no power for about a 4 or 5 seconds then boom off to hyper-drive!!  If I rev it a little while putting it into gear it will go almost fine but still gets a bust of power.  I did just put in new cap, rotor and wires to try and help a moisture problem and it still does this as well not a new problem. Not sure where to start.  Anybody have any ideas? 
Thanks
Kevin
80 Westy
