Subject: Re: [T2] (ok, it is ALMOST friday...) Zits comic strip

>Maybe if enough of us encourage him, they'll get the boys on the road!

I emailed them with some ideas such as having the bus catch on fire, getting 
pulled over for going too slow etc....owning a bus really does require a 
good sense of humor.

Not to stir up a controversy, but I think the Zits boys should paint their 
bus.....A CHEAP SPRAY PAINT JOB TOO!!!
