Hi Jennifer,

     H V L P, stands for    High    Volume   Low    Pressure. It is a =
type of paint gun that is designed to be more efficient in applying more =
paint product (with less "air born" waste), to the surface. Its use is =
EPA required in some States. You may want to check your local laws. The =
HVLP reg's most likely wont apply to home use, but again some places =
don't allow home auto painting either.=20
     So best to cover all the bases.....CYA!
