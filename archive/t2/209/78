Awhile back Steve Dolan was great enough to come out and help me get my lights working. All has been great, until yesterday. My brake lights work, parking lights, reverses but my high beams wont come on and my turn signals dont work. This leads me to believe its in the stalk on the steering column, but I cant seem to find anything wrong. The fuses are all ok. 
Any thoughts? 

Thanks!
