Beware: almost all rebuilders lump a dozen or so vehicles under one
application.
In your case, only the 72 1700 and 73 auto trans 1700 used the same vacuum
unit. However, the centrifugal advance between the 205E and the 205F where
different:

Here is the E:   Timing Set At: 10deg ATDC (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum
hose(s) connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 7-12deg Adv, 16-18deg Ret; Centrifugal: 9-14deg
(-at-) 2000rpm, 21-25deg (-at-) 3400 rpm

Here is the F:  Timing Set At:: 5deg ATDC (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum
hose(s) connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv, 11-14deg Ret; Centrifugal: 14deg (-at-)
1700 rpm, 15-19deg (-at-) 2400 rpm, 21-25deg (-at-) 3400rpm

The difference was when centrifugal started to come in.
[I do not not have a clue as to why the specs for the vac are different when
the vacuum unit is the same!?!?!]

You might want to make a list of all the vehicles the rebuilder says it fits
and then compare the specs of the original curve. Go here to get the specs:

There is no 'one size fits all'..... VW had Bosch build different distributors
with different advance curves for a reason.
