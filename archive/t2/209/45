Subject: ugly bus competition


Terry,

Just wanted to let you know that I enjoy reading your comments on how to do
a good paint job.  There's lots of ways to do crappy jobs but there's some
gems of experience I enjoy hearing about and remembering for reference.  My
main interest in spending time with my bus is in learning the process even
though I know it will end up ugly the first time.

My '70 Westy for example is probably the crappiest most bondoed one on this
list.  That overall situation is not going to change (it was originally
$650).  About 6 coats of various types of latex, rustoleum and other stuff,
its flaking and peeling all over, basically your worst nightmare.  It's
never going to be very pretty, but I am using it for practice.  I don't have
a welder so I am learning how to bondo (lots on there already-no flames
please).  Have a big compressor and DA sander, and borrowed a paint gun.

I am practicing so that when I try to do my '67 bug it will look better.
That one has minimal rust and only two layers of pro paint that has a lot of
rock chips and a few dings.

Basically though I don't know anything about the pro process, but I have
started on the back end of the bus:  stripping, bondoing, sanding, priming
with rattle can, and sanding some more.  Soon I will step up to Variprime,
and whats the brand of filler primer?   Top coat will be a VW/Porsche color
called Aquablue metallic.  Does anybody know who makes it?

List: is there a book that might help me out here, on tips and tricks?

I also need to know what to buy for an air line dryer.

Many thanks,
Will

P.S. I used Rustoleum White enamel on the poptop.  Good enough for me.
