Subject: 205E distributor vacuum canister failure

Anyone know where to find a replacement vacuum canister for a 205E dual
vacuum distributor?  Mine is leaking on the retard side.  I have plugged the
retard line and it seems to run okay like that, but I want to replace the
canister, is this available anywhere, or am I headed for the boneyard?

Thanks,

R. E. Haufler
