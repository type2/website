Subject: Re: [T2] my $100 paint job

I want to make this perfectly clear--I am not bum rapping anyone for
trying to make their bus look better than it is or was----

The idea that makes me cringe is the thought of going to all the trouble
of attempting this laborious act, and covering up all the alleged rust /
dent / crash repairs with sub standard prep and refinishing materials,
and throwing all the work away.

Agreed --good paint ain't cheap.

And yes a guy could cover his Van / Bus with econo paint--but it just
won't last, not unless it is covered up in a garage or cover all day
long and only driven at night when the sun is down.

I also paint heavy equipment--Cats, Terex scrapers,etc.

I use Dulux, the cheapest paint that Dupont makes ( which has been
discontinued for a cheaper enamel yet) and at best the paint chalks out
in 2 two three years, and I fortify it with a product called Flashbond,
which makes the paint stick, and flow better, as well as giving it some
durability.

I can't for the life of me swallow the thought of wanting to be doing a
bus more than once within my period of ownership.

Its almost like being into whips and chains---:>)

Anyway, what ever trips your trigger is OK with me--spay cans, wagner
spit guns, roller's, brushes, latex, farm equipment enamel, finger
paint---
What ever gives you the best feeling--do it---

I have 4 guns---

One Optima gravity feed ( German ) for primer only.
A Binks # 7 that is 28 years old, and lays down the paint slick as
glass.
And a Binks 2001 hooked up to a Binks 2 gallon pressure pot for Cab Over
Semi's,
And a Wagner Electrosatic paint system for heavy equipment--zero
overspray--all the paint goes direct to the machine.

If any of you were thinking about doing your Bus with inexpensive paint
this is the trick----and you can rent them--
No overspray, and the low buck paint lays down very smooth with almost
zero reducer, and with half as much material.

Good Luck to one and all of you in your quest for your ideal Bus---

Later,


Terry

What are you talking about? I had a blast taking my bus apart and
painting it, I want to do it again, I'm thinking cherry red with black
bumpers......or maybe a dark blue with white bumpers. 

Terry is a professional paint man and knows good from bad. He also has
access to equipment the rest of us doesn't. 
He is right about everything he says IMHO but you've got to do with the
equipment you've got. 
I got a cheap Campbell Hausfield compressor given to me and I bought a
cheap gun. Decent results, not good by his standards I am sure BUT I
accept the limitations of the quality of the job I did and I'm happy.
It's lasted about 3 years now and still looks good. 
Given the access to the equipment I would use a modern 2 part clear coat
paint and spray it in a booth with a HVLP gun but I don't have that
equipment... <grin> 
Hang in there. Be happy with what you've got, consider it a test. If it
lasts longer than you expected it to then be happy, if it doesn't then
study up on what you could have done better within your means. You can
always do it again later. 
Also your idea of good, my idea of good and his idea of good maybe
entirely different things.
