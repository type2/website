Subject: Powdercoating report

Got back a load of powdercaoting this week. We delivered 5 wheels, 1 
complete set of tin for a VW Type IV, 1 complete set of tin for a Corvair 
110 HP (for my bus), and all the Trans-vair kit brackets and rods.

We picked up all of it and gave them a $100 bill.

Their rates are $40 an hour. You can get 16 wheels done for $40. I wish we 
had more parts that needed a coating of white!

We could have turned in the same batch with 11 more wheels and still only 
paid $100!!!

Much more expensive than rattle can paint but much nicer too.

The web address for the company we used is:
