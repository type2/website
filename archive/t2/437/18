Well, I edited the links and filenames to make sure all the links in the 
page work...

Thanks for bringing that to my attention!
If you download the videos (they are in spanish), I want to apologize for 
their big size, but Adobe Premiere
doesn't recognize their coding so I can't edit them to make them smaller...
