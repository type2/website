Paul,

You must live someplace expensive!  Check some more powder coating places.
I got mine sandblasted and powder coated for $25.00 each.

Otherwise, use por-15 and a top coat of your favorite color.

Cheers, dave

I prefer using rattle cans,  No sprayer is currently available, but I might be able to borrow a friends.  Also I don't care for comments on wasting my time with painting when I should have them powder coated.  The $60 per rim is more than I can afford right now.
