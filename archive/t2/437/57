Subject: 2 questions

hi all,

I am still on the lookout for a decent DC, and I have 2 questions for y'all
re: brakes and wiring so I can make a better decision about what year/mod to
look for. TIA.

#1.  What year were vacuum assist brakes introduced?

#2.  Is any particular year/model known to have more gremlins in the
electrical system *by design* (nothing to do with POs by-passing ignition
circuits, or baked insulation, old switches).  And if the answer to this one
is NOT "All years/makes are equally reliable", then does one year stand out as
a shining beacon of electrical ingenuity?

Reason for asking, I am actually seeking one W/OUT vacuum assist brakes, and
in that vintage, the most reliable electrically; I do not wish to re-enact the
under-dash fire I had when I had my 63 kombi.  TagainIA

Ben
