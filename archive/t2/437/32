I like hydraulics better. I've been putting off the valve adjustments in my 65 for too long now because I am a slacker/loser. 

I only to make 1 adjustment for the 3 years I owned my '79 powered 76 bus. Add the 10 years that the p.o. had it and never touched them (or anything else) and that's 1 valve adjustment in 13 years.

>I only drive it once or twice every two weeks

Hydraulics will be noisy for a few minutes till they pump up. Or, start your bus once ore twice a week. Better for the engine anyway.

Education is the cure to our fears.

An admission. You WONDER if the lifters have anything to do with it.  I understand the annoyance of not knowing what's wrong and wasting money on repairs. Unfortunately, I think you're grasping at straws a little bit here.

>I would feel better checking my valves every 3000 >miles then never knowing what is going on back there.

Nobody says you can't check your valves with hydraulics either. A valve getting tight is a valve getting tight either way right?

>Anyway, can I just drop some solid lifters in there >or what?  Do I need new pushrods?

More variables for an unsolved problem.
Think about it awhile.
