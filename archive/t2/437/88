Subject: Re:  rear transmission mounts

Just a note regarding my last post to say that yesterday I found a complete
rear transmission carrier assembly complete with mounts in good condition at
a wrecking yard.  Most I looked at were deteriorated or broken like mine,
but I found one bus off on it's own in this yard with a good set.  I also
picked up a shifter and front shift rod in excellent condition, all for less
than the cost of a single new tranny mount from my local FLAPS (if he could
even find one) so I'm happy.  I was amazed at the good body condition of
some of the busses in that yard.  The Westy which I scavenged the shifter
gear from had a near flawless body, no rust no major dents...far better than
my bus :(  Who would send away a nice bus like that for scrap?

Cheers,
