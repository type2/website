Hiya Zac,

I recently used Zymol Wax/Cleaner on my faded 1970 Bug.  Wow!  This stuff is 
terrific.  It made that old Glasurit finish look almost new.  Did a very nice 
job on chrome also.  Was not really all that hard to apply.  It's green stuff 
in a clear plastic bottle.  Kind of expensive as I recall.  Smells like 
cocoanuts, if that means anything.
