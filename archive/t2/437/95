Kidding. You must make it happen, do it like this: You say OK beach it is, 
and take off. Prepare a route that allows you to stay the night. But dont 
tell her that, you are out for the day. The bus breaks down, (cause you 
pulled off the dist cap) and you HAVE to stay the night there. Sorry honey, 
we need to camp here tonight. Be prepared with a full tank of water, a full 
campstove etc.) Tell her you will call AAA in the morning. She will like it, 
if you make it fun. Remind her that if you were in another vehicle this 
would suck, but you are in a bus so everythings OK.
