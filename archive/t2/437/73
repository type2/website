That's not quite how it works.  Oil bath filters work in two ways.

First,
air is forced to make an abrupt change of direction right over the surface
of the oil.  The more massive dust particles hit the oil and stick. >

Second, the oil is directed through a mesh of excelsior or somesuch. Oil
droplets entrained by the air are deposited on the mesh and slow dribble
back toward the oil reservoir.  Dust particles stick to this oil and are
washed along with it back to the reservior.

If you hear bubbling, you have filled the filter wayyyyy to full!
