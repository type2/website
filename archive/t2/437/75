To follow up, I got the Bus up on ramps today and checked out the switch.

There are two very similar switches on the master cylinder, one in the
middle and one at the end towards the rear of the Bus.

My tests today were just of the switches themselves.  What I did was
have my wife press the brake pedal while I checked for the switch to
open and close with a VOM.  Here are my results.

Switch 1 (rear-end of master cylinder):

         2
         --
     1 |    | 3

Pedal up: 2 shorts to 3
Pedal down: 1 shorts to 3



Switch 2 (middle of master cylinder):

         2
         --
     1 |    | 3

Pedal up: nothing
Pedal down: nothing


I suppose my biggest question is: why are there two switches on the
master cylinder?  I didn't see anything obvious at a cursory glance
over the wiring diagram.

It also seems as if that one switch is duff, and that I'll have to
replace it.  I guess pulling that switch implies having to bleed the
lines?

...and I have my Bentley manual now, and am going to pour over the brake
section tonight, but as always, any advice from you kind readers will be
greatly appreciated :-)
