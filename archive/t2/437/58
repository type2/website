Subject: Adding a sunroof to an original westy

Hi folks,

I appologize if this topic has already been discussed but I'm having a tough
time finding any info on the net. I'm converting my 71 westy into a deluxe
bus (long story) and have located a complete sunroof assembly to install
that actually originated from a 71 deluxe. I'm curious to know if anybody
here has done this conversion before and if so could you post your
experiences or email me directly? I'm doubting my ability to do the
installation myself and am thinking about calling various local sunroof
shops to see if they can install it for me. I do have the bently manual but
I want to make sure that the sunroof gets installed properly. Is this a wise
choice? Also, I've priced sunroof seals from a couple parts vendors and they
are quite expensive. Are there any good alternatives to buying a real felt
seal or is that really the only way to go? I'm not real concerned that the
seal be authentic. I just want to make sure that I keep the elements from
making their way through the roof and into the bus. Any insight would be
extremely helpful and very much appreciated.

Many thanks,
~Gman
