I am relatively new here, but on one of the other lists to which I
subscribe one of the other members has discovered a way around the dreaded
5-line URL. Some mail readers can handle them with aplomb but others
cannot.  If you paste your multi-line URL in at www.tinyurl.com, it will
spit out a very short version that anyone can cut and paste very easily.

                             OOK!
