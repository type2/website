I've seen any number of desirable (your definition...) vehicles 
sitting in driveways and such just waiting for a neighbor to
drop a dime (quarter ?-) on the property maintenance or the
unregistered gestapo to get that eyesore out...
I tried to buy an abandoned MG once, but the owner of the 
property wouldn't even let me close enough to get a VIN #.
He was terrified that somehow he would be liable for some-
thing if he let it go...A neighbor told me that eventually he 
called a junkyard to have it removed...
