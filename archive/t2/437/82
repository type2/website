Subject: Rear End Noise ?

Yesterday I had a noise develop - It started when I was in reverse backing
out of my driveway - I pushed in the clutch to stop and I heard a ping -
when I began to drive on the road I had a knocking sound that seemed to
increase with the speed of the bus - It eventually diminished as I went
faster and would increase in sound as the vehicle slowed - (best way to
describe the noise is similar to something hanging off the bottom hitting
the ground)
I am not sure where to begin to look - CV joints maybe ? Any Ideas on likely
areas to begin checking

Thanks
Eric
