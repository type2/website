Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Weird engine sound...

did you readjust all the valves also?
yes sounds like you have a exhaust leak....
there is some stuff that wall mart carries that you can temp patch it with that is sold in a tube or better yet run it by one of these midas or muffler shops something like that and see if one of those nice guys will hit it a couple of times with a spark for you might cost you 20 bucks and hell if nothign you get to walk up under the bus and look around if they'll let you...
kinda cool to stand under soemthing that i usually find myself laying under or rolling back and forth with the creeper under...



 if you get to looking for some new bolts for the exhaust cause some are missing or broken check lowes out they have a large selection of diffrent bolts...
i bought my tranny mount bolts there as well as the bolts for my exhaust bolts that were missing ....
got lots and lots of washers as well ...

hope that helps and glad you found the problem..
peace
