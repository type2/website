Jon,

The air does not go thru the oil and should not bubble (unless you way
overfill the filter.  The way an oil bath filter works is by forcing the
air to make a couple sharp turns, the most important of which is the one
at the bottom.  The neat thing is that the air molecules are very small
and light and can make those turns without trouble.  Particles of dirt are
*much* larger and heavier and basically skid off the track in the turn and
collide with the oil, where they are trapped.
