>>and yes you are cool as hell to be able to put the sounds on the list...
someone said somethign once before somwhere about muir use to have sounds on 
a website but not sure what that is about before my time of vw ownership..<<


I was trying to download the sounds that Muir had. But they weren't 
available. Then
Robert chimed into the list. He said he would try to find out what was wrong 
and get them up again. But never heard from him again. Would it not be neat to 
have a site that had sound bites of problem sounds & the result of the 
repair?
