Subject: Painting rims

I have a set of rims that I hot tanked all the grime off of.  Now for painting, does anyone have a suggestion for the type of paint to use that will  last?  I prefer using rattle cans,  No sprayer is currently available, but I might be able to borrow a friends.  Also I don't care for comments on wasting my time with painting when I should have them powder coated.  The $60 per rim is more than I can afford right now.
 
Thanks,
Paul
