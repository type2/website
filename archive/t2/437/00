i agree sound s to me like loose valves or valve?

recheck and adjust them...

might be something wrong..
just last week i was thank goodness changeing the pushrod seals when i found my retainer wire for my pushrods broken inside...
i wouldnt of known unless i would have done so...
good thing...
i know now that i have to replace the push rods...
it eat through three of the four on that head....
thank goodness for leaking push rod seals for once...LOL...
