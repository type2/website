take a peek here for some good things to get it going:

If you have the timing set close enough, Use Muirs static test for
just a get it going thing. And the valves are adjusted properly, If
the carb is in good shape, this should get the motor to run. Some
other things that would cause a bad idle, are gunky carb, vacuum leak
,choke problems (which can go away when the engine is warmed up) or 
(like you are asking about) mis-adjusted carb. Good luck.
