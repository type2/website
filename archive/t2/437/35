Same thing that happens in every other limo.  How many people wear seat belts in those things?  Heck, let's turn this into a real discussion because it is a valid problem with busses:

Do people riding in the back of your bus always wear seatbelts?
Do you ever drive with the bed down and people sleeping in the back?

I confess that I have done this, in fact my bus doesn't even HAVE seatbelts in the back.  The seats are sideways in the Safare conversion and there are no mounts for seatbelts.  Guess they didn't care back in 1973.  For this reason I have all but decided to ditch the sideways-facing rear seats and install a bench seat across the back like the Westy has, and install proper belts.  Even then, the temptation to lounge on the bed while driving will be hard to resist.  I did the same for thousands of miles of driving during my childhood, around the US and Europe and lived through it.  How important IS safety to you?
