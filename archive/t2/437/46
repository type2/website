Subject: Re: [T2] Syncro Vanagon

The Vanagon Syncro was sold in the U.S. in 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 
1991 but was not imported in 1988.  There were enough 1987s left over to last 
through 1988.  The 1987 I had was one of these.  It was made 9 February 1987, 
two days after my third son was born, and sold new 16 May 1988, two weeks 
before my daughter was born.

There were all 5 speeds, but only the top four were usually used since low 
gear is really low and meant for steep grades and rough terrain.

I had mine for about five years and probably would still have it except that 
fifth gear and the head gaskets all went out at the same time and the wife 
said that it was time it went, :-(

Hope this helps.

Anyone going to the show in Anoka, MN tomorrow?
