Well,

It weird sound was indeed a loose valve. You guys are good!
One of the valve adjusting screws was resting on the valve cover and was 
stripped.
I had to ride my bike 40mi to get a replacement screw, since none of the 
FLAPS had
one and I didn't want to wait for mail order (I will order a couple though 
next time I place
an order)... Put the new screw in and readjusted the valves. The engine now 
sounds better,
I think, although I suspect an exhaust leak. Sound bite can be heard at
