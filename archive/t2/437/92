Subject: Where to sell a slightly funky '78 camper online?

Hi all:

I posted yesterday about the '78 camper my daughter's friend drove from
Washington to the SF Bay Area, only to have it essentially give up the ghost
in my driveway.  The plan is that I put my daughter and her friend on a
train to Illinois - where they were supposedly driving this beast - and sell
the vehicle out of my driveway on an "as is, where is" basis.

So, can you provide me with some online (free) classifieds where I can
advertise this somewhat funky camper?

I'm aware of Craig's list and The Samba, and there used to be another place
I'd go from time-to-time that seemed to carry lots of VW busses, but I'm not
finding it now.  Any other good places to place a classified?

Thanks!
