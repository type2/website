pretty involved project...

Yes, the design and engineering of the resin shell are a hoot, but the rest
is really just a "normal" chassis, with a really weird top on it.

Some of the design factors for the resin shell were the weight, how to
reduce the size of the sections in order to keep from having to make
$1000.00 molds (!), and how to set the sections up to reduce the actual
number of molds needed to complete the shell.

It'll be a bit heavier than Fiberglas, but totally cool.  Some of the
sections will be clear (maybe tinted) to act as windows/view ports. If a
section gets damaged, I can replace the damaged bit on the road.  I could
even cast the needed part right on the spot. :O)

The biggest things for me are 1. the advertising potential of... hmm...
let's call him "Shellbert" for now... on the road (I would even hope that a
mag or two might find him interesting enough to pop a few pics in their
publication), and 2. the satisfaction of looking at him and knowing that (to
quote Zim's sidekick), "I made it myself". {grin}

I had an already established engineering principle to work with, so there's
no trial/error there, but it took about a month to figure out how to apply
it to the specific design of the trailer.

I'll be picking up a 1:24 scale beetle kit for making the trailer model, and
some of my local club members who are fabricators are looking into getting a
beetle chassis and dealing with the hitch issues for me.

Me, too. :O)
