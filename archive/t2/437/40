Mike, I read you're post about the "cast" trailer and it seems like a pretty
involved project.  I pull a Scamp trailer with my '76 westy and have pulled
it over 20,000 miles now.  The Scamps are fiberglass, weigh just a little
more than a Puck trailer and are molded or cast in a fiberglass mold.

I have a 2 burner propane stove, forced air furnace, hot and cold running
water, full sized shower, airconditioning, porta potti, 3 way 'fridge,
closet, many storage cabinets, with a dinnette and sleeping for 4.

You can purchase these older "cast trailers" pretty cheap, then fix them up
the way you want.  Many on this list pull fiberglass trailers, it is a great
way to enjoy both the bus and have a nice trailer to camp in.
