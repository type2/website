Subject: Westy Interior?

Hello, I just bought a westy interior for my bus.I got the bed, fridge,
closet, and storage compartment above bed. Here's the problem, I will
not relocate my spare tire, So I'm thinking of cutting a half circle out
of the back side of the closet so I can still get my spare in and out.
Any thoughts? Any idea's? Has anyone done this before?

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
