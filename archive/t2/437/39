Subject: Turn signal relay

I'm slowly making sense of the mess the PO made of the Silver Bullet.  I've
had the engine rebuilt, carb rebuilt and a whole mess of little stuff to
include replacing some tin, seals, and all the other miscellaneous tune up
stuff.

I got inside today to start pulling/testing wires/fuses around the fuse box
because of miscellaneous lights not working. The PO (or PO to the PO, etc)
made a real mess in here.  There are all sorts of wires hangin out and pokin
around in there - some of which dead end 12 inches from the fuse box.  I
even found a hot wire running to the rear just laying next to the battery
that turns over the starter.

The purpose of this though is to ask about the emergency flasher/turn signal
relay.  I've tried to chase these wires around to see what's going on, but
I'm stumped.  Currently, the blue/red(KBL) and the blue(49a) wires coming
from the turn signal relay (pn211 053 215) are spliced together.  When I
disconnect them and let them run separately, the flashers in the dash no
longer function.  Everything else continues to work normally.  Before I drop
the measly $10 (after spending plenty up to this point) on a new turn signal
relay, is there anything else I should check?
