I've found that with hard water deposits that a good fine cut cleaner first
works the best before waxing. I always use Maguires fine cut or medium cut
depending on how heavy the oxidation or scratches etc. are. Then apply a
thin coat of Maguires carnuba #26 wax to finish off. It will leave a very
smooth glassy finish.
