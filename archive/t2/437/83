Subject: Stripped plug hole in the UK

Hi all
I'm in need of some urgent help here in the UK. I've just been servicing my
1978 1600dp in readiness for our trip up to Scotland from Bristol next week
and with only a few days to go I have stripped a spark plug hole.  If
possible I will try to find someone locally to fit a helicoil but if not is
there anything else I could do to temporarily fix this. Is it possible to
temporarily JB Weld the plug back in. it only has to last another 1500-200
miles before the engine will be rebuilt. I am really hacked off now as I
have just spent the last three months building new cabinets and welding in
new metal ready for this trip. Unfortunately I am not in a position to
remove the engine and do this job properly yet.
Help!
TIA
