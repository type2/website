The air cleaner sorta works on a cyclone principle.  The air is brought 
into the chamber of the filter by manifold vacuum (by way of the carb). 
  The heavier particulates "precipitate" out and are trapped in the oil 
reservoir in the bottom of the filter.  The smaller stuff is drawn 
through the filter medium (a loosely woven material that stays soaked 
with oil from sloshing around I guess) where it sticks to all that 
oil-coated stuff.

It doesn't work like a bong.
