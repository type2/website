Subject: RE: [T2] Adding a sunroof to an original westy

Thanks for all who has responded. I'm pretty sure that my westy is setup for
the factory sunroof assembly as I think it's got the channels, etc. Here is
a link to some pictures I took of my roof: http://www.calcentral.com/~71bus/
If anybody can verify that it is indeed setup for a sunroof I'd really
appreciate it.

Many thanks!
