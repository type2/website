Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Adventurewagen pictures!

OK, I also tried to view the images hosted on tripod and geocities and, as
usual with these services, I got the "Bandwidth exceeded" brush off. I
wasn't under the impression that this list is massively huge, so how
low is the pathetic bandwidth limit set at? :-(

I guess the question is, Why in the world does anyone that actually wants
others to see their pictures, host them on tripod/geocities anymore!?

It seems all you get for free is the opportunity to waste your time hosting
your images on their service just so they can not let anyone else see it.
LOL

Well its your time to waste, personally I'm swearing off ever trying to
follow a picture link to tripod/geocities again... ;-)
