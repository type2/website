If those miles are going to be on a long trip away from home to Scotland, then I wouldn't even consider anything like JBWeld.  Do you want to risk ruining your trip by breaking down in the middle of nowhere when the plug comes loose again?  Unfortunately, a helicoil or timesert is probably the only fix that would be reliable enough to get you through your trip.  If you can't find someone to do it, consider buying a kit and doing it yourself (you may need to delay your trip slightly or pay the extra for overnight shipping).

That is unfortunate, but there is nothing you can do about it now except take care of the problem in a way that won't put your trip at risk.  If the plug does come loose again during your trip, you could probably drive a short distance by removing the rocker shaft assembly from that cylinder and running on three cylinders.  This should obviously be a last resort though.

Good luck,
