Same thing I tell everyone else who is wondering how to diagnose an engine.
Compression test
Check/adjust valves
Verify other basic tune-up stuff like timing, plug gap, dwell, wires.

If no problems found there (very low probability of this, from what it sounds like) then start looking for oil leaks.

Sounds to me like the motor is a basket case though.  :(
