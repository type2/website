Subject: Re: [T2] convert hydraulic to solid

volks,

I have anoher question on the same subject. I have hydro lifters and just
recently ordered new pushrods/pushrod tubes. Is there a difference between
hydrolic lifter pushrods/tubes and solid lifter pushrods/tubes. If there
is a difference i could be in trouble because I did not specify that I
need hydrolic pushrods/tubes to match my lifters.
Thanks,
Will
