Subject: under the dash air conditioning

My Bentley Manual has nothing about air conditioning in a Bus.  I am trying to figure out if the entire system is in a 78 Riveria.  Is there a place on the net that describes the system or can someone tell me what I need to be looking for?
 
Thanks,
Kevin
