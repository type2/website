Subject: firetruck hoses

hey guys, not sure if these will fit but those of you
with firetruck would know anyway but in the
sportsman's guide www.sportsmansguide.com they are
selling german fire hoses so it might be worth a look
if you have a fire truck or are making a firetruck or
heck, if you are a fireman with too much cash on your
hands.
