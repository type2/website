Subject: convert hydraulic to solid

Hi all,
  I am thinking of converting my GEX rebuilt (by PO) in my '78 Westy from 
hydraulic lifters to solid ones.  I only drive it once or twice every two 
weeks, and quite frankly, hydraulic lifters confuse and frighten me.  I have 
burned 3 exhaust valves on this van since I have owned it, which has been 
for about a year and a half, and I wonder if the lifters have anything to do 
with it.  I would feel better checking my valves every 3000 miles then never 
knowing what is going on back there.
  Anyway, can I just drop some solid lifters in there or what?  Do I need 
new pushrods?

Thanks!
Brian Zweerink
