Subject: Vehicles in Japan and Thailand (Friday)

Hi,

In the east coast is officially Friday! I've been wanting to show the 
following pictures,
http://rpalomera.home.comcast.net/vehicles/ since the Fridolin tread came 
up a couple of
weeks ago. Well, I finally got to put the page up....

This summer (actually, end of Spring) I went with my family in a trip 
to  Japan and Thailand, and took
a lot of pictures, some of them of vehicles.

One thing is for sure, the trend in Japan is towards boxy cars. All the 
makers have them in one way or the other,
and in all sizes, although most of the vehicles are in the small side. 
Didn't see a single bus during my week stay in Tokyo and Kyoto, but I did 
see a bug.

Thailand in the other hand has more variety of big and small cars, and a 
lot (I mean a lot) of small motorcycles.
I did see couple of buses in Thailand. The pictures show a late bus with a 
hatch mirror and canvas instead of
sliding door. I also saw a bus in Bangkok with two sliding doors but didn't 
have the camera ready, and once the traffic
starts moving in Bangkok you better do too or you could get stuck in it for 
couple more hours...

That hatch mounted mirror is great. The 12 passenger mini-van we rented 
(white one in the pictures, was the only
cheap car available) had one of those mirrors and it was great for parking 
or while backing up since you can see
the rear bumper. Definitely as useful as the ultrasound collision systems 
used in upscale cars, but without the price
tag or wiring requirements!  All the SUV's and vans in Thailand have the 
hatch mirror and I wanted to get one too for
"La Vebe". I guess I'll have to go back to Thailand to get one  ;-)

Regards,

Rogelio
