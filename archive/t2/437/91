Wow!!!  What a good event, watched the movies on
Friday night. Had a real good breakfast Saturday
morning, Full moon style.(good hot burritos) went down
the river on a tube, watched the rain and case burning
Saturday night. got a little too much sunshine but
I'll get over it. I think a good time was had by all.
Thanks everyone for a wonderful weekend. Phil (in the
80 yellow westy)
