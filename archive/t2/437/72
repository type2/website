  Now for painting, does anyone have a suggestion for the type
  of paint to use that will  last?  I prefer using rattle cans,  No
 sprayer is currently available, but I might be able to borrow a friends.
 Also I don't care for comments on wasting my time with painting when I
 should have them powder coated.  The $60 per rim is more than I can
 afford right now.


Since you had them hot-tanked, every speck of paint is now gone.  I hope
that surface rust hasn't started yet!

You need to prime the rims first.  Look for zinc-rich primer in rattle
cans.

Let the paint dry for a day (this is important, as you want the volatiles
gone before you bake), and then give each rim a bake at 200 degrees
or so in the oven while the spouse is otherwise distracted.  Ventilate
well, as the paint will smell.

Next, paint the rims with whatever paint you wish, but make sure that the
paint is compatible with the primer.  Krylon silver is very close to
the original silver paint.  Let the paint dry for a day or two
and then bake the wheel in the oven again.

Lastly, by this point your spouse will have discovered your alternative
usage of the oven, which means that you had better be prepared with a plan
of appeasement so that you can finish the job.
