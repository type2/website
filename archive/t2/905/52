   <<   I'm just curious -- what paint is good for keeping
the bus as rust free as possible and least harmful to the environment?>>

None.

The shops in Cal. are stuck with using water based finish coats--it's
basically latex.

It might be good for the sea gulls & the iguana's--but not for the
vehicle it's going on.

It's a short lived finish.
