Subject: oil temp?

Hi all, I'm in the process of putting in a rebuilt 2.0L f.i. engine in my '77
westy.I want to make sure that I keep an eye on the oil temp and oil presure
as my test drive will be a drive to the Okanagan for my holidays from the
Fraser Valley.My question is what range should the temperature be to be safe
and which kind of sending unit do you recomend  to use? I was told about one
that goes into the presure relief valve ,is that good?
Thanks in advance!
