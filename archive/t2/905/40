<<Nason Paint, Fulthane Activator and Ful-Base Reducer. He recommended
using Rust-Mort and Dupont Variprime self-etching primer OR Chassis
Saver>>

Nason is Dupont's low quality, cheap , "Johnny One Coat" cave and
pave,fluff and buff garbage.

I used it once on a 30 ft dump trailer--it was short lived.
One summer and it was fagged out.

The Vari Prime is the way to go--and then sand it and cover it with
Dupont's Uro Prime .
It's like sealing the acid etch primer with a flexable plastic
bag---will  not attract moisture at all.

Sand it with 320 and paint away.

If you thin that the Chassis saver is going to save you some time and
money--you better just get a pint of it and do a section of the vehicle.

It is like sanding a diamond--hard as a rock.
To get any paint to stick to it, it has to be scuffed good--with no more
than 320.
You'll go through a sleeve of 320 tying to prep a 2 ft. square.
It's good for frames--tough stuff--but really a poor primer.
You'll be on the prepping of the body for a month trying to get any
biter's into this stuff

PPG Concept is Excellent Paint---long lasting, easy to use, loioks 3 ft
deep when your done.
BUT--Not Cheap Either.

Just flip out the plastic--worry about paying for the paint later.--: )
