Think about it.  You expect this stuff to go on smooth and glossy and to
look perfect for 10 years in the sun without oxidizing.  That's a somewhat
higher expectation than you would have of $20/gallon house paint.
Designing a coating that will do that is not a trivial exercise, and they
don't sell nearly as much car paint as they do house paint.

Personally, I think that the manufacturers are holding us hostage by
feeding the desire for a mirror surface on sheet metal.  If cars came with
matte or semi-matte finishes they would be a lot easier to keep looking
new.  I'm thinking about adopting a "Afrika Korps" look on our '69 bug.
Heck, I want body panels molded out of Little Tykes plastic with
color all the way through and "pop it back out" bodywork capability!

Yeah, that stinks.  Parts intentionally designed to make themselves
non-functional is really predatory engineering.  That's even lower than
the 90% empty cartridges that come with printers these days.

The last printer I bought is a HP Laserjet 4L.  I bought it 12 years ago,
new, for $600, but in the time I've been using it I have replaced the
cartridge once.  It is hooked to its third computer, still works
perfectly, and will probably keep working as long as I want it too.
Unfortunately, it has only a parallel interface, so compatibility will
rear its ugly head soon.  I think that it was the last decent consumer
level printer HP made.
