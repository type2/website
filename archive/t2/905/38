<<Anybody know of a realible source for these materials at a more
reasonable price? Or am I just out of touch? >>

Ken,

Your out of touch.

Just got done with a Stil Challenger Utility box---

The price tag with the zinc chromate acid etch primer, the primer /
sealer, GM Victory Red Urethane paint, hardener, reducer, laquer thinner
masking tape, sand paper, ---$1963.76--jobber's cost.

Paint is in no way inexpensive anymore.

Not unless you want to use short lived, non matching, straight tractor
enamel at $29.00 a gallon , & cut it with gasoline or turpentine for the
econo look.

Check with any of your local Farm Supply stores--they'll have it in
stock.
