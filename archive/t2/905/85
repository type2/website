The Type 4 also has a centrifugal fan.  Making the blades in a
centrifugal "squirrel cage" fan flexible would be more difficult.

There are not too many water-cooled cars that come with flexible-blade
fans anymore either - they all use electric fans, which are even
better from an efficiency point of view because they only come on when
needed.  This is typically while idling in traffic.

Our air-cooled motors are a different beast as well because most
water-cooled engines don't require the radiator fan at highway speeds
- airflow is sufficient to keep the engine cool.  The fan in an
air-cooled engine does the same job as both the radiator fan and the
water pump on a water-cooled engine.
