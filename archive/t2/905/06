Subject: Need 74-79 Gas Cap near Morgantown, WV->Baltimore, MD->Philly

Volks,

I'm looking to buy a gas cap for a 1974-1979 bus.

I'm currently in Morgantown, WV but driving to Philly tonight via I-68, I-70, and I-95 (i.e. via Fred., B-more, Delaware...)

Any listees out there want to sell one and/or does anyone know of an auto parts store that would carry such a beast?

I plan on asking at the local FLAPS here in Morgantown (need to pick up a spare fan belt anyway) but don't expect to find one, so I thought I'd query the list to see if there's anyone en-route.

Cheers,
   Avocado Tom
