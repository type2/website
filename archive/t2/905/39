Subject: Re: [T2] Yikes - Paint is Expensive

Wow,  lots of responses!  Well, I feel better knowing that I'm not
getting taken.  I don't mind paying for quality but, there is no sense
in paying through the nose either.

The fella at the auto body supply recommended that I use Nason
Fulthane Paint, Fulthane Activator and Ful-Base Reducer.  He
recommended using Rust-Mort and Dupont Variprime self-etching primer
OR Chassis Saver to take care of any metal that is less than perfect
but, still solid.  I've done some research on Chassis Saver and it
appears to compare very well with Por-15 and if I buy all the prep
materials from the same source, I should be able to expect some
support if something goes wrong.  Looking back at the archives, it
appears that its about a 50/50 mix as to whether to go the rust
converter/etching primer route or Por-15/Chassis Saver route.
Frankly, the Chassis Saver path seems like a little less work in the
long run.  I don't know that I'm confident in all of the aspect
surroundings priming/top coating this stuff, though.  The document
from their website makes it sound like an additional primer is not
necessary but, that seems questionable.  I also don't know whether I
can use glazing over it if my work is less than perfect - hey, I'm
shooting for perfect but, my body work experience is limited.

At this point, I think I'll take the suggestions to check out the PPG
products and take any additional suggestions and price differences
into consideration.  I certainly like the comments of PPG being toward
easier end of the range of products.  Can anyone give me an idea of
how PPG and Nason are going to compare handling-wise?

Thank again and in advance,
Ken
