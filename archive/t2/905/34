I am assuming a stock FI system and that you are
referring to a stock FI fuel pump. If it was noisey,
perhaps you have a bunch of crud in your fuel lines
and tank. Be sure to change the filter and when you
do, blow through the old one to see how much
resistance there was.

It sounds like you might have low rail pressure which
could be the pressure regulator. If you have it in
running condition but it's still weak on power, try
using a padded vice-grip or a ratcheting type fuel
line clamp like you'd use to clamp the lines when you
change filters... Where the flexible line runs into
the pressure regulator on the right side of the
firewall, clamp the fuel line about halfway closed
while the engine is running and see if it speeds up.
You're looking for "speeds up a little but doesn't
race" arrange the tool so it doesn't flop around (duct
tape maybe?) and go for a test drive - see if you have
more power. That will confirm thr pressure regulator.

You HAVE already grabbed ahold of each and every one
of the vacuum hoses - the pre-formed hoses that are
all over the place - and physically pushed prodded and
twisted to be certain they are all well seated and
have not baked hard and brittle and fallen apart...
They look like they're on even when they aren't.

Please let us know what you discover. -BaH
