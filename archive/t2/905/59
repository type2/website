You can buy tub and sink paint at a decent paint store...
It's a two part epoxy based paint that can be sprayed...
Ask about the correct tip, I used a borrowed HVLP gun
to respray an old clawfoot tub...Prep is everything...
You've got to get "tooth" on all the surface you're
painting. And watch the time! If you don't clean the
gun before the epoxy sets...you've got a permanent
gun to set on the mantle...
Also, there's companies that'll come to your house
to respray your tub...They'd probably spray your bus
for a fee...But my guess would be that the prep would
be up to you and no guarantee on the finish...As I un-
derstand the formula, it's got minute particles of glass
in it that gives it shine and durability...

Oh yeah, you'd better LOVE white... ;-)
