Many years ago,, a friend of mine bought a Beetle that seemed like it was 
ceramic coated... it looked like a porclein bathtub paint... it never 
faded.. and was real easy to wash. 

eventually,,, his neighbor backed into the hood. .. <sigh>... so he had to 
have a new hood installed and painted to match... it has faded now, but that 
other coating hasn't 

iirc... it is a 62 beetle,, he has had it since the early 80's.. and drives 
it ,, leaves it out in the weather... has fun with it! 

I wish I new the story of it's paint history..  maybe it belonged to a 
worker at the tub and sink coating place in town. 

<thinking> ,,,,, I wonder if a bus body will fit on that paint line... 

Jamie .. doesn't want that much work... Rivers
