Subject: Little Miss Sunshine

Hey guys,

    I really apologize if this has already been mentioned on the list, but I
was away for a few days so I might have missed it. There is a new movie coming
out I think in a couple of weeks?? ...and it's called Little Miss Sunshine.
I'm not exactly sure what the movie is about, but nearly half the scenes in
the movie take place in a yellow Type-2 Volkswagen Bus.

IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449059/
Trailer: http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/littlemisssunshine/


The driver hauls a$$ in it and at one point the sliding door falls off...
