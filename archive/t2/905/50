Ya'll are gonna love this one.

Powder coat paint!

I have started seeing some folks that are painting their cars with the
new lower cure temp stuff that "sets" with exposure to UV.

Lots of other drawbacks(like repairs)...but it is pretty much
on forever and the EPA could care less about it.

Oh, the other drawback....you have to be able to put it on
metal...no bondo....however, you can buy hi temp "metal filler"
that it works with.

There are folks in my area(somewhere) that have started doing 
old american vintage car frames in powder coat....which means that they
have some humongous ovens.

There are rumors that the Merecedes folks have been trying to figure out 
how to use it for a while.  Remember the link to how much of the cost of a 
new car was paint?

Read up on it!

Cheers, dave

    I'd pay for that one.
