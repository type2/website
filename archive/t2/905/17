	Thanx Dave  -  I was unaware of the change in brandname.  The 
original name Lumiweld I saw in Popular Science when the product came 
out 2 decades ago.  Only about a decade ago I bought some of these 
brazing rods (that's what they really are) under that original 
brandname.  It's a minor puzzle why anyone would change the name of 
such a self-commending product.
