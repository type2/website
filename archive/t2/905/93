I am totally addicted to that place. Every once in a while, I'll hop on the 
website and order like 15 different things that will come out to like $100 
bucks. Of course, it always takes near a month to get, but it's like 
Christmas every time. Sure, it's all crap and it's all made in China, but 
where else can you buy a 55lb Anvil for like $12 bucks?
