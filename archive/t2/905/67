Hi All -

----------------
In response to more whining about paint costs, George says:

.....Personally, I think that the manufacturers are holding us hostage by
feeding the desire for a mirror surface on sheet metal.  If cars came with
matte or semi-matte finishes they would be a lot easier to keep looking
new.....

Aha - this gives me a chance to suggest a real alternative: satin or matte 
finish paint.

I had Jim Lavars, a 25 year pro at fooling the eye with auto paint in Santa Cruz 
CA, use a light desert tan matte industrial tool paint with some extra hardener 
on Trigger, my '67 sedan, eighteen years ago.  Though battered by wind, rain, 
salt, sand, rock chips and carelessness, only in the last year or so did some 
cracks start showing on the top and gray primer begin to show through on the 
front cowl.  When I needed to repair major damage from a t-bone to the drivers 
front fender and door area, after mondo bondo, I simply used Krylon outdoor 
satin spray paint.  Because the surface is not shiny, the color mismatch, though 
obvious, blends in to the casual eye, as well as helps hide my first time try.

Seven years ago, realizing that the 30 year old original red paint was as much 
rust as anything else, I sanded down and used spray can primer and a similar 
light tan shade (Almond I think) of Krylon on the top and front of Betsy, the 
'71 Kombi.  This took two cases of primer and 18 cans of paint over a week to 
apply. It still looks decent.  Again - because the non-shiny surface does not 
reveal the small imperfections, I'm quite happy with this gorilla approach if 
budget or wallet doesn't permit a better job.

This approach has the bonus of never needing to wash your car.
