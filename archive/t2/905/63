Subject: [T2] cylinder head temp sensor reading question

hello everyone,
       according to the bentley manual, test the cylinder head temp sensor
with an ohmeter at 68*F.  it is way hotter here in georgia than that.  my
thermometer reading at the time i checked the resistance on this part was
89*F.   the resistance reading was 1826 ohms.  the bentley says
approximately 2500 ohms.  if the resistanc eis higher or lower replace the
temp sensor II.   is there a scale for variable ambient temps or should i
just replace the darned thing.  what are your opinions on this matter?
