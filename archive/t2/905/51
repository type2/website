Yes, I know I posted on how to take a digital thermometer (Taylor makes 
a number of good ones) and extend the sender and the wiring to meet the 
gauge up front on the dash.  Taylor makes one with an alarm when a 
certain temp is reached, and its sender uses a miniplug connection.
    It's fun in summer to see how long it takes the engine to cool down 
below 100deg F- and you will then realize why one should get to a 
campground in hot weather at least 3 hours before going to bed and lying 
over the hot engine compartment!
