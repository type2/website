Subject: Crank & Rod Service

I'm in the process of overhauling my 77 2.0 type 4 engine. It had  
about 230k miles on the shortblock from what I can tell.

The main crank bearings were eaten through the bronze(??) The cam has  
some pitting and I plan to replace it, but most items look alright. I  
have the rods still on the crank and was planning on leaving them on  
when I take it to the machine shop. I plan on having them check the  
crank and polish the surface, replace the rod bearings and deal with  
the cam&distributor gears. Should I plan on having the wrist pin  
bushings replaced? What about balancing the rods or other service on  
the rods, is that necessary with this motor?

Thanks
