Subject: Re: [T2] Yikes - Paint is Expensive

My local PPG dealer has a mid-grade paint that was about $65/gallon and a body man friend of mine says it's good paint.  Might look in the phone book for who sells PPG.  Generally each town will have one exclusive PPG dealer where you can get the best price.  Mine is Sage Green.  I don't know if the yellow would be more.  Cheers...KR

paint (77 chrome yellow) at $170/gallon. There price for filling
primer and activator was more than I expected also, ~ $90 for both.
Anybody know of a realible source for these materials at a more
reasonable price? Or am I just out of touch?

Thanks,
Ken
