Subject: Re: [T2] Yikes - Paint is Expensive

On the topic of printers: I have an older Canon printer which I can 
refill. You can buy multi-oz bottles of ink for $15 or so. So, for the 
cost of an inkjet cartridge I am good to go for /years/.

On the topic of the Laserjet - we have one at the local university where 
I used to work. Stopped by for a visit the other day and printed the 
configuration... Has printed over 2 million pages very, very slowly (and 
reliably). The printer I have at my current job is WAY faster but has 
only printed about 300K sheets. I'm racing to catch up with 1800 page 
print jobs... <griN!>

If you are learning to paint buy cheap. Next time 'round buy better. My 
acrylic enamel paint (with hardner) still looks good and fit my my 
limited skill and budget. NOT OEM quality by a long, long shot. Am using 
tractor paint for non-exterior surfaces. WAY cheap and durable. Doesn't 
look good on surfaces intended to be shiny. I keep expecting the EPA to 
lock us amateurs out of painting our own vehicles.
