Hi Ken.  The $65/gallon paint was enamel paint.  The  distributor for it is only allowed to carry PPG products but they do  have lines that are not the PPG brand but made by PPG.  I'm going  to go back down there and check it out.  My buddy painted a  friend's wife's car with it and it looks great.  I'll get back  with you.  Cheers...KR

At this point, I think I'll take the suggestions to check out the PPG
products and take any additional suggestions and price differences
into consideration.  I certainly like the comments of PPG being toward
easier end of the range of products.  Can anyone give me an idea of
how PPG and Nason are going to compare handling-wise?

Thank again and in advance,
Ken
