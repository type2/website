Subject: Help - can't get reverse NOT to work..

Hi

As I have mentioned earlier, passed test ready to go etc,  but one tiny 
problem I can select reverse WITHOUT pressing the gearstick down, it 
just slides right in, this could be problematic at freeway speeds.  The 
other gears are all fine if not a bit stirry.

I have replaces all the bushes, clutch etc during the rebuild.

I have checked the shift plate and stick postion as per Bently several 
times?  Any ideas???

Thanks
