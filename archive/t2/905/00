Subject: RE: Original fuel Line Clamps

A side note... BMW clamps found in the salvage yards are much better quality than the junk you find in FLAPS. Pressed in worm gears, not cut into the band.  I've never used them for FI connections but use'm for everything else around the car and garage. Wide range of sizes on most '80's you find, 13mm to 40+.
