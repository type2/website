It's time to invest in a timing light, vacuum and pressure gauges.  I'll
be in Eugene on Sunday and thought perhaps I'd go to Horrible Freight
and git some on the cheep...

Any one want to warn me away from the following???

> timing light:
> http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/ctaf/displayitem.taf?Itemnumber=3343
$12.99

> BRAKE BLEEDER & VACUUM PUMP KIT
> http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/ctaf/Displayitem.taf?itemnumber=92474
0-30 inches Hg
$19.99

Or, should I go with the vac and pressure in one?  Are the gauge ranges
on the one below acceptable?  The price sure is right.

> FUEL PUMP AND VACUUM TESTER
> http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/ctaf/displayitem.taf?Itemnumber=93547
Tests output pressure to 10 PSI
Read vacuum to 28" HG
$12.99

And don't we all need one of these?

That's the problem with harbor...  I can spend a coupla hundred in
cutesie incidentals real quick.

Thanks,
