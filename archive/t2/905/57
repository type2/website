Subject: Push Rod Seals

Hi,

I'm a new member to this list. I just recently bought a '78 transporter, 
and the guy I got it from pointed out an oil leak, suggesting that I 
replace the push-rod bearing seals. Does anyone know whether we'd be 
able to do that without pulling the engine?

Also, since I'm a bit new to VW's, if anyone's free this Sunday 
afternoon in the South SF bay area, and would be willing to give a tour 
of the engine in return for a home-cooked meal, I'd love to have it!

Thanks,
Greg Perkins
