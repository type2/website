FWIW my VDO gauges work fine and I'm sure they do for many others.  they 
ARE sensitive to the wiring and grounding. . .some folks report common 
calibration issues and bad apples but I have a 3-gauge pod mounted below 
my dash to the left of the steering wheel with cyl. head temp, oil 
pressure, and oil temp (now on the CB adapter for oil pressure/temp both 
in pressure location fot T1).  and all the readings make sense.  YMMV.
