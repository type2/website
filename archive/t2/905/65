Tub refinish...

Years ago I had a friend in the rub refinishing biz - it didn't take him
too long to mask, prep and spray new stuff on a gruddy ol' li'l sink.

The prep he used was NASTY.

But I bet this'd be a helluva long lasting surface.  Glossy as all get
out, too.

He seemed to have gotten into this on the fly - if you're really
interested, google it, I bet there are opportunities to get started.
