You're good. It's right where it should be or close
enough. More resistance makes it run richer, less
makes it run leaner. It is not uncommon to add
resistance to that circuit to make the engine run a
little richer for freeway driving, for example. I used
to run a variable resistor that I could adjust
instantly from the drivers seat.

Anyway - your sensor is right where it should be. Was
there some symptom you were trying to chase down?
