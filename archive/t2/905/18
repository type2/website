Subject: Re: [T2] Yikes - Paint is Expensive

I just painted my bus and paid $90 for 2K primer (a gallon) and $130 for PPG 
Omni paint (per gallon, including reducer and hardener). That was the low 
end...the high end was $230 a gallon.

There is a ton of archive info on paint alternatives, but if you want real 
auto paint, that's good quality, those were the prices I found in town.
