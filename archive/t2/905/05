Subject: Re: [T2] Yikes - Paint is Expensive

Sounds about right to me.  My primer/surfacer was over $200 for all 3 parts for 1 gal.  Dupont Nason single stage was $88/gal for the color part, 1 gal Dupont nason epoxy primer and the activator/reducer was $130 (Nason is the middle quality Dupont product line). 

I ordered a gal of Nason single stage to paint my interior and the distributor mixed up the Chroma 1 (top of the line Dupont product line) by mistake and sold it to me for $88, the Nason price, it's normally $230/gal, not including the activator or reducer.  It ended up being about $120 or so, instead of about $300, I get some luck every now and then.

I used a little bit of the BASF urethane primer/surfacer bottom shelf product (LIMCO) and it was fine.  It is about the same cost as the Dupont Nason.  I liked it better than the Dupont Nason, actually.  Maybe not as tough when done, but it went on easier and was much smoother after sanding.  That is probably the difference between epoxy and urethane, instead of BASF vs Dupont.

Transtar products have a good reputation.  Those may be less expensive.

This stuff is high and getting higher.  I do not know of a way to avoid or minimize these expenses.

Paint guns and computers get less expensive all the time to compensate, I guess.
