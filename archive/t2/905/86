Subject: Re: [T2] better cooling fans?

Just be careful of what plastic you use. The Corvair engineers tried a 
plastic fan (and I don't know which plastic). As the battery was 
recharged and produced acid fumes, these combined with the plastic in 
the fan and created a gas that was making the passengers sick. I'd have 
to research the particulars... They wanted the lightest fan possible to 
comabt the fan belts that kept flipping off during hard, high rpm 
shifts. A properly adjusted fan belt stays put but they were trying to 
improve the design understand.

Anyhow remember that the wasserpumpers have their engines at the front 
of the vehicle. They need the most airflow help when the engine is 
turning slowly b/c the vehicle is generally moving slowly and there is 
no ram effect over the radiator from vehicle motion. In a rear engined 
vehicle there is never much of a ram effect. You need max cooling all 
the time and the difference in engine speed is well matched to the 
engine's heat production: low rpm, low load, low cooling effect, and 
vice versa assuming that the driver can operate the gearbox and gas 
pedal correctly. That is my take on it.

The better solution would be a huge leaf blower whose throttle was 
matched to the gas pedal. GOOD cooling at the right quantities. Of 
course it would have to be a 20HP leaf blower... <griN!>

Maybe a large capacity turbo blower with a super duper NASA designed 
electric motor? Yeah, yeah I know - massive electrical draw... <griN!>

Keep the good ideas flowing. My answer is just speculation...
