Gillette usta run specials...Buy a coupla packs of blades and they gave you
the
razor free...
Printers are like that too...a coupla cartridges and you've spent the cost of
the
printer...Epson, for one that I know, puts a chip in the cartridge that tells
the
printer that it's too low on ink to print. Even if you use the refill kit,
the chip
won't let the printer print... ;-(
