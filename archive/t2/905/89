Don't forget to pick up the $2.99 electric fly swatter (really need  that around here last week) and the $9.99 diamond knife sharpening  block (four different grits).  And a $6.99 electric screwdriver  kit, and..., and...  Don't forget your credit card.   Cheers...KR

Any one want to warn me away from the following???

0-30 inches Hg

Or, should I go with the vac and pressure in one?  Are the gauge ranges
on the one below acceptable?  The price sure is right.

Tests output pressure to 10 PSI
Read vacuum to 28" HG

And don't we all need one of these?
