Hi, Bernnard:

Bus Brother Mark Kruezer who is on a cross country trip in a '85 Westy
with a Zetec (www.ourwesty.com) engine right now gave me this tip for
a quick fix:

Go to Menard's or a Kitchen supply place and purchase a long candy or
deep fryer thermometer, long enough to make it down the dipstick tube
to the lowest part.  I got one at Menard's for $7.00.  It is about 11'
long.  My temp is solid at 225 when I check it with the thermo.  The
thermo goes up to 550 degrees.  Mark uses this method on a '79 Beetle.

Not exactly convienent as you have to pull over, but is decent quick fix.

Pete
