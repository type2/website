Subject: Need help - poptop luggage rack

Hello to you all.

I've search and read some of the old e-mails on the archive, and found some
informations I need to repaint my new fiber glass poptop.
However, I need some informations and a litle help:
My bus (1968 - baywindow) is receiving a new fiber glass poptop. It's an
upgrade from the old one that's currently mounted...It's a project similar to
the Westfakia. But what I would like to know is how the water gets off the
luggage rack in (for example) rainy days? I've noticed the holes that my
luggage rack has. They're 6 and obviously, they are useful in this case...But
once the water gets off through the holes, where does it go? If the luggage
rack has a seal that is fitted between the rack and the top of the bus, how
does the water leaves?
I've repainted my bus and I sure don't want to get it rusted again so
soon....

Thanks in advance...
Best regards from Lisbon, Portugal.
