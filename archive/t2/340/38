Subject: CA bus for sale in Asheville, NC

I own too many vehicles, thus need to sell one.  For those that are looking
for a bus that does not require any rustoration or mechanical work, this is
it.

This bus is a 1976, 2 liter FI bus.......came to me from California.  Green
with white paint, tan/brown interior.

Mechanically perfect.  Everything works.  New rebuilt motor (maybe 1000
miles on it) new clutch, clutch components, full brake job (hoses, drums,
pads, shoes, springs, rotors, bearings).  New window seals......all of them.
New door seals.   Seems to be the original paint.
NO RUST, except small hole under battery, and could use a little work under
front windshield.  i have put Por 15 under the front windshield, and it does
not leak a drop of water.  ......none elsewhere on the van, none.

Bad.....one dent on the passenger door ( I have removed 90 % of it), needs
rear bumper.   Front bumper has one crease in it.


$4200 Pmail for directions to come see it.
