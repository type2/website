Hi Scott,

Yes, the word CAM was incorrect, I meant to say "CRANK". Sorry.

Right after I hit send the word "wobble" occurred to me. That is what 
is happening, the piston and rod wobble slightly on the crank in the 
forward/aft axis. Only about 2-3 mm, but I wouldn't think even that 
much would be acceptable.

To rephrase: With the crank end of the rod held in one place the piston 
end of the rod can be moved fore and aft about 2-3mm. The axis of 
rotation is centered on the crank bearing. It's a very slight rotation 
but I wouldn't normally expect any in this particular location. OTOH, 
I'm not an engine builder so I thought I'd bring it to the list.

Lateral movement of the rod along the crank is NOT what I am talking 
about. It does that too, but it doesn't concern me as much right now.

Does that help?

Happy trails,
