I'll have to take pictures, then (a digital camera is on the event horizon).

I inherited a modified setup.  Whatever the engine had originally, it now
has a single carb.  Which frankly is about my speed repair/tune up-wise, so
the loss of power/performance may be balanced out my being able to work on
the engine.

Thanks for the help.
