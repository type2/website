I agree with everyone else that has posted so far that your primary concern should be low-end torque.  Ideally the cam should make excellent torque between 1000 and 3500rpm.  Above that rpm, it isn't going to benefit you much unless you like to drive very fast.  The stock cam's torque drops sharply above 3000rpm, and therefore is not the best for efficiency and power at highway speeds.

Rule of thumb:  If in doubt, choose the more conservative cam.
