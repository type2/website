That's the preferred location for some.  It's outside the engine compartment,
so a leak would have less disastrous effects.  It also allows you to use an
uninterrupted metal line from the firewall to the fuel pump.

Me, I put mine right next to the intake of the fuel pump, so I can
inspect and replace it more easily, but I'm seriously considering 
reconsidering.
Your call.  But definitely have one disposable filter between the fuel tank
and the fuel pump.  DO NOT PUT IT BETWEEN THE FUEL PUMP AND
THE CARB(S).  The mechanical VW fuel pump is designed to pull, not push.
