aircooled.net's "stocker stomper".  Anybody have this cam?  Do you like it?

Depends on where the torque "comes on"...A heavy vehicle (read: Bus) needs
low end (low rpm) torque to move...A lighter vehicle (my Bugeye) can use
an engine that produces more power at higher rpms since it doesn't need
the low end torque to start it off. BUT! Like everything else, it's a com-
promise...If your gearing isn't matched to your engine's 'curve', you can
end up with something horrible to actually drive...A stump puller at low
speeds, that wheezes at high speeds...Which is not to say that the cam 
or modifications you've chosen won't be entirely satisfactory to you,
just that it's always a lot better/cheaper to do your homework before
you do the engine work...
