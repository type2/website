Subject: torque or horsepower?

I am looking at cams...  I know this sort of thing is always a compromise, 
but what should I concentrate on with my 72 westy, torque or horsepower?  and 
will a cam itself cause an engine to run hotter/cooler?  I'm looking at 
aircooled.net's "stocker stomper".  Anybody have this cam?  Do you like it?

Thanks,
Jen
