Well, counting the one in the fuel tank and (maybe) one in the fuel pump,
you may have as many as four.  I'd just run one add-on filter.  If the filter
sleeve in the fuel tank is in good condition (and there is NO good reason
for it not to be), this is a reasonable amount of overkill.  Each filter will
restrict flow, to some degree.
