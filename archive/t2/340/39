Subject: Re: [T2] oil pressure sender install

Re tightening pressure sender- I enlarged the hole with a dremyl, and
then

I used some sort of sealing compound and inserted a putty knife between
the terminals and twisted the sender with a vice grip on the knife
handle.
To seal any air gap, use silicone or a piece of "putty" found int the
electrical dept of Home Depot-used to seal boxes to a wall- it never
hardens.
