Single (probably Solex) carb, right?  Sounds like vapor-lock to me.  Make
sure your fuel filter is clean and make sure your fuel line is NOT touching
the engine case or anything else that gets really really hot.  Use some
plastic wire ties or whatever you can think up and support the fuel line so
it gets better air flow around it.

You'd be amazed how hot it gets in your engine compartment when you shut off
your motor.  I've got one of those nifty indoor/outdoor thermometers in my
73 with the "outdoor" sender mounted inside the engine compartment.  On the
highway on a 80 degree day my engine comparment temps read around 90-95
degrees.  Shut off the motor for 5 minutes and the temps spike past the 120
degree limit of my thermometer.
