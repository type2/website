Umm, are you sure that you don't have that backwards?

Gasoline is a
volitile fluid with a high vapor pressure.  If you reduce the pressure of
the gasoline by more than about 4PSI by placing a restriction on the inlet
side of the pump, the gas in the line will turn into vapor, which the
pump can't pump.  This condition is called "vapor lock".  VWs don't vapor
lock much since they have a nearly-gravity-feed system with little
restriction.  If a restriction is placed in the line you increase the
chance of vapor lock.

If you do put a filter upstream of the fuel pump, make sure that it is a
large low-restriction unit.  The normal place for a filter is on the
pressure side of the pump, between the pump and carburator.  I'm not a big
fan of the little filters and find that Pep Boys has a fair selection of
larger filters with the correct hose nipples for various Japanese autos.
Be sure to clamp all connections between the pump and carburator
