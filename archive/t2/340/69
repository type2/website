Subject: Air Cooled Classics Porsche in Knoxville, TN

Hi All,

Has anyone ever dealt with "Air Cooled Classics Porsche" in Knoxville, TN?  
The guy seemed very curteous and knowledgable on the phone-- He said he could 
help me untangle in my mind how I want to build my 72 Westy's engine.  I'll 
be doing the work myself, but was wondering if I should listen to him-- his 
is the only shop I've found close by that can do machining on type 4 engines.

Thanks,
Jen
