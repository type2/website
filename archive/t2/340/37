Subject: Hose sizes (general)

Is there a 'rule of thumb' that tells you what is the correct size hose to
use for a particular fitting, given the O.D. of whatever the hose is going
on to?  I want to get the correct size hoses for my engine and I can't find
anything that tells me what sizes to buy.  I have a vernier caliper so
measuring is no problem.  If it helps, I am thinking particularly of vacuum
hoses and the various connections to balance pipes etc (dual carbs).
