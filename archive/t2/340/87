Subject: Interesting IKEA clock dash install

I have the same clock in my empty right instrument cavity.  Probably not as
neat looking though.  I put some silicone seal on the suction cup, pushed it
in and held it with masking tape till cured.  Looks good and easy to set or
replace batteries.  A really good improvement and much better looking than
all the LCD digital numbers.
