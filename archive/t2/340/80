One way is to remove the fan housing.  You can then get a thin open-end wrench on the nut by inserting it from the side, under the tin.  A lot of work to remove the fan housing, but less than dropping the engine.  You could also just hand-tighten it.


>Also, I was wondering where would be the most useful place to wire a voltage gauge? At the battery or up near the fuse box to see a voltage drop in the old wiring. Both?

If you go with the battery, you will need a relay unless you want the gauge on all the time.
