Sounds like a good suggestion, but I don't have a mig so this will have to be
done by a shop. I have never had much luck with easyouts and given the force
the stud held when I twisted and the amount of penetrating oil that I have
used I think any easyout would just break.

No, this is another case I have. I just got tired of the extra space it
required with the studs, plus as it will sometime go to get aligned bored,
they need to come out anyway.
