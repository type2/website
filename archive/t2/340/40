Subject: Interesting IKEA clock dash install

IKEA has an analog battery clock ($5?) that is round and embedded within
a rubber case that has a large suction cup on the back.  The clock part
is threaded within a plastic "cup" and must be unscrewed to replace the
battery.  First we stuck this to the windshield, and then I realized
this made for an easy install in the blank hole in the right of the
instrument panel. Pulled the rubber covering off the clock- and then I
wound adhesive" wide 1/8" thick closed cell weathersealing foam around
the cup (2 layers) and squished the clock into the round dash cavity. 
Took the washer tubing off an old steering column and used this to
nicely face the gap the foam reveals.  The clock itself is simply
unscrewed to set or replace the battery.
