Jen,

Stick with torque for a westy.  Unless you are going to spend
almost all of your time on the hiway at 65+mph.

For a westy, I would do the street special...you need torque to get you 
and all of your gear moving.

The other one needs recomended HD valve springs.  Migh run a little hotter
depending on the valve overlap, but you should be fine with the street 
special.

Cheers, dave
