If your stock pump is working, leave it be!

They work OK.  You may have to add a pressure regulator if the pump puts
out too much pressure.  Usually power is drawn from the hot wire on the
coil, but make sure that you're not overloading that circuit.

Filters seldom run full as they trap bubbles in the fuel.  Nothing to
worry about unless you have fuel starvation problems.  I don't think that
my fuel filter has ever run full.

I think that it's a non-problem.  The stock setup is reliable and doesn't
tax the electrical system.  Unless you have a really good reason to change
it (hot engine that needs more fuel flow, perhaps), stick with the stock
pump.
