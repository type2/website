Subject: Funkily designed air cleaner

A carb air cleaner question...

The single carb air cleaner on my bus's engine has a square base and top.
It's about 4" x 7", and has a square air filter (hollow) with one corner at
a small 45 degree angle.  Four metal clips hold the top, to the bottom of
the air cleaner  I'm assuming that it's an aftermarket air cleaner, and so
it follows that I can't seem to locate a replacement filter for it.

Does anyone recognize this type of air cleaner, and would the opinion be
that it would be better to replace it with whatever was supposed to be there
in the first place, or that I should keep trying to find the right filter?
My next two stops were going to be a NAPA, then a performance shop.

Thanks. :O)
