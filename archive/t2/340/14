Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pump wont shut off!!

> Hey folks, my fuel pump wont cut off even when the
 ignition is off. Is it the ignition switch or a relay
 or the pump? Any Ideas or experience with similar
 problems welcome.

Unplug the double relay, left end of fuel tank panel. May be silver or black plastic. Has two plugs on it.
If the pump stops, relay is bad.
If the pump stays running, you have wires shorted together!
