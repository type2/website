Years ago my friend bought a decent running Bug; ran it for quite a
few thousand miles and finally went for a tune-up...The mechanic
replaced three out of four plugs (Guess which one wouldn't come
out?)...He told my friend the bad news...Well, I could wrench it
out, but then we'd hafta pull the engine to shoot a helicoil in to
fix the head. Yeah, be careful with those $1.50 plugs in $500
holes...
