This is a common filter for aftermarket carbs. If your 77 bus has a carb
there is no "correct" air filter, since your induction system is not stock.
That style of filter is used on many applications both for downdraft and
sidedraft carbies, webers mostly.

The best place to get elements for that style of filter would be at an
aftermarket performance parts shop. Try asking for an element for a weber
DGV or similar carb. You can get a K&N element that you never have to
replace, you just clean and re-oil it.
