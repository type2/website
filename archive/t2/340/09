Subject: Re: [T2] '78 engine carrier

you asked
<Is this something that could be installed AFTER the engine is in, and 
if so,
<would it be reasonably easy to do?

someone else on the list tell me if I am wrong but I think the answer 
is no!
I think I remember trying this - I had painted the carrier and it was 
not dry yet so on went the exhaust and in went the engine and .....
Later when I tried to slip the engine carrier between the exhaust - No 
go.

So I guess you could put the engine back in sans carrier and exhaust 
and then install the carrier and exhaust in *that* order.
