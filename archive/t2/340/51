I just replaced the canvas recently on my '79.  After removing the plastic 
strips and examining the factory staples, I decided to use my 20+ year old 
Arrow hand stapler with 1/2 inch staples.  This stapler was only able to get 
the staples about half-way in.  I decided to take a break for awhile (and 
wonder aloud who in the h*ll designed this dumb*ss canvas setup in the first 
place) and take a trip to the home center.  The power staples available at 
the home center were too narrow (didn't have the spread of the factory 
staples (about 1/2 inch)) and were too long (they would've gone straight 
thru the wood).  After much thought, I picked up a new Arrow hand stapler.  
This worked fine with 1/2 staples. Maybe the spring on my old stapler was 
tired? Every now and then the new stapler wouldn't quite drive the staple 
all of the way into the plactic strip and wood, so I would just seat these 
with a tack hammer.  Top got installed and has no wrinkles.  Looks great.
