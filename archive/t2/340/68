Subject: door restoration?

Out of the 1200+ T2 messages I have saved, I cannot find the 
excellent write up that someone did about putting their
front doors back together.  I have started on the door seals, but 
am now ready for all of the intructions for the glass/regulator,
vent window and the window seals.

Someone had a great writeup, including instructions on when to
consume the next adult beverage<grin>.  

Someone have that one handy?  For my 78 Champagne edition...which
is starting to look pretty good!!!

Cheers, dave
