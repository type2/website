Here is all you need to know about Eureka Springs, Arkansas.

I've been trying to tell you all about this for years.

Take a look at the main page here...  http://www.nwavwa.com/

Basically, when we do they show, we own the convention center and town!
BTW, if you have spouses that aren't in to VW's, then they will love the 
town as it is a shoppers paradise with victorian type houses all over the 
place.

Cheers, dave
