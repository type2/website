Subject: Electric Fuel Pump on T1 engine?

I have recently seen a couple of vendors selling
electric fuel pumps that can mount in the same spot as
my stock mechanical fuel pump on my 1600 DP engine.
Anyone have experience with doing this? Do they work
well? Are they really just a scam? Where does it have
to be wired to get power, coil? Run wire to fuse box?
I have noticed that my fuel filter seems to run empty
a lot. Even after installing a new mechanical fuel
pump. I don't know if this has caused any issues with
my engine getting enough fuel or not, but it seems
like it could. Could the electric replacement help
this out?
