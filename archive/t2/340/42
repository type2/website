You didn't say if it was a FI or carb engine sooooo.
One thought I have is that it has something to do with your cold start
valve? Perhaps (theory only) the cold start is operating way too much
& the only way to lean out the mixture when starting while hot is to
open the throttle all the way (read push gas pedal). One more thought
is the Temp Sensor II which is located in the drivers side head on #3
right where the intake runners connect to the head. This little $20
sensor can cause all sorts of issues.

But if you have a FI engine you can guess the problem or get the
minimal amount of tools and go through the Bentley procedure and
check/verify all tests for FI. This is the only good way to test and
correct your FI system. The guess approach really doesn't work well.
