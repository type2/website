If you can, look up the viscosity ratings for each of those oils (within the same brand) and see if they are nearly identical. 20w50 normally isn't much of a boost during winter over SAE30.

As a matter of experience, I always fill up 1/2 quart lower than the spec, run the engine, let it sit overnight and check it again in the morning then add more. The stick will let you know you have enough oil but you won't know how much until it's cycled through the system and settled. Measuring the oil you add to the filter isn't enough to get it right the first time.

Just undo the plug for a few seconds (oil cold of course) and check the dipstick. Repeat until the lever is correct.
