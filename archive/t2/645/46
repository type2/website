Subject: Re: [T2] Generator pedestal breather tube question

I have the same tube on my 71 bus but the tube is open to the  atmosphere.  
Could this be causing some of my rough idling when I try to  start in 1st gear? 
 Is my carburetor getting too much air do you  think?  My engine runs fine at 
idle but when I put it into gear it almost  dies on me so I have to give it a 
LOT of gas to keep it from dying.  Other  than that, it runs like a scalded 
dog!.
