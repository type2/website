I found some more up to date info at Chevron's CA site (at least pertaining
to their own oils):

http://www.chevron.ca/ProductsServices/Retail/MotorOilLabel.htm

If you look at their viscosity table...

...you'll see that 10w30 and SAE30 have the basically the same viscosity
except that 10w30 can start the engine in much colder weather.

WRT your quoted oil choices: although 20w50 can start in colder weather look
how much thicker the oil is than SAE30. Based on those number it doesn't
seem like a good idea to switch to 20w50 for winter if you are achieving
your goals with SAE30 during the summer. You would be better off with a
lighter oil as long as you are maintaining the proper oil pressures.
