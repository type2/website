The EGR valve is a valve with two "closed" positions - at idle and at Wide
Open Throttle - and is open otherwise, allowing a small amount of inert gas
(exhaust) into the air distribution box.  The introduction of the inert gas
is supposed to lower combustion temperatures,  resulting in less NOx
emissions.
