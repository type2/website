I hadn't even given it a thought.  I was just looking in the owner's 
manual chart which shows 30w OK down to 32F and 20w50 OK down to 15F.  
Of course, they don't mention whose 20w50.

I had the Castrol around and just put it in.  I still plan to switch to 
synthetic once a filter arrives and definitely before winter sets in 
here in Montana.

cheers,
