Subject: Decel valve

Volks,

For the third time in three years my decel valve is failing.  The first
was the OEM unit, the next two were junkyard finds.  I have a feeling that
shear age is doing them in and would love to pick up a new one (not NOS,
but new manufacure).  Face it, after 25+ years rubber gets hard and cracks
whether it gets used or not.  I have done a basic search and do not see
anyone with this part dor sale on their web pages but I am curious if
anyone else has had any luck getting a replacement.
