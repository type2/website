i would say gas shocks are worth there weight in gold 
after riding on bad ones.
i put new gas shocks on the back of the bus and
regular shocks on the front spring 2004 from shocks
that were broken and love the ride but would prefer to
have the extra cushion of gas in the front.
they arent much more but at time had to get the 13.99
deal from western auto...
will put the regular fronts(western autos for extras
after replace front with gas though. alot softer ride....
