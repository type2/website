Subject: Generator pedestal breather tube question

On my '71 stock DP upright engine, there is a breather tube that goes from the
top of the generator pedestal (next to the oil filler) downward through the
tin to the underside of the engine. Originally there was a rubber thingy that
slips over the bottom opening of this tube. Does anyone know purpose of this
rubber piece and is it important?

Thanks,
