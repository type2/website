Subject: Re: [T2] Installing a BN2 heater in a Westy

Guys:

BN-type heaters just plain scare me..  I had one when I got the bus.  
Smelled bad and leaked Gasoline in the engine compartment.  All I could 
think of was BOOOMMM!!!  It's gone now.

Blankets don't explode!  Also just for camping a propane heater such as 
we've discussed might be better. And of course body heat with the right 
camping companion....

I remember the BN heater in my old Beetle.  I got too hot and I thought 
the car was going to burn.  It was toasty though.  Crispy critters...  <g>
