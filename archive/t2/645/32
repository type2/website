Subject: RE: [T2] Official AIRS Update

I'll volunteer for Arizona if it isn't taken by
Jess or somebody else.  Actually, I could do any
state as I will be calling from my cell phone and
it doesn't care what states I call. 

Rhetorical question:  why are we thinking about
paying someone money (ms.net) instead of getting
those services free from yahoo or someone else? 
You could start a yahoo group, make an occasional
post to all the members to require them to
confirm and save the list as one of the files on
that part of the website.  

I like free.

Happy AIRS'in
Ray
