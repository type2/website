Sorry, forgot to update you.  I got a call back a few days later that 
the warehouse that thought they had them, well, didn't.  They referred 
me to Rocky Mountain Motorworks!  I ended up finding a used thermostat 
assembly from a 914.  It worked out well in the end since I also needed 
the bracket.

cheers,
