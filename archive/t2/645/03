Subject: oil level question

I just did a quickie oil change on the bus.  I had planned an order of 
filters and a switch to synthetic.  Well, the weather beat the filters 
here, so I changed out the 30wt for some 20-50 as a temporary fix 
today.  I read the spec of 3.2 quarts without filter, added 3, checked, 
started up and shut down.  Checked again 15 minutes later and I'm high 
by about half the distance between the marks, shoot!  Does this call 
for a drain off or am I within the margin of error?  How much is too 
much?

On a side note, the creamy oil filler cap is no more.  Thanks, I'll 
bet, to the thermostat install.  On a beside the side note, I got a 
scare when the filler cap wouldn't come off.  I was just about to take 
the rubber neck off and refill when it finally gave way.  Guess I'll be 
a little gentler putting it on in the future!

thanks,
