Subject: Rear Brakes locked up - should I be concerned?

Hi Type 2er's,



I was driving through town yesterday at about 30 miles per hour when I
had to step on my brakes rather hard. My rear brakes locked up and I
skidded about 60 feet. I have only had the bus for 5 months or so but
when I checked the brakes everything looked great. I brought it into Les
Schwab for an inspection after this happened and they too, said the
breaks checked out just fine. I sometimes have to pump once to get full
pressure, should I be looking into a new break system, MC, etc... or is
it normal for a bus to do lock up under hard breaking. The conditions
were dry and the fluid wasn't frozen or anything. I am just looking for
opinions and ideas from the rest of y'all.



Thanks,



Max Bronsema
