Subject: Vanagon flapper box seals

Hard to believe I've been looking for this part at the junkyard for two
years but everytime I go I forget to check out the Vanagons.

These are the seals that go between the flapper boxes on an air cooled
Vanagon and it's accordian tubes. Karl got me wise to them because they are
made of silicon rubber instead of crumbling asbestos cuffs used on the
baywindow which tear up everytime you R&R those parts if you are not very
careful. Asbestos is no good for you anyway.

The straight one is from the passenger side and you need two of them for the
baywindow.
