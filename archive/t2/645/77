Subject: Looking for Solex carb rebuilder 

Has anyone had any good experiences having their Solex carbs rebuilt -
including rebushing the throttle shaft? Any specific recommendation would be
welcome. I took my 34pict-3 to a 'carb shop' a while back and they just
cleaned it and put in a new kit - something I could have done. The throttle
shaft still leaked.

Sincere thanks,
