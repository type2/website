Wayne,
        Is your Westy an automatic or manual-trans model??  The manual trans 
starter shaft  (rearward end when installed) is carried in a brass bushing 
inside the bellhousing.  The automatic has a casting of its own for this 
purpose.  Sometimes the bushing can "freeze up" making it difficult for the 
starter motor to turn..... however, your BMW battery seems to do a better job, 
right?  As far as the CCA statistics are concerned, I've been able to turn over 
a Type II engine with a small battery (for example from a riding mower), so I 
tend to think the problem may be in conductivity to your starter (cables and 
grounding) or in the starter itself.  If your starter has given many years of 
service, it may be that the brushes are nearly worn out.  Without being able to 
see your Westy firsthand, I can't offer much of a diagnosis.... sorry!

Sorry to rehash this topic.

 

I've got a '79 Westy, the battery in the bus (a NAPA group 41) won't turn
the bus motor over.  To make sure the problem wasn't ground related, I
cleaned the battery to body connection and the frame to transmission
connection - the ground wires look old but not bad.
