Subject: Brake Drum - Vanagon & late bay

Will Vanagn rear brake drums fit the late bay VW??  I see that they are 
different number in Bus Depot, but I thought I researched it before and 
found that they were the same fit drums..

I know the front calipers on the Vanagon fit the late bay (until what years, 
late bay and Vanagon, I forget) but not the Vanagon rotors of course.
