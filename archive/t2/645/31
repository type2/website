Subject: Re: [T2] Installing a BN2 heater in a Westy

BN4/BN2 gas heaters are no more dangerous than the aircooled bus or bug
you're driving now.  
If you don't perform the recommended maintenance the gas will leak and it
will burn. If its running too rich it'll smoke and smell.
If you change the fuel lines, diaphragms if you have them and tune it up
once a year they're perfectly safe with no ill odors.
Like I've said to several folks who contact me about buying a gas heater:
"If you don't work on your own rig and either pay someone else to fix it or
drive it 'til it drops, then a gas heater isn't your best choice."
Get the manuals and write-ups, take the time to perform the recommended
maintenance and drive through blizzards in short sleeve shirts!
