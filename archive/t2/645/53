Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Drain Plug hmmmm

It's nice to know that this hex-key drain plug is correct for my bus.  I
didn't want to force the issue - I just wasn't sure (now I am) that this was
the correct drain plug - hey sometimes POs and/or their mechanics put odd
thing in odd places just to get thing back together.  I've learned the hard
way, not to force things unless you're sure how it was put together and how
it's supposed to come apart.  

 

On my next oil change I will try using an 8mm hex-key/socket to get the
drain plug out - happily, mine is not stripped. just in there very tight.  

 

If there is a problem and I've got to take drastic measures to get the drain
plug out. can I replace my current drain plug with the more standard one
that uses a regular wrench?

 

Thanks again for all you help and input.
