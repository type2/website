No, the carb does not care whether the air is coming through the air
filter or the vent tube. You may have the rivet issue. Search archives
or library for this fix to your throttle plate.

 I have the same tube on my 71 bus but the tube is open to the atmosphere. 
 Could this be causing some of my rough idling when I try to start in 1st
 gear?  Is my carburetor getting too much air do you think?  My engine runs
 fine at idle but when I put it into gear it almost dies on me so I have to
 give it a LOT of gas to keep it from dying.  Other than that, it runs like a
 scalded dog!.
