this is just speculation, but the piece is kinda a fish mouth shape
that only opens when something goes through it one way (kinda like a
one way valve but not that perfect of a job). I suspect it keeps the
vacuum that is in the crankcase from sucking road muck and such into
the engine while providing a way for oil overflow to exit.
