Subject: [T2] Still no get up and go

Those of you who forgot what the issue was here...no power after 25mph or 
so.

It turns out that the camshaft lobe for #1 and 3 was no longer eggshaped, 
but rather round. This and a cracked head on that side.

John assumes this was due to an overheating issue he had on the way to a 
campout, due to a misconnected vacum hose. They fixed it at the campout, but 
apparently the damage was already done.

John is still in need of a good driver's side 2 litre head so he can get 
back on the road.

Any insight on how long it would take to wear down a cam lobe? John claims 
he kept regular mainanence on his valve adjustments, but to me a worn cam 
lobe seems like something that would take a long time to achieve. Any input 
may help John and others to avoid this in the future.

Thanks again for all the help!!
