Subject: RE: Back to my battery and starting

"Is your Westy an automatic or manual-trans model??"

It's a manual.

"is carried in a brass bushing"

I'm going to have to check that.

"your BMW battery seems to do a better job"

Yes, it starts the motor.

"it may be that the brushes are nearly worn out"

Based on a receipt found in the bus when I got it - the starter is only 3
years old - that is if they put in a new or quality rebuilt starter.

Many thanks for the help, especially the bushing lead!  Unfortunately, I
don't have a heated work space, so checking the bushing might wait 'til
spring.

Regards,
