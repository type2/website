Subject: Re: [T2] Official AIRS Update... Take 2

Hi Volks,

Thanks to all who replied. So far I have volunteers to review the 
following states:

Arizona, Arkansaw, Colorado, Florida,Georgia, Idaho, North Carolina, 
Nevada,Ohio,Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennesee, Virginia, 
Washington, Wisconsin ,and the provinces of  Ontario and Alberta.

There was also mention of expanding AIRS coverage into Europe, which I 
would be very proud to see happen.

I also got replies from four web designers who offered help and/or 
suggestions.

It has become apparent that this project requires the use of MySQL and 
PHP technologies. I am willing to learn the tech required to get the 
AIRS site to this new level of technology... but it certainly won't 
happen in a week. I think that spring 2005 is not an unreasonable 
deadline. In the meanwhile the existing airs list will have to suffice.

I am going to pull this project from the limelight and learn myself 
some programming techniques. If anyone has any suggestions, please 
p-mail. When I have the new database ready for testing, I'll be asking 
the volunteers to input the data and run some searches.


Happy trails,
