Custom VW car show and swap
264 E Broadway Road, Arizona
Hi everyone, its time for our annual car show and swap. We close off a
quarter mile of street for this show and it is usually huge! Its on the
14th....NOT the 7th as has been erroneously reported in the Mesa Tribune. We
have expanded the show to 26 car show categories and we need you guys and
gals to bring all your cars out. I have created 6 bus only categories to
hopefully lure the bus crowd out of hibernation........lets get motivated!
as well as more type 1 slots and all other classes as well. We have changed
the show entrance so that the truly low and the pristine can enter on
asphalt. The swap will be on 3rd avenue with overflow north on Pomeroy. We
will enter from 2cd ave and Pomeroy. Swap gates open at 6 and please try and
be nice......we cant fit your 10 place car carrier....or your motorhome so
dont ask.......trailers may be charged for 2 spaces. Its 20 bucks for a swap
space and 10 bucks for the car show. Please bring canned food for the needy
if possible.....but admission is free for spectators of course. We really
appreciate all the support we have received over the last several years and
hope to see all vw clubs attend and enjoy.
See ya
Tom Karls Mesa
