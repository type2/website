It is a one way valve. It's purpose is to vent blowby out of the
crankcase, but for the most part, the crankcase vent hose will be
sucking to create negative pressure inside the crankcase. The one-way
valve serves to seal that tube and enable vacuum to be created inside
the crankcase instead of sucking outside air into your carburetor
through the vent tube.

 On my '71 stock DP upright engine, there is a breather tube that goes from the
 top of the generator pedestal (next to the oil filler) downward through the
 tin to the underside of the engine. Originally there was a rubber thingy that
 slips over the bottom opening of this tube. Does anyone know purpose of this
 rubber piece and is it important?
