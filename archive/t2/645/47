Wayne,
	My '78 bus (which also had the original engine) had the same type of 
plug. Boy was it ever a bear. It too stripped out. I ended up taking an 
American 1/4 allen, filing it down a wee bit and hammering it into the 
hole until it was a very tight fit. I then stuck a cheater on it, and 
when it seemed all was hopeless, the sucker finally broke free.
	Boy was it ever a relief to get a hex head drain bolt on there.
