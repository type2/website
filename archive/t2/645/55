Subject: Re: [T2] Master cylinder....

I've just finished putting a rebuilt (Cardone) ATE master cylinder
in my Bus...New pads in the front, new shoes in the rear...When 
I went to bleed the brakes, I get a very soft pedal 'til about 1/2
way down to the floor...Tried the bleeding sequence again (right
rear, left rear, right front, left front...) no air but still a soft 
pedal and a check of the master cylinder shows leakage from
the pin-sized hole at the front bottom of the MC (below and be-
tween the 13 MM nuts that hold it to the servo) now before I
go nuts on this, is this "just" a bad MC or is there something else
I should check before ripping it out again and getting another
from my FLAPS (Tomorrow... ;-(
