I think some of the points Daniel make are valid but let me put my 2 cents 
in.
Microsoft and .Net hosting has become so competitve lately that you can host 
a quality site for what I feel is peanuts nowadays.

I am in no way affiliated with this company but it is who I use exclusively 
for my Microsoft hosting.

http://www.1planhost.com/hostingplan.asp

$8.25 a month with the ability to have 250 pop3 email accounts.
250 people that can have name(-at-)airslist.com if you so chose.

$35 a year extra to add a SQL database.

So your talking $134 a year to host a site.

14 people willing to donate $10 each will get your site running for a year.

Yeah sure you can code it in PHP or .jsp and use mySQL BUT you may just find 
more people willing to help you if you went the microsoft route.

Why?
With a lot of people thats all they work with , and the market for hosting 
is so competitve now that if your a hosting company and you dont host ASP or 
.NET applications your throwing business out the door and how many business 
owners do you know willing to do that.

I'm not jumping on the Microsoft band wagon at all but they are a company 
trying their hardest to make it so even a monkey (no offense Daniel) can 
even work with their products.

1planhost uses  HELM as their web interface.
One of the best currently being pushed (in my opinion) and used by hosting 
companies and another reason why I went with them.

Again a monkey (no offense to monkeys) can use it to get their web site up 
and running.

Anyways my point being, I don't think the technology that the site is 
created in should be a hindrence.

First find out who can help.
If all they know are Microsoft products then there are a ton of places out 
there willing to host.
I found around 40 good ones before I narrowed it down to 1planhost.

And I hate to say it but Microsoft isnt going anywhere anytime soon so 
you'll always find somebody willing to work on it.

OK I'll shut up now.

Hopefully the new site and list will be a lot more useful in the future.
Good luck

Kevin
