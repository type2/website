Subject: Back to my battery and starting

Sorry to rehash this topic.

 

I've got a '79 Westy, the battery in the bus (a NAPA group 41) won't turn
the bus motor over.  To make sure the problem wasn't ground related, I
cleaned the battery to body connection and the frame to transmission
connection - the ground wires look old but not bad.

 

As a test, I took my group 47 battery out of my old BMW (CCA 590) and hooked
it up to the bus with jumper cables.  It turns over the bus slowly and the
bus starts - this very same battery turns the 3.0 liter BMW motor very
quickly.  Some more background. the PO's mechanic R&R'ed the starter and
added an additional starter relay in 2001 - hopefully they did a reasonable
job and the starter is good.

 

So, why is my motor turning slowly?  Is that normal and do all bus motors
turn over slowly when starting?  Is there another electrical connection that
I should be looking at - i.e. positive wire (although it looks to be in good
shape - yes I know I'm only looking at the ends and some black insulation)?
Or maybe 590 CCA is just not enough for this 2 liter motor. this may be
true, I'm just having trouble getting that through my head when 590 CCA
turns over a 3.0 liter high compression BMW engine so quickly.

 

TIA
