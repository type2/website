Subject: RE: [T2] DEAD BUS*?$(-at-)! HELP

First of all, what is your name? Oohvwbus(-at-)aol.com?

Second tell us more about you bus. Specifically the engine. What is it?

When you say it died and then said that it had no power that sounds like it
started again?

Is the starter motor turning over ok (meaning the battery is cool)?
