If one is new to a list, it is not a good idea to start off by being
critical of other list members, no matter how accurate your criticism is.
Picture a newbie in a biker bar criticizing the personal hygiene habits
of the regulars!  It is much better to lurk for a while and develop
understanding the list culture before attempting to modify it.

For your information, vendors are welcome to contribute to the list and
advertising isn't forbidden either.  You probably read the prohibitions on
advertising ebay auctions and misinterpreted it.

You seem to have taken my post concerning criticism of other listees in a
very personal manner.  It was intended to be instructive for the general
audience, but if you feel it applies to you directly, so be it.

Our listees consider this list to be a very valuable resource.  It is
valuable because we work to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio.  Random
criticism, flaming, and "me too" posts increase the noise.  If someone
acts badly, we all know it, and we don't need you to point it out for
us.  If the offense is bad enough the admins will take care of it.

I'm sorry to hear that.  It would have been better if you had stuck around
long enough to figure out how the list culture works.  We're really quite
civilized here, care a lot about our buses and keeping them on the road,
and are quite helpful toward that end.  We're not fond of flamewars,
though, and nip them in the bud.

Perhaps you should hang around a bit more before you give up on the list!
