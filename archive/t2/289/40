the ecu should not have any effect on shifting or gas in oil.

check the presure to see if it is correct...  

only couple ways for gas to get into oil.

do all the cyl fire??  a cyl that is not working at all speeds could suck
gas into the oil 

this one has me scratching my head, as unlike the carb buses there is no
mechanical fuel pump,  so there really is no place where where gas could
get to the oil except at the cyl, 

how's compression????  
I would bet on bad rings somewhere and 1 cyl not firing
