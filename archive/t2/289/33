Subject: Re: [T2] re Full Flow filters for upright engine

Berg has an oil pressure relief oil pump cover
which limits pump output to 125 psi ( and returns
excess to the pump inlet ) for full-flow application.
This could also be 90 psi, depending on where you read it.
The minimal downside is that hot oil is recycled through
the pump until it is delivered to the filter.
