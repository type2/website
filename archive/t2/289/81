Folks, sometimes what we read into an email isn't what the writer
intended.  If you feel that a post was acrimonious it is time to take a
deep breath, relax, and give the writer the benefit of the doubt.
Personal counterattacks are not productive and only waste bandwidth.  It's
OK to attack ideas, but not the people who expouse them!

If an attack is particularly nasty be assured that the admins will be
handling it behind the scenes.  Like the CIA, if the admins do their job
well you won't hear much about it!  :)
