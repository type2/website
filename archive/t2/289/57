Subject: Clutch?

I just started noticing that my clutch was getting "longer" and that I was
getting a touch of
grind when I put the transmission into reverse. Not bad, just a little.

So I got under the bus to adjust the clutch (having nothing but Bentley and
Muir to guide me),
and I found I was "out of thread." In other words, it has been adjusted for
the last time, before
I got there.

Hmmmm. The engine is running well. No problems. Good compression. Good vacuum
seal
on the FI.... all is well. But I am about to lose the clutch.

Questions: How long can this go on driving normally? If you drop the engine,
should you go ahead
and do the rebuild then? Even if it is not in real need.... What say ye?

This is a 1975 1800, new engine some 12 years ago.
