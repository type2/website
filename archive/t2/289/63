Hi Everyone,

Thanks so much for answering my questions so quickly.

After reading everyone's advise, I think I need to take a deep breath and
start from the beginning.  Over this next week I am going to start with
some basics.

1. Listen to the engine :-).  I was afraid to turn it on when I got home. 
I'm over that now.
2. Compression check.
3. Check to see if there is any lose parts rattling around.
4. Remove the valve covers. Check it out.

I have a Bently manual and plan to do all the work myself.

I'll repost when once I get some "basic" information from the above steps.
 On a side note, I'm a Java programmer by trade and purchased the bus to
learn about cars.  My wife is a VW fanatic from birth and is also loving
the bus.  My kids (one is 5 the other 18 months) think "Bess the Bus" is
COOL.  So......  She will run again!  I will fix her and be my own best
mechanic in the process.

Thanks everyone, I'll post with some more info once I get the above steps
done this week.

One last note, I purchased a 1500lb capacity motorcycle jack from Kragen
Auto parts for $59.  The profile on it is an amazing 4.5 inches and will
raise to 4 feet.  I built a platform for the top of it out of 1 inch
plywood and it will hold the engine, no problem (at least in theory,
haven't pulled it yet :-))

Thanks!
Don Manzano
"Bess the Bus" <--- will ride again real soon!
