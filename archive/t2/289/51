Subject: Re: [T2] re Full Flow filters for upright engine

I may be missing something here, but I didn't know any air cooled VW had oil
pressures above ~50psi, even when cold??
I have used el-cheapo full flow filters on my beetle (I fitted an oil filter
unit which replaces the oil pump) with no problem, and now use the same Mann
filter I have for the bus (2L type 4), again with no problem.
I do know there are some full flow oil filter with a built in bypass for
pressure spikes.
