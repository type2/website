Subject: Door mirror restoration

I have a 20+ year old door mirror which needs restoration.  The silver
backing is flaking off in many places.  Does anyone know if new glass
can be mounted in the original mirror frame?  Or does one completely
replace the entire fixture to restore the mirror?  Thank you in advance.
