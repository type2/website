If you've been running with bad brushes the commutator is now shot.
Replace the whole generator or take the armature out and get the
commutator turned.

Keep a spare regulator around.  It makes troubleshooting much easier.

No.

Unlikely.

If this is a type 1 engine, you might consider changing to an alternator.
It is almost as easy as changing the generator and eliminates lots of
problems.
