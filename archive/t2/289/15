I guess this is a hard question concerning the ecu working properly. The
bus runs very good and the only problems are the gas in the oil and the
transmission shifting from 2nd to 3rd gear. Hopefully the pressure
regulator will fix the gas problem and I guess the only way to see if the
ecu is affecting anything is to replace with the 022 906 021 ah. Does
anyone have a extra AH ecu they would consider selling.Thanks for your
answers and advice.

Hi Everyone,
     I am still working on the fuel in oil problem. I have found that the
pressure regulator is bad and I have replaced it. I don't know if this
fixed the problem or not. While checking and testing I found that the ecu
is for a manual transmission, mine is an automatic, part # 022 906 021
AH. The ecu in the bus is part # 022 906 021 AG. Will this ecu work in
the automatic and if not does anyone have an AH ecu for sale.

        Thanks
