Yeah - they'll have what you need.

FWIW:

Safety glass comes in two versions: the kind that has two layers of glass 
with a layer of plastic in between. This is commonly found in front an rear 
windows (windshield and back window). The other type is tempered glass.

The first type shatters but remains intact thanks to the plastic layer in 
the middle.

The second version (found in all of the VW side windows) shatters and will 
crumble but the pieces aren't sharp like a broken window in you house or a 
broken glass bottle.

Go to the glass shop and take your measurements. Tell them you want clear 
tempered glass. What they will do is order it from their source. The source 
will cut it and then run it through a tempering oven as you can't cut 
tempered glass.

Then they will ship it to the shop where you bought it.

We have commercial 3 glass shops in Cookeville in addition to the half 
dozen hardware stores that will cut plain glass.

When I replaced the glass in my '78 Westy I found that one shop was cheaper 
but they could not supply the jalouise window glass because it was too 
narrow (???). So I bought the two big rear side windows from them and the 
jalouise panes from the other shop and saved $20.

By the way my replacement glass was tinted a nice smoky grey - the tinting 
is IN the glass vs on the glass like the tinting film. I will have to have 
the rear and cab door windows tinted with film if I want them to match - 
all be tinted.
