Subject: Re: [T2] How do the retractable belts work in an accident??

Here's a great site to find out how anything works:  howstuffworks.com.
In particular:

http://www.howstuffworks.com/seatbelt3.htm

It's all about acceleration.  Only rapid acceleration/deceleration causes
the seatbelt mechanism to catch the ratcheting spool.  When traveling at
constant speed or at standstill, the ratchet doesn't catch.
