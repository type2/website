The vacuum advance works by a hose connected to the throttle body.  When
the throttle is cracked open, it induces a vacuum in the line and
advances the timing.  Since most of the time you are cracking the
throttle open when you're starting to move forward, you are able to
advance the timing before the engine has spun up, and advancing an
engine's timing in addition to giving it more gas/air helps it speed
up.  With mechanical advance, it uses the engine speed to advance the
timing, which obviously only works when the engine has started spinning
fast (which isn't the case when you're moving from a stop).  The vacuum
advance has no effects at throttle deflections other than when the
throttle is cracked open.

The funny thing about the whole subject is the fact that the 050 *IS* an
009 with an added feature.  If you want to run as an 009, just
disconnect the vacuum hose and your running just like an 009.  Want the
050 back, hook the hose back up.  Now, their might be some weighting
differences between the two models for the centrifugal (mechanical)
advance, but I'll leave that for the techies.

When I bought my bus, the PO had the wrong dizzy and I noticed the
performance difference right away.  It just didn't have the same oooomf
that my other two 76 buses had.  Luckily he had the correct dizzy for
the 78, I rebuilt it, dropped it in, and it ran alot better.
