Most of what I have to say pertains to encouragement & advice, only a
little will help right now for troubleshooting. First off the FI
system on a bus is fantastic (when in good shape) & will give many
years of good service. One thing to know about it is that no amount of
"tinkering" will get it running well. Sure, you might get lucky, but I
sure don't have that luck. The Bentley has a fantastic troubleshooting
section just for FI. The only diagnostic tools you need are a
volt-ohm-meter, vacuum gauge & FI pressure gauge. Just follow the
instructions & don't skip a step. it will just cost you in the long
run.

Enought preaching. on to my feeble suggestions. One, have you checked
the temp sensor II? this little $20 part causes all sorts of havoc on
the fi system, & it's easy to replace also. Might want to give it a
shot. 

How does it act when in neutral or park? I sorta wonder how your
timing is. If the problem was just w/ it in gear & not a horrible loss
of power mabey, but I also sounds like a vacuum leak. I would suggest
putting a vacuum gauge on the engine, record it. Double-check your
timing, record it. Get the part # off the distributor, record it. Then
report back to the list. This might help get the ball rolling on your
gremlins.
