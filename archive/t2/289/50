Subject: How important is it...

I'm rebuilding the carbs on my 73 bus, and came across what I think is a
part left over from when it was a California bus, and had lots of pollution
controls... (All of which were removed by the previous owner at some point)
Anyhow, the part apparantly has two names, one from the Bentley manual,
"Idle mixture enrichment" and another from the diagram that came with the
rebuild kit, Thermo cutoff valve. The problem is that it's obviously broken
and I'm wondering if I need to worry about replacing it. Any help is
appreciated.
Thanks!
