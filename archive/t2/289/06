That would be the _front_ tin!  Front is front!  :)

If you can't find this rather rare piece of tin ('71-only) you can
manufacture your own from the similar piece from a doghouse Bug.  You need
to add a piece of sheet metal to the bug tin to match the shape of the bus
firewall opening.  That is exactly how VW did it!
