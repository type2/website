Well - it's all about what you like. Some Beetle drivers report a flat spot 
in the engine acceleration right off idle. I did not have this problem with 
my Beetle.

Another item is that the 009 is built with #3 cylinder retarded so that #3 
won't get as hot. This is only a problem with the Beetle motors where 33 is 
downstream of the oil cooler and runs hotter than the other cylinders. 050 
does not have any cylinders retarded so that theoretically you make more 
power from all of the cylinders including #3.

I won't even get into timing advance for mechanical vs. vacuum advance 
distributors BUT I'm told the vacuum advance distributors automatically 
adjust for the load on the engine and will help control ping. If you can 
drive your engine and not hear ping and you are satisfied with the 
longevity of your engine then drive it and be happy. You can't hear all 
ping, you've just got to feel sure that all is well.

I've used the vacuum advance distributors and like them. They are smooth 
and the engine seems happiest (coolest). I've also used the 009 and the 050 
on my Type IV and Type I engines and liked them as well. My 40HP 1200cc 
Beetle loved the 009 dist. Consistently gave me no trouble, top MPG and 
then some, and the power DID seem (SEEM) to be a bit better. I would 
describe it as more EAGER with the 009 versus the vacuum dist. I doubt 
there was much more than .00057 more HP as a result of the 009.

I'll probably stick with the vacuum advance dists. on my "heavy" VW's and 
the mechanical advance 050 on my Type IV powered Beetle. I don't "do" Type 
I engines.

Study up on it - aircooled.net has a great article on it I believe - and 
make your own decision.
