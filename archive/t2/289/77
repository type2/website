Subject: 78 guy with noise

Hello all,

Another suggestion for the noise guy:

If you can mistake hat everyone seems to think is
valve noise for rod noise, you might mistake CV joint
noise or wheel bearing noise for engine noise. If you
haven't surely determined that the noise is coming
from the engine, or if it disappears when the wheels
aren't moving, might check those too.

As for expense, you are, like me, bound by *necessity*
to fix your own van. You can't afford an expensive
mechanic diagnosing or repairing your problem. So
trust yourself, get out there with notebook in hand,
and figure out where that noise is issuing from. Use a
metal rod held near your ear and find out whether the
noise issues from the case or the heads, then you'll
have a better idea how to proceed. 

That said, the motor you have is comparitively
difficult to drop. Those guys who say it only takes 15
minutes are talking about the upright motors. So be
sure before you go pulling it. 

The only thing you can't afford is if a rod is
actually knocking. That'll require a complete rebuild.
I had a buddy who bought an entire shortblock for
about $800, plus shipping in the range of $150.
