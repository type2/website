get the Bentley book the Muir book is mostly based on the upright engine,
you have a type IV pancake engine.

?? BTDT, blown valve seats cause much worse problems but one way to check
valve seat is to pull the valve covers, take off the rocker assembly and
see if any off the valve ends stick up further than the others, (top
center of the spring assembly)

new heads would include new valve seats and usually new or replaced valves
and guides.   so I would suspect you got new valve assemblies.  (wow, I
paid about $2,500 to have my engine completely rebuilt by a known skilled
craftsman, of course I pulled and stripped the engine and replaced it
myself)

I would reccomend you spend about $250 of that money on some decent tools,
jack and jack stands and a Bentley manual, you can get decent heads for
under $200

you always need more money than you have ;8*{

sure doesn't sound like a head problem to me, but I have been wrong
before.   how many miles on this engine??

like another poster said, I would check other things first, heck if the
engine is running can you go to the back and hear where the noise is
coming from??

where are you located?

good luck
