Subject: 009 not good for my bus?

Ok, got the message from some of you guys, that the 009 distributor is not a 
good one for my van. I have had this discussion before with my V-dub buddy, 
Brian. He told me I would be better off with the 050.

I will certainly look into the 050, but I really must admit, I like the way 
the 009 has run in my bus. I have been running it for about 6 years, on the 
same engine, with about 45,000 miles in, two trips to Canada, one to Cali 
from Virginia, and another back out to Colorado. It has worked very well. 
Highway cruising at 80+ no problem, good acceleration from stop and in the 
mid range, and no missing at highway speed. I pulled the engine last week so 
I can check everything out while I do the bodywork, and; moreover, to clean 
up the engine compartment. I have 120, 117, 120, 115 for compression, 115 on 
#3.

I am not doubting any comments that were made in reference to the 009. 
Compared to many of you, I am a novice at best, and at 25, I don't have the 
experience that many of you do.

What is negative about the 009 in a type IV application?

Thanks for your help, I appreciate any comments, good or bad.
