Subject: Head temp sender kit by VDO

Good day again guys,
I just got my VDO head temp sender kit! (still available at
www.cip1.com)
3 questions, if i may take some of your precious time:

-The sender/washer by itself is thinner than the original compression
spark plug washer, should i keep the spark plug washer and use both or
remove the original spark plug compression washer? (i feel that i should
use both!)

-It look to me that the average head temp (70-80Fdeg) on a T4 engine
(1700cc in my case) should be between 300 and 375F? Is that right?

-Should i put this one on the #3 cylinder, why not # 4 !!! If the
thermostat flap is deffective i think that the #4 would be affected
first (on a T4 of course). Or even the #1 and #2!!! If the flap stays
close on this side (you never know!) they have less cool air than the #3
and #4!!! (#2 & #4 always have a minimum amount of air as the flat never
close completely)

Best regards, Ben
