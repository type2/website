This is an off-list note to you, Don.    After sending my first post an 
hour ago, I had some more thoughts......mainly in the direction of using 
your $450 to buy parts/machine shop services for fixing the dropped valve 
seat, if indeed that is the case.

Ifyou can bite the bullet of fear and uncertainty about doing your own 
engine work to get the heads off and to a machine shop, you could probably 
get the job done within budget. Almost everyone on the list has ended up 
becoming their own best mechanic, for the same reasons you are facing.

You can probably rise to the occasion, or at least try, and find out if 
owning a bus is something you can do, on the budget you have. If you find 
out you can't do it, you will be dollars ahead and in the same place you 
started......owning a bus that can't provide transportation. And you can 
move on to selling it, or storing it until you can hire someone else to fix it.

I'm trying to be encouraging.  I just spent 3 years between getting my 
engine out, rebuilt, and back in and running again. I think it would have 
been better to do all the work myself rather than the way I did 
it.....hiring someone to drop the engine, another person to rebuild it, and 
a third party to put it back together. Continuity was lost in the process, 
and things got forgotten and overlooked and had to be discovered and 
redone, etc.   Probably cost me $4,000 but I didn't add it up. I could have 
probably sold the bus at the beginning for $2,500 and be $6,500 richer 
today.......which would be a great down-payment on a restored bus.

If I could do it over, I'd have sold the bus or done it myself. Either 
action would have been more efficient and effective than stumbling along 
hiring expensive others.

Hope you find a better path.
