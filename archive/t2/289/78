sounds like your bus is running hot, just
like you stated. that can cause the
issues you are describing.

have you been doing the 'Muir dipstick test'
to see if you're running hot? (i'm assuming
you don't have any temp guages since
that wasn't mentioned)

my next guess would be is it getting enough fuel?

good luck,
