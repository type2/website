Subject: Jalousie window overhaul kits?

Does someone make Jalousie window overhaul kits? My windows need new seals
and the widows flutter at highway speeds. The looseness in the mechanism
seems to be coming from the gearbox. Can I get a replacement gearbox? I see
that it appears to be permanently riveted in.
