Subject: re Full Flow filters for upright engine

I am having an engine built on nearly new Mexican cases. I'm getting it
drilled and tapped for full flow. I have read in the archives that people
have used Fram HP1 filters for this, since a normal filter will explode at
the 300psi pre-pressure relief valve pressures here. I am wondering if the
stock Mann VW filter can take this pressure, or are there any other choices?
I prefer the Mann but I'll settle for Fram HP1 if it is the only choice...
Also, are these filters hard to find and expensive, or available at my local
Wally World?
