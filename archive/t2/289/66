Allow me to suggest the following order of operations--
1. Check for anything obviously loose, armatures etc. If you have a 
screen on your fan, check that
2. Check belts and pulleys (you might even take a big adjustable wrench 
and turn the engine over by hand a few times)
3. Check oil
4. Start engine

I always have to remind myself to live by this rule of diagnostics--

Always Rule Out Easy-and-Cheap-to-Fix Causes Before Attempting Major Work

Otherwise I have a tendency to rebuild a carburetor when the cause is a 
cracked vacuum line or pull apart a wheel assembly when the cause is a 
rock wedged in the tire tread.

On the other hand, by following the rule Always Assume the Worst I have 
quickly amassed a surprising collection of tools and parts :-)
