Subject: Re: [T2] gas heater ducting

Jason, if you want to duct it like the dealerships did, you will have to cut
the gas tank cover and run your duct beside the gas tank.  There is about 2
1/2" beside the tank for the duct.  I have seen both metal and dryer vent
ducts beside the gas tank.  Of course the dryer vent ones were a bit out of
round.
