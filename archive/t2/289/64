Please, someone hold me back!

It's so easy even a girl can do it. Wow! I should forward this to my
girlfriend.

What is this about $150 for all the books and tools you'll ever need. First
don't waist $60.00 of your precious $150.00 on the 3 (most important) basic
test tools - "multimeter ($15), dwell meter ($20), a timing light ($25)".
This after the Bentley manual ($34.95) leaves you $55.05 before tax for hmmm
maybe a cheap set of sockets.

Please don't set this guy off on the wrong track. A decent set of basic
tools to attempt this sort of job is more along the bal park of $500-$700.
That's Craftsman too.

A couple hours to pull the motor and slap it back? I would love to see that
done by a first timer or even a pro for that matter. Yes that is what we
charge for a labor rate to pull and reinstall but it always takes way
longer. A beginner needs to set aside a whole day and a helping hand for
each of the tasks. Aside from problems that is.
