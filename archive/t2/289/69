Subject: RE: [T2] Need a piston for 2.0 

Michael,

Unless you don't care about this motor I would recommend a new piston and
cylinder set. Chances are that the cylinder walls are scored or scuffed. I
would inspect the rest of the cylinders for ware and make the call. Just
replacing the piston might fix the low compression but it wont make it
correct.
