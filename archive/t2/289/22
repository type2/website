Subject: Revisiting The Great Hubcap Pass

I was looking for the website today about The Great Hubcap Pass and finally
found it and saw a name error on the picture captions.  I tried sending
corrections to hubcap(-at-)type2.com, the provided address but it bounced back.  If
anyone out there can/wants to make the corrections, I've listed them below.
Sorry to the people I was passing it with, but I've forgotten your names.

On page http://www.type2.com/~chuff/photos6.htm, the names are incorrect.
Picture #2 is where I dropped off the hubcap in December I think.  I'm the
blond girl in the pictures, Dallas Smith.  I forget the guy's name but it was
in Raleigh, NC.
Picture #3 is where I picked up the hubcap in January I think.  It was north
of Chapel Hill, NC.

I forget the year but I think it was 1998 or 99.
