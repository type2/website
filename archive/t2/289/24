If I was you,, I would check the engine/trans ground strap.. 
The ground is common to both your problems,, and if it isn't any good, your
starter will act up, and so will your charging,,,, and maybe your ignition,, but
as it draws significantly less than the starter the ignition may be getting
enough through the ground to allow it to run.

It is easy enough to prove, use your battery jumper cables temporarily between
the battery neg and the engine case then test again.
