Subject: a formal apology to Chris and the list

Chris,

I am sorry that my message came across as sarcasm. Yes, I was a little upset
with the post however I surely should not have offended you or anyone else
for that matter.

Here is a better explanation of my concerns.

I too would support a do it yourself bus owner. Are not we all? The whole
reason why I am in business today is because of my quest for cheap parts and
bits of knowledge to help me get my junker on the road again and away from
the city tow yard.

I guess what I am saying is that yes go for it do what you can and if you
have the list you are far better off than I was and others like Chris but,
you have the list and I, like Chris and everyone else, we are the list. So
let it be said. I say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Take
a few steps back and move forward slowly. Be sure of your task before you.
But  I can do that better than the way I did. Sorry Chris. Need a part give
me a call it's on me!

Working way to late-
