Interesting- it seems when I had problems before I just jiggled the ground
strap, and battery and it would start. I ensured good connections on the
battery - but if the ground strap is not totally in tact that might be it.
When you say "use your battery jumper cables temporarily between the battery
neg and the engine case then test again." Do you mean, disconnect ground
strap, connect the cables, then try to start or are you referring to using a
volt meter?
