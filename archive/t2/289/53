Don:

I sure as heck wouldn't drop the engine until I had a fairly good idea what
the problem - if any - actually is.  No power loss, no smoke, no oil
issues... offhand, this doesn't sound like an "internal" engine problem,
though, of course, it could be.  Open up the engine compartment, start up
the engine, and go back a listen to the engine.  Run the engine (gently) up
in RPM's and listen some more.  A rod knock has a "deep" clunking sound that
certainly will vary in tempo as the RPM's change.  If there *is* an
"internal" noise, try and generally locate it by moving your head around in
the engine compartment and determining where it's the loudest.  If it seems
to be coming from one of the heads, then check the valve adjustment on that
side.

If the PO put new heads in that should have cured any "sunken" or "moving"
seats at that time, though this kind of condition could develop again.

If you don't feel confident in your mechanical abilities and if you don't
have enough "auto mechanic" experience and knowledge, this might be a good
time to use some of your cache of cash and take the bus in to an experienced
VW shop for diagnosis.  If you *do* have a fairly major internal problem
(e.g., rod knock) then you can blow right by the $450 mark in a minute and
still not have a running engine.
