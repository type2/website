Morning all,
I am planning to install the correct exhaust on my 79 bus.  =20
My question is is it easier to connect the crossover pipe to the cat to t=
he muffler etc. and then bolt the whole thing to the heater boxes?
Or is it easier to connect the crossover pipe to the heater boxes and the=
n the cat to the crossover pipe etc.?
Hope You enjoyed the weekend,
Peace,
Kyle
