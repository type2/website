Hi,

I can't help with the transport except to say that more than one rack 
has been transported on a Greyhound bus. As for scratching do not 
worry about it.  For the feet in the rain gutter  simply slit some 
fuel like and make socks for the feet. The clamps can be dipped in 
tool dip to rubberize the ends and eliminate scratches. Also not that 
baywindow racks are about an inch wider at the feet than splitty 
racks.

Thanks
