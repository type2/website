Jupiter is a "house brand" tire made (I think) by Hercules.  You will also
find the same tires under the "Merit" brand.

They seem to work OK.  I had a set in passenger load range before I knew
better and they didn't exhibit any nasty defects.  They also make tires in
load ranges C and D, but oddly enough the C and D tires aren't M+S rated
even though the passenger load range in exactly the same tread pattern is.
Very strange.  Of course, it is rather hard to find any M+S rated 185R14
load range C or D tire in the US.
