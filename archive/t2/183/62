profuel is the brand of aftermarket fuel pressure regulator often sold 
with the aftermarket electronic fuel pumps for carburators.  Sounds like 
the lines may have been running close to heat sources that rotted them 
out.  With the mechanical pump in place this highly suggests that it was 
added on.
