Subject: Broke down.....CV probs?

hey class...thanks for all the responses and 
help u've passed our way to get us back out on 
the road. i definately have some things to run 
with now. 
i do have a truck and flatbed trailer lined up 
to bring the 'rainbow wagon' home tommorow 
morning. so it looks like i won't have to be 
doin a roadside cv job. which...after pullin and 
puttin the engine back in, on the side of the 
road, my back is thankin me for. 
now i get to bring her HOME, and work on her in 
the shop:) wahhhooo...and it don't sound like 
it's my tranny!!!! thats a relief!!
but i'll definately be reporting back on what i 
find out with the observations of the CVs and 
all the other checks i was adviced to look into.

i just recently, before installing my new 
engine, inspected and repacked my CVs. so it's a 
task i've tackled before. not sure where i went 
wrong tho, if they've already gave out.?.? 
i also was having troubles, hearing noises,with 
my passenger side rear wheel at the beginning of 
our trip. that ended up goin away. so i have a 
good idea of where to start lookin. 
i'll post back up, after we get her home 
tommorow. thanks again for all the love and 
positive energy everyone has sent to us. a 
gr8ful peace out to u and yours, 
*shine on* -Chris
