Subject: Re: [T2] Rubber steps for 70 front bumper


I experienced the same problem after I painted the bumper on my single cab, I
was able to get the pads most of the way, but not all the way, on.  The rubber
seemed to be too stiff to pop into the holes in the bumper.

I've had other projects to tackle and have left the pads as they are, they don't
seem to be in danger of coming off.

I have a possible solution, at least worth a try before you spring for new
pads.  I'm going to give it a try when I get a chance.  When I was redoing the
interior on my old Adventurewagen, the black plastic/vinyl beading trim had
shrunk and gotten very hard.  Because it was also covered with white paint from
a P.O.'s whitewash of the interior, I decided to soak the trim in acetone.  In
addition to removing the paint, the acetone also caused the trim to become very
flexible and expand.  Once the acetone the evaporated, the trim shrunk back down
to normal size and harden back up, but I was able to reuse some of it by
installing it while it was still soft.

I'm sure this is very harsh on the rubber and doesn't increase it's life span,
but it you're going to replace it anyway.....
