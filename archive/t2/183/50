Subject: Re: [T2] Rubber steps for 70 front bumper

Hiya Tom,

New rubber step pads are in order.  The old ones (probably after 32 years 
now) have weathered to a hardness something on the order of diamonds.  When I 
took mine off (I did my bumpers last year) they were as tough and hard as a 
rock.  Got the new bumper pads from West Coast Metric and they fit like a 
glove.  Go new (yeah, they're a bit spendy) and you won't regret it.

ps.  If you go through the 68 and up Parts for Sale - pictures category over 
at the Samba you can pick up the white bumper gaskets which go between the 
left and right step sections and the main front bumper.  They're NOS and 
$25.00 a pair.  Available nowhere else as far as I know.
