Hello List,

In my automotive class, my instructor will not let a
car leave the garage that has had the wheels removed
without the lug nuts being set to 80 ft/lbs torque.
This is especially true with aluminum wheels when
using an impact wrench. The lug nuts will actually
bind against the wheel before the wheel is seated in
place. I have seen this first hand. After using an
impact wrench to put the nuts back on an aluminum
wheel, I torqued it. I turned each nut several more
turns with the torque wrench before I reached 75-80
ft/lbs. I imagine that the same thing could happen to
a power coated wheel. I make a habit to torque each
nut once in a star pattern and then again going in a
circle pattern. It doesn't take hardly any time but it
is time well spent. 

Have a great day!
