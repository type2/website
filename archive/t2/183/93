Subject: Re: [T2] Lugless engine into Bus

> Hi all, I was wondering if there is some way to put one of these engines without the mounting lugs molded into its rear into the bus.  I have managed to get not one but two rebuilt examples of these. I put one in there and it wasn't until I grabbed the cross member to install it that I realized what I'd done.  Boy is that ever a heartbreaker, it fit right in there just right too.  I think maybe if I get the mounting pieces from whatever VW this came out of and chop them up then maybe I can weld soemthing together to make it all work.  Glen Ward

Do you mean the rear carrier mounts.
There is a bracket that fits over the oil cooler bolts and one case bolt
to adapt it.
not ideal but it works.
