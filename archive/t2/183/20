Subject: 79 west wind noise

Hi all,

I've checked the library and archive and I can't seem to find info on a
jarring rattling noise that comes from my '79 westy at high speeds, and
especially when driving into a stiff wind. At times it sounds like my whole
dash is vibrating but I disassembled everything on the inside, and isolated
the sound to either the front window seal, or the fiberglass top. Does
anyone have any information on where the noise might come from, and what I
can do to get rid of it?

Many thanks
