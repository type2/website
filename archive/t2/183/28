Ok, so I went to fix this gas leak under my bus.  It was leaking from =
what appeared to be a pressure regulator.  I have not seen any mention =
of this in the bentley bible.  Anyways, it says "profuel" on it and has =
I believe four different settings.  I could not pay that much attention, =
because I was taking a gasoline bath trying to fix this damn leak.  The =
gas lines to this thing were pretty bad.  My question is this...is this =
a stock item for a 73 bus and is it needed? =20
