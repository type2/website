I need some help from the M-Code experts out there ...

I have already checked out Vincent's list, but cannot identify these
codes:
586, 774, 793, EK2

EK2 is not even listed on Vincent's page and may be a collection of
other codes. Here are some goodies my Camper has that are not accounted
for by the other codes:
Fresh air blower in cabin (would be 121)
Vent windows in rear side windows and sliding door (would be 508)
Padded dash (would be 511)
three point automatic belts in cabin and lap belts in passenger
compartment (could be 549)
tinted window glass green (would be 568)
I also have:
rear window defogger (tinted green window - I guess it is made out of
Unobtanium)
suspended seats made by Bremshey in front (the ones you find in
commercial trucks - but these go into the stock rails and are a factory
option according to Cord at Volksteile)

Can make anyone sense out of these codes and options?
