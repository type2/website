Subject: Whiny rear-end

I've got a loud whining sound coming from the rear of my '74. It's
gradually gotten worse and I assume it's a bearing of some sort - probably
a wheel bearing. I'm having trouble telling which side of the bus it's
coming from. The whining goes away when I go through left-handed turns at
speed. This would make me believe that it is the right (driver's side) rear
wheel bearing that is going. Any hints?

BTW, I went up to Cookeville to visit Chris Mills and bring him his
tachometer adapter. While looking at each others' busses I pointed out that
my fuel tank always leaked out the fill hole and that I couldn't find a gas
cap that fit right. We then looked at his bus and realized that someone
installed the outer ring of the fill neck UPSIDE-DOWN on my bus! That fix
alone was worth the 100 mile trip!
