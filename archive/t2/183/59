Subject: hoodathunk? brief swap stop

father's day brings the annual swap and show to springfield (oregon) german
auto. peridy small potatoes, but hey the vw circus was in town nonetheless.
and of course once again the show proved scale is relative: i brought home
a vdo 2/79 tachometer, full-size for the right side cluster. a buck. who
knows ~ maybe my next question is "can these be rebuilt?" horray for our
little town. k, father's day continues on, best to all  - steve
