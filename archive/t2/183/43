I would say it was somewhere between the transmission output plates and
the axle stubs.

Oh, there *is* a tranny, it is just not connected to the wheels!

Bring a pre-greased spare CV with you, an 8mm six-point allen and a
triple-square tool with you.  Also, a jack, a jack stand, good vice-grips
(JIC), a hammer, and the Sears external C-ring tool.  Oh... maybe a
puller, tho on a bay probably not. Should take 1/2 hour by the side of the
road, and you can drive it home.
