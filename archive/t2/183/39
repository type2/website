David, Chris, Everyone,

Like love, the dual circuit warning light is a many spendoured thing, and
many-propertied as well :-)  There are four different behaviours for this
light, depending on which year, model, and wiring harness you have.  Not
only can it be tied into the alternator, but the parking brake and the
oil pressure light as well!

As far as I know, these are the variants I know.  There may be others, and
the years and models are only appoximate:

On late 60s and early 70s bugs, the "B" light came on when:
 o you push it (light test)
 o the circuits of the brakes did not work in concert

On '68-?71? buses, the "B" light comes on when:
 o the key in the on position and the gen/alt is not putting out power
 o the circuits of the brakes did not work in concert

On '76-79 buses, the "B" light comes on when:
 o the parking brake is on and the igintion key is on
 o the circuits of the brakes did not work in concert

On '80-?83? vanagons, the "B" light comes on when:
 o the key in the on position and the gen/alt is not putting out power
 o the oil light is on (starting or low pressure)
 o the circuits of the brakes did not work in concert

It "always* comes on (usually as a quick flash) when you brakes are not
working correctly, but it may mean a variety of other things as well.

The alt light not going out 'til you rev the engine is very typical in
Vanagons and may be typical in replacement alternators.  It has someting
to do with having a high enough RPM to get a field going in the field coil
of the alternator.  Once the field is established, it will be sustained
even at idle, but the newer alternators seem to need a goose to get them
going.

David, I think you are fine.  Westy pokey, watch your oil pressure!
