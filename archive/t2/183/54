Dear Prudence ( just *had* to say that ! ) and Beth-
You might also check the plug on the AFM.
Either loose plug or defective pin connections.
Disconnect the AFM from the air filter box
and gently push a long screwdriver into it
from the air filter side to open the flapper,
the fuel pump will run. If it is sticking, there
is a warped flapper due to the backfiring.
