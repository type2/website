Probably too late, but there is a good VW place in Bishop.  Never had any
work done there, but the owner helped me out when I was in need of a tire
to get me to Reno.  It's called "Sierra German Auto" and it's on the north
side of town on the way to Mammoth, past the "Y".  There are a lot of bugs
and buses parked outside
