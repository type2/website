I pulled a gas heater (BN4 I think) out of my 71 westy and would like to =
raffle/donate it to the list.  Proceeds could either go to the list or =
to the Kristie Laurite fund.  I think it has all the parts, duct work =
and I would ship it to who ever wants it or send it to one of the =
gatherings for a raffle.  This was a factory installed unit and has the =
fire wall cut out with it.  Anyone interested
