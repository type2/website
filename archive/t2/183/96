Subject: HCBF 6 - T-shirt Orders

The High Country Bus Festival is rapidly approaching and so it the deadline 
for T-shirt orders.

There will not be extra shirts available at the festival - so if you want 
one, be sure to get your order in by the deadline. (July 1)

This year shirt is being designed by Jennifer Murphy,  a fabulous bus 
fanatic and artist from Boone.  Jennifer designed the artwork for the HCBF 2 
shirts.

Shirts are $15 each / you can pick them up from me at the festival.  If you 
are not going to be able to attend HCBF, please include $5 for shipping and 
handling.  Those shirts will be mailed out after the event.

order forms are available one of two ways:
1)  the HCBF webpage:
http://www.mindspring.com/~contecmidwest/page3.html

OR

2)  here is a PDF flyer you can print out w/ and order form on back:

thanks and see you all in July!
