The circuitry of the relay shown in that link is basically what is in 
the double relay fuel pump side with the exception of the timer 
circuit .  The timer circuit is probably in a control module.  If i am 
reading that circuit correctly what it is looking for is a changing 
state (ie the trigger of firing from the points) to keep the timer 
going.  If it goes to a constant state the 555 timer will have not 
trigger and shut off the pump.  One lead from the coil is supposed to go 
to the double relay.
