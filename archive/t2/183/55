or possibly, your backfire has caused the air flow meter to jam.....take
off the air cleaner. look into the opening and you will see a flap.  take
a pencil eraser and push this flap it should move smoothly..  also check
the plug behind the air flow meter to see that it is installed tightly.

no, but when you turn the key can you hear the double relay click, up on
the fire wall top left side in the engine compartment, has two big plugs
with wires on em plugged into the bottom

this really doesn't sound like job that needs to go to the shop and cost
big $$$$$ most likely something worked loose and just needs to be found,
cheap to fix probably expensive to find when paying by the hour
