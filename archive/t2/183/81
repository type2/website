Subject: Re: [T2] Guage Lighting

What I did was cut off the push-on end going to the last light on the
dash (I think it was heat control) and replaced it with a new one and an
extra wire crimped in.  Then I ran that wire to the new gauges.

Something else you can do is use one of the double male adapters on one
of the light connection to the dash and tap off of that.

Email me if this doesn't make sense.
