I read in the type 2 library ( http://www.dolphinsci.com/relay.html )that in
this relay the coil should be in the circuit. (Just applying 12V to the
trigger input is not enough. The circuit relies on the higher voltage pulse
that is generated by the coil when the points open.) could this be why I
have an empty male spade connector on my coil?
http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze3t2qs/bus/engine006.jpg  Or does that
only apply to the type IV motor that he's discussing?

I'm looking at the wiring diagram for 76 model Westy's in the Bently
manual... but can't seem to find exactly where in the diagram you are
talking about...

Now for the interesting part... just went out to my bus to trace those
wires...  Can't really tell if it's a red w/blue strip or red w/black
strip... (with a flashlight) the brown is definitely brown w/black strip,
both of these wires go out through the lower right corner of the firewall...
every wire in that group, (that's going through the hole in the firewall) is
butt connected ( I think that's what they're called... small tube, put one
wire in one end, one wire in the other end, crimp the wires in...)  SO if
they've all been replaced from the firewall on... what color they are
doesn't even matter right?  AND the black wire connected to that relay, goes
to the coil...

(THE GAME IS AFOOT!)
