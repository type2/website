The wires going to the relay that you identified as a newer vanagon
fuel pump relay look suspicously like the wires that should be on the
fuel pump control section of the double relay.. the only large red blue
wire i can find is the fuel pump pos lead.which is supposed to be
connected to the double relay. the only brown lead i can find in that
area is the ground for the double relay. Note that the double relay has
a couple of circuits inside of it that if they go bad you could
actually get a slow drain because it is leaving circuits active.  From
your year and type of engine i am sitting here with the wiring diagrams
and it is looking like somebody did a hack around the problem wiring
fix to something and has left you with the difficulty of trying to
figure it out.  Very possible that the fuel pump control side of the
double relay went bad.  my opinion without being able to get my hands
on it.
