Subject: Re: [T2] Rubber steps for 70 front bumper

Tom, 

I had the same problem on my 71. Someone suggested using a hair dryer to heat 
them back up and put them on. I actually left them lying out on a really hot 
day and it did the same thing. Although it still wasn't easy to put them on, 
it worked much better. 
I also used a rudder mallet to knock in the tabs in the slots and holes. It 
really helped. Also keep in mind they side on from the back forward, so that 
the inside of the rubber step rides along the edge of the bumper itself and 
fits snugly. I missed this the first time, but it made it easier when I 
caught what was going on.
