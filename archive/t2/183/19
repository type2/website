From what I can see in the pic, that flat spot is where the real engine number
is stamped on a 2.0L case. But it should start with GD or GE.
On 1700 and some 1800's the number is stamped on top of the case at the center
next to the spilt seam. They start with AW or ED.
Usually a stamped in set of numbers with no letters is done by a machine shop
to keep track of the engine with the work or repair order. The number will be
the R.O. number or the date. In your case, it may be the date, Oct 10, 1992.
