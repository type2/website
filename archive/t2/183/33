I hear this all the time and it saddens me.  Buses were made for road
trips!  If your bus is in good shape it is far less likely to give you
problems on the road than it is around town!  If you drive sensibly (keep
speeds under 60, take your time on hills) you will not be stressing your
bus as much as you do on the way to the supermarket.

Print out the AIRS folks for your route and hit the road.  Scenery is more
scenic through a bus windshield, and you can see over all those folks in
their sausage cars.
