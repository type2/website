Considering that VW doesn't make generators (and if they did these days,
they'd be watercooled), your best bet is a Honda.  They make _very_ nice
small generators.  I have a 20-year-old EM-500 that still starts on the
first pull after sitting for months.  You won't find a quieter generator,
and the capacities of the new models is double that of my old one.  Spend
a few more dollars for a Honda and you'll be happy for a long time (as
will your campground neighbors)

BTW, the quality of Honda generators has caused some unscrupulous
manufacturers to use Honda industrial engines in their own generators,
with the "Honda" name prominently shown.  These are not the generators you
want as the Honda-made generators are an integrated unit designed
specifically for making electricity.
