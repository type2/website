Subject: brake question

Listees, 

OK, this morning I ventured out and decided to try to replace my brake lines 
in my 71 and remove my calipers myself. The old lines really were in bad 
shape, dry, cracked and in some cases looks like it was almost clean through. 
I also have to remove the calipers and have them rebuilt. After the line was 
off, the caliper didn't free at all so I know it really need some work. 

 I have two questions:

First, when I removed the brake line, no fluid came out. OK, maybe like a 
drop, but that's it. Shouldn't there have been more fluid in the line? Is 
that an indication of something else, or normal for lines in that bad of 
shape? 

Secondly, I can't get my darn calipers off! The retaining pins seem to be in 
there for good! I put rust penetrating oil on it and let it sit overnight 
last night, but no avail. Any ideas? 

This is the furthest I have ventured on brakes. I replaced the pads before, 
but this is all new to me!

Thanks All!
