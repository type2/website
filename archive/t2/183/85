That repair guy lost the spring washer for the steering wheel nut!

Anyway, I took the steering wheel apart (sounds funny) to reveal all the
components of the horn and cleaned everything.  I'm still getting some blue
arcs when I press the horn and thye seem to follow the contour of the brass
ring that is set into this piece:

I also noticed some discoloration here in on the plate that contacts the
brass ring.

It seems when the plate is depressed everything makes contact in this
assembly so I can't see what could be shorting out.
