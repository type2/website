Subject: Re: [T2] What's this Ink Stamping?

I have seen reconditioned engines with very similar markings.  This may 
reflect the date of  placing back into service.  I cant see that spot on 
my engine but right above there is where VW put the stickers specifying 
the recondition type and status.  another sticker stated date was 
stamped on case but not where.
