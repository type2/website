Icould look on the web for a couple hours or I could walk out to the 
garage and get the catalog...

Bugpack 4538 Rear mount adapter.  Unique adapter allows the installation 
of all VW engines (except 36 hp) in 68 and later VWs where rear mounting 
is required.  Uses oil pump installation studs and lower case through 
bolt. etc, etc, etc.

 From Catalog #20  List price $13.30 in 1996.
