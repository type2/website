Subject: That little "D" shaped shim on the alternator shaft...

First off, thanks for all the advice on my first brake job. Replaced my 
stripped drum and put on some new shoes and hardware -- goes and stops now, 
just the way she's supposed to.

Anyways, I've got a situtation now with my alternator pulley. No matter what 
I do, the pulley ends up riding against the alternator housing and has cut a 
nice deep circular gash into it. The little "D" shaped shim is still in the 
groove on the shaft, but it seems to have worn down a bit since I last 
looked. Anybody know where to find a replacement or have a home-grown fix 
for this? I've looked everywhere online and haven't found one yet.

Thanks...

Sean,
