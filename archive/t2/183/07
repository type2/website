AND then there is the other side of the coin, don't pull em down TOO
tight.  Here in Baltimore our local transit system has been having a
problem with the rear wheels falling off the busses, 18 so far.  seems
they set the air presure up too high and the guns were torqueing the
wheels on to the hub at over 200ft/lbs.   the lug nuts were snapping off.!

or as Doc Tim would say

USEeth thy torque wrench to the DM spec
