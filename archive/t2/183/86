David,
That diagram that I put together showed how to use a fuel pump relay from a 
Rabbit or Audi as a safety circuit when installing an electric pump into a 
vehicle that used to have a mechanical pump.  In looking at the diagram for 
your year bus, the relays are quite different.  In your circuit, the signal 
from the points closing goes directly to the electronic control unit which 
in turn has a hand in the control of the fuel pump relay.

In my Bentley, I am looking in diagram I page 5 of 5.  The double relay is 
marked J40 and it looks like the heavy black wire you are talking about is 
on terminal 86c of the relay

If you look at the diagram in the Bentley (diagram I page 5 of 5), the 
wires will be identified with color and wire size.

Now that we are in the neighborhood, I have a question for you.
This circuit that you have identified as causing the current drain, should 
NOT be hot with the key switch OFF.  Have you checked terminal 15 on your 
ignition switch to verify that it turns off when the key is off?  If the 
voltmeter says that it's still hot, then remove the wire from that terminal 
and test again.  If still hot, bad switch, if it goes cold, then you have 
an "extra" wire somewhere providing the feed.

Let me know what happens,

Scott
