A 1.7L head does not fit the 1.8L bore
unless it is machined. In addition to a
difference in the valve sizes, it also has
a variation in combustion chamber shape
and volume, effecting a different compression
ratio. Unless both heads match, there is a
lot of unnecessary stress directed through the
rods and crankshaft resisting the difference.
Replacement heads should be compared for
combustion chamber displacement, regardless
of the source of supply.
Your 1.8L head is designed for a carburetor
engine, and is a good choice for replacement.
There is another 1.8L head for a fuel-injected
engine configuration, which has smaller valves.
Trade out that 1.7L head and get a matched
pair of something proper for your application.
