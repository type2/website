Subject: keeps quitting

Hello everyone.
My friend has a '78 automatic fuel injected bus.  It just recently had a
tune up and all the seals have been replaced.  For some reason that we just
haven't figured out is that it quits every time it gets warmed up.  It
usually happens when we come to a stop and only sometimes will it start back
up.  Does anyone have any suggestions on what this problem could be?  Thanks
a lot.
