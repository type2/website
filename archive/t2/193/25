1.8L Head inside diameter is 105mm. Valves 39.3 In X 34 Ex ( FI Head )
( The Carb Head, same part #, has 41 In X 34 Ex , and one or two EGR holes. )

Ezackly. Don't know where you are getting those other #'s.

The 1.7L head has been flycut from 100mm to 105mm to fit the 1.8L  cylinder.

The best choice for big valves and carbs is 41 X 34 valves ,1.8 Carb Head.
Also a good choice for an upgrade to 2.0 L or 96mm Big Bore Kit .
The 2.0L FI Heads are too small valves for me. As you will see, the 1.7L
head has bigger intake valves than the 2.0L. ( 39.3 vs. 37.5 ).
