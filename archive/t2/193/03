Just wanted to let you all know... It was the fuel injection computer...
doh...

SO...  I should have the bus back tomorrow morning (if all goes well,) the
one thing that's scaring me is that he says the wire that burned out (the
one that ran from the front of the bus to the solenoid [1 of 3]) "wasn't
necessary."  He couldn't give me details right now because he was on his way
out the door, I'll find out more tomorrow morning. Does anyone know exactly
how many wires are supposed to run from the front of the bus to the
solenoid?  Like I said, I had 3, two larger diameter and one small diameter,
the small one was the one that burned out.

Thanks,
David

Did you unplug the fuel injection computer?
