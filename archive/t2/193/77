The key words here are "No title".  If anyone is planning to buy this bus, 
beware that "no title" may very well indicate "stolen bus".  If you're going 
after this bus, I'd suggest contacting the state police first and inquiring 
about the current owner.  Unless some legal paperwork has already taken place 
(such as a mechanics lien or abandonment), whoever is listed in the state 
records as the owner of that bus is still the owner and no one else has the 
right to sell it.

I was at a salvage yard a few years ago in San Antonio.  Guy had a really 
pretty green 77 Westy in absolutely A-1 condition except that the motor was 
under a tarp next to it instead of nestling happily in the back end.  I asked 
about it and he said he'd sell it for $250 w/o motor and $500 with.  I was 
getting my checkbook out when I asked about the title.  He said he didn't have 
one.  He said a guy brought the bus in a couple of years earlier and asked if 
he could store it there while he came up with the money for the needed motor 
repairs, but he never got back in touch.  (I was wondering why there was 
fishing equipment, a duffle bag with clothes, some books, and a few personal 
items in the various cabinets.)  I put my checkbook away and left.  That, my 
friends, is how you end up paying $500 for a stolen bus.
