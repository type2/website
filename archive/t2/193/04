Subject: RE: 185/195 Size question 

At 112+ degrees here for about a week straight -- There is little chance of
snow and/or slush here in Decamber/January. Trust me, I am well aware of it,
as I was born and raised in Chicago--I had 185s on our Bessie and moved up
tp 205s, great ride==

I hear you can get a 225 tire on the back of a bus.by putting it on, without
air--then filling it with air after you stuff it into the wheel well??

One way to tell it is Really hot in Phoenix is when you travel the freeways
and see pieces of tires all over the road, due to blowouts--Last week there
was a blowout right in front of me and the shredded tire slamed into the
front of Bessie--

Maybe not always, everywhere, in all seasons. In our Ohio winter, tires in
the snow/salt belt work better if they have a thinner profiles rather than
a wide flat footprint. The thinner contact seems to bite into the slippery
surface better and provides some traction, where the broad flat footprint
does on snow and slush what that same footprint does on very wet
roads.....it sort of hydroplanes.
