( I wasn't being completely serious, Roland :).
But there is no real good reason to assume that your cam is
flexing or moving sideways under pressure from the valve springs.

There are several methods and techniques for valve adjustment.
For instance, why is the Zendfolge ( firing order :) referenced as
1-4-3-2, when it could just as easily be 4-3-2-1 ? Perhaps it is
easier to remember 1-2-3-4 when it is time to adjust the valves ?!
Are you using feeler gauges ?  The touch can be entirely subjective,
get the go / no-go set. Are your valve stem tips dished ?
Is anybody interested in discussion of cam profile / base circles,
valve train geometry, or fitting of  hydraulic lifters to solid lifter cams ?!
