My only concern is that I'm not aware of any
205's that have sufficient max pressure or max
load, since the Michelin MXT's left the market.
Remember that any of the P rated 205/75/14, which
is all of them to my knowledge, must have the max
load reduced to 91% to compare it to the spec
185R14C or 185R14Rf.  In other words the tire
should still have max pressure of at least 45 and
a max load in the 1700 range and load index of
94-95. I don't know of any close to this.
