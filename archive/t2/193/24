Put a set of Bosch W8CC in and all is well.  Once
again the Captain learns not to cheap out. 
(Actually the autolite's were slightly more
expensive, but they were the only one's FLAPS had
in stock.)  I usually take Dr. Tim's bosch only
advice with reservation.  And as usual, he's
snickering at me.  

It still seems to need the carbs synch'ed but
that's a job for another day.  It sounds like the
left carb is whistling more than the right.  Is
there a webpage on doing the job?
