Subject: Distributor Rebuild - A Resource!

Hiya List,

Yesterday I posted a general question to the List concerning rebuilding a 
distributor.  In short I wanted to know if there was a "renewal" kit or a 
business which would refurbish old distributors.  To those (Steve, Eron, Jay) 
who filled me in on the Bosch kit, my thanks.

Not knowing just where to start looking for "distributor renewer" I checked 
my local yellow pages.  I found an outfit called Philbin Manufacturing (check 
'em out at www.philbingroup.com) and low and behold, they do remanufacture 
distributors.  And they do Volkswagen/Bosch distributors.  "Neat", I thought. 
 They even had a listing for my Bus (69-70).  Although I was a little 
suspicious because this distributor was listed as having other applications, 
so I was wondering if it was really a 205T.  So, I went on over to see these 
folks this morning.

When I told the counterman what I needed he pulled out what looked to be a 
brand new 205T.  "Wow", says I.  It is really a nice piece of work complete 
with points and condenser.  He looks up the price - $58.80 with a core charge 
of $5.00.

Folks, I have not yet installed this "new" distributor but I have to say I 
was very impressed with the workmanship.  And, what's more, Philbin will 
renew your old core.  So if you're doing a resto to stock this is a place you 
might want to check out.  This turned out to be a great resource and these 
guys are right in my back yard.  Give them a "look-see".
