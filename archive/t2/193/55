Listees, 

I imagine I already know the answer to this, but thought I'd ask anyway. A junkyard near me has a wrecked 73 Ghia with a set of perfect high back seats. Can I put these buggers in my 71 bus without any retrofitting? 

My drivers seat is history and I know I can buy those high back seats cheaper than new covers for mine. I can't imagine I'd get that lucky though!....

Thanks all, 
Melissa
