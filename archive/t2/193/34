The 68-72 worm-and-peg box might be stronger than a splitty box, but they
still proved failure-prone after radial tires began to be used.  I think
that this is why the '73-up went with the worm-and-roller box.

One tends to adapt to differences in steering effort.  The wider contact
patch requires more effort to turn.  Longer lever arm gives more torque.
