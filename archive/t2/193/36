Aha ! Problem solved by p-mail !
The dimension given for "inside dimension " was a linear measurement of
the largest dimension of the combustion chamber. This is not relevent.
The correct measurement of combustion chamber is volume.
Here's how:
Make a clear hard plastic circle to fit inside the head recess.
Drill a small hole in it.
Grease the edge and fit it there.
Get a 60cc syringe from the vet ( cat doctor :) for free, and
fill the combustion chamber with colored water, removing the
bubble by tilting the head.  This will be the volume in CC's
that you need to compute the compression ratio and match
chamber volumes.

No, that 1.7L head has been flycut to fit the bigger bore.
Appearances can be deceiving. For instance, i look
exactly like Brad Pitt ( with an equally proportionate
thickness of the head :).
