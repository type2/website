Subject: Re: [T2] Going nuts...upholstery

OK, I went and 'appropriated' a M code plate from a 78 Champagne bus. Build
date 02/78, vin # 2282098015
The 1st row verifies the vin:
08 098 015
The 2nd row is:
4817V1 D61 027 227
3rd row:
08 5 7198 UF 2218 61

The 1st group in the 2nd row is paint and upholstery.
I have not got a clue on how 4817 equals the 2 paint colors.....
But V1 is sienna [red brown] cloth. Although only the light gold insert is
cloth, the red brown is vinyl.
