Hello everyone,
When I purchased my 75 Bus it came with low back seats with our head rests
or even holes for them.  Now that I am recovering the seats I find that the
frames do have holes that I am thinking are for headrests.  My question is,
anyone have the headrests that they would be willing  to part with or a set
of high back seats that will fit (What years will fit that are high back)
 
I also would like to swap out my seatbelts and install self adjusting ones,
can I do this, if so anyone have them?
 
Regards
