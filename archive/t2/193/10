Subject: On setting valves after rocker arm removal...lesson learned?

I few weeks ago I failed smog and wrote here for advice on what to do for my 
'75 FI engine. Valve adjustment was suggested, which I had recently done in 
association with removing the rockers shafts in order to replace the pushrod 
tube seals. But nonetheless I took a look and sure enought many of the 
valves were 'way' tight. Readjustment resulted in passing smog with room to 
spare.
My theory is that because I loosened the adjusting screws when I put the 
rockers back on, that when I went to adjust cylinder 1, the contralateral 
valves on cylinder 3 were not really being activated, so the cam wasn't 
under any pressure from the far side, resulting in a false setting of the 
valves on 1, etc. Does that make sense?  If so, it would suggest that you 
need to go around the cylinders twice in such a situation to really get the 
proper adjustment.
Thanks to all who responded.
