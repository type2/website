>>I think the key here is that you use Whatever
works for you--I Do know that
when you go to a "Tire Shoppe" or where-ever you
buy your tires.-  Alwaysask "What is the BEST
Deal on a set of tires"! and mention the size 
you want--This always works for me.--As a lot of
"Tire Shoppes" Do carry, one or
two, sets of 4 tires that they may have just a
few of! Ergo you can cut yourself a deal., 

And you end up with some passenger tire rated for
1300 lbs that has insufficient max pressure. 
Because there are no reinforced 205s currently
available to my knowledge.  If anyone knows of
anything, send me the data and I'll post it to
the tire page.  

Please pay attention to your tire specs found in
bentley, in your owners manual, and on the
various tire faq pages.  There is a reason the
engineers put it there.  VW cuts corners where it
can and even some that it shouldn't.  

This advice of going to your friendly local tire
idiot and buying what ever P195/75/14 or
P205/60/14 they have on sale leads to blowouts
and rollovers.
