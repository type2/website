Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder-head tin


Someone recently mentioned that they were lacking the tin piece between the 
cylinders that the thermostat-rod passes through on the head, for a type 1.  
When all else fails while trying to find one, use the type 3 cool-tin that 
wraps completely around the lower fins on the head.  I grabbed a few pairs, 
and they keep me cool even fully laden in 100+ degree weather.
