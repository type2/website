I don't think I would put Autolites in a Ford let alone a VW or RX-7 (we 
were the ones that tried them in an RX-7 with crummy results). I personally 
have had a few instances just like this with Autolites. And you've helped 
confirm my 'suspicions'.

Call be crazy but I run NGK or Bosch in Japanese vehicles and Bosch only in 
my VW's. Never been burned like that. Champion and Autolite have given me 
fits on a few occasions in my Foreign cars.
