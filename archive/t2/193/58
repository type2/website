Subject: looking for a used dual carb linkage 

hello

im looking to buy a linkage kit, complete or not, used, for dual dellorto
drla 40 on  a type 4 engine

Else, anyone can point me out the right kit on CB performance?  its seems
they have many kits, offset intake manifold or not... well all intake
manifold on type 4 are offset no? the passenger side is closer from the back
in about 1-2 inches.

My homemade kit is not sufficient... i give up!
