Just got Wanda back, I'm going to go outside and turn everything on and make
sure, but everything seems to be workin just fine!  She started right up,
and it almost seems like she's running better than she ever did, (well,
since I'VE had her at least...)  The real test will come when I go outside
tomorrow morning and try to start her...

Thanks again to everyone for all their help and assistance!
