Mathew:

I had a similar problem. You can replce the filter
(good idea anyway) but dont do anything else until you
check ignition (specially if it was running well
before):

Clean and/or replace points at 50 degrees
Timing at 7.5 (if the timing light is not flashing
constant or irregularly, its still ingition)
Pull plugs, clean and gap them (do this on a cool
engine for re-install)

If the spark is poor, it will still run well during the
engines rich cycle for warmup.  After the temp sensor
comes up into operting range the mix leans down and
then it is more succeptible to poor sparking.

Once you get through that basic stuff then you can go
to 
Vacuum leaks, fuel pressure, temp sensor range, airflow
meter output, etc.
