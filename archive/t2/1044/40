Subject: Bus Tripping - back home

Hello All,

We're back in Burlington after covering 7000kms in 4 weeks.  The bus needs
a bit of work.  It seems the alignment was dings but one of the bad roads
along the way as the front tires have some pretty nasty cupping which they
didn't have before.  I think this may actually be the source of my 'wheel
bearing' problem (the noise is coming from the tires).  There was a lot of
toe-out, which is obviously wrong.  I've set some toe in now so hope the
tires will recover.

Worse though, I thought the engine was sounding a bit odd the last few
days so I finally looked closely and found a small exhaust leak in the
right side j-tube connection.  I quite concerned about this as the thing
these parts are all original (33 years and 100,000 miles).  The gasket has
rusted it's way out of the connection.  The joints, all four of them (on
the 2 j-tubes) look good except that the don't really...let me explain.
The aren't flaking rust but there isn't much left of the bolts that hold
them together.  I'm wondering if they are going to fall apart if I don't
do something about them...all four of them, or they may hold together. 
Here's some pictures...what do the type 2ers think?

The engine side of the right one is leaking at the bottom, just a bit.

If I take these apart, will there be enough left to bolt them back
together or is it a complete loss?  I'm guessing I won't know until I try
:-(

Should I putty it up with muffler cement and hope for the best....

Cheers,
James
