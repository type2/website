Subject: High HC now passed!  (1118>>178  Is 15 vacuum too low?

After getting 1118 HC and 0.25% CO, I thought that I had a leaky 
injector (gas milage was 16 on the Highway) and checked the engine- hose 
was falling off the pressure regulator (so pressure may have been 8 lbs 
too high), but pulling injectors showed them to be tight inder pressure, 
as was the cold start valve.  Karl suggested the CO is too low (lean, 
air leaks?) and thus misfiring, letting raw gas through.  Spray starter 
around the hose joints showed leaks around  the cold start valve seal 
and some cracked connections to the Decel valve.  Fixed those, and for 
good measure put in the 83 VANAGON rebuilt AFM I got as Everybus for $5 
after checking all the resistances and finding it to same specs as the 
bus.  Idled and ran fine, but vacuum I did check ( teed into the 
pressure regulator line)-is 15 at idle- is that too low?  I noticed a 
cracked injector seal (not sure if cracked all the way through.)  Took 
it to inspection and it passed with 178 HC and now 0.25% CO  Am I still 
running lean?  I'll see how milage is going up to West River Westies.
