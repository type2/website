I don't believe that data is correct.


The 091 tranny from the 76-79 bus will increase cruising speed at a
given rpm by about 6%.B  This means that 60mph with the old tranny
would correspond to about 64 mph with the 091.B  Good thing too,
because an 8-10mph increase would put the motor out of its powerband
and likely make it overheat.


The gaps between all gears are also exactly the same between the two
trannies.B  The only difference is the ring and pinion, which is 34/7
in the 5-rib and 32/7 in the 091.B  That is where the 6% difference
comes from.B  


I bet Will was thinking of the 3-rib tranny when he said this.B  The
3-rib has a totally different ring/pinion ratio and 4th gear than the
5-rib.


You will have to use the bellhousing from your old transaxle on the
091 for the conversion.
