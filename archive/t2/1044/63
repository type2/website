I bet what happened was your engine backfired, and blew off those two
hoses, and *cringe* damaged  something in the process, creating a big
vacuum leak.

I've seen this sort of thing happen a few times. take a look at the
AFM. disconnect the cables and hoses, pull it out and make sure there
aren't any bulges or cracks in it.Try to move the flapper inside with
your fingers or a screwdriver (be gentle). In extreme cases the bottom
of the AFM unit blows right off the rivets and its fairly obvious
where the leak is. You would get exactly the situation you described.
Sometimes they can be fixed, sometimes not.

If it isn't the AFM, I'd inspect all the other FI components
especially the hoses. The line going to the brake booster is a usual
suspect, it will be on the left (FIF) of your air distribution box.
You could allways disconnect it and plug the boss on the distribution
box as a troubleshooting measure.

Check all the hoses and check them again.

If you find something cracked or disconnected you'll want to resolve
the backfiring issue immediately.

Let us know what you find.
