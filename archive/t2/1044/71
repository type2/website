Subject: 74 High-top camper body and parts

Hello list,

I am picking up a 74 Camper (high-top, not Westfalia) from Abbotsford, BC
Canada. Originally I planned on towing it back home to Saskatchewan, but I
am not confident that I can safely tow the bus home. I have decided I will
pull as much as I can and leave the rest. I have only seen a few small
photos, but assuming the body is in reasonable shape, I would hate to see it
get scrapped. Any listers in the area who are interested in sharing the
spoils? If so, contact me off-list and we can work something out. Ad is
still up on The Samba -

Also, I haven't properly introduced myself on the list, just been lurking
around absorbing all the info. So hello, I'm Zach, very happy to see so many
other people love their busses too!


Cheers,
Zach

'73 Westfalia
