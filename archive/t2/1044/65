Subject: EZ Awning review

Re: EZ Awning that BusDepot sells--I just put it up for the 1st time 
last weekend at High Sierra Music Festival.  standard version.  It 
ROCKS!  took a while to figure out the first time--not the EZ-est awning 
in the world BUT once set up for the 5-day weekend it was super 
convenient.  and kept the brutal California sun off, in a sea of vendor 
"EZ-ups" it made the bus an integrated part of the scene. . . also a 
plus to have the complete set of reflective window covers that BD sells 
. . . shield the windshield and side windows, pop the top and you get a 
cool convective breeze. . . the SUN is a killer, shade is the shelter. . .

no affiliation, just a happy customer. . .

PS in other news, my re-welded pedal assembly completely disintegrated 
on the drive home Monday, pedal hinge bent, pushrod squeehawed, pivot 
assembly broke at the pivot pin.  I got home 70 miles by pulling a rope 
attached to the throttle cable.  Today I'm engineering an improved pivot 
assembly based on a garage door roller bearing.  Pedal hinge will be a 
super-duty barn door hinge.  what a POS design from the factory in 
Germany!  has anyone invented or adapted a better design from another 
vehicle?
