Subject: Re: [T2] oxygen sensor testing?

Unfortunately there are two kinds of gas analyzing devices...

The basic automobile O2 sensor can be connected to a meter or an easily built electronic driver to give a rough fuel/air ratio indication.  This is how modern FI systems manage themselves.

To get a precise enough indication to actually set the CO correctly requires a shop-quality gas analyzer.

If you look on the internet, I think you can find kits or plans for a DITY gas analyzer.  The circuit is easy to make, but I think the precision sensor is pretty expensive. You can also get screw-in sensors which can be temporarily installed in an exhaust bung for on-the-road testing (midas can weld in a bung for a few bucks).

Not sure why your CO needs adjustment...normally once that is set, it is good unless the AFM or a piston/cyclinder is changed. Mine was only adjusted after I put in a new engine...has smogged great for years. 

If the AFM is really inconsistent enough to NEED regular adjustment, I'd get a new one.

I can't 
afford to buy a new AFM and would like to know how I can check the fuel 
mixture myself without an expensive gas analyzer.
