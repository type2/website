What year of bus?

Start tracing all of the hoses, you have a vacuum leak, and they all must be 
solved every time you try starting it, otherwise they will blow off again, so 
check all vacuum lines using a guide of ratwell.com and see what you can find.

Is the line to the brake booster still hooked up at the intake manifold?
