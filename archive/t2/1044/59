In my last job, I had to track down some odd-shaped aluminum framing, and
used these folks:
http://www.masoncorp.com/
I was able to go to their warehouse in Raleigh and pick through hundreds of
profiles to find one that fit. It was years ago, but at the time they gave
me a catalog of their products, which listed profiles, dimensions, etc. You
might be able to find something there.
We also used

for some custom screening.
Good luck,
