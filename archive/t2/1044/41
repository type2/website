Two things before you set off on a trip: Is it hooked to the fused side or the un-fused side of the fuse box? If removing the fuse where it is wired in causes a loss of power then you're probably (maybe) okay. What else is on that same fuse? If you know ahead what all is depending on that fuse, you'll know the first place to look if there is a problem - or what you might need to turn off when operating the sink! I suspect that the original inline fuse was wired to the hot side of the fusebox and the inline fuse was the only fuse and was not shared by anything else. Best to go back to that setup, IMHO. -BaH

 I got it solved, it seems like the wires weren't making
 contact inside the wire nuts on the short leads off the
 pump, I took them apart to run a wire from the fuse box to
 test to see if the pump was still good, after I hooked them
 back up it works great, there wasn't much stripped wire,
 that may have contributed.
 
 FWIW I do not have an inline fuse or a fuse at the pump on
 my '77, just a fuse in the regular fuse panel.
