I'm in no way as qualified as most of the people on the list to diagnose a problem, but my '74
Westy had a very similar issue.  I made sure all the vacuum hoses were on and tight and it DID
seem to make a difference, but the problem persisted and eventually she wouldn't start at all.  My
problem turned out to be a bad fuel pump.  I installed an electric pump and the problem was
solved.
