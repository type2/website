Subject: testing disc brakes

You need an assistant.  Assistant does not get dirty, so you can use your
significant other, or a neighbor.

Jack up front end so both front wheels are off the ground.  With your
assistant in the driver's seat, and engine off, spin the right passenger
wheel while your assistant slowly applies the brake.  When the right
passenger wheel catches, have your assistant cease applying the brake , but
continue to keep their foot on the pedal.

Go over to the left driver side front wheel and see if it is still free or
if it had caught.  If it is still free, then apply more brake pedal until it
does catch.

You can then determine that the right passenger brake catches before the
left driver side.  And get pretty much a good idea of the impact.

Of course, if the left driver side wheel is 'locked' when you first go over,
then re-start the procedure at the left driver side front wheel, until it
'catches' and check the right passenger side while assisyant applies more
brake pedall.

Since there is no physical adjustment to the front disc brake caliper /
rotor / pads that can be done by average shade-tree mechanics, this is
logically valid and a simple procedure.


You can jack up the rear and do the same, but the adjustments to the brake
shoes are a factor.
