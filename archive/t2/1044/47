The  general complaint with AMC heads is that
some people have discovered they  are fly-cut
such that you will need the cylinder head gaskets
to close  the gap between the head sealing surface
and the cylinder. If you have  compression, you are fine.
The compression ratio is another concern.
For  this, you need to measure combustion chamber volume
and deck height (  distance from piston to head).
If you don't want to do this now, just run  mid-grade gas
(87 octane) and listen for ping under acceleration.
You  don't have a dilemna, just a bit more  power.

hey Dave  I think you are confusing the AMC with the AVP heads .   The AMC 
are brand new and aren'tt flycut. they require no head gasket.  The  AVp like 
from bus depot are reman and probably are flycut . later  mark  d
