Subject: ERG Light on after DIY oil-change and now my 83 runs like

Hey now!

 

I have an 83ac Westy that's working me over right now and I need some
advice.  

 

It was running great until I did an oil change last week.  Now the EGR light
stays on and it's running like crap (no power, low idle (about 500)).  I
need ideas about what may have changed?  Where are the leads that trigger
the light from the EGR valve?  Is the condition of the EGR filter (under
driver side rear) essential (there's a small hole in it)?  It was like that
before the oil change and all was fine. 

 

Also is the o2 sensor triggering the ERG light and just needs to be reset.
I just turned 97,000 miles and have read some stuff about o2 sensor
replacement.
