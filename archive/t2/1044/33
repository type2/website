Subject: RE: [T2] What's a 2L engine worth?

If it has low compression on a cylinder or a "bad valve", but it totally
complete from exhaust to fuel injection, Mark is right. $500-$800. If the
motor has acceptable and balanced compression with no known problems,
$800-$1000. But the mileage is pretty high, so that is unlikely.

To answer specifically to your question of what is "fair" and you need to
sell it right away, $350-$500, with no promises to the new owner.

Now if you do a little work on it, re-seal it, clean it, paint the tin,
replace the grommets and check the "bad head", you could easily get $1500 or
more.

Subject: [T2] What's a 2L engine worth?

As I posted a week or so ago, I am selling a COMPLETE 2Liter type IV engine
from a '79 9 passenger with 111K on it. I drove it from Baltimore to Philly
(about 100 miles), and so I can garantee it runs well enough to use as-is.
BUT, the guy who I bought it from said that his mechanic said that there's a
"bad valve" in #2 cylinder. I pressed him for more info, but he didn't seem
to be very technically savvy, so that was all he knew. I can say from
driving it that it IS running weakly. 
So what's a FAIR price? Remember, it is totally complete, FI, exhaust,
wiring, computer (does it have a computer?), tin, etc... I'm converting the
car to a fully electric vehicle, so I don't need ANYTING that is associated
with the engine. 
Thanks for your help.
