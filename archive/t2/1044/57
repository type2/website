=====================

After reviewing some responses I thought I might need to clarify...

I really need a source for the Jalousie screen FRAME.

I can replace the screen (actually already have the screen material, bead
material, and tool).  But, when I made a generic frame to fit it just will
flop around since the original frame had a lip on the sides that allow it to
hold in.  I am interested in a good source for frames or would like to hear
what anyone has done to fabricate a suitable frame substitute.

Thanks,

Michael
