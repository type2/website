Subject: Re: [T2] Gear ratios

That may be perfect, then. My bus is soon going to be my weekend 
cruiser, so it'll be treated pretty kindly when it comes to wear & tear. 
I'm also in the process of turning my 74 bug into a Baja with a 2.0 T4 
pancake, and I was planning on using one of the two 6-ribs I have for 
it. but, if the 5-rib could be stronger I may use that since the 29" 
tires on my bug will negate any need for high gear ratios.

Thanks for all your input. I'll look into the program when I get home 
from work.

Between that and the internet search engines to tell you all the different settings for the 2 transaxles, you should be able to see what speed improvement you might see.  I don't think it would be as great as 8-10 mph, but what do know?

The original 002 bellhousing fits onto the 091 transaxle, so, if you have a practically new clutch/pressure plate and don't want to gamble on whatever is on the new tranny or you don't want to pony up another cash bundle, you can re-use the original bellhousing/flywheel.
