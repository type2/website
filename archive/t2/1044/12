Just as an FYI:

OEL translated from German is OIL in English.
OLEO translated from Portugese is OIL in English.
OLIO translated from Spanish (loosly)/Italian is OIL in English.

I have seen caps with all four languages on them.

Wow ! !!

Until I saw this article, I thought OEL was a fancy way to say OIL, (since
OIL is the famous '710' cap, I thought  OEL is the higher grade '730' cap)
