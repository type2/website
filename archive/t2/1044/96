Bernie asked:
 Hi, does anyone recommend synthetic oil for transmissions? I'm driving a '77
WESTY and am thinking of switching the oil in the tranny to a synthetic. Is
this a good idea? Is there any advantages?Thanks,Bernie,Fort Langley BC

I ran the Redline MT90 in my 77 Westy. I had a problem when it got hot.
It expanded and ran out the input shaft and left big puddles. No, it was not
overfull. The input shaft is higher than the fill plug. Cold, it was to the
level of the fill plug; where it is supposed to be. Drove the bus and when it
got hot and started dripping from the clutch area, I removed the fill plug and
about a pint poured out!  Drained out the MT90 and went back to Sta-Lube GL-4
and never had a problem again.
