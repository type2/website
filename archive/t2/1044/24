Subject: Sink doesn't work - I tried the Bently, I searched Ratwell

I tried the Bently, I searched Ratwell.

My sink used to work all the time, then only sometimes with the keyy off, but always with the key on, now it doesn't work at all.

Were does the wiring go?

Where should I check it?

Anybody had this issue and solved it?

Thank you,

James in Portland, Oregon

Anybody on these lists headed to OCF?
