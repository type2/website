Subject: Vanagon cylinder spacers and starting issues.. Continued

Jim, and all.

I think I'll try to run them as they are...

You guy's rock. 

I know Beetles and Ghia's etc...

T-4's  and fuel injection are a mystery to me....... I'll get better
though..

 

Now for getting it started...

I have spark...

But, when I open the flap on the AFM the regulator gurgles and hisses like
the pressure is being released. I changed it to a new one, but still hisses

Then I pulled the injector rail and got no spray from the injectors.

Then, I pulled off a hose and only got a trickle of fuel, not the 30 lbs
that I need...

Any ideas?

I still need to do a valve adjustment to ,006 to let the lifters pumped up.

I'll do that tonight, as well as check the fuel pump volume and delivery
rate

 

BTW... The new job at the Parts Place is going great. This place has really
changed from when I used to buy from them years ago... And the pay is much
better than Airhead Parts... Scott screwed up! Still a great company, but
they really lost a good employee...

Wish me success..
