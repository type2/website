Subject: Gear ratios

What is the practical application of the gear ratios of various years? 
As in highway speeds and such. Right now my 75 bus has the stock tranny, 
so that would be a 5-rib I believe. Would installing my spare 79 6-rib 
give me a higher 4th gear cruising speed? I'm a complete novice when it 
comes to interpretating what the numbers mean.
