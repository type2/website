I have been using Redline MT-90 (GL4) for a while. It provides smooth
shifting even at very low temperatures and I have gained noticeable gains in
power, mileage and lowering of NVH. It runs about 40 dollars a gallon, just
under a Bus Transmission's capacity.

Running it will extend the gear oil change life to 50K miles or more.

    Hi, does anyone recommend synthetic oil for transmissions? I'm 
driving a '77 WESTY and am thinking of switching the oil in the tranny 
to a synthetic. Is this a good idea? Is there any advantages?
Thanks,
