Hi Joel,

A core longblock with a known issue should sell for about $250-$400.
But that's not what you're selling. I've seen a complete set of L-jet
FI parts sell for $300+ on ebay, and a complete set of engine tin is
also worth $100.

You could probably make more $$$ parting that out, and selling the FI,
engine tin, alternator and exhaust parts separately, but it would also
take more effort and take more time to sell off all the bits and pieces.

I think you should both be reasonable happy with a transaction in the
$500 range. YMMV.

Happy Trails,
