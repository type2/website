Subject: Wiring that 72

Still flailing around wiring my 72.  I am going to have to (almost)
completely rewire the dash area and all the major components.  Lots of
"add-ons" and "quick fixes".  I think I can do it, just slow.  Is there
a special size for all these spade connectors (male and female) and do
you think I can get them at Radio Shack?



Anyone who has done this before, I would really appreciate it.





While I am doing this, my son decided to remove the mufflers and
exhaust.  All 4 connections are spot welded to make up for the broken
studs.  Wow.  I have not looked at this real close yet, but I am
thinking there is a manifold I will need to take off and replace just to
get the exhaust system back to decent shape.  Once again, looking for
experience in this one.
