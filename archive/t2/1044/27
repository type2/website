I may have a small issue here, I am remembering back over 2 years to when I got my bus, there was a mess of wires under the dash and there was in inline fuse holder, I traced the wiring and found that it wasn't connected to anything so I removed the mess, today I am not finding any inline fuse holders under my dash
