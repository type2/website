Subject: vanagon 2.0 spacers.

With AMC heads, Do I need to add the 1.6mm spacers? What happens if I run
without them for a summer? Just run 93 octane? Or should I take it apart and
add the shims?

The PO bought and installed the heads without the spacers, and never started
it since. I'm afraid to start it this way.

I'd like to run it for the summer and tear it down in the late fall. 

Is this doable?
