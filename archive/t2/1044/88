Paul, dude, I've got just the answer for your 'J-tubes'

It is a simple, five step process:


First, Micro-Decontamination the whole system, then 2nd, apply Thermal Spray
Coatings.  You may find the need to do some basic Tool Assembly & Quartz
Repair, but after you do the Anodization Coatings, you may find that all
this pays for itself because of the Precious Metal Reclaim.


Too bad there's not someone in  the bus community near Dallas Texas that
could help, but I think I know of a mom & pop shop in  Southbridge MA that
could help out.


Yeah, I am feeling a bit spicy right about now, ,,,,,
