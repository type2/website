The general complaint with AMC heads is that
some people have discovered they are fly-cut
such that you will need the cylinder head gaskets
to close the gap between the head sealing surface
and the cylinder. If you have compression, you are fine.
The compression ratio is another concern.
For this, you need to measure combustion chamber volume
and deck height ( distance from piston to head).
If you don't want to do this now, just run mid-grade gas
(87 octane) and listen for ping under acceleration.
You don't have a dilemna, just a bit more power.
