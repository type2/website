Saw a Mexico Beige Bay Westy heading north on US 31 south of South
Bend on Sunday, then saw a air-cooled light blue Vanagon Westy
headinging west on 80/90 Toll Road.  Also just saw a gold Vanagon
Westy with multi-colored daisy stickers on the sides heading west on
80/90 - both in LaPorte County, Indiana.

Buses everywhere!  - Any list members?
