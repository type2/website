David,
you got me on the data.  I would swear I get some more speed by the seat 
of the pants though.

this is going from an old 70 trans to an 091.  not the same as going 
from a 75 to an 091.  I think I got more.  but may not apply to Nathan.  
Pay close attention to the flywheel/bellhousing combo.

'70 Westy "Rebertha" had a new accelerator pedal hinge and linkage 
welded up today.  wooo On the Road Again!!!  "out of the powerband and 
overheating!!"  supposed to be 115 driving through Sacramento tomorrow 
have a cold beer for me!!

<quoth David>

I don't believe that data is correct.

The 091 tranny from the 76-79 bus will increase cruising speed at a
given rpm by about 6%.B  This means that 60mph with the old tranny
would correspond to about 64 mph with the 091.B  Good thing too,
because an 8-10mph increase would put the motor out of its powerband
and likely make it overheat.
