Subject: 1976 2000cc FI only runs at wide open throttle

Hey Everyone,

My 1976 2000cc bus is giving me some trouble.  I went out to go to work one
day and it was dead :(

Symptoms:

Engine will start and run for a few seconds then stall (Running on the cold
start injector maybe?)

The only way to get it to run is to hold the accelerator to the floor. The
engine will start and run at wide open throttle (engine races up to
5000RPM!).  If I let off the throttle it stalls unless I floor it again.

A few notes: When I looked at the engine I found the hose connecting the
intake plenum to the air flow sensor box was off as well as another hose
going to an oil filter. I reconnected them but it did not make and
difference.

My bus still has the factory fuel injection system.
