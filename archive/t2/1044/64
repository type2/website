Thats just what I was looking for. I put on 205's which helped a little 
bit, but its still by no means an interstate cruiser. I get 17.2 MPG 
driving to work and back on a backwoods road never leaving 3rd, and on a 
trip over the weekend with nothing but 60mph cruising, I got 17.6mpg... 
not a huge increase.

But, I'm more interested in it for the ease of driving in traffic and 
simply getting to distant beaches sooner.

Another question though, is can I simply bolt it up to the bus? Again, 
its a 75. Understood I'd need the different flywheel, but is that it?
