I've heard it's not the best thing to swap lifters, but ymmv

adjust the valves to 0.006" and run the engine for a little while - this 
will allow the lifters to open fully and allow oil to get into them 
(this is per boston bob's recommendations). 
Then pull the covers off and see which ones are soft (press on the 
bottom side of the rocker).  The ones that are hard can be tightened to 
1.5 turns past contact.  Put the cover back on and run the engine some 
more.  When the last ones have pumped up, adjust them to the correct 1.5 
turns spec and enjoy your hydros.

I use castrol. works fine.  Just don't use synthetic when breaking in an 
engine.
