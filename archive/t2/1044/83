Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon cylinder spacers and starting issues..

Been there- we limped home last Aug due to what was ultimately a PO 
effort to line his tank and it peeled off, blocking the fuel outlet.
I pulled the hose from the pump and watched it run into a bucket- a mere 
dribble- blew up the line and it ran OK- changed the fuel filter which 
did not really help as the pieces were too big to get to the fuel 
filter. Eventually changed the pump (Ford f150 truck Bosch from a FLAPS) 
as the old one got hot and quit (siezed?), ran some when cool again. 
Still got that Ford pump (noisy now) which got us home from Pa border to 
NJ going on back roads very slowly, since the FI was essentially 
starved.  I solved the blocked tank by cutting the access hole over it, 
opening up the sender hole, and inspecting/vacuuming out all the bits 
until it was clean.  I have a valved T in the line I can hook an 
external hose to (high enough to be above the tank) and blow up the line 
if this should happen again.
Starting with the injector rail is drastic (did you replace the seals?), 
unless you used the tap at the left. Make a wire about 4 ft long with 
alligator clips.  Lie under the bus and put one on the + terminal of 
fuel pump and other on the BIG terminal on the starter.  How does the 
pump sound-?  Should barely hum, not be really noisy. Assuming your gas 
ran freely from the filter, you can check the volume this way too (run 
the outlet side into a bucket).

   Then, I pulled off a hose and only got a trickle of fuel, not the 30 lbs
  that I need...
