Subject: Kelty Carport - $129 (Half Price)

For those who may be interested, I have the Kelty Carport Deluxe Medium on
special, for $129, which is about half of the going rate. (It retails for
$320, and sells for $270 at REI.)  For those who do not know what a Kelty
Carport is, you can see pictures of it attached to a Vanagon at the
following link. It is something between an awning and a lean-to.  This was a
closeout buy of another retailer's inventory.  I only have about 20, and
when they're gone they're gone.
