I got it solved, it seems like the wires weren't making contact inside the wire nuts on the short leads off the pump, I took them apart to run a wire from the fuse box to test to see if the pump was still good, after I hooked them back up it works great, there wasn't much stripped wire, that may have contributed.

FWIW I do not have an inline fuse or a fuse at the pump on my '77, just a fuse in the regular fuse panel.

Thanks,

James

Hi,

I have a 78 so it might be the same as yours.  I had some problems like you. No power, and the switch next to the faucet was gone. I bought a toggle switch, but I had no power. I finally found that there was an inline fuse under the dash close to the fuse box. I replaced the blown fuse I had power and the pump worked. You don't have to take any of the cabnets out even to replace the pump. It's under the water tank. Mine leaked after I got it working and had to replace the pump too. Get a 12 Volt tester. Also there is a fuse at the pump on some models. Check and see if you are getting power at the switch, if not look for that inline fuse under the dash.

RE: "Sink doesn't work"
Do you mean that the faucet and pump that provides water from the internal water tank aren't working?
