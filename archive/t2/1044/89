Subject: Bone Dry Hydraulic lifters

Hey Volks,

I've been reading up on Hydraulic lifters as I am putting a 2.0ltr from 
an '80 Vanagon (boxer code CV) into my '74 Bay.  I have on good 
confidence that the motor was freshly rebuilt before I purchased it and 
it appears to be so.

Before I run the motor, I plan to reset the valves as per Richard 
Atwell's methods 
(http://www.ratwell.com/technical/HydraulicLifters.html).  Is there 
anything else I need to do in order to properly lubricate the lifters?  
The motor has been sitting (with no oil in it) for approximately  2 
years so I'm sure they have bled out.

Another question I have it - what brand of oil should I use?  I plan to 
use the oil weights as suggested by the Bentley manual but has anyone 
discovered one brand works better than another - especially for the 
first few oil changes on new lifters?

Thanks,
Andrew
