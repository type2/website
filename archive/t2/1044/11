Subject: FW: [T2] Where to mount a Full Flow oil Filter on 1971 Bus?

Joe,

No problem, the photos are attached.

The work-around is a special tight clearance oil-pump cover and fitting from
Gene Berg. It requires only very small clearance work on the engine hanger
or "moustache bar" to fit (if your moustache bar is tweaked a little). I
have an extra one if you are interested in buying it from me. I'll take some
shots of it as well. The Gene Berg adapter is around $35.00. Part number BG
241B.

Hope this helps.

Hi Jon,

I'm in the process of doing the same on my '69 Westy (full flow filter).
Would you mind sharing
your photos with me as well?

Also, where the elbow fitting mounts near the fan pulley, how did you get
the pulley tin to fit? 
The only way I seem to be able to make mine work is by trimming the tin (ie,
cutting a hole in
it), but it's something I'm not a big fan of.

Thanks!
