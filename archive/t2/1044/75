Subject: Sunroof Drivers...

Have any of you calculated the city and highway MPG differences between 
roof open and roof closed? Maybe even roof open with windows down, and 
roof open with windows up... I've noticed the vacuum effect when I run 
with my windows up and the sunroof open so I think it may help the 
"aerodynamics" (if a bus even applies) since air isn't rushing into the 
cabin.
I hope to test this on Saturday with some solid highway driving.
