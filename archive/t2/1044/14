Subject: HHO Injection

Long story short, I'm experimenting with HHO gas as a gasoline 
supplement for my 75 sunroof with 2.0 T4 progressive weber. My question 
is, can I simply insert either a 'Y' or a 'T' fitting into the break 
booster line and pump HHO gas into the manifold? My plan is to route two 
lines to the engine from the hydrogen cells... One into the top of the 
carburetor through the air filter for high RPM injection and one into 
the manifold for times when the engine is idling.

All input and criticism is openly welcome.
