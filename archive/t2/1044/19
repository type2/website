Subject: New Rotors, hoses and pads (now what) bus still pulls to the

71 Westy: bus front left wheel would lock up when I hit the brakes hard...

so I had the hoses replaced  all around (except the left rear (order 2 right
rear hoses, duh but shop took it off and checked if it was clogged, ok).

Decided to replace the rotors and pads up front.... got the bus back and they
told me to go easy on the brakes for awhile so the pads can seat. Notice
driving home that the bus pulls to the right as the brakes are applied coming
to a stop.

Disc brakes I thought were self adjusting. anyone know why they this could
happen. It is just they everything is new and the brakes will adjust or do I
have to look at other components.

They adjusted the rear brakes (e-brake handle comes out about 9 notches,
it'works, it's tight )and bled everything. Wondering what to do next...

Happy 4th to all,
Trey
