Subject: Re: back window for inspection ???

Jim asked:
 My 78 VW convertible is almost ready for the road...when I purchased the
carthere was no back window in the top ....my question is do I need to have a
back window to get it inspected ??? ...I live in NY Thanks !Jim~

I can tell you that the correct window is 75 to 79.  Good luck!

According to this:  http://www.nydmv.state.ny.us/broch/c-50.htm
it appears that only the windshield ahs to be present...... But I would not
say that is etched in stone.

Windshield And Other Glass
No crack of 11 inches long or longer is allowed if any part of the crack is
within the area cleared by the windshield wiper.

Windshield - check for presence and condition
All windows - approved safety glass or rigid plastic and condition
