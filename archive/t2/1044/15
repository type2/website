Subject: Re: [T2] Taking Interstate 12 from Pasco to Missoula

Hmmm... I live in Missoula and can tell you a little about what is closer
this way. Not too sure about 12 closer to WA. Although I do know that it
runs through the Nez Perce National Historic Park which is supposed to be
really beautiful and hold a ton of Native history.

I have driven from Missoula on 12, 13, then 95 south to Boise many times. As
you get into eastern ID there will be a lot of mountainous widings that keep
you next to the Lochsa River for quite some time. Once you get up to Lolo
Pass there is a fairly new Visitor Center if you're interested in the areas
history. And if you need fuel look for a Sinclair about 13 miles before the
pass. There is even a restaurant, lodge and a campsite there if you're
looking to stop and do some hiking which is worthwhile.

After you get into Montana look for mile mark 16 and a mail box on the west
side of the road. It has a small sign on it that says The Jack. I definitely
recommend you stop in there for a quick drink. It is a bar but it is very
unique in that the bar stools are all carved out of tree trunks. There is
even one that is a swing! It's just a pretty neat place that you can say you
have been to.

And after that its up into Missoula. Hope that helps a little bit. If it
were me and I wasn't in a hurry I would without a doubt take that route.
Even if you don't find too much to stop and see at least it will make for a
really pretty drive on a nice day!

Good luck!
