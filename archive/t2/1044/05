I've had this happen before on long trips, especially with mountain roads which generate high-heat braking.

First try to adjust the front wheel bearing play on both sides..it's easy to do...you want it snug but not TOO snug.  You should be able to slide the washer sideways with a screwdriver, but not with your finger.

Also check obvious things like lug nuts and suspension joints.

If adjustments don't work, then R&R the bearings for inspection.

If you do need to replace the bearings, it's pretty easy, just keep track of which way the races go in the hub.  To remove stuck races, heat the entire hub (with the race) in the oven to 300 degrees or so.  To install tight-fitting races, heat the hub to 300 and ice the race...pound it in quickly before the temperatures equalize through conduction. A shop can do all this with a press.

 It sounds like the
left front to me and the sound is worst when I turn slightly left.  Goes
away when turning right or more left (at 70 km/hr).  It gets really bad
when I brake.
