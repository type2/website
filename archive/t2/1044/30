Subject: What's a 2L engine worth?

As I posted a week or so ago, I am selling a COMPLETE 2Liter type IV engine from a '79 9 passenger with 111K on it. I drove it from Baltimore to Philly (about 100 miles), and so I can garantee it runs well enough to use as-is. BUT, the guy who I bought it from said that his mechanic said that there's a "bad valve" in #2 cylinder. I pressed him for more info, but he didn't seem to be very technically savvy, so that was all he knew. I can say from driving it that it IS running weakly. 
So what's a FAIR price? Remember, it is totally complete, FI, exhaust, wiring, computer (does it have a computer?), tin, etc... I'm converting the car to a fully electric vehicle, so I don't need ANYTING that is associated with the engine. 
Thanks for your help.
