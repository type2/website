Well I've been almost all the way across the states and back now (I'm
in Chicago, heading east) and I've yet to pass one other single bay
window bus on the road.

Do you folks have something against US20?

Peter, I'll be passing through your neck of the woods sometime
tomorrow, perhaps I'll finally get to break this streak.

Happy friday

peace
