Subject: Re: [T2] EGR Valve Diaphragm Replacement?

I still have the OEM EGR valve.  Since the valve and the filter were poorly designed afterthoughts, my solution is to install them only for the smog test, then put them back in storage for two years...they last a lot longer that way.

You can make blank covers for the hole in the manifold and the exhaust pipe by cutting and drilling a piece flat metal stock.  

Use a cork gasket on the manifold hole cover.
