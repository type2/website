Subject: Re: [T2] Painting Valve Covers:

This is all nonsense, talking about heat transfer through valve covers. Come
on. They are there to keep the oil in, that's it. There are a lot of things
that can be do to assist the cooling of an air-cooled VW but finned or water
cooled valve covers ain't among 'em.
