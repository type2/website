Or are rebuilds, and they rebuild them using STUDENTS at electrical 
colleges. Neat huh?

Mine from SHMUCKS sounded like crap the day I bought it. I took it out and 
returned it. I stuck in an old original Bosche from a junkyard and it still 
sounds great.

Fun can be had with starters at FLAPS by the way, ask them to test a bad 
one, they wont put something on it to hold the bearing, and as we know it 
needs it! So they blow it by trying to test it, and then you scream, jump up 
and down and say WHAT? You didnt put something to hold that end? They will 
call a manager, you say check your books, they will see it requires it and 
soon, with enough screaming, blaming and general distubance they MIGHT give 
you a new one. WIth a lifetime warrantee, which you then trade someone for a 
non-working one, which then you bring back in a month or so and say why 
doesnt this work? They will either test and ruin it, or just replace it and 
the cycle starts anew.....
