Subject: Re: [T2] Score!!! sliding window parts

Jim,

Yeaaa!!!  Thanks!...just ordered 4 from the local dealer.  For $5 I'll
try them.

As far as I am concerned, that makes everything good on my sliding 
windows instead of having a 99% restored vehicle, it's getting much 
better!

Besides, one of the items on the judges list is window rubber....and I
wanted them to seal good!

Many thanks, dave
