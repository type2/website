Yeah, I've thought about water cooler valve covers too!  In previous
discussions on oil coolers, many have pointed out to me that there is not
that much oil iin the heads, so the effect on lower head temperatures in
not dramatic.  Then I started thinking about water cooling the head only
- pretty soon I realized how the wasser boxer came to be!! LOL!   Guess I
should buy a newer Vanagon - or learn to love the 02' Honda Odyssey as
much as the Westy!
