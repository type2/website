TRW? LOL.. Are they remanufacturing car parts again? Yeah! They do mainly
aerospace and defense contract stuff, but in hard times they have been known
to reman auto parts as a way of keeping their machines and machinists
working. YEARS ago I bought NEW rims for my '65 T2, and I couldn't find them
anywhere, but one local VW parts house carried some TRW reman'd rims and I
was able to get a new set.
This is good news for us, if it is the same TRW, that is.  Jan B
