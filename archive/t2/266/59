Subject: overfilling your oil???

fellow listmembers...

what happens when you put too much oil in your bus? can that cause something 
to start leaking?

I have oil dripping off of those two little bolts/screws coming off the 
bottom of the fan housing, LOTS of oil coming down off of the drivers side 
heater box and drivers side engine mount.

I checked and replaced the pushrod tube seals, but from inspecting them, I 
do not think they were leaking to begin with.

From looking, maybe coming out of the oil cooler?

not sure where to start looking, or if I should just have someone else work 
on it, if its going to require a lot more knowledge than I have to tackle 
the job. (mainly because its m daily driver, and work 40 hours a week. cant 
really have it out of commision too long)
