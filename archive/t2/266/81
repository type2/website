Pertronix replaces both the points and condenser.

Points are dual purpose: a trigger and a conduit for the spark so a
condenser is required to keep the spark from jumping the gap at
inappropriate times.

Unlike points, the sensor you'll install substitutes only the trigger
behavior because a solid state device sends the current to the spark plug
and has no need for the condenser.
