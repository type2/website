Subject: Re: [T2] overfilling your oil???

Trust your dipstick. Start there. Drain out the oil and refill to the mark.
Go to a car wash, and clean the bottom of the engine.
It should be dry when you get home. Simple enough, yes ?
With the engine running ( wheels chocked, neutral gear, emergency brake
on ). you may find some leaks at their source this way.
Use a flashlight and follow the leaks uphill to the source as best you can.
Place a sheet of cardboard under the engine to mark additional oil leaks
overnight.
Overfilling will cause oil to leak out and maybe blow out the crank seals
front / rear. If you now see bad leaks, you will have to do some work, but
you must first start with the correct oil level to make the diagnosis. It
may well be stopped by simply correcting the level.
