Three things to look at:

1. Check connections to the temperature sensor II (near cyl #3). If it opens 
up the engine tends to flood (a bit of smoke).

If you have a ohm meter remove the ECU mutipin connector (ignition off)and 
measure between pins 13 and 5 on this connector (the plug, not the ECU 
itself) while wiggling the wires to and around the temperature sensor. The 
nominal (cold) value of  2000 to 3000 ohms or hot value of 200 to 300 ohms 
should not jump around with the wiggling. Pin 5 is one of three ECU grounds 
(5, 16 and 17) so try try between 13 and 16 and 13 and 17 as well just to be 
sure.

2. Do the same thing for temperature sensor I located where you can't see it 
in the air flow sensor.  Measure between pins 27 and 5 on the ECU connector 
plug this time while wiggling the connector on the air flow sensor.

3. If you have a lambda exhaust gas sensor with more than 50K miles I would 
try a new one. D0 NOT test this sensor with a ohm meter as it may be damaged 
with this test. This sensor is part of the lambda loop that controls the 
air/fuel ratio on some/most 79 models.
