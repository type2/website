Subject: Re: [T2] Intake manifold gaskets.

Thanks All:

I have replaced all the gaskets hoses on air distributor and still have vacuum
around 15.2 inHg. I suspect the gasket between the runners and the cylinder
head. I will check with carburetor cleaner before I go through your whole
exercise.

Let me get some things clear on your steps:

You mean the rubber connecting hoses to the air distributor?

This is the gasket between the runner tubes and the cylinder head? What I have
been referring to as the intake manifold gasket. My new gaskets are some sort
of plastic/bakelite material with graphite coated paper on the outside.

I am assuming the mallet was to get the runner tubes into the rubber hoses
(boots). When I put them on the first time, I had to remove the air
distributor. It was really tuff putting then on by hand.

My injectors have new gaskets and new hoses, but I think I will remove them
just to get them out of the way.

Was the crack in your gaskets very noticeable? What did your vacuum become
after the repair?
