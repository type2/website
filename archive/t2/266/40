Anyone know where the hubcap is?
Last I saw, it was Everybus 2002.  Britt Grannis (did I get that right?) carried it away in the Roadcow.
Anyhoo, when it passed through my hot little hands in November of 2000, I placed a cassette of road tunes which I called "Traveling Tape - for the Great Bus Tour" in the baton box.
When I saw the hubcap baton with all its accouterments at Everybus (it now resides in a big plastic trunk with the original little brown make-up case), I noticed the tape was lacking.
I got Britt's address and told him I would mail him a new one.  I searched far and wide and high and low for 100-minute cassettes, and it turns out that no one makes them anymore (certainly not Maxell).  All I could find were 110 minute cassettes, so I made a NEW Traveling Tape with MORE road tunes on it.  Now I can't find Britt's address, and by now the baton is probably (hopefully) well on its way somewhere else.
That tape DESERVES to be in there!  A POX on whoever took it out and never put it back!  Where can I send this tape so that it finds its rightful place in the original baton box?
