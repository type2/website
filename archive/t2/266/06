True, but paying a higher price is no guarantee of getting a quality product.  I tried that already.  Might just mean that they are cheating you worse.  Going to a mom-and-pop place didn't work for me either.  I guess you have to research the product all the way back to it's origins including what the person who assembled it had for breakfast that morning.  :(  Not easy to do.

I do have hope though.  Hope that the "information age" will be our salvation with respect to exposing those both worthy and unworthy of receiving my/your/our business.

Yep, that fits into their Drive-through-U school-of-business framework very nicely.

At least my bus has one company supplying parts for it that I still trust - Bosch.  They will continue to get my business until they give me a good reason to do otherwise.
