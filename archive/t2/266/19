Subject: Re: Intake manifold gaskets.

My spin on this is: going the whole nine yards as I described is really
easy, doesn't take too long, and may end up saving you in the long run.
Chances are, the injector seals are cracked and need replacing.  The
gasket at the head may be cracked.  Taking the stuff apart as I described
allows you to inspect everything and do the job right.  Injector seals
cost a buck or two.  The gasket at the head costs about $5.  If you don't
get in there, you can't inspect what you've got.

You may be able to just loosen the bolts for the runners and get those
boots off... but it is much harder with everything connected.  Trust me,
this is easy stuff.  It took me about an hour (apart from the fact that I
had to get replacement nuts for the runners).
