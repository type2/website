The hatch holds the seal in place, so there is no need to glue it on any
side, IMHO.  My original seal is glued on the upper edge only and cut in
the lower right corner so to remove the apron I just pull the seal out of
the apron, and swing the seal into the left side of the engine bay and
let it sit there.
