Yes, there is supposed to be a seal ring there. There were two different ones.
It depends on the coverplate you have. They are not interchangeable. I could
not find it pictured anywhere but if you go here:
http://www.bus-boys.com/aircoolsystem.html and look at K, you will see a note
about the seal. Bus Boys calls it a 'plastic gasket'. Part # 022-903-203
I always try to keep them together as sets when I remove engine tin.
