There was a good reason why VW went with thin metal covers.  They transmit
heat well, they flex a bit to conform to the gasket surface, and they were

My first guess would be your sequence is probably reversed...:-)

My finned cover closely resembles the fins on the VW cyl-
inder and act as an effective heat sink because of the in-
creased mass and surface area.
