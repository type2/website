Subject: she stay broke

Hey list,

I just found out that the head for the #1 and #2 cylinders is cracked. 
 It had blown some smoke this week and was a bit down in the oil level 
so did a leak down test on and compression test.  The leak down was 
good, the no blow by except for #1.  The compression was 40 psi and only 
went up to 50 psi with a shot of oil in #1.  The other cylinders were 
all good at 125, 125 and 135 psi for #'s 2, 3, 4 respectively.

Why did I write?  Six months ago I changed the head on #'s 3 & 4.  It 
had the same symptoms for that side as I have now.  I have a '79 bus.  I 
was told when I bought it that it had a 2000 cc motor with a Weber on 
it.  The Weber I could see, but I knew next to nothing about VW's and 
how to tell the size of the motor.  When the rebuilt head arrived from 
AVP, via a Bus Depot order (thanks to both places for great service) I 
found out that the flange and collar on the exhaust pipe could not bolt 
up to the head.  AVP helped solved the problem by noting that the '79 
bolts flush the exhaust and the '78 has space for the collar.  AVP sent 
me a '78 2000 cc head and it bolted up just fine and I got great 
compression and all was right with the world.

I started to wonder why the '79 head would not bolt up when everything 
stamped on the bus said manufactured in Feb. of '79.  I got the engine 
number and matched it up with the list from on the library.  Was I 
surprised!  I had a 1975 1800 cc engine in my bus!  

Why did i write?  I now have to get a new head for #'s 1 & 2 cylinders. 
 Should I match the head that I have on there?  This is a '78 2000 cc. 
 OR should I put the "correct" head on?  This would be a a '75 1800 cc. 
 Cost is an object and I would really like to avoid buying two 1800 cc 
heads if I could.

Feedback please.
