Subject: Re: [T2] Intake manifold gaskets.

I just did this on my '79 Westy (suspecting a vacuum leak in this area).
Not too hard, just remove the AFM unit, disconnect the fuel ring (at the
cold start injector), disconnect the injectors from the runners (be sure
to protect the tips - wrap em in a baggie), then remove the nuts holding
the runners to the heads.  Pull the runners out to the sides, you may
have to wiggle them a bit.

Now, there are _two_ gaskets in this area.  First, the boots which connect
the runners to the manifold.  Also, there is a riser (with paper
gaskets on both sides) between the runners and the heads.  I found that
one of my risers was cracked; also the PO used some funky nuts that didn't
torque down all the way.  Just went to the hardware store this morning to
get the M8 1.25pitch nuts to replace the old ones.  When replacing,
torque this down to 14ft-lbs (as per Bentley).

When reinstalling the runners, I didn't use any gasket compound (though
I'm not sure if this was the right thing to do.)  I had to use a rubber
mallet to work them into place with the new boots.  Be sure you get the
injectors back in _straight_ (you might as well replace the small gaskets
on these guys too, if you are going through all this trouble in the first
place).

Hope this helps.  The procedure is _much_ easier than it looks.
