To bad they dont have them for a 72.

And this is the same front for that parts warehouse there was a thread
about, a week ago. Wonder if it will take them as long as it took them to
get me my brake drums, 2 months. And I wonder who is rebuilding the boxes
for them or are these brand new Brazilian boxes?

Well thats rather harsh isnt it? If you think BB is bad try waiting on this
turd of a company to send you your order.
