<< Volks,
 
 I'd like to contact others that are or will be "Full Timing" in their VW 
Vans.  
 Full  Timing is Folks that are NOW or have in the PAST ..... Living or 
Travelling for
 significant periods of time in their Vans.
 
 The goal being to a create a Community of VW Van Full timers.
 
 A place we could:
 
 Have a forum to exchange information unique to fulltiming.
 
 To build a private email distribution list that we would all share.
 
 To ask for or offer assistance.
 
 If you would be willing to participate in such a Community .... pls email me 
your preferred email address.
 
 My intent is not to publish these exchanges on the open Vanagon, Eurovan, 
Westfalia & Syncro Lists. 
 
 Hitting the Trail Soon,
 
 Larry Chase
