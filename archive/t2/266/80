Subject: Re: Synthetic Oil

I appreciate all the comments about my low pressure after changing to the
Mobil-1. I am going to run some diagnostics this weekend to get a better
picture of my engine's overall condition. The thing that bothers me about
this low pressure situation is that it happened IMMEDIATELY after I changed
to the synthetic oil. Prior to the change I ran quality dino oil and never
had any indicated pressure problems under any driving conditions. I'm going
to cjange the oil back to dino today and see if the pressures return to
normal.

Thanks for the help,
Dave
