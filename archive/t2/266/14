Subject: Intermittent Problems

Hello list,

I am having some intermittent problems with my Westy
that I thought you might be able to shed some light on or at least
give me an idea where to start when I take a look at her this weekend.

The problem:  Not all the time, but occasionally I will
be driving and after a few minutes the engine will nearly stall and start to 
run very poorly with little throttle response and give off a bit of smoke; 
or it will stall out all together.  It will then start right up again and 
run fine for until the next time it happens. (happens maybe once or twice a 
week, and shes my daily driver)

The stats: 79 Westy , fuel injection, 80 case, and I just gave her a tune up 
with new points etc, and fuel/air filters. compression at 130 on all 4 cyl, 
no *obvious* vac. leaks.

Any idea where I should start looking?  Offhand it would seem to me to be 
some sort of air/fuel problem (aux air regulator?), Im just wondering if 
anyone has an idea what I should start checking first

Thanks

Matt
79 Westy
