Maybe it's not tightened up right?

The mallet is for the seating everything against the head.

Getting the intake runners into new boots and seating the gasket is sometimes a lot of work, twisting, seating etc. You have to put them on the plenum and push the intake runners in to get them started then use a twisting action to completely seat them.  It shouldn't be easy if you are expecting to raise your vacuum level.
