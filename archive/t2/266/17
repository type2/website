Subject: Intake manifold gaskets.

Original Question:
I decided to replace the intake manifold gaskets on my 82 2.0L Vanagon this weekend....Any suggestions on the best way to loosen up the manifolds and replace the gaskets while the engine is still in the van?

Mike:

If he's just doing the runner to plenum gaskets, can't he just loosen the bolts on the runners with the injectors/electricals attached to get the room he needs? He didn't say he was gonna do the gaskets at the block.

Later,

Billy
