I am almost finished refirbishing my 79 bus f.i.
settup. I went ahead and bought all new injectors form
Advanced Auto. Each injector came with seals and a
clamp. The seals appeared to have been cut from a
hose. They were very thin. I went ahead and bought new
injector seals from The Bus Depot. There is no
comparison! The ones from the Bus Depot are much
better quality. They are individually molded out of
soft but sturdy rubber. They fit perfectly with no
unwanted gaps and they appear to be identical to the
factory ones. I would recomend them. Any how, Have a
great day and good luck!
