Subject: Torque and the rear wheel nuts

After taking in all the info about the rear wheel bearings I wanted to ask
the list what is the preferred method of applying the correct torque the
rear wheel nuts?

I read this interesting Bob Hoover sermon on flywheels.  Does anyone
actually do this with the rear wheels?

> Use the piece of pipe as an extension handle on the breaker bar when removing
> rear wheel nuts or the flywheel bolt. In conjunction with a bathroom scale,
> the pipe-extension also allows you to accurately set the torque on the
> flywheel bolt. (Stand on the scale, grasp the pipe at an accurately measured
> four feet from the socket and pull up while watching the scale. When your
> weight increases by 54 pounds, you've torqued the gland nut to 216 ft/lbs.
> Your anti-torque lever will be sticking out the other way, preventing the
> flywheel from turning as you torque the bolt.)
