Subject: Another plug for John Brown's Buses, October 18-20th

Come join us in beautiful, historic Harpers Ferry.  Only 66 miles from 
Washington DC and 68 miles from Baltimore.  Baltimore and DC Metro folk, 
it's a VW camp out only a stones throw away!!  There are folks coming from 
Canada (Rumor has it possibly 4 buses). So spend a few more hours in your 
bus before it gets tucked in for the winter. Call KOA now to make your 
reservation, that way you are not stuck in the middle of two RVs ;0)  Hope 
to see you there!
