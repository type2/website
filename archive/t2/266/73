No dont do that. Bar-B-que paint is high temp which means it contains some 
ceramic type content. This will act as an insulator. Since they are exposed 
to air, and this cools them, use a flat black spray paint. It wont burn 
away, and its the best at radiating heat. Gloss is a poor conductor as is 
Chrome.
