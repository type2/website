Subject: Air-cooled Vanagon engine for sale

Hi all:

Since I have a rebuilt TypeIV sitting in my garage I'm selling the engine
out of my recently acquired '82 Westfalia.

I drove the van with this engine in it exactly twice: the first was a 30
minute or so test drive on city streets and freeways, the second was the 15
minute drive home.  My impression of this engine was "strong."  That's
obviously a seat-of-the pants impression, but I've driven my '81 Vangon over
these same hills and dales and freeways and the car seemed to move out every
bit as strong as my '81.  Both drives were during a period where we were
experiencing record heat, but the "dipstick test" indicated no overheating
of the engine.

The engine has a new left-side head that couldn't have more than 100-200
miles on it.  The owner said that the head cost a little over $300, and
that's about right.

The engine has a sound coming from it that sure sounded like a lifter not
pumping up, but, if that's the case, it didn't pump up during either drive.
In any case the noise sure doesn't sound like a rod knock or something of
that sort.

My wife, who followed my home after the purchase, reported a small puff of
smoke coming from the tailpipe in situations when I was decelerating.  Since
I didn't even notice it during the initial test drive we're not talking the
Exxon Valdez here.

About an eighth of the top fin on #4 cylinder is broken.

Now you know exactly as much as I do about this engine!

I've done a "medium" job of cleaning the exterior of the engine, so you
won't be presented with a complete pig of an oil-soaked engine.

I'll palletize and box the engine for shipping.  If the purchaser lives near
an Amtrak with freight capabilities and chooses to ship that way (fairly
cheap, in my experience) I'll take the engine to the Oakland station.

Asking price is $500, plus actual shipping cost charged by the carrier, plus
$10.

I know that a picture *isn't* worth a thousand words when buying an engine
over the internet, but I've posted 2 pictures of the engine at:
