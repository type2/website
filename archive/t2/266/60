---------------------------------
This will give you a good start on the rebuild:

If this engine is still running......... run some Gunk / Siloo / Rislone
Engine Flush
through it, just follow the instructions.
Change the oil and filter and run 1 quart of Marvel Mystery oil in it for
about two hours (don't overfill the crank case) If you can't dive the car
just start it up and run it long enough to get it to operating temp a few
times before you pull the engine.
You'll find that it reduces your engine cleaning time considerably.
When you buy your Gasket set, be sure it has the 
front seal # 021-105-247a
rear seal # 029-105=245b
new connecting rod nuts are a good idea too # 113-105-427
the gasket set. Order them extra if they aren't in there.
Order four extra cylinder base gaskets / shims .010 size.
Try to get a gasket set with Viton pushrod seals (O Rings).
Decide if you are going to run German rings or Brazilian rings. (I
prefer the German ring, harder metal, takes a little longer to seat
though.)

------------------------- Engine Rebuild -------------------------------
The parts list below should be fairly close to what parts cost.
Remember to add in for crankshaft polishing about $55.00 to $70.00
Lifter resurfacing, about a buck each. New lifters are about $9.00 each.
New camshaft about $135.00 to $ 180.00
Rod rebuild. Piston end bushings about $8.00 per rod
Machine shop cost of pressing the cam drive gear and distributor gear off
and back onto your crankshaft when you install the rear main bearing,
about $8.00 to $14.00 should cover it. Be sure that the bearing goes on
right the first time; you'll have the crank with the bearing in the right
position at the time you start on the presswork.

-------------- ***************** -------------------- 
Cylinder Base Gasket 1.6 mm thick shims (part No. 071 101 341).  
-------------- ***************** --------------------
The factory (Thrust bearing only, the shell type cam bearing) cam bearing
had a copper finish from
the factory. When one tears the engine down it looks severely worn, when
it
really is not, that's the way the "Elephant bearings" come brand new, out
of
the box. Replacement bearings may have a normal babbit finish.
------------- ***************** ----------------------
******** Oil Pressure Gauge **************
I can't express strongly enough how important it is to have a working oil
pressure gauge on a newly rebuilt engine. You may choose to just use the
idiot light after your break in period but having an oil pressure gauge
is near mandatory in the first few thousand miles. Although you engine
may start immediately and the oil light will go out you're only measuring
about 7 psi. Which is fine for idling at intersections. If you've badly
placed a main bearing shell you will be getting your required 7 psi but
you'll be getting oil blow out around the bearing shell and your engine
will shortly self destruct with burned out rod bearings, seized engine
and possibly spun bearings at one of the main bearing locations. If
you've inverted the oil bypass plunger you'll be getting oil pressure.
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you've never rebuilt an engine; I'd suggest that you get your hands on
a Hayes or Bentleys repair manual and read through it (browse it mostly)
and see what's involved.
If you decide to go ahead with your rebuild run a quart of Marvel Mystery
oil
with your regular engine oil for as long as you can before the teardown.
It also doesn't hurt to run a 1/2 quart with every tank of gas up till
you rebuild. The Mystery oil will clean your oil passages, crankcase
internally, lifters, pistons, piston tops and groves and just in general
remove all of the varnish buildup that's in there.
When you disassemble your engine use a torque wrench to loosen the bolts,
replace bolts or nuts that have been over torqued. Consider using new rod
nuts and crank case nuts and washers, new head bolt nuts and washers are
a good idea too. Clean all bolt threads with a wire brush and wipe them
dry.
When you put your pistons into the cylinders, be sure that your flywheel
is on the engine and the oil pump is NOT. 
The oil pump tends to jump out of the drive slot when you turn the engine
backwards on occasion during
the piston/ring replacement. 
While you've got the engine out go ahead and repack your CV joints and
replace the boots.
******* Absolutely ***** Double check the retaining rings at your wrist
pins. The arrow on the piston top points towards the flywheel.
******* Absolutely ***** Double check that the O ring on your oil pickup
tube is in proper position.
Put your distributor drive and your distributor in with the 12 degree
angle set while you can still see the top of the piston and the marks on
the back of your flywheel.
Mark the timing notch on your fan assembly with white paint; you can also
use Liquid Paper or Whiteout for a semi permanent easy to read mark.
If you have AMC heads be certain of whether you need head gaskets or not,
AMCs normally don't use gaskets and OEM VW does use gaskets.
Even if your heads look good you need to have them inspected by a
qualified re builder, heads with 100K on them need new seats / valves and
guides even if they look good to you.
Use engine assembly grease on everything that looks like a bearing,
replace the starter pilot bushing in your bell housing and your clutch
main shaft pilot needle bearing in the end of the crankshaft. Replace the
felt seal and *O* ring in your flywheel.
Don't trust new cylinder piston sets, check your end clearance on the
rings for each cylinder. Clean and lubricate the cylinder walls before
assembly and lube them good after assembly.
If you can (within your budget) replace the camshaft and lifters, about
an extra $180.00 on a good deal price.
I'd recommend that you replace the $2.75 rocker arm adjusting screws if
the show any wear at all.
If you do the job right you could get as much as 140K out of your new
engine before you have to go back in again.
It has been said that the three oil gallery plugs on the flywheel side
should be replaced with 1/8 NPT brass plugs threaded into the block. It
might be something that you want to consider but is not required.
If you've got a 2000cc Type IV engine, set your hydraulic lifters at ONE
TURN from just touching the lifter. NOT the two turns in any of the
manuals.
Often it is best to install a new oil pressure-sending unit after the
rebuild (just to be safe). About $5.00

*****************[Setting Deck Height]***************
You cannot run different brands of heads on alternate banks (combustion
chamber cc) you have to run both VW or both AMC. Otherwise you'll have an
expensive and very questionable repair job.
Piston top to cylinder head clearance: Use a piece of hollow 1/8" thin
wall brass hobby tubing. I bought it to check deck clearances when I
built my engine. I crushed it in each cylinder and checked it with a mic
after cutting 1/2" off after each test stroke. (can also use a good tight
Crescent wrench as a measuring devise)  Worked great and it crushes
enough that it doesn't lock the stroke or bind the engine. It was a handy
98-cent tool for checking deck height and piston/head clearance. Just add
.010 shims until you get them evenly matched. You'll probably need to
order extra cylinder base shims in advance ........ four come with a
gasket set. Seldom more than four are required but get four extras, about
90 cents each. 
 
*****************[Very Important]********************

There are four parts you absolutely must keep up with when you
disassemble your engine:
1. Spring under your distributor, tie it to your distributor with a small
bundle tie.
2. Thrust washer under your distributor drive, tie it to your distributor
drive with a small bundle tie.
3. Three thrust washer/spacers on the flywheel end of your crankshaft,
Don't bend them, don't change the stacking order. They should be the
proper thickness for your engine but you need to use a dial gauge and
check crank end play before you reassemble the engine. You can use
Plasti-Gauge to set your crankshaft end clearance. Its nice to have a
dial gauge but the plasti gauge works just as well.
4. Fan spacer or AC pulley, if you install the fan without this
spacer/pulley
it will bind the fan against the fan shroud. 
 
*************** [Best of luck to you!]*****************
 
Remember! Clean, Clean, Clean that is a big help in engine reassembly.
 
***************[Engine break in]******************
Install 20/50 Wt engine oil, new oil filter.
Run the engine at 2000 RPMs for twenty minutes. It will take a
while for the lifters and everything to settle in so you'll have noise,
smoke and stink. Don't just guess about this, time it with a watch or
watch the clock on your dash.
You may think that the engine is going to self destruct during this 20
minutes but it will not.
You can shut it down and reset the timing, points if you need to.
If you have to do this shutdown ,,,,,, restart the 20 minute run in
procedure.
Change the oil and filter, remove and clean the strainer after this
20-minute run in.
Drive the vehicle at 2000 RPMs or less for 200 miles. Change the oil,
filter and clean the strainer. You can do the 200 miles in city driving
or better out on a country road but don't let the engine overheat sitting
in traffic. Race the engine up to 2000 RPMs if you get stuck in traffic,
you engines needs the airflow to keep the heat down.
Install 20/50-wt oil after this 200 mile run in.
Drive the vehicle another 600 to 800 miles keeping the engine at less
than 2000 RPMs and change the oil and filter again.
You should check your lifter setting at this time and check for any oil
leaks.
After you've got this break in done you should wait about 5000 to 8000
miles before you go onto the higher quality synthetic oils.
 
Go get em!
