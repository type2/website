I can't know what Bus Boys sells, but considering that decent injector seals
are so cheap, I just can't imagine they'd be selling junk ones. Unlike the
other firm mentioned (carmadillo), they've been around long enough to know
better. So I'd be inclined to give Bus Boys the benefit of the doubt, and
assume that the person who reported having problems with them just happened
to get a bad one. After all, no brand has a 0% defect rate. Of course Bus
Boys could confirm this; why not give them a call?

With regard to injectors, the non-Bosch ones I've seen have been rebuilt,
not new, whereas the Bosch injectors are new.  I don't sell rebuilt
injectors so I couldn't comment on how they hold up compared to new ones.  I
sell new Bosch ones for $59.95 each.
