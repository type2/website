Subject: Vangon rear bed cushion

My Vanagon westy cushion has particle board on the bottom of it.  Is this
cushion supposed to have a board on the bottom?

I have the bed in the house so my wife can fit a new cover - any
suggestions - I was thinking of some heavy duty fabric and thena
removable cover over that - or simply a velcro heavy duty cover that is
removable.

Dogs have taken it over as their bed!
