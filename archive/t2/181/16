the Blue Ridge is a lot of long steep pulls and also long steep
downgrades. and few if any services.  make sure your brakes are in good
shape

come up US 15 Va/MD/into PA spend the night in Harrisburg area, Follow 11
out of Harrisburg up the Susquehanna river to Mifflinville, jump onto I-80
east for about 30 miles to rt 93 South to Hazelton, Near Jim Thorpe PA
grab US 209 North through the Delaware Water Gap into New York.

this is an absolutely beautiful trip and it is also long, slow and hilly,
if you are having any trouble though there is usually a decent size city
or Interstate not too far away.

230-235 is when I begin to get nervous, at 240 I slow down and at 250 I
pull over
