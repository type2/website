It should be a press fit, but those things often pop out.  You might be 
able to thread the hole and put in a small plug, but I didn't have that 
option because I was on a long trip, so I pressed the thing back in, 
cleaned the area up and covered it with epoxy.  It lasted until I replaced 
the carb.
