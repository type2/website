I use the flourescent ones that screw into my regular shoplight.  They are =
just household 'money savers'.  Since I'm still in the U.K. I can't run =
out and look for you, but they are the kind that come to a point.  Avoid =
the ones that are two "loops" because they get broken fairly easily when =
you drop things on them.  They cost more than the heavy filament bulbs, =
but they last significantly longer.  I find them bright enough for me, but =
still manage to drop the upper engine to tranny nuts into impossible =
places to see.
