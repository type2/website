Brutal. At least you might have tossed a little helpful info along with
the beating.

I would first verify TDC/#1 firing position. Spin it to tdc and check to
see if both valves at #1 have gaps if not spin it 360deg.
Now is the rotor pointing at your #1 plug wire? Are the plug wires in the
right order/right way round? do you have static timing close enough to get
a start? (maybe a little before tdc depends on the dizzy).
Give it another try. You said youre getting fuel. Did you check spark?
If it still doesnt start just verify the valves are set right. Youu might
check compression just to be sure but this is a new rebuild so I hope the
compression is OK. Gas, Spark, Compression and timing in the ballpark
should get something out of it.
   good luck
