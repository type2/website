Sleep...at the gorge?  no, not gonna happen.  the "camp ground" if that is
what you want to call it, should be re-named to  "party ground"  I am not
sure with a show like the who, but I could only imagine.  You might try
making a reservation at the vantage camp ground.  I think it is about an
hour east of the gorge.  If you have no t been to the gorge before, you are
in for a real treat.  I saw Roger Waters there 2 years ago and man was it a
bitchin show!
