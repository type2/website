Craig.

I have the Berg sender as well and really love it. It was originally 
in the 67 and the oil pressure light was really bright so on the odd 
occasion it started to flick it was really noticeable. However the 68 
instrument cluster in the 68 has a green fluted oil pressure light 
and can be hard to see depending on the position of sun. Can you give 
a quick rundown on how you set up the buzzer system?
