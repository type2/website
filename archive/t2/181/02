Oooh, I've been there and so has my bus!  :)  Just a couple of comments on 
Onion Valley.  If I remember it was one of those rare 2nd gear roads.  The 
parking area at the top is just shy of 10,000 ft. elevation and the trail 
goes UP from there.  I hiked it with a large backpack and had to stop often 
because of the thin air.  The Onion Valley parking lot is one of the 
closest places to access the John Muir trail, which winds through the 
Eastern Sierras.  It's only a couple of miles from the road.  Astoundingly 
beautiful country - not as heavily forested as the Western side (Yosemite, 
Sequoia, Kings Canyon) but plenty of lakes and scraggly pine trees.  Be 
well prepared if you decide to go up the trail as it can get very cold at 
night and there are few people around to help if you have trouble.  Good 
hiking boots are a must.
