Bus exhaust systems HAVE to exit off to the side of the vehicle.  Look at the 
stock exhaust exit location on any year of bus.  

If you release the exhuast out directly behind the bus with a beetle muffler, 
aerodynamics (or a lack thereof on a bus) will cause the fumes to pool behind 
the bus.  ANY "leaks" in the seal around the rear lift gate or engine 
compartment door and any rust holes in the rear panels and battery trays will 
cause the exhaust to get sucked directly into the passenger compartment of 
the bus or indirectly into it through the cooling fan and heater boxes.
