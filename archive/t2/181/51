Subject: Re: [T2] oil, and the berg dipstick sender

I've used an ignition key buzzer that comes with the bus.  It is 2 prong 
and I wire it directly into the oil light circuit...It's very simple, and 
it keeps me from hearing that buzzing sound anytime I open the door with 
the key still in the ignition.  greg
