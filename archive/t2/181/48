Ive got the impression you have a 1600 with a stock sender.
Stock sender should be off with just a few psi.
If it was me I would have checked the pressure with a gauge and replaced
the sender if it was out of spec. If its correct and the engine is tired I
would have used a heavier oil and possibly upped the idle a tad.
Stock senders should all be about the same. the VDO dual senders come on
at a higher pressure like 7 psi I think. My dual sender used to
blink with my old very tired engine but never now.

Still it is an important indicator and is best functioning correctly so
when you see it on you know it means something.
You said a heap by mentioning the engine may not be up to spec. We have 2
questions then. Is the lamp wrong and needs fixing or is there really a
low pressure problem.

You should worry unless you verify the cause.
-Bad indicator?
-Low oil pressure? Caused by
 -Overheating? Missing tin, seals etc?
 -Worn oil pump?
 -Worn tired engine bearings?
_Something I left out?


Especially if you have no gauges this is pretty much the only
warning you get so dont take it lightly.
