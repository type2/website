Subject: 2.0L Thermostat needed

Anyone have one for sale?

This is for a 82 Westfalia, just finishing the head replacement and notice
that the thermo is fully extended when cold.  I know I have read about them
being NLA and haven't found one in my limited looking locally.  Also, I seem
to remember reading on a website (Raby?) about using the more commonly
available T1 thermo in its place but have not been able to find it now that
I need it of course.

Thanks,
Mark
