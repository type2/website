Subject: Does this tool work?


Another list member pointed me to this specialized VW tool for removing
tie-rods.  It looks pretty close to the design of the one depicted in the
Bentley.

It's under $10 and for this application I want to know if it's suitable in
the opinion of other list members.  I measured the joints and I think it's
just the right fit and I'm inclined to purchase it.
