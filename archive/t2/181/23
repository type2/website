Subject: rust behind drivers seat

From a safety perspective, do I need to be concerned about the rusting and
heavy flaking behind both driver and passenger seats, as it is near and
around the seatbelt mounting points? I have examined the seatbelt mounting
bracket under the wheelwell and it appears to be secure. How does moisture
get  in behind the seats? From weeping through the door seals? Is this a
common problem? 

Thanks 
dc
