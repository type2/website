Well, after reading the responses to my oil consumption post I couldn't h=
elp but wonder why I was having to add oil.
I had the bus checked out.  I need new push rod tube seals.  The mechanic=
 wanted $240 to replace them.  Since they cost about $0.40 each I think I=
 am going to attempt this one myself.  This will be the 1st time I do any=
 real work on my engine.  I have manuals ready and another person to read=
 them to me.  Is there anything else I should look at or replace while in=
 there?  Any other seals or gaskets I will need?  I know I will need to r=
eplace the valve cover gaskets, but what else?  Any recommendations?  Any=
thing to be emphasized?

Peace,
