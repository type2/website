Subject: RE: [T2] rear vent window info needed

Where do most people get replacement windows for the rear sides from? Do I
need to find a donor or can I get one cut or does someone online sell
windows?

Yes and yes.  What you propose is the usual solution.  Be ready to deal
with a substantial amount of rust when you pop that window out.
