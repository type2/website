Folks, I picked up 2 new bulbs(incandescent) for my trouble light
last night for about $2.50 each....rough service bulbs are expensive!


Looked at the flourescent trouble lights and wondered if they were
really better.

The question is...who uses what and why?

I like the idea that flourescent is cooler(no more burned stuff), but can 
you really *see* with them??(on your vw....mandatory vw content<grin>)

Cheers, dave
