A typical commerical glass shop can cut new glass using the other side for 
a template and then send it off to be tempered.

The benfit is that you can replace all the flat glass with tinted glass - 
the kind when the tinting is in the glass rather than film put on the 
inside of the glass. Cost? About $150-$200.

A single piece of glass would be something like $35.
