I'm compiling a count of legacy listmembers. In the past 24 hours, 18
volks on the Vanagon list have raised their hands to the question, "Were
you a listmember on vanagon(-at-)lenti?"
 
It just occurred to me that there are 'legacy' listmembers on the type2
lists too!

If you were on the vanagon(-at-)lenti list just hit reply and send.  I'll
post the results next (As unca Joel would say) Frydaye.
