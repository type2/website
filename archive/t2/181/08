Subject: Oil Light Coming on

Hello List,
The facts, 6,000 miles on a new Mex longblock.  Changed oil over the weekend
to 20w50, had the vales adjusted today, mild temps here in cental Ohio this
evening, not leaking any oil whatsoever.

My oil light came on at idle.  What gives?  What should I check besides the
oil level?  Too late at the moment, I will do tomorrow.

Is this a warning for low pressure?

Thank you in advance
