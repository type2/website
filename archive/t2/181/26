Yes.  The stress on the seat belt mounts during an accident is *very*
high.  If they pull out, then you go flying.

Daniel, VW welded a reinforcing plate behind the sheet metal with a nut
welded into it.  This provides a number of crevices for water and road
crap (especially salt) to hang around in and for rust to form.  Rust is
most likely to form at water/air interfaces and junctions of dissimilar
metals.  That junction of body, plate, nut and bolt provides lots of
both.

Alas, it is very common.  The only real cure is to have that piece of
metal replaced, which is a fair job.
