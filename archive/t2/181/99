Subject: Re: [T2] mixture distributor pipe for dual carbs

Any time you put a balance tube on a dual carbed boxer engine you have to 
run a balance tube.

I believe it is supposed to smooth out the pulsations in the intakes and 
make life easier for the carbs - allow a more steady flow and thus make the 
carbs more accurate and help emissions and possibly gas mileage.

I believe it connects the manifolds and not the carbs.

This would also be where the automatic tranny and the power brakes would 
connect as well.

Due to it's length you will probably have to fasten it to the engine in the 
middle so it don't just hang there waiting to break from vibration.

Anybody else got an opinion out there?
