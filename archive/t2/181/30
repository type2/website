get  in behind the seats? From weeping through the door seals? Is this a

common problem?

Check the seams in the sheet metal in that area; especially underneath in the 
wheel wells. Water is constantly being thrown against that area by the tires. 
Winter driving usually adds salt to the equation, depending on your area.
