Subject: oil, and the berg dipstick sender

i have used straight 30 winter, 40 summer here in austin for years. no
problems, no low pressures. cylinder head temp (in plug hole) would go up
to 350, but not over, and case was passing the spit test.
on a lark, i put in some 'hi-rev' valvoline 20w-50. i kept my pressures
longer on it (ie, long trips saw higher constant prssure - 45 - 60 at
cruise!), but idle would drop to 10 psi or so... about 5 psi lower than
straight. head temp remained below 350.

today, i carted 6 trannies to a friend for rebuilding (one good one made
outta the six... i hope!), and did an hour of freeway driving in the windy
texass sun and heat. 60 miles outta town, i started hearing a
'chip...chip...chirpchirpchiiiiiiiiiiiirrrrpp' and the oil light came on: i
have a buzzer connected to  the oil light, and i hear it LONG before the
light comes on bright enough to notice! my berg dipstick sender had alerted
me that 70 was just too fast for conditions; i pulled over for 15 minutes,
and then continued into town.

the berg sender has saved my ass- AND MY ENGINE - countless times. for $20,
if you don't have one, well...  i won't get insulting.


anyways. in town. i ate lunch and let the motor cool down to ambient.
admittedly, ambient was 98 degrees. but when i checked the oil level, i did
a doubletake - i thought there was water dripping off the dipstick!  i have
NEVER seen oil look so thin.  so i'm not too sure about that multiweight.

i have a vacuum leak somewhere, so i need to track it down, fix it and
drive some more before i decide yea or nay on the multiweight, but that
wateryness really startled me today..............
