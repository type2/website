What year windows will fit a 1973? Anything from 68-79 or do they change
window sizes?

Thanks,
Corbett

A donor bus in a junk yard is probably your cheapest way out. Its easy to
remove..just take a razor to the perimeter of the old seal. Once most of it
is gone from around the window, have someone gently push it out towards you.
I have used a screwdriver to pry it, but of course this is glass so you must
go slow and be careful. Most yards charge you if you break the glass.

Good luck,
