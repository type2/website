I've driven into New York twice in the last six months, both times into
Manhattan, once on New Years Eve (into Times Square no less) and we just made a
trip two weeks ago.  We had no problems parking, we used a parking garage just
off Times Square on 47th Street.  Last time, it cost about $28 for about 8 hours
worth (I think the max amount for a 24 hour period was about $32).

That being said, we have also used the train (Metro North) to ride into Grand
Central.  Costs about $30 round trip from West Point/Garrison area (about a 45
minute ride).  It's a cool ride and you get to relax instead of fighting
traffic.  I have not experienced Manhattan traffic or parking during normal
weekday business hours.  Also, consider the height of your bus when looking at
parking garages.  If your interested, I can point you towards some web links for
info on parking garages.

Good Luck on Your Trip,
