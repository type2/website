Subject: Top Ten Things I LOVE about drivng my VW

Rather than focus on the negative, I thought I would
offer some of the reasons I love driving my bus...It
is Friday after all...

10.Owning a vehicle with a personality
9. Jealous stares from people trapped in their SUV's
at stoplights
8. The purr of a finely tuned air-cooled engine
7. AIRS
6. Waves from other VW owner's on the road
5. Not having to pay for a motel room
4. Ability to do my own repairs - even if it is on the
side of the road in the rain
3. Sitting high over the road
2. Going slow - It is ok to slow don now and then
1. The almighty type2 list

Now get out there and drive your bus!  Happy Friday...
