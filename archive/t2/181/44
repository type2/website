Subject: Re: [T2] rear vent window info needed

A donor bus in a junk yard is probably your cheapest way out. Its easy to
remove..just take a razor to the perimeter of the old seal. Once most of it
is gone from around the window, have someone gently push it out towards you.
I have used a screwdriver to pry it, but of course this is glass so you must
go slow and be careful. Most yards charge you if you break the glass.

Good luck,
