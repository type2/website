Subject: Re: [T2] push tube rod seal replacement

with a type4 engine like yours, this is very easy. you don't have to
remove the head like on the type1 engines. The tubes just pull out the
head :) While at it I would pay the extra $$ & get the viton seals
(they work fantastic) & I would also replace the valve cover seal as
well. the only other piece of advice I would give is to
beg/borrow/steel a torque wrench if you don't aleady have one. the
studs that hold the rocker shafts to the head are pretty small & the
torque rating is low as well (i think like 10ft-lbs). Don't want to
overtighten those guys & strip it out of the head. Make sure you
adjust your valves after doing this as well. It's a very easy
procedure & you should have no problem doing it, as long as you pay
attention. good luck.
