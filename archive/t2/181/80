After the girls put there hands in the paint they need to be able to get =
the paint off.  It is probably not a great idea to introduce real harsh c=
hemicals to this event, so I would steer clear of oil based, etc.  =20
I have been painting the inside of my bus with acrylics.  It looks great,=
 however, they probably will not hold up well to the weather the exterior=
 is subject to.
They have come out with new "oil" paints that can be thinned with water a=
nd clean up with soap and water.  I'm not to familiar with them, but it s=
ounds like you wouldn't be able to wash your car.
A friend of mine has a bus that he brings to concerts.  He leaves it in t=
he parking lot with some cans of regular water based house paints, some b=
rushes, and a sign that says please paint me.  It seems to hold up pretty=
 well to the elements.
Also, Poor Richard's paint jobs have made the papers.  I don't know what =
he uses, but you may be able to ask him.  I know he has a website, but I =
don't remember what it is.  Maybe he is on the list?
Hope this helped.

Good Luck,
Kyle

p.s.  If anyone lives in the bay area (or between the bay area and NC) an=
d would like to leave there mark on the inside of my bus let me know.  Th=
ere is plenty of paint and some space left.
