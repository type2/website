Hello All     I use only flourescent lites in my shop when I found out 85% 
shop fires were caused by cheap drop lites. Also there are good and bad the 
short stubby lites work the best. the ones with a hard outter case will eat a 
lot of bulbs. I get mine from Snap-on or Matco about $40.00 each, bulbs are 
about $12.00 each.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing salem Import Service
