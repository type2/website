Subject: Tennessee to Vermont in July

After two successful runs to Florida and weekly trips to Atlanta (totalling
a solid 10K miles), I'm making final preps for a trip to Burlington,
Vermont for the month of July. I'm leaving on the first and hope to be in
Massachusetts by the 4th and Burlington on the 6th. I'll be taking scenic
(slow) routes as much as possible, starting with the Blue Ridge Parkway.

I'm looking for places to stopover - first night I hope to make it as far
as Lynchburg, VA. Staunton/Charlottesville area would be nicer but I don't
know if I'll make it quite that far. On the second I hope to make it into
Pennsylvania (thoughts of hitting NYC to see the WTC site being delayed
until the trip back).

Any recommendations on routes through Maryland, Pennsylvania, NJ, NY? I'll
be staying with family in Massachusetts and friends in Burlington. I'd love
to hook up with other bus drivers in Vermont while I'm there.

Final preps for Portia: aux battery system, good mounting for my GPS, fan,
new carpet, replacing the Westy cooler (not fridge) with some homemade
drawers and a platform for my ice chest, and a new paintjob (Red, White and
Blue!). I'm considering putting in an external oil cooler in case I need to
run the interstates for time. My experience running from Florida is that if
the air temp breaks 90 degrees and I get stuck in traffic, regardless of
the speed my oil temp breaks 220 degrees. I'm not comfortable with that -
should I be?
