Listees

I am hoping to replace brake lines in my 71 tonight per Steve Dolans suggestion. My calipers seem frozen, but I understand it could be as simple as the lines being clogged, so new lines it is. I bought rebuild kits for my calipers and thought I would have them rebuilt while they were out of the bus. My brother was going to do it as a payback for a few favors I did for him, but its two weeks later, I'm sik of waiting for him and am dying to get my bus going (and stopping). 
So these are my questions:
1. Is there an easy way to tell, after I have replaced the brake lines if the calipers are ok, without having to bleed the brakes, find out they are'nt and start over? 
2. How hard is it to rebuild them, could I do it myself, with little knowledge and stength, but a good Air compressor?

Thanks All!
