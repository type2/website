Here's a few more:

People stopping by at 7:30 AM Saturday morning to
ask me if I'm interested in selling any of my VWs (just
2, no junkyard here)

Finding out *after* aquiring your first type 2 that it has many
1 year only parts and they cost 3x what previous years cost
(At this time I'd like to thank my good buddy Scott for the=20
freebie 78 FI engine :-)

Getting lectures from the drivers of gas guzzling super-tanker
urban assualt vehicles about how unsafe it is for me to ferry
my kids around in my type 2. (One person said "Imagine if MY car
ran into yours broad-side..."  My reply was "Maybe if you pull over
when you use your cell-phone that won't happen..."  She wasn't =
amused...)=20

PS- My goal is to get my bus running for the Phil & Friends show
in Raliegh next month.  When I used to tour, I always wanted a bus
and had intended to get one, 1995 changed all that and my focus returned
to type 1s.  Now I have one, and I'm damned determined to get there
if I have to drag it up there...
