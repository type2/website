Subject: Re: [T2] Painting Accelerator Pedal

Assuming you mean the rubber accelerator pedal and not the steel base - 
you've got two options.

You can either buy a new rubber pedal pad or "paint" or "dye" the old one. 
If you want to dye the old one go to the auto parts store and buy vinyl 
dye. It is different than fabric dye in a can. Both look like cans of spray 
paint.

I prefer to source my dye at the auto body shop supplier as the dye is 
better quality.

This is essentially a flexible paint.

I can be used on plastic, vinyl, and rubber.

Clean the surface very well with mineral spirits and then a light cleaning 
with lacquer thinner.

You could also use "bumper black" which is again a flexible paint for 
plastic and rubber (don't know if it is suitable for vinyl).
