I use a 20" single bulb fluorescent light fixture in my VW type 2 camping 
site.

It gives a nice 'warm' light and bathes the VW type 2 camping site with 
light, rather than a harsh incandescent light.

Great if there is electricity, but even so, there is a reasonably priced 
portable setup at Sam's for Father's Day.  And it does include a portable TV 
with radio, light, and gosh knows what else.

Sorry, I forgot the price, but it is under a bill.
