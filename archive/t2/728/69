Hi everyone,



First time post from a newbie 'down under".

I have a 76 bay camper with the 2litre type 4 engine and manual trans.
Engine has been rebuilt approx 25000km ago. Runs well - no unusual oil
consumption.

The issue - last night I noticed a patch of "oil" under the bus - usually
does not leak - but which smelt strongly of petrol.

On checking the oil level today, it was approximately 5 inches ABOVE the
full mark on the dip stick - again strong petrol smell. I have now drained
the oil - very diluted/runny.

I only changed the oil approx 200km ago - all seemed fine then.

Any suggestions on where to start looking? Also, if I refill oil should I
drive it the 5km to the shop - or have it towed??

Thanks for any advice.

Take care,

Mike

Peace and Love
