Subject: runs without FI

Sounds like a movie title....

I agree with Mike S. It'll idle and even rev a little like that, but it won't
push a load of any sort. While trying to track down the dying engine problem
(still haven't found it, grrr) I discovered in a similar way that the engine
will also idle and rev (albeit somewhat hesitantly) with the FUEL PUMP not
RUNNING. I had disconnected the terminals at the fuel pump to check for
voltage with a voltmeter (I didn't have alligator clips on my voltmeter) while
pushing the AFM lever with a screwdriver, and forgot to reconnect before I
went up front and fired the engine with the ignition key. While walking back
to the engine I noticed the voltmeter showing correct voltage at the fuel pump
and realized, "hey, the fuel pump's not hooked up, this shouldn't be
possible!" I almost had a Dr. Frankenstein moment of lifting my hands to the
sky and shouting, "It's ALIVE!"

Anyway, I figure now that idling was able to draw just enough fuel via vacuum
from the engine plus gravity feed from the fuel tank to keep it running. It
really didn't want to rev.

Now I understand that the idle curcuit likely lets the bus idle without an
AFM, but why did it keep running when I revved it a bit while standing still?
Shouldn't it stall?
