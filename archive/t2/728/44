Hi Chuck,

On your side of the country you will want to avoid ordering from the 
US. I've heard that customs takes up to 6 weeks or more on mail 
crossing the border in BC. Orders from GermanSupply.com or CIP1.com 
won't be a problem. If you can find a way to get your busdepot orders 
routed through Montreal or Toronto then you'll save time getting your 
stuff.

As for expenses.... Duty isn't all that bad but brokerage fees can be 
brutal. Avoid UPS at all costs for that reason. Fedex or US Postal 
Service are a much cheaper alternative.

Happy trails,
