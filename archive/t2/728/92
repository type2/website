Well, the cage was indeed rotating on it's collar, but that doesn't seem to
be the problem. :O(

I replaced the cage, but I still can't get into 3rd or 4th.  It appears like
the trannie isn't willing to transverse right (or left, I suppose) across
neutral into position for going into 3rd and 4th.  Like the path across
neutral is blocked somehow.  There's no "H" pattern anymore.

I was under the bus while my son put the shifter through it's paces and
noticed that there's a light sounding "tap" whenever you try to shift across
neutral into the slot for 3rd or 4th.  Like the hockey stick is hitting
something.

Is anyone familiar with something like this?  Here's hoping that I'm not
looking at a trannie job; I'm still paying for the engine job...
