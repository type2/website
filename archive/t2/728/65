Sorry for the delayed reply. I was waiting for the shipment to arrive so I
could see for myself rather than risk an incorrect answer.  Alas, our
shipment (which was due today) has now been delayed a week because some
bureaucrat in the customs department forgot to fill out a form (ARGH!!!!!),
so I thought I'd better reply with an "I don't know yet" rather than not
reply at all. :-)   I did notice, however, that Richard Atwell has a diagram
for making brackets on his website (www.ratwell.com).
