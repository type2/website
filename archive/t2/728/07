Gerald,

    I had a problem that left one of my front brakes rubbing ever so
slightly.  The pedal wasn't coming ALL the way back up after being
released and caused the rub.  Next time you use the brakes, after you
release the pedal put your toe under it and see if you can pull it up
any.  In my case it was just dried out grease on the pedal pivot
bushing and bolt that was causing too much friction.  I cleaned the
parts and regreased them and that fixed the problem.
