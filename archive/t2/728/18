Subject: Syncro de Mayo

Not sure if news of the Syncro de Mayo event in Hollister, CA (2 hours
south
of San Francisco) has spread to this list. Usually a handful of
bay window
buses show up.

More event info here: http://www.syncro.org/SdM_events.html

Please register on the
event web site if you'd like to attend.
Thanks,
Peter
