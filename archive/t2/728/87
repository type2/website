Hi Ron,

What's shipping to CO like for these tires? Would it be better for me to try
and find them locally?

Alex

You will find just about everything you need to know about Bus tires on my
Tire Info page:

Forr a short time we have the Hankook 195R14's for $69 each, which is $10
off the normal price.
