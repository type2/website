Subject: Re: [T2] A question about 4-speeding my automatic 3-speed

You guys keep it up and I'll be shopping for an automatic. 2 speeds (ala Powerglide)? No way... 3 speeds? Nah. 

4 speeds? You've got my attention but Audis are rare here in small town TN. 

With a 4 speed option I'd seriously consider going with an auto-box. A bit deal because I'd have to reverse rotation my Corvair implant. What's another 10 years on this project? <grin!>
