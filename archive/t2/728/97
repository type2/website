Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch

Isolate the problem. (for example, this is not the clutch :)
Disconnect the shift coupling and verify all the gears
at the transaxle output shaft. A vise grip pliers helps.
If the trans shifts, then reconnect the coupling and
make the adjustment at the shift rod base plate per Bentley.

If the gears do not shift at the disconnected trans
the problem will be internal, and requires the removal
of the nosecone to correct internal components.
