Subject: Rocker tip to valve tip offset: how to set ?

Putting back my rocker shaft, I noticed that most of the rocker tips were
on, or almost on the same "line".  I recalled seeing some advice to position
rocker tip a little offset from valve tip.  I checked and found back my
source in a Clymer book.  I believe this offset is to help the valve rotate
slowly on its seat (change position at the least) ant get more even wear
from the valve tip.

Does this recommendation just applies to mechanical lifters system for Type
1 engines or also to Type 4 mechanical or hydraulic lifter system (shims and
springs are different on the rocker shaft than for a mechanical system) ?
If yes, how to do the adjustement ?  Are there extra shims or shims of
different thickness available for the duty or should I use some used from
other rocker shaft ?  Thanks for you help.
