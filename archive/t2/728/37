Subject: RE: [T2] A question about 4-speeding my automatic 3-speed  

If the Audi 100s and 5000s (same car - just different name for the U.S.
market) used the same tranny, it's sucessor may have the tranny we are
looking for. Anyone out there who knows Audi A6 transmissions?

Exact same internals, right?  The case has to be different, unless the

Hey George   they were front wheel drives  the only difference is the bell
housing   I have seen some differences in the internal parts like pistons
and such  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
