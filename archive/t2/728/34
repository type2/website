What's causing you to be unable to reattach it?

When I had to reattach a rear shock, I remember it helped to put a floor jack
under the engine (with a nice piece of wood in between, of course).  I raised
the rear end of the Bus a few inches (NOT lifting anything off the ground, of
course!) which gave me enough room to reattach the shock absorber.
