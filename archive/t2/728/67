Hi Volks,

It took six days to live the adventure, and 5 days afterwards to find 
time to write about it.

I've posted it on the interweb because it's just a little too long for 
email,  and because with html formatting I can put some pictures online 
to go with it.

Here's the link:

Happy trails,
