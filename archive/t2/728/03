Subject: Rivi not quite ready for prime time

I was headed out earlier tonight (well, last night) and the Rivi informed
me it's not yet ready for an extended trip -- including no more towing.

I developed a "rubbing sound" that I can't pinpoint while in the drivers
seat. I assumed it was an old brake line clogging and holding a rear brake
in so I took it up on the highway to get up a little speed and see if I
could feel a warm hub after a short run or if it would vibrate loose and
stop making the noise if I cut the engine and coasted. It didn't stop
making the sound, and I can't feel a warm hub.

I suppose the Rivi thought I was headed on to Fredericksburg
(http://www.texasvwclassic.com) though because part way into the test run
the alternator light came on nice and bright. When I got home it took me a
few minutes to figure out where the damn belt went. It's curled up nice and
neat inside the fan. I didn't even touch it, just came on in and relaxed
for a while.

Back to the sound... I'll try to get a ride out to get my truck and ramps
and go ahead and replace the rubber brake lines but the sound gets louder
when I make a left turn and a LOT quieter after I straighten  up from a
left turn. It was too noisy around when I tried to hear if a right turn
changed the sound. Hope it's not a bearing or something. 

Jake (Raby) is also not hapy with the fact that the VDO CHT hovers between
400 and 450 at speed and around 350 at idle. I need to test another
gauge/sender. I, personally, think it's one or the other. The gauge
registers 150 after the bus sits 12 hours with an 80F degree outside temp
so I'm thinking at least 50F needs to be subtracted from any reading it's
showing. Maybe 100F.

Oh well, a few more bugs to work out.
