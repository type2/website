Karl, my owners manual says that it is either a
185SR14 Reinforced, a lighter tire with a lower
max inflation pressure, or a 185R14C, the heavier
tire with higher max loads and max pressures.
Some of the models specified only the 185R14C
(and older ones specificed 7.00x14 8PR).  

I've seen the Agilis and Cooper SRM's side by
side with older Conti's reinforced.  The
185R14C's had a noticeably stiffer sidewall.   Of
course, the reinforced tires were noticeably
stiffer than the two passenger tires I took off
also.  

You will not find a reinforced standard passenger
tire on the market in the US right now.  I think
that Conti CR21 was the last, but it's been
replaced with a 185R14C also.  This "midgrade
tire" has gone the way of midgrade gas at so many
service stations.  Like I said, if there any
185SR14 Reinforced tires or 205/70/14 Reinforced
tires available, I'm not aware of it?

Long live the tire FART (reverse psychology).
