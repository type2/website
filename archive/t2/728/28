not sure if this answers your question but i put a 70? sportsmobile top on my hardtop 76 bus with minor difficulty...
have pics as well if intersted in looking at it... will find them if you wish..to see them...?
it is possible yes indeed....

but i love the room it has now and my daughter loves the cot uptop... its huge for a 7 year old little girl...

I've always wanted a sportsmobile straight up style pop top. Brian has 
that 71 sportsmobile up for grabs. Could I transfer the sportsmobile top 
onto my 73 westy camper? Well, I know anything is possible, so I suppose 
I'm asking just how much of an undertaking it would be to do so. Just by 
looking at it, it doesn't look like the hole in the roof would be the same 
size.
