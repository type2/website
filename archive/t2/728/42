Subject: major engine problems need imput

so i drove my bus down to my vw mechanic and on the
way down there white smoke was coming out of my
tailpipe i called a friend and he reensured me it was
fine oil bring off from the winter. I gave my mechanic
a call a few days later and he told me started my bus
and the same problem the white smoke and oil was
coming out of the tailpipe and oil was leaking out of
the engine so he shut off the bus asap. Later on he
did a compression test and the results were  the
numbers were 150,150,75,75 we spoke and we decided
that he was going to pull the engine out on tuesday
and where he figures out what happened we were going
to talk again and make a decision can people write to
me and give me imput thanks again
