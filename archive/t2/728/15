Subject: Disc Brake Piston Retaining Plate

Hey Folks,
    Does anyone know of a source for these plates? I have replaced everything
up front on my '75 Westy, rotors,calipers, pads-but had to reuse the heavily
rusted retaining plates. I cleaned them up the best I could, but I would like
to get some (4) in better shape.   TIA, Jeff
