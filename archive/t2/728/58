it's basically cutting a hole the correct width and between the two
roof supports and bolting it down to the body. Several people have
questioned the fact that I don't have belly pans and cut a hole, but
to be honest the framework for the sportsmobile top seems quite
strong. I believe that Adams sportsmoblie top sits atop a sunroof bus
as well, so if I remember that correctly that's both a std pass bus
and a sunroof bus that they fit well on. Some assorted pics of the
