I have 10 or 20 spares I bought in bulk. I'll probably stick a new one on
since that one has been streching in place for 2 years with no use. I spent
today sleeping since I wasn't at the show and had spent yesterdy packing.

Replaced the CV's with rebuilt units from O'Reilly FLAPS. Played with the
new ones for hours feeling for ridges and such before I finally installed
them. I'm gonna have to get a helper to walk with me and listen for the rub
if it's not something visually evident. A Jeep driving friend suggested a
bent backing plate (or dust shield as he called it). Said he has to
straighten one  or the other of his after most off-road trips and it sounds
like he's grinding an axle in half until he does.

I'm still trying to thinl of something that would change sound when camber
changes in a turn though. And that thought keeps coming back to "bearing".
