Subject: [T2] Tire balancing for 69's

George's idea [below] is a very practical suggestion!  The tire shop I use has 
a balance machine on which the shaft diameter is 1 1/2 or 1 3/4 inches; gotta 
check that.  I was going to make an adapter, but an old drum has all the 
provisions in place.  Just have to be sure of the opening.  Thanks.....

Another approach is to mount the wheel on a front drum, and then to
balance the whole thing on the machine.  Any drum will do, worn out,
Beetle, etc. as long as it will fit over the spindle of the balancing
machine.
