From Nemo:
 
 You will not find a reinforced standard passenger
tire on the market in the US right now.  I think
that Conti CR21 was the last, but it's been
replaced with a 185R14C also.  This "midgrade
tire" has gone the way of midgrade gas at so many
service stations.  Like I said, if there any
185SR14 Reinforced tires or 205/70/14 Reinforced
tires available, I'm not aware of it?

Not trying to beat a dead horse, but quoting YOUR words:
" Agilis are reinforced 185R14C Commercial tires."

All I see are:
  " AGILIS 185R14C  1710 LBS
M+S Rated [Agilis 61]
DOT Approved for highway use.
99/97R
2 Ply polyester sidewall.
Made in Italy."
from Greg Potts and 

"  Agilis 81  185R14C
MAX LOAD SINGLE 850kg/1875lbs at 65PSI
MAX LOAD DUAL   800kg/1765lbs at 65PSI
M+S tubeless
8PR (I'm pretty sure that I was told that is 8 ply rating)
102/100M  weight rating
Made in France"
from Bob.

WHERE is the 'reinforced sidewall' that everyone, including you, is saying these tires have???

I am done with this fairy tale.
