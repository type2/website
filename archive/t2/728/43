Subject: Re: [T2] Tire balancing for 69's-wide 5's

I've actually done this.  It was the only solution that presented itself. 
First I got the tire shop to spin the bare drum to make sure it was balanced 
as it sat, then I had to bolt the drum to each wheel in turn, while the tire 
guy humored me. But, it worked. They are actually balanced. I bought an old 
front Beetle drum at a swap meet complete with lug nuts. It now hangs in my 
garage.

I'd love to take credit for it, but this idea is just another piece of
the List Lore that has collected over the years! :)
