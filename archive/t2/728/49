Hii Neal,

It's a good choice. I just finished an 1800 mile trip to EveryBus on a 
set of Agilis 185R14's... They performed excellently. I have previously 
run them in snow and slush and had no complaints.

For the two years before that I had been running M+S rated Continental 
RT-735's. Those had fine handling but the aggressive tread was a trifle 
noisy on the highway.

Happy trails,
