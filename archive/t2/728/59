Subject: Re: [T2] 73 westy to 71 sportsmobile pop top swap.

jason helped me out when i was cutting my top and sent me pics and such of his top and suggested that i leave the crossmember in and so i did and am glad ....
it gives lots of support at the end of the cot...
also what i did was when i cut my hole i left plenty of room for error...
in other words i cut the hole and made it small so that i could trim it up if needed be and actually i still havent finished it inside yet but you really cant tell but on the other hand i did not over cut the hole ...
less was more...
 
as far as the inside being sharp .. sounds crazy but i used 1/2 inch pipe insulation on the metal cuts inside and  now no getting cut... also the seal on the outside was broken and such and i checked on the seal at diffrent suppliers which seemed pretty high for a poor man per inch or foot cant remember now and well used the 1/2 inch pipe insulation on the outside for a seal as well and it works really well and looks kinda groovy to  hehehehe~!~ this was a suggestion made by someone else on the list and i found it to be a grateful idea.... sorry to whom gave the idea to me forgive me but thank you still working well the 1/2 inch pipe insulation for a seal a year later...
peace and love
chris

it's basically cutting a hole the correct width and between the two
roof supports and bolting it down to the body. Several people have
questioned the fact that I don't have belly pans and cut a hole, but
to be honest the framework for the sportsmobile top seems quite
strong. I believe that Adams sportsmoblie top sits atop a sunroof bus
as well, so if I remember that correctly that's both a std pass bus
and a sunroof bus that they fit well on. Some assorted pics of the
attachment.
