Your compression test indicates that you might have a broken ring that is
causing oil to be pumped into the combustion chamber and out through the
exhaust.
Alternate might be: Oil way overfilled and leaking into the combustion
chambers after sitting all night.
2) You parked on a big hill or slant and oil leaked past the pistons. 3)
Valve guides leaking real bad.
The Blow By of the compression will probably make the engine leak out the
valve covers, out the pushrod seals, out the crank case vent box and can
sometimes push past the rear crank seal into the fan area. It will also blow
out the oil dipstick tube.
Check your dipstick tube for crankcase pressure. If you have pressure the
air should sorta go puff puff at the tube end. At high RPM it'll probably
spray a little oil out.
