Subject: 30pict2 Troubles

I am having some troubles with my carb - It seems to idle and accelerate fine
so I hope that it is a setting that I have a problem with - I have to pump the
gas pedal to get the car to start or at least hold the gas pedal all the way
down- it still takes 5 - 6 seconds of the car cranking over to catch and then
I still have to hit the pedal or it acts like it's not getting enough gas
I have never had this trouble before usually they started right up without the
pedal
My ignition is fine - all the usual suspects have been checked
Perhaps the carb is sucking air without the throttle open

Any ideas
Eric
