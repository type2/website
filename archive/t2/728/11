Subject: Re: [T2] A question about 4-speeding my automatic 3-speed

Herb,

I have heard similar rumors and am very interested in learning what you find
out about. I have a 74 automatic project that could profit from a 4 or 5
speed automatic ...

This is what I heard: you need a late Audi transmission and the bus final
drive section. I have not heard from anyone who has actually done it nor do
I know which Audi tranny would work.

I believe that the waterboxer route is a dead end. When I had my engine
built by Kummetat in Germany 10 years ago we discussed transmission upgrades
(I was thinking about a manual 5-speed). But he told me that the waterboxer
trannies will not work in an a/c application because the transmission itself
is too long. Now, this was concerning a 74 bus - so it actually may work in
a Vanagon.

Hope this helps,
Marcus

Hi-
I have an 80 Vanagon with a 3-speed automatic. I like the auto a lot
after having many, many manual VW's in the past. My left foot and right
arm are getting lazy, I think.
Anyway, I've heard rumors that a 4-speed automatic can be installed in
its place. I'm willing to spend the money to do this since I think it
would take a load off of my motor (lower RPM), improve gas mileage and
allow me a greater (laugh) top speed.
