Hi Neal,
I use a dedicated Gmail account to read the type2 and vintagebus
emails. Gmail offers 2 GB of free storage which should be sufficient
to archive the next 10 years of mailing list traffic.
It is great to have the google powerful search engine to find the
relevant emails at google speed. It makes the email archive way more
useful.
I you'd like I can send you a invitation for a Gmail account.
