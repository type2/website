Subject: Re: [T2] 76 Bay - Fuel in Oil (Lots!)

The usual suspects  seem to be 1.) rich mixture, 2.) failing piston 
rings (allowing raw fuel past rings into case), 3.) cylinder not firing 
(allowing raw fuel to build up & bypass rings), 4.) Hole in piston.

Five inches above the full mark sounds pretty grim. Time to do a 
compression check no doubt to rule out a hole in the piston. I 
understand that blow-by (from a piston hole or bad rings) can cause 
enough pressure in the crankcase to force and oil leak.

One (of many) things I've never been clear on...and I suppose not 
related to your problem since you have a 76, presumably Fuel Injected, 
but maybe some kind soul will answer here...can a tear in the 
mechanical fuel pump diaphragm cause fuel to enter the crankcase?
