Sounds like a ruptured accelerator pump diaphram or clogged
accelerator pump circuit. Of course, vacuum leaks can cause all kinds
of trouble too.

 I am having some troubles with my carb - It seems to idle and accelerate

 so I hope that it is a setting that I have a problem with - I have to pump
the
 gas pedal to get the car to start or at least hold the gas pedal all the way
 down- it still takes 5 - 6 seconds of the car cranking over to catch and
then
 I still have to hit the pedal or it acts like it's not getting enough gas
 I have never had this trouble before usually they started right up without
the
 pedal
 My ignition is fine - all the usual suspects have been checked
 Perhaps the carb is sucking air without the throttle open
