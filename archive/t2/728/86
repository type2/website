The best tire for a 1971 Westy is the ;
Bridgestone  268917  603 V  185 R14  TLBL   PS  D
 
I bought these tires at  Firestone. I like the Idea that if I have a  
problem, I can go to any Firestone in the country and they will honor the  warranty..
They may have to order them for you. They are a little pricey, but they are  
worth it.
