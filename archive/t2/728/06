it's a lot more simple than you think. I've done it roadside with
little tools before. Just put the bus in 1st or 3rd to move the hockey
stock as far back as possible. Crawl under and loosen the nut that
holds it to the transaxle, and remove the thru nut that goes through
the cage. you might have to wiggle it a bit, but mine came right out.
there is an indention in the hocky stick that the set screw goes back
in so no need to mark where it came out. leave the shifter area alone.
