Subject: Re: [T2] 73 westy to 71 sportsmobile pop top swap.

     Well, for a number of years VW sent sunroof busses over to Westfalia 
for conversion into campers.  68-73 or 74, as I recall.  Is the sportsmobile 
a Westy conversion?  There is no info on it in the library.  If so, perhaps 
it uses the same sun-roof body and thus the same hole.  I looked at a bus 
with a straight pop in a junkyard once, but I don't know if it was 
Sportsmobile, or an ASI, or what.  That one used a sunroof body, though.  
You can tell if it's a sunroof body based on how the hole is cut out, 
whether it has the sunroof support structure and the place for the crank 
handle or not.

     Measurements couldn't hurt if it's not too much trouble, when you get a 
chance.
