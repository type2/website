Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch

I'm changing out the cage on the rear shift rod tomorrow and wondered if
there were any sage words of advice from the list to go along with the
experience.  I checked the archives but could only find a few oblique
references to the cage.

I've assumed that I have to loosen the collar that holds the front and rear
shift rods together in order to slide the rear rod forward enough to get it
out of the cage.  If not, how do I get enough slack to get the old cage out
and the new one in?

I'm also guessing that I should mark the position of the old cage before I
remove it, in order to get the new one to line up properly.  Sound good?

Any help appreciated.  Thanks!
