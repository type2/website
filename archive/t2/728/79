Subject: Re: [T2] 76 Bay - Fuel in Oil (Lots!)

 seems it stuck or something and caused gas in my oil...????
if one of my friends sees this today maybe he can narrow it down for you and
remember what my problem was?


Float/needle valve in one or both carbs sticking and allowing the fuel to flow
in. I just went through this with my carbs I rebuilt for my '74 engine.
