Hi Mike,

My bus will get above idle with the AFM unplugged if I accellerate 
gently. Wouldn't want to drive it like that though.

Happy trails,

For the FI gurus:
Well, I rolled the 78 Westy out of the garage (dead battery) down our 
hill next to the house to make room to work on replacing a friend's 
head gasket in a 70 Datsun.  (now I was glad aircoold's don't deal with 
this).  Wanted to drive it back in today, and used a charged battery to 
stick in there; involving removing the aircleaner/AFM to make room. 
Stuck it in, but then got distracted by having to go to town.  Came 
back, started the bus, and it idled with an odd "Blub...Blub..." sound 
that sounded rich, and I revved it, assuming it was because it hadn't 
been run in a month and it had to warm up- then UPS showed up with some 
Bus Depot stuff, and since I wanted to put in the new voltage regulator 
I turned it off. The old one was only charging around 13.8v max.  OOPS- 
the afm/air cleaner was still lying above the engine compartment!  Now 
I understand that the idle curcuit likely lets the bus idle without an 
AFM, but why did it keep running when I revved it a bit while standing 
still?  Shouldn't it stall?
