Those Audis were indeed "Subaru-style" FWD.  But with VW-style
automatics that's not much of an issu e -- the transaxle has two sections, 
one is the actual AT, the other is the differential carrier (which is also the 
bellhousing).  IIRC, the 003 AT was used on the Bus, Type3, Type4, 
Dasher and Rabbit .. all essentially the same *transmission* with different
diff carriers.

That said, I hear some of the Audi 5Ks had four planetary gears Vs. the
Bus/Vanagon three planetaries .. MmMmmm big motors.. >:-)
