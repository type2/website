Hi Gerald,

My bus threw an alternator belt just hours after I installed the 
sunroof engine into the westfakia. I put it back on and haven't had a 
problem since, which has been several months and many thousand miles.

The rubbing sound you hear could be an early warning from a CV joint. 
Have you serviced the CV's yet?

Happy trails,
