Subject: Koni shock install....

Finally getting around to installing a set of Koni's on the transporter.
One question though that I can't seem to get figured out.  The shock the I
took off the front has a narrower mount than the new Koni's.  The original
shock also had a spacer on each side of the shock which was then followed by
the washer and nut.  This is for the bottom mount.  Now, there is no way
that I can fit both spacer's on with the new Koni shock.  Is it ok to leave
these out?  I am not sure if this was the stock setup or something tossed
together as a fix.  The other side is the same.
