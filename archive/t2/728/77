>are your Agilis tires an Agilis 61 or 81   seems
I just bought some Agilis 81 tires but everyone
is telling me they don't exist??    I've looked
at my tires several times they deffinately say
"AGILIS 81" on them.

Who the heck says they don't exist.  They are a
highway tire, no all-season rating, and a
slightly heavier load-rating as I recall.  81
isn't as popular because it's not all-season.  

I received my email from Michelin regarding what
they recommend for our busses after last week's
FART.  They recommended both Agilis 61 and 81.
The email is at the bottom.   

>Michelin Agility tires, 

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.  Agility are passenger
tires.  Agilis are reinforced 185R14C Commercial
tires.    

>Is this a good choice? I want to know what size
that you guys are  using my camper bus had
195/70/14 

That is a tire for a Hyundai or Chevy Metro.

Looking for a 185R14 tire to fit my 1970 VW van

Which of your tires meet the manufacturers
stringent standards?

We believe the tire you are referring to is a
