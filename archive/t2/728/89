I used the Bridgestone 603's on two Westies before buying my first set of
Hankooks.  In general I liked them. They did very well on dry roads - very
nice handling and a quiet ride - and they wore well. However the Hankooks
felt more sure-footed on wet or icy roads (and were cheaper).  Having used
both tires extensively (two sets of the Bridgestones, three sets of the
Hankooks, on various Westies), I'd probably say it was a close call between
the two if the price were about the same (at least in relatively warm, dry
climates). But the price usually is not about the same; the Bridgestones
tend to be somewhat expensive.
