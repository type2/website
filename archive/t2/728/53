Yes, but I had to have the package in my hand before I new what to really
call the part. :O)

The new one has urethane bushings instead of the stock ones.  They appear to
fit the cage tighter.

No, the cage is rotating on it's collar.  I can get into 1st & 2nd, but not
3rd & 4th due to the rotation.  Without a safety wire in the bolt, I'm not
sure if this is the original 28 yo coupler or a replacement.  In either
case, it's got to be replaced.

Thanks.
