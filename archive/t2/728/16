Subject: 73 westy to 71 sportsmobile pop top swap.

     I've always wanted a sportsmobile straight up style pop top.  Brian has 
that 71 sportsmobile up for grabs.  Could I transfer the sportsmobile top 
onto my 73 westy camper?  Well, I know anything is possible, so I suppose 
I'm asking just how much of an undertaking it would be to do so.  Just by 
looking at it, it doesn't look like the hole in the roof would be the same 
size.
