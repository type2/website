Subject: Vanagon Expert - What year is it?

Hello,

I would like to get a original Vanagon, but I would like it to have the 
following:

1. Round headlights
2. Seven passenger with headrests
3. Shoulder style seat belts in the back row (i.e. not lap belt)


So what year(s) should I be looking at?

Thanks, Phil.
