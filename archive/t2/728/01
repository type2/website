Subject: Re: [T2] FREE 71 BUS for parts

Hey Volks -

Whoever takes Brian's free '71 Bus... if you don't need a steering gearbox and
the one in there happens to be in good shape (i.e. no excessive slop or
clunking/creaking/groaning noises), I would be absolutely thrilled to buy it.
At full market value.  I'll even make a donation to the list, too.  Really!

Desperately yours,

- Miles
