After all the discussion on Bus tires that has been on the list which I only 
glanced at and deleted, Today I decided I would put on four new Michelin 
Agility tires, Is this a good choice? I want to know what size that you guys are 
using my camper bus had 195/70/14 on it now but this might not be what I should 
use, thanks in advance Neal
