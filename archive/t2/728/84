Hi Karl,

Michelin might be bad at PR, but that doesn't mean they make an 
unsuitable product.

I just checked the codes on my passenger side front tire. I would have 
taken a pic, but it's raining out and it's too hard to get a decent 
photograph of a wet sidewall. Remind me again in a few days and I will 
have a try at a photo.

Here's the relevant info:
AGILIS 185R14C  1710 LBS
M+S Rated
DOT Approved for highway use.
99/97R
2 Ply polyester sidewall.
Made in Italy.

IIRC the date of manufacture of my tires is sometime in 2002. I could 
look again, but like I said, it's raining out.

Seems to me that this meets the bus specs just fine. It's just a shame 
this info isn't more widely available.


Happy trails,

Those people at Michelin need to put down the crack pipe and do a 
little research as to the info [BS] they are
spreading. If you go to their website, they ONLY show the 61 and it 
ONLY comes in 2 sizes...... again, NOT
recommended for a Vanagon because it does not meet the requirement
of reinforced sidewall. One of the 2 sizes IS 185R14/C. The C for 
commercial is one of the requirements in the
Westy owners manual, but why does Michelin NOT recommend this tire??

At one time, I did find the 81 listed but the only 2 sizes available 
were somewhere around 225 and 245. But
now it is no longer to be found.

I did find a listing for Agilis 61, 81, and 101 on the UK Michelin 
website but no info about them.

"Michelin Agilis 61, 81 and 101: for medium and heavy vans

  Built to take everyday shocks

  Exceptionally robust

   Resistant to shocks and kerb scuffing due to a double kerb protector, 
ribs to preserve sidewall markings, a
new specially resistant rubber compound and a substantial thickening of 
the sidewalls (+4mm).
   Adaptated for heavy loads with a polyamide-reinforced tread area and 
an increased contact patch area.

  ... For more miles than ever

   Regular, even, tread wear due to a 12% broader tread and specific 
orientation of the grooves and sipes

  Versatility

   Better grip on all types of surface.
Grooved tread for improved traction.

  Speed symbols

   R, Q, M "

They mention a 'thickening of the sidewalls +4mm' but no other info.

Perhaps a 'thickening of the sidewall' does not mean 'reinforced 
sidewall'?  Or else they would recommend them
in their LITERATURE that they seem to always want you to READ??

The 'reinforced' does appear, but it refers to the tread only.

If you do a little searching on the UK website and look for tires for a 
late model Vanagon, the Carat, they DO
list 2 tires that specifically say reinforced, the Energy XT2 
Reinforced and the Energy MXV3A Reinforced. The
KEY word after each is Reinforced! But these seem to be available only 
in Europe.....

Down below, you wrote "Agilis are reinforced 185R14C Commercial tires." 
  right after the line that starts
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

WHERE does it say ANYWHERE that this is a REINFORCED tire???  Michelin 
does not say it.  Where are you getting
this info?  Your reply from Michelin does not say it. They only mention 
load index.

Sorry to harp on this, but someone has to have the correct info.

are your Agilis tires an Agilis 61 or 81   seems
  I just bought some Agilis 81 tires but everyone
  is telling me they don't exist??    I've looked
  at my tires several times they deffinately say
  "AGILIS 81" on them.

  Who the heck says they don't exist.  They are a
  highway tire, no all-season rating, and a
  slightly heavier load-rating as I recall.  81
  isn't as popular because it's not all-season.

  I received my email from Michelin regarding what
  they recommend for our busses after last week's
  FART.  They recommended both Agilis 61 and 81.
  The email is at the bottom.

Michelin Agility tires,

  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.  Agility are passenger
  tires.  Agilis are reinforced 185R14C Commercial
  tires.

Is this a good choice? I want to know what size
  that you guys are  using my camper bus had
  195/70/14

  That is a tire for a Hyundai or Chevy Metro.
