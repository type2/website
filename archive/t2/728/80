??? now I'm really confused, this 81 has tread that looks like a snow
tire, huge deep lugs. lots of room between em too. will check the tire
sidewall again (when it stops raining) but I asked for and was told it was
an all season tire, and looking at it I have no reason to doubt it..

but wouldn't be the first time I was lied to, although this sales person
has been taking care of my tires on this and my wifes car for many years
and he had to special order them so he would have no reason not to get
what I wanted.
