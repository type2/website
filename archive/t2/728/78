either way good luck bro

Thanks to all so far...

The bus has the dual solex carbs (we did not get FI on a bay in Aus).
Standard mech fuel pump.
Both carbs were refurbished and fitted approx 20k ago in place of a single
webber. Interestingly, the left carb is a little discoloured externally (not
wet) but the right carb is very clean. I have changed the oil - will let it
sit for a while and see what happens. I should have stated earlier that the
bus has only been driven about 5km since the last oil change and then sat in
the driveway (level). The trip was to fill the fuel tank from near empty -
so the tank is full.
Pistons, cyls,rings and heads all new last 20,000km. When I last drove it
the 5km the engine was running fine - all 4cyls, smooth, no smoke etc.
I too am keen to learn if a split fuel pump diaphragm will leak fuel into
crank case....
Regards, Mike



Peace and Love
