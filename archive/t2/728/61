You will find just about everything you need to know about Bus tires on my
Tire Info page: 

<http://busdepot.com/busdepot/details/tires.jsp>

Forr a short time we have the Hankook 195R14's for $69 each, which is $10
off the normal price. These are the tires that outperformed the Michelin
Agilis reinforced tires in an independent German road test.
