After driving the bus around the neighborhood unsuccessfully trying to get
it into 3rd, I pulled back into my drive and got under to see if everything
was right.

I pulled the set screw out of the cage and made positively sure it was
centered in the hole in the trannie shaft.  Then I played around a bit with
the shifter.

Since I needed to go down to the grocery store and the FLAP (to get some
safety wire), I decided that one more trip at 30 mph wouldn't hurt.

Imagine my complete surprise when the bus slipped nicely into 3rd!  Whatever
was wrong, isn't now.  There's a bit of not meshing 100% sometimes when
going into or out of 3rd (a quick grind as it goes into/out of gear), but
that may be my driving and not the trannie.  The shift pattern has changed
considerably with the new parts in place.

Thanks for the advice and help, gang.

Back on the road again...
