 I did get the note from Karl about rocking arms, but I still can't figure
 out WHEN to adjust.

 I mean, how do you tell the arms are rocking when you can't  rotate the
 engine back and forth and put your fingers on the two arms to see/feel them
 rocking!!  It is a two man job.

One man job with a remote starter button connected to the solenoid.
Like this..... or you can make one:
http://buy1.snapon.com/catalog/item.asp?P65=&tool=diagnostics&item_ID=11306&group_ID=1476&store=snapon-store&dir=catalog

Rotate engine in direction of rotation. Watch any pair of valves.
When the exhaust JUST starts to open, STOP, adjust that cylinders intake.
Rotate engine, exhaust will open, then close, then intake will open and close. JUST as the intake is closed,
STOP, adjust that cylinders exhaust.

Move on to the next pair.
Exhaust just starts to open, adjust intake.
Intake closes, adjust exhaust.

Piece a cake.
