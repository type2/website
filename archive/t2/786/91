I'm putting this up for my dad. He's decided to sell his 67 Beetle and
77 Bus and buy an earlier split window. The bus is really solid and runs
great, with a new engine with less than 10K on it. Can be used as a
daily driver or fixed up for shows. Only bad news is it does need a new
paint job as the paint now is just worn down and oxidized. I built a
little webpage for him so you can see more about the bus at
http://www.aomc.com/dadsbus.htm He's asking $5500.

Thanks!
