Meg,
The difference is that one fits a Bus and one does not.  The AL79X fits
Rabbits and other watercooled cars.  The AL75X fits most 72-up Busses.
(There is also a higher-output AL108X found on some later model Busses,
although this is less common.) If you choose your year/model from the
drop-down menu on busdepot.com, then you can avoid inadvertantly viewing
parts that don't fit a Bus. Also, if you click on the part listing and
scroll down, there is a list of what vehicles the part fits.
