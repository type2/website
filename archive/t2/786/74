Thanks Dave... problem is that I tried the next size up from 1180mm and it
was too small... not too big.

Napa went back and said something like...ok, the next one down is 1165mm 
and the next one 11xx mm....

You do know that they will eventually stretch quite a bit and if you can 
just get it over the pulley and then the A/C pulley and then adjust, 
you will be good to go.
