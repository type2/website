I have not used them, but there is a place that
does restoration (most especially Mustangs) in
Chepachet, RI.  I did drop in -- they really do 
do restorations of some sorry hunks of rust.

Their web page is itself a sorry hunk of bits,
but here it is:

If you use 'em, lemme know.  I'm nearby and
am thinking wistfully...
