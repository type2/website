When I rebuild an engine or have to lie underneath for any length of 
time, I lead a wire from terminal 50 on the solenoid into the engine 
compartment with just enough length to reach the + terminal of the 
battery. I usually solder a male banana plug onto this end and put a 
plastic sheath of some kind over the banana plug. When I want to 
remotely start the engine, I just turn the ignition switch one click 
to the on position and return to the back to momentarily touch the 
banana plug to battery +. When I just want to turn over the engine 
without starting, I don't turn on the ignition switch.
Cheap. Effective.
