Subject: Yellow Bucket - Rare Westy accessory?

Hello all..

I went to a car show this weekend and saw a *really* nice '75 Westy..
The owner, having saw my '74 Westy was very excited and we checked out
each others vans. When I opened the back seat I saw a rather unique
yellow bucket.. I say to myself "hey. that's really weird, I have the
same yellow bucket!"  The other bus owner explained to me that it came
with mid-70's Westies and they were extremely rare. He said it took him
several years to find one. I was kinda skeptical and thought it was just
a (very weird) coincidence. How could I never have seen another one of
these before?

I came home and did some investigation and found this page on type2.com:

HOLY CRAP! It's the same bucket! He was right!

I immediately went back and looked at the pictures I took when I first
brought the bus home (again, these pictures prove useful).. Sure enough,
It was sitting in the back with some parts in it, mostly nuts and bolts,
and a lot of grease. My bus was a junk collection unit of the PO when I
bought it so I didn't think much of a lot of the parts that were in it.
I put the bucket on the storage shelf under my workbench and its been
sitting there  for the past 6 years. This morning I cleaned it up and
took some pics.

Anybody know what one of these is worth? It's in good shape (it is a
bucket and has been used as such). Might I be able to sell it to fund
some needed repairs?

Are there any other similar items that came with westies that I may have
overlooked when I got my bus?


Thanks for readin'!
