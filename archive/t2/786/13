Subject: Re: [T2] Wife sez the bus isn't reliable enough to go to

This may annoy some on the list but ...

Some here *love* busses so much that they have to own more than one.
Which often also means they own more than one that needs work.

When I see how hard it gets to find time to maintain my only bus given
my relatively untroubled life (wife is easy on me, no kids, family
sits across oceans :-). I wonder how you guys do it - or maye not do
it.

Happy aircooling
