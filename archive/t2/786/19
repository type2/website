Subject: Heads.....and stuff

I have changed my mind again.  I have run the gambit of options, new engine, rebuilt, rebuid my own.  So I have decided to just replace the heads.  I have a serious leak from the valves on the left side.  
 
So if I do a compression check and it comes out to spec, can I assume the internal stuff is ok and will last for many miles?
 
What other things should I check for with the heads off?  Any articles out there concerning the specifics of changing the heads?
