Subject: locking gas cap key

Hello all,

Had abit of a scare this weekend when I pulled into the gas station to 
fillup.  I currently only have one key (lost the 2nd key last year).  I keep it in 
the ash tray.  Anyways, it was gone.  We went straight home and searched. Long 
story short... we found it.  My 8 yr old had taken it out. 

I was wondering if anyone could help me obtain a spare key or key blank for 
my gas cap. The cap itself is stamped with the following:
ohne
Blau
Lufturg.
The key I have still has it's number on it. It is stamped 218.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks,
