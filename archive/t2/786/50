It was a compromise because I don't have the cross over system: it rusted off back in 1990.

If I had that y-pipe at the end, I suppose I could have removed test plug, drilled and welded a bung in there. The o2 sensor would be facing directly at the ground and as the cable only bends so much I don't think it's an ideal location. Drilling it elsewhere probably would be better.

For those that require a cat anyway, I'm interested in the variations.
