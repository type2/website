Subject: Re: [T2] Thermostats for $55 found

Karl- Good question. I have one of the new Mexican wax pellet thermostats. 
This is the second time I've heard this. Do you think I should dump it in 
favor of an original for that very reason? It's been working fine up to now, 
but I don't need to lose my new engine...

 in reponse to:

You can get them for $22.95 from Donsco VW.

My question:

Are these the original style bellows thermostats? That fail in the open 
position.

Or the new style wax pellet thermostats that fail in the closed position?
