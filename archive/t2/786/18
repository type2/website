Subject: RE: '79 A/C Fan Belt Size - Update

I went to a VW parts counter the other day and they could not find this
information in their files on their PC.  They called VW (some central info
service) - they (VW) told the parts person that there were many varieties of
A/C installed back then, so they could not provide me with the information I
need.

 

Their suggestion, like many of the folks I've talk to, was to tie a
string/rope around the pulleys and then try to measure the correct length.
Then I'll have to do some test fitting with belt sizes up and/or down to
find the right belt. What a PIA.

Group,

 

I've got a '79 Westy with dealer installed A/C and I am in need of a fan
belt for it. someone had suggested an 1180mm belt would work - well I tried
that yesterday and it is too short.  I did a search through the archives and
could not find a reference to belt size.  I will agree with many of the
posters that the process to put this belt on is a PIA.  I found a number of
folks in the archives that seem to have '79s with A/C and I hope you don't
mind that I bcc'ed you but I hoping that you would have this info at hand.

 

Thanks in advance to all for your help.
