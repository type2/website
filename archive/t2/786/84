Subject: Re: [T2] Where would you buy them?

I would love to do away with the smog stuff.  Does that cause any other issues?  I have asked in the past about how much can I remove without causing problems, but I have received conflicting responses.
 
 
Since I don't have heads without smog ports can someone tell me the part number for said head.

Hi Don,

Why not use the 1972 1.7L heads and do away with the smog pump ports?

I had a smog-pumped 1.8L that had the ports capped off, it was a 
major PITA because it would pop the #3 plug after something like 
12-20 hours of operation.


Happy trails,
