Subject: 69 Bus rear crossmember and picture request

"When you say cross member?  Assume you're speaking of the rear engine
hanger??  If so.have a couple of spares available."

Well now that you mention it I do need that too.  The big part is the sheet
metal piece that you take out first when removing the engine.  Mine did not
come with it.  I think in one of the books they call it the rear crossmember.

Thanks,

Stephen
