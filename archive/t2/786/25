Subject: transmission pan (need help fingding one)

Im looking for an automatic transmission pan for a 79 bus
If any one has any ideas of where to find one I would appreciate it.
I think the early vanagons and rabbits use the same one.
Visited the local junkyards this weekend and came up empty.

thanks
