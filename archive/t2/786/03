Hi Barry,

You can do this yourself... You jack up one wheel, put the bus in  
gear and chock the other wheels. Remove the spark plugs to lower  
compression and you will be able to turn the engine using the rear  
wheel with a perfect view of the valve train.

My Dad used to do valve adjustments that way on Mom's 71 westy.

Happy trails,
