Wayne,

Back in the archives someplace is the size info stuff....basically what I 
did was go back and ask them for the next two smaller lengths and then go 
home and try them.

I took the one back that didn't fit....no problem.

Napa went back and said something like...ok, the next one down is 1165mm 
and the next one 11xx mm....

You do know that they will eventually stretch quite a bit and if you can 
just get it over the pulley and then the A/C pulley and then adjust, 
you will be good to go.

I have actually had to loosen the York from the bottom mounts and twist it 
sideways to get an original belt on....then torque it back around, put the 
other bolts on the bottom...snug them up and then see how it looked....you 
will have to adjust it again in 1,000 miles of A/C useage.

Do *not* strip the threads out of the  York!

That was with the dpd mount....vpc is different.

Cheers, dave
