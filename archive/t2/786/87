Subject: Gas Cap Key - '72

I took my gas cap key to my '72 to the local Fischers hardware store, and I 
had 2 extras made from their stock.  No problem-o.

This site has pictures of gas cap keys./  See the fifth line of keys.  They 
rekeyed an igntion cylinder to my other key for the doors.  They are usually 
at local Maryland / Pennsylvania shows.
