Billy,

Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks!

I suppose that there are no numbers on the belt that are readable... I guess
that would be too easy.  What I need is the belt length and the width.

Thanks again for your help.

Wayne,

I have an a/c belt from a dead (77?) bus engine that had a a/c compressor
mounted to it.
I have since ditched all the a/c gear except the belt for some reason.

I could send you the belt, or measure it, just tell me what dimensions you
need.  I don't mind cutting it to take a good I.D. if that's what you need.
