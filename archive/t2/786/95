Subject: Mixing and matching heads.

I've got a 2.0 engine in my Beetle and am considering putting 1800cc heads (I think they have the bigger valves of the 1.7/1.8/2.0 heads). 

Anyone done this and what were the results. Am planning a W-110 cam (a hair wilder than stock) and will be running carbs. 

Wondering if it was worth the trouble (head scratching, boring the heads to accept the 2.0 jugs, thinking further about the cam, heads, exhaust mix).
