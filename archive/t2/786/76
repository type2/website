To be honest I suspect that this may have been a case of either the muffler
or cat having had a flange that was welded off-axis at the factory. If my
memory serves me correctly we may have had another similar complaint at some
point, but even if I'm right and it was a couple, that would be a couple out
of many. This leads me to suspect that these were isolated cases (i.e. a bad
batch) rather than the norm.
