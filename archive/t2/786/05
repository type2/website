Hmmm.  I just take the engine to TDC, then wiggle the rockers on #1.  If
they have a bit of play you are in the right spot.  If not, rotate the
engine one full turn of the crankshaft and wiggle again.

Once you get #1 at TDC, adjust the valves, rotate the engine 180 degrees
counterclockwise, adjust #2, rotate the engine 180 degrees
counterclockwise, adjust #3, rotate the engine 180 degrees
counterclockwise, adjust #4.

I don't pull plugs, as the engine is easy enough to turn with a wrench.

Tried a remote starter switch once, but never could get the thing to stop
at the right spot.  I think that requires pro reflexes!
