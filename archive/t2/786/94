Subject: Lapping Valves

Well, since decent used 1700 heads for less than what I paid for my whole
bus are nowhere to be found, I've decided to repair what I've got.

I have a 1700 head that was sent to me by another list member months ago
that is fine except one of the intake valves fails my Windex test (allows
the fluid past the seated valve). The spring heights are all ok and the seat
appears fine. The other 3 valves in that head are all seating nicely as
well.

So tonight I'm going to pull the head apart and see if lapping that leaking
valve (assuming no cracks or anything are hiding underneath) fixes things.
If so, that's the head I'll put on my bus. (Yes, I'm going to cc both heads
to make sure they're close in volume.)

My question is, should I lap the other valves while I've got it out? And do
the other head while I'm at it? Both heads need to come off anyway so I can
finally fix that busted exhaust stud and lapping isn't terribly time
consuming. Just wondering if it's a good idea, or if I should leave well
enough alone.
