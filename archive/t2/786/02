Subject: 69 Bus rear crossmember and picture request

Howdy,

I just bought a 69 Westy and was wondering if anyone knew if you can get a rear
crossmember for a 69 aftermarket or will I just need to hunt around? Any ideas
where?  Also the PO fit a bigger engine in there and cut some metal out and I'm
not positive what is missing.  Does anyone have a good picture of the engine
compartment of a bus around 69 without the crossmember attached and maybe the
engine out?

Thanks for the help,

Stephen
