I was working on another bus last weekend trying to tune it up pass it's smog test. It had failed the first test and I felt the only way to help ensure it didn't fail a second time was to use my wide-band oxygen sensor and drive the bus at the same 15 and 25mph speeds the dyno test performs.

My sensor is installed in the u-bend of my 78 exhaust:

I had resigned myself to swapping this part over to the 76 bus but we hit a major roadblock: although the heat exhangers had been removed in the past, three of the 6 fasteners were factory originals. In other words, everything rusted so badly we were never going to be able to get it off without removing most of the exhaust system to work it into submission in the garage.

We took off the bumper and noticed that the catalytic converter had a rusty section on it. Wondering where the exhaust sensor on the 79 CA and Vanagon CA models was mounted (I thought I saw one on the cross over pipe at the junkyard once) we attempted to remove the plug with a 22mm flare nut wrench and sure enough what came out was the reminant of an old oxygen sensor the mechanic had used to plug the hole when he installed the cat.

Here's a photo of the cat from the worldpac catalog:

It's used on 75-79 FI beetle, 77-78 Bus, 79 Fed Bus and 80-83 Federal Vanagon NONE of which use an oxygen sensor for their FI system.

I'm not sure if the mfgr has goofed or is simply and more probably is using the same cone on this unit they use on several others.

I'd like to hear from anyone who's purchased a cat recently that wasn't made by Emico. I'd like to know if those units have a bung for the O2 sensor also.

This addition is a great convenience for tuning with a wide-band tester.
