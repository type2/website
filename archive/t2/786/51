The version I usually carry (my part number 22916, $99.95) is not from Emico
and does not have a port for the 02 sensor. As you said, it is not supposed
to. But I can get the Emico, and have dropshipped their version periodically
when we were out of stock on our usual one. Out of a number of Emico's
dropshipped at various times, I did get one fairly recent complaint that the
Emico cat the customer received had a hole for an 02 sensor, as shown in the
above pic. The customer was not all too happy about this, as he did not have
anything to fill it with. So I don't know if this is now common to
current-production Emico's (which wouldn't make sense, as it renders the cat
unsuitable for most Bus owners, who would not have anything to plug the hole
in the cat with) or whether they just had an "odd" batch.

If you want an 02 sensor port in your cat, there is another way to get it,
although it involves replacing your muffler as well. Order my 22918 cat
converter ($99.95), which is for an '83-85 1.9 liter Vanagon (among other
applications). This cat comes with an 02 sensor port AND a plug to fill that
port if you aren't putting an 02 sensor there. This cat connects to the
muffler via a flange. Then order the matching Vanagon muffler (025251053EAN,
$79.95) instead of the stock 75-83 aircooled muffler. This muffler is
precisely the same as the aircooled one except that it has the a flange to
accept the 22918 cat.  Other than the connection between the cat and muffler
being a flange, this combination will look/fit/cost exactly the same as our
aircooled ones, but will add an 02 sensor port (and will include a plug to
fill it if not used).
