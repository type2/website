Hi all,

We're in the final stages of preparations for the upcoming BNNTA VW camping
weekend.  From our end, the printing is done, trophies are here, the event
t-shirts turned out beautiful, our event's '59 Panel Bus is all loaded up with
tents, bikes, event supplies and door prizes for the trip to the lakeside
campground.  The initial weather forecast looks great, so we're getting
excited to see everyone again for a long holiday weekend full of Type 2 and VW
camping fun!

If you need any info on the event, please visit our simple web site:
http://www.bnnta.com    There is a Mapquest link at the bottom that should
direct you right to the location on Mark Twain Lake (about 30 miles due west
of historic Hannibal, MO).  As at past events, I've leased the entire group
campground at the Indian Creek recreational Area right on the Lake and we will
again restrict access to only VW's of ANY kind or era!  When you wake each
morning, all you'll see are Volkswagens and their happy owners.  The Corp of
Engineer Rangers are looking forward to our arrival, and have even offered to
block traffic during our Saturday scenic caravan across the Cannon Damn as we
cruise over to tour Hannibal.  I imagine that there will be fierce bribing for
votes for the various BNNTA Bus Awards, especially in the hotly contested Best
Group Theme Camping awards.  It'll be fun to see what your campsites will be
decorated as...

We wish everyone a great Labor Day holiday weekend wherever you'll be, and
hope that you have a safe journey to join us at BNNTA or wherever you'll be
travelling to!
