>What do I win?

A few grams of karma

Actually, he said  ' push rod '   I took the rocker assembly off and checked 
everything, and except for some wierdly worn adjustment screw feet, all 
looked fine.  I buttoned all up [with a torque on the rocker stud nuts of 11 
ft/lb] and the horrifying noise was gone, but a very loose valve was making 
itself known that it wanted attention.

Since I have vey little experience with solid lifters and valve adjustments, 
I am going to ignore it until I can get someone from around here to help me.

I did get the note from Karl about rocking arms, but I still can't figure 
out WHEN to adjust.

I mean, how do you tell the arms are rocking when you can't  rotate the 
engine back and forth and put your fingers on the two arms to see/feel them 
rocking!!  It is a two man job.

But this valve is so far out that it will be easy to fid by an experienced 
VW guru.

But not me .. .
