Subject: RE: [T2] RE: '79 A/C Fan Belt Size - Update

Take the belt to a FLAPS. They can put it on a tool that will duplicate the pulleys and give you an accurate size. We had one at Advance Auto once upon a time. Looks like a big aluminum ruler with a fixed plastic radius at one end and a sliding radius at the other end with markings to divine the length and the width of the belt. Are you sure the archives don't have the right size in them? Seems like someone solves this mystery each summer.
