Though, as I found out when I did this conversion on my '82 Federal Westy,
the flanges on the catalytic converter and muffler are oriented in such a
manner that the tail pipe must either point dramatically off the horizontal,
either up or down.  I solved this by cutting the flange off an old tail pipe
and having the two pieces re-welded.
