Richard,

 

That is very cool, thanks!  Mine does use the York compressor - I'll check
with VW and see if I can get the belt.

 

BTW, what does VPC stand for?

 

One again you come through with the info - thanks again!

 

Wayne

I went to a VW parts counter the other day and they could not find this

information in their files on their PC. They called VW (some central info

service) - they (VW) told the parts person that there were many varieties of

A/C installed back then, so they could not provide me with the information I

need.

 

The fiche says the part number was ZVW 219 222. This would be the VPC
installation that used the York compressor.
