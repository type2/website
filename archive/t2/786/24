Subject: RE: [T2] RE: '79 A/C Fan Belt Size - Update

Thanks for you suggestion.  I would take the belt to my local FLAPS if I had
a belt to take ;-) - my bus came without the belt.

I did a search in the archives... there is much discuss about the A/C units
and how difficult it is to get the belt - but I could not find the specs.
As I mentioned in my first email, I did get a belt size from someone, but
when I tried to put the belt on, I found it to be too short.

Thanks again,

Take the belt to a FLAPS. They can put it on a tool that will duplicate the
pulleys and give you an accurate size. We had one at Advance Auto once upon
a time. Looks like a big aluminum ruler with a fixed plastic radius at one
end and a sliding radius at the other end with markings to divine the length
and the width of the belt. Are you sure the archives don't have the right
size in them? Seems like someone solves this mystery each summer.
