	Whatever you go for, if you have room around it, glue slabs 
of expanded polystyrene (sometimes called 'styrofoam') to the sides, 
bottom & top.  2" fine, 4" better.  The frig will then run far less 
often, because coolth leaks out slower.
	If it has a semi-detached radiator at the back, slip in 
between that and the cold chest a sheet of what we call gib-foil  - 
gypsum-core 'drywall' with shiny foil on the side facing the warm 
radiator.   This inhibits the heat radiating off the radiator from 
rushing straight back in where you've just pumped it out from.
	BTW the really modern frigs have the radiator buried in the 
wall, so that adding insulation outside will not help.  Bastards make 
it so you can't soup it up!  Twisted, eh?
	If you can arrange the warm air rising off that radiator to 
pass up over a towel rack, it will dry a small towel overnight.  May 
as well get some use out of that waste heat  ...
	And if the air sucked up that warm-air flue at the back of 
the frig comes from a cool place (thru an open-texture aircon filter, 
to exclude dirt & insects), that will make the frig run even less 
often.  You'll end up practically generating electricity with it =-O
