Subject: Re: [T2] Flywheel and Clutch

Those nubs are dowels that are necessary for centering the pressure 
plate assembly properly onto the flywheel.  The slightest lateral 
movement of such a large piece of iron on your rotating assembly will 
induce vibration that will cause excess wear to your main bearings.  I 
would never put a clutch together without all three pins.  I agree with 
Jim Arnott that your pressure plate assembly should already be drilled 
for the dowels, and I bet your old flywheel also has the holes for the 
dowels.  I would never put a clutch together without all three of those 
pins.
