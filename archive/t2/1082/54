remember how many clicks you tightened the wheel so that you can return
it if it doesn't help.

So....this tightening of the wheel business...where could one, if one were
so inclined, find some how-to info? Any link or somethin' would be soooo
appreciated. I have a fuel injected '77 and am having a little bit of a hard
time finding the resource I need to learn about the fuel mixture "thingy".
hee hee! You see...I would like to get a lil' bit more kick for them
straight-aways...like maybe 65mph at 396F instead of 55mph (I like living on
the edge).
