Subject: Re: What are these holes for?

Was asked:

What are these holes for in the engine tin of a 1975 FI bay but
NOT in a 1978 FI bay?

I have a 1975 FI bay that was a basket case. I'm in the process of
installing the tin but I can't figure out what the large feed thru holes are
for in the right rear and left rear engine tin.

 Bentley does not show any holes. I also searched internet and the Type2
archives - but know luck.

 I have a 1978 FI bay, it does not have these holes.

------------------------------

Bentley kind of mentions it but not completely.



75 to 76 1/2 uses preheated air to the air cleaner when cold. To do this,
there is a preheater pipe attached to the cross-over pipe. See Bentley section
5, page 15. Mid 76: from vin 226 2077 584 and build date 1/76 and later did
away with it. The holes in the tin are for paper tubes to the air cleaner. See
Bentley section 10, pages 26 and 27. Figure 6-1 and 6-2 shows the right side
hose. Figure 6-4 shows where the left side hose connects.
