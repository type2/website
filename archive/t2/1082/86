Pretty dry area where it lives - ideal for no-rust.
Seems like it should be
easy to catch a vandal in a town that small - probably either the mayors kid,
the police chiefs kid or the preachers kid so it wouldn't help to catch 'em!
Somebody will bet a great deal!

 Here's the deal....
 
 My friend Pat
has this '81 hardtop Riviera full
 camper.  Bed, sink, three way reefer, porta
potty,
 stove, etc, etc, etc. Air-cooled automatic. BA-6.  No
 rust. Starts
and drives just fine.  Put new heads on it
 not too long ago. Nice rig with a
nice layout. Hardtop means
 that it'll fit in a normal height garage.
 
 Pat's
had it for sale for a couple years with few nibbles
 because (I suspect) of
where we are. (NE Oregon.  Out
 in the sticks.  Elgin, Oregon to be precise.)
Last night vandals tossed a rock into the windshield and
 now Pat just wants
it gone. So....  Here's what he's
 asking.  He needs a 1600 type 1 motor for
his
 bug.  Bring him a good running 1600 DP motor and take
 an '81 ASI Riviera
home with you.
