  Bentley kind of mentions it but not completely.

  75 to 76 1/2 uses preheated air to the air cleaner when cold. To do this,
there is a preheater pipe attached to the cross-over pipe. See Bentley
section 5, page 15. Mid 76: from vin 226 2077 584 and build date 1/76 and
later did away with it. The holes in the tin are for paper tubes to the air
cleaner. See Bentley section 10, pages 26 and 27. Figure 6-1 and 6-2 shows
the right side hose. Figure 6-4 shows where the left side hose connects.
