Subject: 1974 Westy

Hi all, a 1974 Westy was just added to the inventory at Everett's junk yard
in Brockton, MA on Thatcher Street, just behind Massasoit Community College.
The rear bumper and windshield are toast, but the rear hatches are almost
pristine and front doors are in great shape. The upholstery is in excellent
condition. The front seat has a small patch in it. It is orange in color.
The engine and tranny has been sold, the rest of the bus can be had for
$500.00 according the junk yard, but I think that's kind of steep. The Z bed
looks to be in good condition, at least it opens and closes and most of the
interior is still there. The head liner is also pristine. If the headliner
will fit a '78, it's mine!! They want $75 for each door and $20 for the
hatches. I'll buy the upholstery before anything happens to it if anyone is
interested. I closed the windows and doors to protect the interior
yesterday.
