Subject: 78' Exhaust Suggestions

Volks,
 
I'm looking for a solution to my exhaust sytem on my '78 westy. Currently have
OEM heater boxes and an afermarket muffler from Bus Depot.

The aftermarket muffler never fit very well from the beginning and is loud. I
think the best solution is to convert to 72-74 OEM style system but that will
cost me over $800. Can anyone reccommend a better bolt on muffler than the one
I got from Bus Depot? Maybe the one I got was just a reject but the flanges
were not parrallel and I had a hell of a time getting it on two years ago. Now
it is getting pretty rusty and leaks a little at the gaskets due to poor
sealing from day one. I looked at the quiet pack and 4 tip monza style
mufflers at Bus Boys and was thinking of trying one of them. Any suggestions
on a better solution that wont cost me $800? I'm not after any performance
gains just looking for a quiet exhaust that will hold up. The rest of the OEM
system is in pretty good shape ie. elbows and manifolds.
 
Thanks,
 
Ted
