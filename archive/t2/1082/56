When I took my VW trained mechanic for a spin in my bus and re-tuned the 
mixture to run leaner, he was shocked that a leaner mixture produces a 
cooler CHT.  Like everyone else (myself included), he always thought a 
leaner mixture produced higher temps - not true.  I am running around 
18:1 for my cruise and that's how I'm bringing the temps so low.  I wish 
I could datalog it for you but the megasquirt doesn't have an easy way 
to datalog EGT otherwise I would.

Now, because I'm leaning it out, it's also causing a slow burn, which 
means I can advance the timing.  I haven't messed with the timing yet 
because I don't want to kill the engine, but I will probably start 
inching up my *cruise* advance in the near future.  When the mixture 
gets richer (or you use forced air induction - i.e. turbo), then you 
have to retard the timing because the burn is faster.

Take a look at this for the relationship between AFR and CHT:

And also read through this thread - lots of nifty information on the 
subject (which is where the above picture originates):
