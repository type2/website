This may be irrelevant, but I generally coast downhills
in any of my cars.  As I don't have a temp gauge in my
bus, this observation is based other cars (with manual
transmissions).  In summer weather, temperature will
rise during even a long coast.  The lower heat input of
burning less fuel and running no-load at 900 RPM is
nevertheless not dissipated as well as when burning more
fuel and running 2500 RPM under load.  If I keep the RPM
up despite being in neutral and otherwise coasting, the
temp falls.  In other words, it seems that it is the fan
and airflow that matters more than the amount of heat
being liberated inside the cylinders.  Similarly, up-
shifting will lower temperature on the flat even while
it is lowering fuel economy.  My intuition would have
been that temp is more sensitive to heat input, but as
is so often the case, my intuition would be wrong.

Worth what you paid for it,
