Well.... Those 1/4" nubs are roll pins that are pressed into the  
flywheel. Two minutes with a pair of side cutters will pull them.  Are  
you sure that your old clutch cover isn't drilled for them? I don't  
think that I've ever seen a late model clutch not so drilled.  Anyway,  
just pull them out and you'll be back in business. (Or go buy a clutch  
cover. Better solution.)
