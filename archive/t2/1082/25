Subject: Re: [T2] a question about cht rings

I installed mine in the flat spot where the FI temp sender would go.  I 
had to drill/tap a hole since I had carbs.  I realize the temps read 
lower there but I did not want to deal with the ring under the spark 
plug for reasons stated previously AND the fact that it spaces the plug 
farther out than it was designed to be and farther out than the other 
three plugs.  Symmetry is good.  As others have suggested in the past, I 
think it's the change in readings that is important, not the absolute 
value.  In my bus, 300-325 was normal and 350+ was hot.
