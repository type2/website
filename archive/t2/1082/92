Those  nubs are dowels that are necessary for centering the pressure

movement  of such a large piece of iron on your rotating assembly will 
induce  vibration that will cause excess wear to your main bearings.  I 
would  never put a clutch together without all three pins.  I agree with 
Jim  Arnott that your pressure plate assembly should already be drilled 
for the  dowels, and I bet your old flywheel also has the holes for the  
dowels.  I would never put a clutch together without all three of  those 
pins.

hey guys  I resurface a lot of flywheels and every now and then we get  
them where the dowels will not come out even using a dowel remover tool. It is  
then that you have to either not resurface the flywheel or cut the dowels  
off.  I let the customer tell me which way to go, but remember that the old  
VWs did not have these dowels at all.  didn't come on them till about 1972  
when the came out with the type 4 motors.  later  mark  d
