Subject: Koolatron ... 

I was at a garage sale this weekend .. I picked up a Koolatron . a P34A .
it's an older one used for transporting medical stuff . I have it plugged in
and appears to work .. I wonder if it will work better than a crappy tire
koolatron . or . what

 

This is the same as mine ..
