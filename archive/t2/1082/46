Hi Dan,

I wasn't coasting. I had the pedal down and was doing about 65MPH on the 
flats and downhills. Occaisionally 70MPH on a long hill if it was 
straight enough. I didn't want to coast for the reasons you state and 
also because I was fully loaded with a canoe up top and westrailer on 
the back....I wanted to be in full control at all times.


Happy Trails,
