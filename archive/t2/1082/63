Basic answer
In a carbureted engine the carb dumps fuel into the intake manifold, then

the fuel needs to make it's way through the manifold to the individual
cylinders.  
In an FI engine (with individual injectors) the fuel is dumped 
into the intake as close as practical to the cylinder.
What makes it work in either case?  Metering.

Spraying the fuel from an injector in atomized form in very small
amounts is far superior to any form of mixture control from a carb.

On the VW Air Flow Control system the metering is not as precise as 
it is on more modern engine management systems.  But the AFC and MPC 
systems (type 3/4) were and are a vast improvement on the carburetor.
AFC is extremely simple, and works very well in spite of the crude
controls.  Remember that there were (and still are) cars from all over 
the world that have used this same system and except for electronic 
control of the pulse (as opposed to points) still is reliable and 
mechanic and user friendly.

If you have the opportunity to use FI instead of a carb, use it!
