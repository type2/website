	I check capacity (Ah) just by slapping a spare truck 
tail-light bulb across the battery and trying to notice when it quits 
(and then charging the battery promptly).
	But cranking ability is affected less by that total Ah 
capacity than by internal resistance in the battery, which is much 
harder to measure.  The starter tries to draw a very large current 
(c.100 A or more), in which condition a battery that can hold 20 Ah 
and might be therefore be expected to provide 100 A for c.12 min may 
not crank the starter motor at any decent rpm because the current is 
limited by the battery's internal resistance.  In that case, there 
may well be proprietary battery-electrolyte additives claimed to fix 
it (and no doubt sold by your FLAPS), but I fear most or all of those 
additives are rorts.  Anyone found a good one?
