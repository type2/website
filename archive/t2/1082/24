Subject: Re: [T2] Fan shroud flap pins

Seems to me that those pins are roughly the diameter of wire clothes  
hanger wire...  That might work.  If you have one pin you could go to  
the hardware store and try to find some rod that is about the right  
size.  If you don't have an existing pin you could determine the size  
of the holes in the shroud roughly by inserting drill bits into the  
hole.  Once you know what size bit is too big and which is small  
enough you should then be able to find something about right from the  
hardware store.  This will work surprisingly well if you have a good  
drill index.

If you're a little crazy you might measure the diameter of the hole  
then turn down a piece of steel on a lathe to make your pin from whole  
cloth, so to speak.

In my case I've got both pins but only one plate.  I'm going to  
sacrifice a pie tin to fashion a new plate.  I'd measure the diameter  
of the pins for you but they're sitting in a box in someone else's  
garage.

Good luck!
