I looked at the header/collector and quiet muffler from www.cip1.ca ; it is 
available at a number of places, but haven't checked with Busdepot. It 
seemed like a great way to go, as I've used these type 1 versions on my bugs 
for years with  no problems. Very durable in my opinion when buying the S&S 
version which USED to be made in the USA. Don't know about the new ones, 
probably made in China by now.
Here's the page with some options.
