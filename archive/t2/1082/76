What is your goal?  Are you trying to calculate the capacity of your 
battery or are you just trying to see how much current is flowing out of 
your battery at some given time?

If you're trying to calculate the capacity of your battery, then you 
will need to use a very small load if you're going to use your 
multimeter in-line with the load as they usually have a limit of 10A. 
Also, if you're trying to calculate the load, you will need to make sure 
that the current draw stays constant while the battery voltage drops so 
that you can correctly calculate the number of amps coming out of the 
battery - I'm guessing this will be a bit tricky.

Now, if you're trying to measure the current flowing out of the battery, 
you will probably want to get an ammeter with a clamp on probe that can 
measure high currents.  Then you won't be blowing the fuse in your 
multimeter.  If you're just measuring a small load, or if you're curious 
if something's loading your battery when the engine's off, you can put 
the multimeter in-line with your battery (remove positive terminal and 
bridge connection with the meter leads).  But hopefully the load isn't 
greater than the capacity of your meter or you'll blow the fuse or break 
your meter if it isn't fused.
