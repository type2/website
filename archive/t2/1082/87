Subject: What are these holes for in the engine tin of a 1975 FI bay but

I have a 1975 FI bay that was a basket case. I'm in the process of
installing the tin but I can't figure out what the large feed thru holes are
for in the right rear and left rear engine tin.

Bentley does not show any holes. I also searched internet and the Type2
archives - but know luck.

I have a 1978 FI bay, it does not have these holes.
