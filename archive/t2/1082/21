Subject: a question about cht rings

So i got this VDO gauge and it comes with a ring to slip under teh
sparkplug.
I have not installed it because
 #1 where you bend the connector to the ring seems to impede the proper
installation of the plug, adding risk to the already scary idea of stripping
or cross threading.
#2 how are you supposed to get the socket on when that connector piece is
bent up in the way?
so ultimately, is there another place to install it to get the cylinder head
temp reading that is sufficient?
Joe
