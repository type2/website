Subject: Changing the electrical switch

Started having intermittent starting problems a few weeks ago.  Would  
not start unless I rabbited around
under the back of the ignition switch, then everything fine for a few  
weeks.

Got sick of hassles so looked up Richard's site & found Brad Clausens  
blow by blow dissection of the
removal & refitting of the electrical switch.  Thank-you Richard &  
Brad.  Whole job took less than 2 hours
and a fair part of that was working out how to extract the security  
bolt.

Only problem was getting the security bolt out, but ended up using an  
old screw driver & hammer from the
top to bite into the bolt & start to loosen it.  Pulled  switch to  
see if it could be fixed, unfortunately there
was a crack in the plastic next to where the tail from the ignition  
switch sits.

Called mechanic who said copy switches were not very good quality (I  
think that is a fair translation of
the expression he used) & that he suggested a simple switch under the  
dash.  That didn't really appeal
to me so I thought 'why not call local VW dealer?'
Often call the spares section there for work related parts, so called  
& after about 5 minutes of waiting
the spares guy said ' believe it or not, they're still available.'

It cost me $76.00 but I figure if it only lasts half the time of the  
original its still less than $5.00 per year!!
And for once didn't have to buy a reproduction part for something  
fairly important.
