I have been told that twin single throat carbs have the problem because the
cylinders in each bank fire one immediately after the other. This means the
second cylinder to fire on each side tends to run leaner than the first to
fire.

They shouldn't - unless the FI is just being more efficient.  Well-tuned
carbs should be able to somewhat resemble the proper mixture.  Whether
it's EFI or carbs is irrelevant - the proper mixture is all that matters.

Now, if you're referring to improperly balanced carbs, then yes, that's
a problem, but that can also happen with poor-flowing injectors...
