Subject: Re: [T2] How long to cool down before adjusting valves

The Bentley manual states the temp should be under 
50 deg C.  
In all of the shops that I worked at, a
vehicle had to be left overnight or for the entire 
day if a valve adjustment was required. That way we
let the car (bus) sit until midday to do the tune and 
valve adjust. 
If you can put your bare hand on the valve cover, it's cool 
enough.

When do you want to go to Haiti?  I can make it happen.
Christ lays opportunities to serve him at our feet every day.  
We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
