Hi Mike,

I spent about 20 hours last week going to HCBF and spent a lot of time 
monitoring my gauges on a "basically stock" engine. Well, It's not 
really stock ; it's a bastardized EA-case 1.7 setup overbored to 1679cc 
and running L-Jetronic with compression reduced to about 7.2:1. But 
other than the shims used to drop the compression it's still all 
original VW parts, there's nothing at all hot-rod about it.

Usually my oil temp takes about 10 minutes to get to 80C on the highway. 
It takes another 20 minutes to get to 95C. If I don't go over 55MPH it 
won't go over 95. Running flat highway at 65 it will eventually hit 
100C/212F.

Pushing it on the hills between Washington PA and Wytheville VA it will 
climb to about 110C/230F, but once away from the hills the temps go back 
to 100C. My CHT gauge will respond to load within 20 seconds; going up 
to about 410 on a long climb, and dropping to 280 on a sustained 
downhill coast. The oil temps stay very stable.

I have a sump plate oil temp sender and it was kinda weird this last 
trip... On downhills in the hilly section the temp would go UP by 5 
degrees. Going up the next hill the temp would go down, back to 100C. 
After about 90 minutes of this the temp stabilized at 110C. It did it 
again on the trip home as well, on the same section of highway.

I think the problem there is with the sump plate sender. On a steep 
hill, the top of the sender is poking up out of the oil and the sender 
winds up reading the case temp rather than the oil temp. On the downhill 
the oil floods back over the sender and the temps come back down. Or 
something like that.


One other factor that gets ignored sometimes when comparing modern and 
original configurations: FUEL.

I don't think many people allow for the difference between modern 
"gasolines" and what came out of the pumps back in the 70's. Thanks to 
changes in refining and distribution chemistry they really aren't the 
same thing at all.

I'd say that even a "stock configuration" is going to be at a 
disadvantage using current-day fuels compared to what they were using 
when the engine was originally designed.  But finding a petrochemical 
engineer who will go on the record and say that his employers products 
are putting the public at risk might be difficult, so maybe I'll just 
put my tinfoil hat back on and go back to my corner....

Happy Trails,
