They make larger versions of the Norcold/Engel fridges, but every fridge 
needs ventilation since they utilize heat transfer devices.  You 
shouldn't need to cut a vent hole into your bus but you will have to 
leave some room around the heat exchanger of any refrigerator so the air 
can circulate.  If you absolutely can't do that, I would recommend an 
ice chest.
