	This thread, now perhaps nearing name-change to Mixture & 
Temps, has been mentioning in passing some vague ideas about whether 
lean mixture causes low or high CHT.
	I've always thought lean mixture tends to cause overheating. 
Could someone sock us an authoritative statement?
	Exhaust gas analysis is one approach to measuring leanness, 
but such instrumentation didn't exist during the development of our 
engines.  Spark plug reading was the respectable method  ...  And 
neither of these works while you're a-runnin' down th' road  ...
