The injectors spray above the intake valve. So if it's not an intake
stroke the fuel just sets there waiting.

Each pulse injects just a fraction of the needed fuel. So when the
intake valve opens, the full amount is available and gets sucked into
the chamber.

That's an oversimplification, but you get the idea.
