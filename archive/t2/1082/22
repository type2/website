Subject: Re: a question about cht rings

Welcome to "Zen and the art of getting the cht ring fitted"!

#1 where you bend the connector to the ring seems to impede the proper
installation of the plug, adding risk to the already scary idea of
stripping or cross threading.

It indeed can and does jam the spark plug before it gets to the bottom.
I seem to recall lightly filing the inside of the ring to get it to spin
more freely.

#2 how are you supposed to get the socket on when that connector piece
is bent up in the way?

See germansupply.com for instructions on modifying the head to fix this
problem. You can also get thin wall sockets which would give more
clearance.

so ultimately, is there another place to install it to get the cylinder
head temp reading that is sufficient?

No.
