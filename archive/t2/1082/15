Yeah, I was just reading about that on shoptalkforums yesterday - I 
think they use 0.002" if I remember correctly.  That is essentially the 
best way to do it because then then you actually have the correct valve 
lash when the engine is hot.  Setting them cold may actually yield 
different valve gaps when they're hot, but that's also being pretty picky :)
