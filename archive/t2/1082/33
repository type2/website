Subject: Received new alternator wiring from Jim Thompson

Hey Everyone,
I just thought I'd post up a message regarding my new alternator wiring 
harness that arrived today.  First off, it looks great!  I don't know 
when I'll be pulling the old one out, but this one looks super-spiffy 
and I'm excited to replace my old and worn out one.  The quality looks 
top-notch and I'd highly recommend it for anyone that's in need of a 
replacement for their worn out cable.



Jim,
Two questions:

What did you use for the cable covering?  I'd like to redo my FI harness 
and I'm looking for a quality heat-proof covering for my wires.

And the other question is what is the additional terminal for?  I know 
one is for the warning light up front, but what is the other for.  I 
don't think I have it connected in my engine compartment anyways - is it 
for the test jack?

Thanks!
Mike
