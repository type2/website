Some folks have switched to a Virfrigio

you'll have to find someone who can point out
which specific model. With a solar panel there is
at least one person on another list who gets by
without other electricity for long periods.
Mine is running off propane right now, it been
running off propane since Wed the 15th of July
but it has a hard time with the real hot (90-110)
temps. I have a remote read thermometer that
reads the inside temps, the last few weeks I
wouldn't have kept any milk in it (I have seen
71: in it when it was 100: outside).
