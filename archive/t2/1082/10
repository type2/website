Hey all!
Thanks for the responses. For simplicity sake I'm replying to you as a group.

1 Distributor (009 w/o vacuum) - I'm pretty sure I installed it correctly but I'm still questioning the functionality of the unit itself. I do have the Bentley and Haynes so I'm not completely lost. Hopefully when it's finally running it'll be ok. 

2 Clutch - answered, thanks Jamie and Mike

3 The unit next to the Distributor seems to be the Oil Pressure switch, as opposed to the Condenser which is actually attached to the dizzy. Thanks Jamie and Joe

4 Oil Breather - I think this was answered - I can use either setup as long as it doesn't leak. But now that i think about it, in the old engine the hoses were loose and often slipped off; I don't recall it affecting performance (but then again, I did blow up the engine)
---on a kind of side note here... Bailly, the breather hoses went to the carbs air intake to be burned off there. I believe the brake system vacuum hoses went to the intake manifold.

5 Engine Mount Brackets - I bit of a pain but I got them off without removing the fan unit; we'll see how easily they go back on.

Thanks again. You'll likely hear from me again soon once the next set of questions form in my brain.
