I have been living in the desert where average daytime temperature is 100F+
(don't ask me why). Would that explain the reason my cht gauge is
consistently reading around 392-396 at 55mph? Or is there any resource I can
use to learn more about how lean my fuel mixture is? Muir doesn't seem to
mention it...nor the Bentley....
