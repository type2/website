You'll be fine - it'll just mangle the ring - annoying... yes.

Just keep the socket kinda high and it will work.  Here are some 
instructions:

Now, if you notice, they cut a slot for the "neck" of the sender ring. 
I think that this is a great idea, and I did it myself, but if I ever do 
it again, I am going to cut a square notch instead of a rounded notch. 
Because it's rounded, the neck portion of the sender rides up the side 
of the rounded notch while you're tightening the plug.  Would I have 
made a nice square notch, it would have held the sender in place 
perfectly.  Next time the engine comes out, those notches are getting an 
adjustment!
