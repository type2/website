Welcome Larry the Tank Mechanic.  I'm sure we'll all learn plenty from you.
But we also have a few newbies who might overlook the ambiguity in this:-
>
>For VW valve adjusting  ...
>be SURE you are on #1 cylinder in the firing position (TDC)

	In a four-stroke engine such as all VW, the piston arrives at 
TDC twice in the 4-stroke cycle.  The firing position is one, but 
there is also the other one (at the top of the exhaust stroke).
	Therefore, if any newbie finds any confusion in implementing 
Larry's protocol

>the timing mark should be close to 0 (or the case split on
>little motors) AND the distributor rotor will be pointing
>at (or close to) the notch on the distributor housing.  This
>will ONLY be the case when the #1 cylinder is in the firing
>position

	, just check whether the TDC the cylinder is at is the firing 
position, not that other TDC.

Altho' I can't get a 2-stroke VW, I am in the wider world a 2-stroke 
fan, and can now add to their long list of virtues the fact that the 
ambiguity I'm pointing out here cannot occur in that superior type of 
cycle which gives us power every time the piston comes up.  (Of 
course they have no plurry valves to adjust anyhow, so it doesn't 
matter  ...)
