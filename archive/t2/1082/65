You would be wasting a lot of fuel if it were injecting the actual 
amount needed for that particular cylinder's proper combustion every 
time the injector fires, but it doesn't inject that much, so the total 
accumulated fuel eventually gets sucked in and that amount is correct. 
So, in other words, all four injectors are injecting just enough fuel 
(combined) to fire one cylinder, four times.

Where it gets interesting is in accel and decel enrichment.  When you 
floor it, there is an initial lean sag because of the excess in air and 
puddling factor of the fuel on the wall of the intake (carbs have an 
accel pump).  And the opposite holds true when you decel, you get an 
excess amount of fuel flowing into the engine when you close the 
throttle.  The megasquirt has some neat functionality to handle that and 
does it quite well.  I think there is also work starting to look at 
sequential injection - which allows for better emissions, more power, 
and a lower drop in fuel pressure.  If I remember correctly, when you 
fire all the injectors at the same time, the pressure drop causes some 
of the injectors to inject slightly less fuel than others.  With 
sequential injection, they all have the same pressure when they inject 
the fuel.
