Subject: Re: [T2] rear hatch adjustment

Is the gap around the hatch not even? Or is the hatch not touching the seal 
evenly?

OK, so I understand the adjustments of the rear window hatch...Slight
adjustments at the hinges and at the lock, but are there any ad-
justments of the torsion bars...?-(
I just can't seem to get the hatch to align...It just touches the body
on the passenger side when closing and when closed, the hatch is
closer to the body on the right than the left...
