Subject: Is there a "home" way to measure battery capacity?

Dealing with a battery that was subject to a current drain.  Can one 
figure out the capacity (like how long it will crank) in a more gentle 
way like putting a certain amp load on it and measuring the voltage drop 
over time?  Assume the CCA and reserve capacity, etc are known.
