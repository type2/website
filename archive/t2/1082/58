They shouldn't - unless the FI is just being more efficient.  Well-tuned 
carbs should be able to somewhat resemble the proper mixture.  Whether 
it's EFI or carbs is irrelevant - the proper mixture is all that matters.

Now, if you're referring to improperly balanced carbs, then yes, that's 
a problem, but that can also happen with poor-flowing injectors...
