Subject: Re: [T2] setting up multimeter to check current draw

Hi Mike, I'm actually trying to find a small current draw that is slowly 
draining my battery over a few days. I remember doing this with my bug, and 
putting the multimeter in between one battery terminal and it's cable. It 
read the current being drawn from whatever the culprit was. I then removed a 
fuse at a time until I found the circuit that was drawing the current and 
draining the battery. I can't remember if it was the pos. or neg. cable, and 
what I had my multimeter set for, amps, or volts etc.?? I'm electrical 
stupid.
Courtney
