Subject: Re: [T2] Flywheel and Clutch

Hey guys! Thanks for the reply's.

> Are you sure that your old clutch cover isn't drilled for them?
Yes, I'm sure. (but of course I'll check again) But, I'm not sure if the Clutch will fit even if I did remove the nubs; it appears the cutout for the clutch is larger (diameter) on the new Flywheel. Forget to check to see if the holes line up.

>... and I bet your old flywheel also has the holes for the dowels.
I'll take that bet. No holes for the dowels, no marks were they may have been. I'd post the photo but that would take too much effort right now. So yeah, I get that the dowels line up the clutch but don't the 6 bolts


Which leads me to ... Either pull the dowels if the old clutch will work or find the correct clutch for the new Fly. Oh joy... Is any standard Late model Clutch going to work? Presuming the holes are there, that is.
