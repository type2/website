Hey Courtney,

While I have no direct help on how to use a meter to check for current
draw, it reads to me that you are really simply looking to figure out
which thing is taking electricity from your battery, even when all
systems are (you think!) shut down. I did not use a meter to do my
searching.

I had the same thing happen to me pretty soon after I got my bus, it
was parked for three weeks and when I went to start it it just barely
even clicked the starter solenoid, and the battery was so shot it
would not take a charge, and I had to get a new one. This bugged (ha)
me enough to try to discover what had stolen my juice. All I did was
take out the fuses, one by one, with the bus shut down/key in my
pocket, and after dark, so it would be easier to see the little spark
I got from the fuse for the circuit that was running unswitched power.
It turned out to be the last one all the way on the right, your
fusebox may vary, mine's a 1970 Riviera.

The phantom load turned out to be the stereo, apparently this one
needs a little juice to keep the presets memorized and that is
sufficient over three weeks and off a three year old MallWart battery
to render it thirty pounds of dirty scrap.

Hope this helped or at least was entertaining,
