You mean 15 amp-hours, right?  That is very low.  I'm sure the Engel is 
a quality fridge but I have no experience with them.  They look similar 
to the Norcold MRFT fridges but are quite a bit less expensive.  In fact 
they look so similar to the Norcold line that I would almost bet that 
they are made by the same company.  I would not hesitate to buy one if I 
was in the market.

I have a Norcold MRFT-40 and it is fantastic.  New price is about $900, 
I bought mine used on E-Bay several years ago for about $350.  Here is a 
place selling them for a very high price:

Here is a link to a guy who was selling them for $595, may be too late 
for this deal:

I recently took my MRFT-40 to a racetrack in Oklahoma - it was 102 
degrees but my beverages stayed at 32 degrees all day.  It was very 
popular with my friends.  It draws 3.5 amps continuously on freeze, 
intermittently on higher temp settings.  I like the chest style because 
all of the cold air doesn't spill out when you open it and it is easily 
transportable.  My only complaint about the Norcold is that the lid is 
not sturdy enough for an adult to sit on.

The Norcold will have its own spot in my bus behind the front passenger 
seat.  I will strap it down from the two handles so it doesn't become a 
projectile in an accident and it will be removed and placed under an 
awning or EZ-Up while camping so it won't take up valuable interior space.
