Subject: '81 Hardtop Riviera for trade

Here's the deal....

My friend Pat has this '81 hardtop Riviera full camper.  Bed, sink,  
three way reefer, porta potty, stove, etc, etc, etc. Air-cooled  
automatic. BA-6.  No rust. Starts and drives just fine.  Put new heads  
on it not too long ago. Nice rig with a nice layout. Hardtop means  
that it'll fit in a normal height garage.

Pat's had it for sale for a couple years with few nibbles because (I  
suspect) of where we are. (NE Oregon.  Out in the sticks.  Elgin,  
Oregon to be precise.)

 >  For sale because Pat's dog of choice is a couple Mastiffs.  Way  
more dog than a VW was meant to camp with. The Riv just doesn't suit  
his needs any longer.

Last night vandals tossed a rock into the windshield and now Pat just  
wants it gone. So....  Here's what he's asking.  He needs a 1600 type  
1 motor for his bug.  Bring him a good running 1600 DP motor and take  
an '81 ASI Riviera home with you.

If you're interested, drop me a line and I'll put you in touch with him.

Jim
