Ok, this is something that's been worrying me.  I understand that all the
injectors in a FI engine fire at the same time.  Wouldn't that waste fuel?  I
would think that each individual injector would only fire on its cylinder's
intake stroke or very near it.   If they're all firing at the same time, that
means fuel is being injected at intake, compression, power and exhaust which
would waste a lot of fuel.  What am I missing here?  thanks, Greg
