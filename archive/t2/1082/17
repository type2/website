David,

Some of the RV and Marine fridges come with external cooling units
(i.e. compressors).  Depending what kind of drain holes already 
exist in your bus, you might be able to use existing holes
and safely mount the compressor remotely.  This is probably also
slightly more efficient as it removes the heat source from near
the fridge.

Unfortunately, it probably wouldn't work in your application (the
removing the ice chest when you arrive at the destination), which
I think sounds like a great option.

Here are some from Vitrifigio:

Chest types with remote compressors:

Cheers,
