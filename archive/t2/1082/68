I recently installed a hitch on my 1995 Astro and bought two hitch
assemblies that I combined to make a custom one that served the purpose I
wanted.

I 'm not sure if this would work for a bus.  I'm currently without a bus and
cannot see if it will work.  Can a bus have a 2" receiver hitch?  Anyway,
since it's Friday I figured that it might be interesting to someone out
there.  :O)

I had a ball assembly from a Rapid Hitch System modified to take a
Convert-A-Ball System.  It turned out really nice.  There are pictures of it
on this page:

I am very happy with how it turned out and can hardly wait to buy the
trailer and try it out.
