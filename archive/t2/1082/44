I killed two sets of heads going up to 430.  One was a set of heads 
rebuilt by rimco and the other was a brand spankin' new pair of AMC 
heads.  My goal now is to keep my temps below 400 at all times.  Right 
now I have been leaning out my mixture and that has made a significant 
change.  I just drove down the freeway this evening and had my temps 
hovering around 365-370 while driving 70ish..
