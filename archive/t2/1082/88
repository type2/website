Subject: Flywheel and Clutch

Ibm replacing my old 914 1.7 engine (EA010941) with another
914 1.7 engine
(EA063277) and Ibm reusing all the parts I can.
So I go to swap the clutch
today only to discover that I have 2 different Flywheels. I guess that
shouldn't come as a surprise; I just wasn't expecting this to be an issue. The
old set up has a typical Late-type Diaphragm Spring Clutch as shown In the
Bentley Fig 15-1. The flywheel has 6 bolt holes for the clutch and nothing
else. The Fly on the new engine has the 6 bolt holes and 3 quarter-inch nubs
sticking up; apparently for a different clutch. So clearly Clutch A is not
going onto Flywheel B. 
What are my options here? Use the old Flywheel - seems
like a huge job for a guy without the proper tools. I can contact the PO for
specifics on the setup he used and maybe go that direction, but it came out of
a Porsche, so maybe just another can o worms. Someone know the Flywheel
differences?
