Subject: A week from now, you'll probably be reading trip reports...

But as it stands, there's still time to plan your trip to Buses Of the 
Corn in Brooklin, Ontario.

Located in the heart of Southern Ontario's Corn Belt, BOTC is a family 
friendly VW campout. Any year VW Bus is welcome, from 1955 to 2005. If 
you don't have a bus, you are still welcome to come and camp in your VW.

Why bother? There's almost too much to mention, and besides, this email 
is really just a heads-up for those already planning for the event....

GATES OPEN AT NOON THIS FRIDAY. If you need access sooner, please P-mail 
me and I'll see what can be done.

ON-SITE T-Shirt AVAILABILITY WILL BE LIMITED AT BEST.
I don't have too many spare shirts this year. If you're planning on 
tie-dying a shirt at the tie-dye workshop and you haven't already 
reserved one, you might want to buy one and bring it just in case.

LOCAL AMENITIES ARE CLOSE-BY AND WELL STOCKED!!
Canadian Tire, Walmart, and a large grocery chain store are within 10 
minutes of the campground. Tim Hortons, Dollarama and others are also 
well within striking distance.

TWO GROUP MEALS WILL BE HELD: BREAKFAST BURRITOS & POT LUCK DINNER ON 
SATURDAY. Corn will be provided for dinner, but participants are 
encouraged to bring a side dish or dessert to accompany it.

WE HAVE NO ELECTRICITY OR RUNNING WATER ON-SITE. We will be bringing in 
about 100 gallons of drinking water for the kitchen area. Please bring 
your own water if at all possible. Also please refrain from bringing 
generators, as the noise is not appreciated.

PETS MUST BE KEPT ON A LEASH. Yes, I mean YOUR pet. Unless you can show 
me a letter from the Central Ontario Conservation Area that excuses you 
from leashing your pet; I'd really like to see it on a lead at ALL 
TIMES. The general public uses the walking trails adjacent to our 
camping area, and if we expect them to obey that rule then we have to as 
well.

NO ALCOHOL. It's a family-friendly event at a publicly accessible 
location with a no-alcohol policy. Please act accordingly. THANKS!

NO FIREARMS OR FIREWORKS.
That ban includes VW case fires, in case you were wondering.


I toured the facility this afternoon and it's in tip-top shape. The 
grass is green and the lawns are much, much firmer and dryer than last 
year. The local forecast call for some rain tomorrow, then dry for the 
rest of the week!!
