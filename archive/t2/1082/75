Subject: setting up multimeter to check current draw

OK, I've been through the archives (which I suck at) to find this info, but
can't find it. How do I set my multimeter up to check for a current draw. Do I
use the volts setting and go across the fuse connections with the fuse out, or
pull one of the battery cables to place the multimeter in between? Complete
instructions for the electrical-handicapped would be great.
Thanks,
Courtney
