The dowels can be drilled out easily and replaced.  No problem for any 
competent machine shop like the one that will resurface your flywheel. 
As for pre-72 not having the dowels, I am pretty sure the type 1 clutch 
was smaller and lighter than the type IV, and one can always go back to 
the premise that if the VW engineers put something there, it was for a 
good reason.   Engine design is constantly evolving so in general making 
the case that a part was not present on an older model does not convince 
me that it's okay to leave that part off on a newer model.
