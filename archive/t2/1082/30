Unless they knew something different, that location would not provide 
very good results unless you can have something to cross-reference it to 
(i.e. 300 at the fins is really 420 at the heads - slow down!).  I've 
measured the temps at the spark plugs, the temp II location, and a head 
bolt; the spark plug was by far the most responsive and read the highest 
temp.  Because this is the same location as everyone else, you are able 
to make comparisons to other people's measurements and heed their temp 
warnings.  Put it somewhere else, and you're just playing a guessing 
game unless you kill a few heads and then take note of what temp they 
fried at ;)
