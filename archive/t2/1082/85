Polarity of hookup is thus: If you are using the (-) side, the black lead on the meter (-) goes to th "more negative" point which would be the battery (-) terminal and the "less negative" point would be the (-) battery cable which would get the red lead.

As noted earlier, set for highest load before hooking up in order to avoid damage to the meter.

Okay, if you're testing on the positive side (do whichever is easiest to reach!) The source is the "more positive" point, so the red lead would go to the battery (+) terminal. The cable is the "less positive" point so it would get the black lead (also known as (-) in most cases!)

Don't forget what your project parameters are halfway through and turn the switch to "START" or some other impractical high-load stunt or you'll be in the market for a new meter or at the very least, new meter leads and may have a fire to deal with as well!
