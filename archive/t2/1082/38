Subject: Re: a question about cht rings

well..all that been said..I also emailed Bus Depot to ask them, but the
person responding told me he never heard of a problem associated with the
ring and installation, he told me to ask the type 2 people..
so i have..but still really no quick fix.
Modifying the head seems the best way to go.problem there is that you gotta
pull the head to do this, not quite for beginners, not hard either.
I just wanted to verify that i wasnt the only one who saw a problem with
this..thanks Joe
