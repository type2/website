Heh, I was doing the same exact thing trying to figure out what was 
killing my battery and kept blowing the fuse.  I realized my multimeter 
had two ways to measure amperage: on the fused (I think something on the 
order of 500mA) or on the non-fused side (something like 10A).  I 
finally realized the problem was my old wires :)

Well, you definitely want to measure amps and it doesn't matter which 
way you hook up the leads.  If you put it backwards, it'll read negative 
and then just swap the leads.  I can't remember the correct direction 
either.

If you want to test it, try hooking a small light bulb to a 9v battery 
and see what terminals you have to connect the leads to so that the amp 
reading is positive.  You should be able to figure it out pretty quickly.

Just be careful that you don't exceed the specifications of your 
multimeter (it should say where the leads plug in) otherwise you'll have 
a new paperweight.
