Along the same vein........
When I honk the horn in my '73 beetle, the horn sounds fine, If I'm stepping
on the breaks and honk the horn, it sounds sickly. There must be a drain
somewhere, but I don't know that much about the wiring of a bug. Also, is
there a source for bus wiring harnesses? There are hanging wires from under
the dash. A lot of them have been shoddily spliced and a lot of wires have
been cut underneath including where the gas heater goes.

Polarity of hookup is thus: If you are using the (-) side, the black lead on
the meter (-) goes to th "more negative" point which would be the battery
(-) terminal and the "less negative" point would be the (-) battery cable
which would get the red lead.

As noted earlier, set for highest load before hooking up in order to avoid
damage to the meter.

Okay, if you're testing on the positive side (do whichever is easiest to
reach!) The source is the "more positive" point, so the red lead would go to
the battery (+) terminal. The cable is the "less positive" point so it would
get the black lead (also known as (-) in most cases!)

Don't forget what your project parameters are halfway through and turn the
switch to "START" or some other impractical high-load stunt or you'll be in
the market for a new meter or at the very least, new meter leads and may
have a fire to deal with as well!
