Hi Mike -

Regarding the "extra" black wire with insulated terminal, it should say on
the notes I provided.  This wire was found on some models and was generally
used for connection to the VW Diagnostics harness which eventually
terminates at the  Diagnostics Plug.  I almost left it out, but decided to
leave it in so that someone could use it as a low-amperage (say, 8 to 10
amps) "all the time" 12 Volt source.  It can be ignored if you want to.

The sheathing was provided by the person I contracted to build the basic
harness (I add the plugs and grommets myself).  I'll get ahold of the guy to
see if he can provide the source - he buys this stuff in HUGE rolls of
varying sizes.

Hey Everyone,
I just thought I'd post up a message regarding my new alternator wiring
harness that arrived today.  First off, it looks great!  I don't know when
I'll be pulling the old one out, but this one looks super-spiffy and I'm
excited to replace my old and worn out one.  The quality looks top-notch and
I'd highly recommend it for anyone that's in need of a replacement for their
worn out cable.

Jim,
Two questions:
What did you use for the cable covering?  I'd like to redo my FI harness and
I'm looking for a quality heat-proof covering for my wires.
And the other question is what is the additional terminal for?  I know one
is for the warning light up front, but what is the other for.  I don't think
I have it connected in my engine compartment anyways - is it for the test
jack?
Thanks!
Mike
