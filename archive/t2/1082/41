To measure capacity you first need to give it a good charge.  A slow
charge is probably the best, although, I'm not sure if it really matters
in the case of a lead-acid battery (NiMH batteries are sensitive to this).

Once you know the battery is fully charged, you will want to put a
constant load (i.e. 10amps) on the battery while watching the battery's
voltage and make note of how long it takes for the battery to drop to
it's minimum voltage.  According to the following site, that minimum
votage is 11.89v:

At that point the voltage will probably start dropping quickly - remove
the load so you don't kill the battery.

Now multiply the load by the time it took to reach the minimum voltage
and you will know the capacity of your battery.


The only reason I know this is because I just bought a battery charger
for my RC models that will do a constant load discharge on my batteries
and calculates the capacity of the battery as it's discharging.

Now, I'm not sure if putting a load (i.e. bulb) on the battery will have
a constant amp load as the voltage drops.  I forgot all my ohms law
stuff a while back so you'll have to ask the electrical engineers on the
list.  However, I think this would be doable - a ammeter might be
helpful as well to verify what load you're pulling and make sure it
stays constant.


Battery conditioning and equalizing is said to help out lead acid
batteries a lot as well..
