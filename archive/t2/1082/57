Open up your engine compartment and look at the airflow meter.  There's 
a black lid on top of it - carefully pry it off (it's glued on there 
with silicone).  In there you will see a rotating mechanism with an arm 
that slides on a resistive surface.  Below that is a large gear with a 
spring inside of it.  If you use a screw driver, you can rotate the gear 
one direction or another to tighten (lean) or loosen (richen) the 
flapper door which will affect the mixture.  Tighten a few clicks (3-5) 
and see what happens.  It will affect your entire range of driving so 
when you make a change, test out all load/rpm combinations.  While you 
do it, watch your head temps to see if they drop as you lean it out.  At 
some point, you'll lean it too much and end up losing too much power - 
at that point you'll want to richen it back up a few clicks.

When you glue it back on, be sure to use electrical-grade silicone so 
the vapors don't leave any residue on the traces.  You can get this at 
most electronics stores.


This is where a wideband o2 sensor comes in very handy.  It is 
hands-down one of the best tuning tools you can have and if you live in 
california, is the best way to tune your engine to pass smog.
