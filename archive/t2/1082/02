Subject: Re: [T2] fridge ...

Expensive, but you may wish to consider an Engel.  I have this model 
http://www.roadtrucker.com/engel/small-16-quart-engel-12-volt-acdc-fridge-freezer.htm
installed between my front buckets.  Saves space and makes cold beverages 
available
while driving.  The really big benefit is an extremely low draw:  used as a 
fridge, probably
no more than 15 amps in a 24-hour period.
