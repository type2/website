Hi everyone!!!
ok this whole thing with the vw trademark logo stuff is a bunch of you know 
what but we as vintage enthusiasts need to show VW what we are all about! 
they have no clue!! the Michigan Vintage Volkswagen Club is hosting a 
petition to send to VW. You DO NOT need to be part of this club to sign the 
petition! Hey I got a update by e-mail to say that they are actually getting 
some positve feedback! I wish that everyone on this list would fill out the 
query form on the website http://www.mvvc.net 
and lets get this whole thing resolved!!
