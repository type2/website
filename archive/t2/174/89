Subject: Re: [T2] vredenstien tyres

Here we go AGAIN!!   185/75R14 are the WRONG size. The correct tire size DOES
NOT have an aspect number in the middle.

This is my last reply to ANY tire post/question. They come up every other week
and the same questions are asked and the same answers are given. Does everyone
have totally selective reading habits????
As far as I am concerned, if the tire is round and holds air: Use it, you are
going to anyway. You guys buy 1st and then ask questions and then try to
rational your bad purchase.
Knowledge is power.  ASK FIRST.
