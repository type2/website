I would just like to thank the list for everybodies help in sorting out =
my vac woes.  It was just as I had thought, the line between the 2 carbs =
was off.  Put it back on it she purrs like a kitten (well, sort of).  =
But as is my luck, when I fix one thing, another goes south.  Now it is =
time to fix the gas leak that popped up last night!   But I am not =
complaining, this bus was free!
