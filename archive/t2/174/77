Subject: re: [T2] bus buying question

Hi Miesha,

WHERE ARE YOU????  Location has a HUGE impact on the price and availability
of parts. Buying a complete brand-new engine and tranny could cost more than
$5000.  Or you might get lucky and find a decent one at a wrecker's for
$200.

If you're in the east, shop around and see if you can find a rusted out
68-71 Bus to source the driveline from. Drivetrains from 72 and after will
not fit without more work than it's worth. If you're out west where nothing
rusts you are going to have a bit more trouble finding a decent driveline
for cheap, because there is more demand.

Around here you can't legally buy or drive ANYTHING without a title. Your
milage may vary, depending on your location.

The rule of thumb on this list is that a bus costs $5000. You can pay it up
front for one that's trouble free, or buy cheaper and invest as you go.

+++MY STORY+++

In the spring of 2000 my wife and I drove 700 miles to pick up a 79 bus in
exactly the condition you describe FOR FREE. I already owned a rusted out
bus with a dependable driveline and a good interior, and it cost me well
over $1000 (Canadian $$$) before it was roadworthy. At least 150 hours of
labour went in which is not included in the price.
