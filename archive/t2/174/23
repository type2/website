=========================>
Accepting the fact that there was probably just a single supplier, or, at 
best, all suppliers using similar materials and techniques ...........
I replaced Casper's original tent with a cotton one purchased from JC 
Whitney on a special sale plus discount about three years ago.

The tent was used that same year for a 2 month trip.
The next year, it was used for another 2 month trip.
Last year, it was used for a 7 month trip.

After just the first year's use on the 2 month trip and the subsequent 
campings, I began to notice the cotton tent starting to show substantial 
fading of color.

On NewBus, the original tent is still quite nice with the exception of just 
a couple of worn areas starting to show.

If I were to replace either bus with another tent, I would look for 
something made of a material more akin to the original, as my experience 
with Casper's early on cotton material fading is pretty aggravating.
