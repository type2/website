Sorry to add another criteria to the discussion, but... 

The downside to the tires mentioned below is that with the exception of
the Contis and the Kirklands, not one of them is an All Season tire. 
Not a problem in warmer climes, but here in snow country it makes the
difference in whether one can escape the valley or not. Here, I gotta
have an A/S tire. Studs had to come off Apr 1 and we had 6" of fresh,
wet snow May 16. It's been known to snow here in August.

A search of TireRack for A/S tires brings up the Contis, Michelins (-at-)
$107/ea and Goodyear Wranglers (-at-) $85. (Latter two available in LR C,
BTW) Add the $15 ea. shipping and it's double what I paid for the
Kirklands out the door.

So, as the original poster has by now seen, there ain't a simple answer.
 Tires involve trade-offs. You pick the best one for *your* application.
In lands south of snow country, the Yokos are probably the most cost
effective choice. In lands where the roads can turn white at any time,
another tire choice might be more prudent. If you keep your bus long
enough, you will have an opportunity to try them all!
