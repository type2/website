Sean---

Why go to all that trouble?

Why not just take the VIN number off an older bus, and just slap it on
the new one?

Just rivet the older VIn to the new chassis, and it's a done deal !!

Fast, simple, and fool proof, and then importable !!---:>)

You can get away with it for Beetles for one reason: a 2002 Beetle will
fit on a 1963 Beetle pan. 
You take an old Beetle chassis down to Mexico, buy a new Beetle, take
the new Beetle body off the 2002 chassis and put it on the 1963 chassis
and since the VIN follows the chassis you now have a brand new 1963
Beetle which is exempt from all those import restrictions. 
Can't do this with a Bus, it's a unibody design. I suppose you could gut
the new Bus and install everything from the new Bus into the old Bus
shell but doing that you might as well just restore your old Bus to
original specs, at least if it's a late bay you get the Type 4 :-)

However, I have seen many brand new, old style Bugs that have been
imported from Mexico---South America, in the Sunday Chicago Tribune for
sale---- 
How are these vehicles made available?
