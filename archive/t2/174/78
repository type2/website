You might consider also getting a 12v compressor so you can let the air 
out of the spare and then pump it up again. Those Fix a Flat things don't 
really have that much air in them, and so if you use one you still have a 
whole bunch of air missing from the tire.

Off roading in my old 4wd Honda Civic Wagon once I blew out a tire, only
to discover that my girlfriend at the time had blown out a tire and
replaced it with the full size spare weeks before, and never told me. (She
got an earfull that day. Yeah, I should have checked the spare before we 
left, but still.) Broke out the fix a flat, and had to drive some
10 miles back to civilization with the tire only slightly inflated. Bought
one and am never without it now.
