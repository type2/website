According to the website, www.plfvw.com, these are the exact reasons that
Dawn decided to build a better poptop canvas.  There's even a picture in a
swatch on the site for the fringe: the first time I've ever seen mention of
a reproduction of this item.

I haven't bought one of these because I'm waiting to repaint my bus but I'm
seriously considering it.
