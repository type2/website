>BTW the big letter on the sidewall is a 
C 

Correct.  It is part of the size "185R14C" and
means a commercial tire.  It has nothing to do
with load range C or D.  

but the fine print on the side wall says load
range D.  

Correct.  

The westy handles unbelievably better.  Turns far
easier, tracks far better, brakes better.  almost
like having a complete new suspension.

Congrats!!!  I am a hopeless cheapskate and never
put anything other than standard passenger tires
on my vans for years--and put up with the sloppy
wandering play on the front end.  It's the
difference between night and day when you put a
proper set of tires on there, isn't it? 

If you'll tell me how much you paid for the
tires, I'll post it on the tire page.

Peace and blessings,
