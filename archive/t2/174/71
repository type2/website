Subject: securing strap

Dear List,
I was looking through the "Campmobile" supplement and saw that the
camping stool is supposed to have a securing strap that attaches to
the side of the icebox on my 73 Camper.
 I have never seen this strap. I have the metal bracket attached,
however.
Does anyone have a spare one of these they could sell, or can anyone
tell me how to fabricate one?
Is it the plastic snap on kind, or a webbed affair like on the spare
tire?

Also, any good ideas on how to clean and sterilize the water tank.
Mine has been sitting full of stinky water for a year or so.
Thanks,

Tom
