I couldn't say definitively whether Whitney shipped the same product then as
they do now.  At one time there were a couple of small pop top canvas
manufacturers who have since folded (no pun intended :-).  So Whitney's
supplier may or may not have been one of them (although even then, the
present manufacturer was by far the leading supplier of this product).
Today the one supplier is pretty much all there is (save any very small
upholstery shops, individuals, etc. who may sell them individually but not
through retailers).   My experience with fading has not been bad at all with
the cotton canvas (at least from this manufacturer). My friend put one on
his Westy about 4 years ago, for example, and it looks the same today as
then. (If it has faded, it's faded so evenly that no difference is
noticable.)  But since there are many of them on listmember busses, perhaps
others could say if their experience has been different.
