Was calling around for tires today and ran into this brand i had never 
heard of. Vredenstien .  C and D rated tires.  took some digging but i 
found a britt site with info on them. seems these are not a low end tire 
but a commercial grade for lorries.  Seems that brand name is a popular 
brand name internationally for bicycle tires.  BTW the quote i got was 
only $5 different for C or D.  any guesses which ones i am going to look 
at a little later?   Reason for this is because i just happened to 
notice what tires were on my westy and went oh sh???t!!!
