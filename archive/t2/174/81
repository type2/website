Subject: Orientation Stud on Alternators and Generators for 1600 DP

While getting all the stuff together to reassemble my 71 long block
which will have an alternator I noticed that there is an orientation
stud along with the two studs that bolt into the plate. It appears that
the purpose of this stud is to ensure that the vent opening in the plate
is in the down position.  I also noticed while looking in my junk bin
that some alternators don't have this pin and that some plates off
Beetle engines aren't notched for the orientation stud.  In my case I'm
either going to have to cut off the stud or make a notch in the plate.
Does it matter which way I go?
