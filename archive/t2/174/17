I think that the chances of the customs officials of actually crawling
down on their backs and checking out the serial numbers on the frame of
an  older bus are two fold--

(1) slim
(2) none

These guys a government reresentatives, not mechanics----!!

They will check out the Vin plates, and that is about it---

So the event will be no big deal--- 

I am going to contact one of the importers of the bugs on Sunday and get
to the bottom of the real story, on this import thing----- 

I'm looking for actual details, not speculative thoughts--

Later,

Terry

Fast and simple , yes, =A0 fool proof ... not hardly, The bus has its
numbers stamped into the frame, it is obvious that the new bus is not an
older one so therefore would prompt custom officials to check out the
vehicle. then they would find the real numbers . Next would be the
confiscation of the bus, you losing all that money, fines to you, and
possible arrest for falsification and smuggling. fast and simple =3D)
