>>>Reinforced tire works much better than a passenger car tire. The LR 'D'
tire just wasn't worth the doubled price TO ME. (I Currently have
Kirkland LT195/75-14 LR C tires on the Riviera and Uniroyal Larado
LT195/75-14 LR C (1435# (-at-) 50psi) tires on the Vanagon. The Vanagon is
due and I'll probably buy the Contis for it.)<<<

Jim the price difference is negligible.
Conti Tire Rack 50
Yoko 356 LR C Tire Rack 51
Yoko 356 LR D Tire Rack 56
Bridgestone 603v Load range C or D Tire Rack 66
