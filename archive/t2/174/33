>Along the lines of this thread: Didn't someone say that the 
going rate for these new 2002 buses was about 19K, not 
including overseas delivery? For that kind of bread you could 
almost get TWO beautiful completely restored original bay 
window buses that are every bit as good as new, probably 
better if they consist of all german parts! So why not go 
this route and not worry about doing the jail time. I have 
heard stories about what they to do to long-haired boys like 
myself in jail, and I want no part of that! That is why they 
call jail the "Pokey" ;^)
