Hi Volks,

Since the Great Canadian Bug Show is a single day show this year,  I'd like
to take this opportunity to introduce three new competition events taking
place on Saturday August 17th at Buses Of The Corn in Whitby Ontario Canada:


Item #1: The Camping Competition
Time: 10:30 AM Saturday.
Competitors drive onto a "campsite" to execute 4 common bus-camping
manouevres. Starting off with setting up for "Dinner-time" they transition
into "Campfire Lounge Mode" followed by laying it out for "Bed-time". Lastly
the campers "Pack It Up" and cross the finish line by driving off the
"campsite". This is a timed event with bonus points available for style and
innovation.


Item #2: Driving Skillz Competition
Time: 1:30 PM Saturday
Competitors will execute manoeuvres such as our Reverse Slalom and
Serpentine Course; Paralell Parking, Tree Avoidance Parking and other
precision driving tests.


Item #3: Transporter Troubleshooting Time Trials
Time: 3:30 PM Saturday
Our Ace judge will disable a supplied test vehicle with 2 debilitating
mechanical ailments. Contestants will be required to troubleshoot the
problems to start the vehicle competing against the clock. A wide array of
spare parts will be available to use if required. Different combinations of
ailments will be assigned to each contestant and elapsed times will be
handicapped to compensate for complexity of repairs required.


For more details on the rules of each competition, please see our website at

Happy trails,
