Hi folks,
    Excuse my enthusiasm.  But I just got home from getting our bus
inspected.  It's been off the road for about 5 weeks while I've repaired a
bunch of problems, some which I created myself.  This time tomorrow ,2PM on
Friday the 7th of June, I'll be headed east to LiMBO On Long Island and a
weekend of fun and relaxation.  Hope I'll see you there.  Check out
http://arasso.tripod.com/limbo/ for all the last minute details.  I'll
monitor CB channel 2 (only appropriate for a type2 vehicle) so try to get me
if you like.

PS:  I really do need to temper my enthusiasm, especially since I know the
engine needs work  :-(
