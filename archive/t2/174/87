Subject: front beam question

What are the holes in the center of the two beams?  Are there supposed 
to be grease fittings in these?  Is it ok that the upper one appears to 
be leaking something like ATF??  I'm just slightly concerned, as i just 
put that beam in about a year and a half ago...
thanks..
