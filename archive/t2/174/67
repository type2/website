Subject: 236K bus passed Insp (NJ)!

NJ has 2 yr "free" inspections, so it was with trepidation that I went
to inspection today with the 78 Westy- would it pass the looser steering
and the emissions on a well used engine?  I warmed it up to 220 degr,
leaned the CO screw on the AFM (one turn counterclockwise), all tuning
on spec, oil fairly new, brakes adjusted etc.  Tooled in to a nearly
empty station (8:30 AM) and they take over your bus while you go to a
waiting area.  Looked back, and about 5 guys were all over the thing
(ogling it more than inspecting it)!  Sh*t- a headlight lowbeam was out;
assumed I blew a lamp.  They did a lot of looking underneath, jumped in
and out of the driver seat, and finally drove it down the track to test
the  brakes.  Passed fine- only 1.86% CO, HC about 170 of the allowed
300.  The headlamp was OK, but the fuse for it (#3) had literally worn
off the pointy end into a  ring....probably from idly spinning the fuses
now and then to insure contact.  I suggest that those of you with 20 yr
old fuses check those ends!
   Off to Limbo on Long Island...........
