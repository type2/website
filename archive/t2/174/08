Subject: 2L ENGINE AT HIGH COUNTRY (need)

Hello list,

I hate to sound redundant but I thought I would post
this again. Is there any one with a good 2L engine
that wouldn't mind unloading it at High Country? I
need a good long block with GOOD COMPRESSION, and
MINIMAL wear. I just need a longblock that does NOT
need to be rebuilt or have to have the head(s) or P/Cs
replaced or rebuilt. I am looking for an engine that
does not burn or leak oil. (If it leaks alittle oil
from the pushrod tube seals, thats fine) I am willing
to pay a fair price and pay for some gas money. I have
to get my bus back on the road soon whether the body
work is finished or not.
