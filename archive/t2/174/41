Subject:  missing bolts/nuts on oil screen mount

So I performed my first oil change on my '71 Westy, and when I unscrewed
the oil screen plate after the oil drained, I noticed that instead of 6
installed bolts and 6 cap nuts to hold the screen/plate on, I had 2
missing "permanent" bolts that instead were reversed - the hole was
threaded into the bottom of the motor instead, and a bolt took the place
of the cap nut... 

this seems a little odd to me. 
Why would this be the case? Anyone else see this? 
cheers
