For a lark, mostly because I've been disappointed in the past, I called VWOA and their records only go back to 1980.  All they could say was what was already repeated in the Bentley.

I called Continental and their O.E. records only go back to 1988.  They don't seem to remember the model name of the O.E. tire for a 78 Camper but said it was 185R14 reinforced inflated 30/front, 40/rear, LRC, for a 5.5" rim.

When asked about the CR21, they said this was equivalent to the O.E. tire and made in Germany and now available in the USA through distributors.
