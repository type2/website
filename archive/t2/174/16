Fast and simple , yes,   fool proof ... not hardly, The bus has its numbers
stamped into the frame, it is obvious that the new bus is not an older one
so therefore would prompt custom officials to check out the vehicle. then
they would find the real numbers . Next would be the confiscation of the
bus, you losing all that money, fines to you, and possible arrest for
falsification and smuggling.  fast and simple =)
