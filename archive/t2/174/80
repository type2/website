Subject: Installing front shocks

Hi,

I'm replacing the OE front shocks on my camper with KYB gas-a-just's and I
noticed that the metal sleeve isn't the same size.

I asked Bus Depot when I bought them if I'd need a mounting kit and the
answer came back no.

Can someone help me on this before I make a mistake?


OEM info for anyone interested.
