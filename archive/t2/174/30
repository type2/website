The catalogs sell a lifting harness/bar with a threaded shaft. You hook 
this bar to the engine with chains and then hook it to the lift.

Once the engine is in the air - you simply adjust the thread shaft on the 
lifting harness and that will allow the engine to hang at any angle you 
want it to.

It would not be hard to make one with a good look at a picture in a 
catalog. Just need some metal stock and a welding machine.
