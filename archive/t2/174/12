Subject: pop-up tent replacement

Hi ,
I have to replace my tired pop-up tent for '75 westy VW.
Where should I buy it?
Which e-shop would you reccomend?
Quality is the most important target for me.

The second question is about years of production and tents - Does anybody
produce tent with 3 windows which fits '75 ???

Piotr
