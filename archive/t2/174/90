I am well aware of the difference in the profile between the two sizes.  
I am also aware of the 6 tenths of an inch smaller diameter from VW alt 
selection tire of 195/75 R14.  This will cause my speedo to read  
slightly higher.  Will have no effect (other than vastly improved 
handling) on anything else.  Bad purchase???  no way!  As stated on VW 
and tire manufacturer  info sheets on obtaining tires for older 
vehicles..tradeoffs will have to be made.
