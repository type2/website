There is only one manufacturer, so no matter where you buy the canvas you
will get the identical product. Only the price will vary. I believe my price
of $208.95 (with listmember discount) is the cheapest around, and I keep
them in stock.  Part number is 231 070 705 for tan or 231 070 705Y for
yellow.

The standard replacement is 100% cotton and does have three windows (with
screens and zippered flaps).  It is well constructed and heavy duty. An
acrylic version is also available for about $40 more.  Each version has its
plusses and minuses; one is not necessarily better than the other. The
acrylic material is primarily used for marine applications, and its big
claim to fame is that the color doesn't fade even after prolonged exposure
to bright sunlight (like on a boat). But since a VW poptop is not exposed to
nearly that much continuous sunlight, I have never even seen the cotton ones
fade after years.  On the other hand, the acrylic is a bit more rigid,
making it somewhat difficult to fold and close the poptop. The acrylic does
have a slightly smoother finish than the cotton, and is perhaps a bit more
stock looking in that regard, although the yellow acrylic is extremely
bright in color.  Personally, it would perhaps be a close call if the two
were the same price, but I can't say that I'd pay extra for the acrylic if I
were buying one for my bus.

The aftermarket canvases are a bit of a snug fit, perhaps slightly snugger
than the original ones (although the manufacturer adamantly insists that
they are precisely the same size, having been cut from a pattern made from a
VW canvas). I have not found them to be objectionally snug as long as you
install them right (don't pull them too taught when stapling in), but I have
had a few customers comment that it was a bit tighter than they'd have liked
(out of hundreds sold). I do have one high-volume commercial customer who
buys Vanagon poptop canvas to use on busses, saying that the extra few
inches in each direction makes for a nicer, less taught install.  This is
your call if you want to do that instead (but decide before you start
installing, as once you put a staple through it you own it!).  If you prefer
to go that route, that canvas is $228 (253 070 704 for tan, Y for yellow, G
for gray).

Installation is easy but time-consuming, as lining everything up just right
(so that the fabric doesn't bunch up anywhere, isn't too tight anywhere, and
is even at the corners) is pretty much a trial-and-error process.
Essentially you put in a few "test" staples, lift the top, look at it,
readjust and repeat until  everything is even all around, then put in the
rest of the screws and staples.  Basic instructions are included. Allow
yourself a good afternoon's worth of time in case you get it right the 20th
time instead of the first time.  You will need a staple gun and a stubby
screwdriver.  It goes faster with two people.
