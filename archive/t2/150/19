Subject: Wiper Delay Relay

I have a '78 Westy Champagne edition and my wiper delay doesnt work. Wipers
work fine in both speeds but when I move the lever down to the delay
setting nothing happens. I suspect the relay as all my wiring is in great
shape. There are several relays on the fuse panel and I am not sure what
each one does. I know the small metal cased one is for my flashers, I
suspect one is a fuel pump relay for the FI, the others...? Is this info in
Bentley? I'm at work and don't have the manual with me. I also have a
Haynes and maybe it is in there?

Thanks
