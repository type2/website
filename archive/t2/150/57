You may want to get as far way from that building as you can before someone
tries to to weld magnesium. If you've ever been to a motorcycle roadracing
event, when it gets dark the racer boys and girls start throwing their
cracked magnesium wheels into the fire, the show is incredible, absolutly
white fire, amazing. I don't even want to think about a fire like that in a
garage. That's the reason magnesium cases and such are labeled as being
magnesium, like bus tranny cases. Don't weld them!
