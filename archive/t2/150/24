Subject: Re: [T2] where to buy a new engine?

Buy another engine if you must but don't sell the bus and start over - at 
least you know this engine.

Pursue the warranty repair. Tell them the weld did not case the case to 
crack but was a response to fix it.

It may take a male to make the point b/c unfortunately we are still in the 
dark ages it seems when dealing with service people and car dealers.

You could clean the weld up with a sander and when you apply for a 
replacement tell them that the mechanic used a sander to clean the metal to 
ensure it was in fact a crack and not a rough edge left over from the 
casting process at the factory.

If it is just leaking then clean it up with a sander and then JB Weld it. 
If the crack gets worse then you have not lost any money. The JB may hold 
it closed.

Why is the crack a problem? If it is leaking then I understand. Is your 
mechanic attributing some other problem - rough running? - to this crack?

I'm not sure you need a new engine yet.
