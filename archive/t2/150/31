That shuddering on take off could be a clutch problem. If the disc is in bad shape or if the flywheel or pressure plate surfaces are warped you will get the same problem. If its your engine sputtering and coughing well thats another story. Does the problem occur if you are on the highway at say 50mph, then floor it? If so then I would not suspect the clutch,flywheel/pressure plate.

Answer:

NO, it happens only as described, first gear taking off if I let the clutch in too fast, occasionally at similar time in second.

Ouch! I was hoping for motor mounts!
