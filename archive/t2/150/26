Subject: AVP Engine Swap Experience Part 2 (long)

I posted back at the end of March about my new AVP engine. Here=92s the =
update:

The good news is that the engine is running well and producing good power. =

The bad news is=85 That I still have oil leaks. The kinds of leaks that I =
have seem
like they are defects in sealing of the case which are only going to get =
worse over
the months and years as the heating-cooling cycle pulls at things. Worse  =
- AVP=92s=20
warranty support has left much to be desired.  Either AVP=92s warranty is =
not (consistently)
honored or their communication with their customers is very poor or both.=20

I picked AVP for among other reasons, their reputation on the list. =
Perhaps then my=20
negative experience is the exception not the norm. Maybe most people do =
not need to
make a claim against the warranty service, but its one of those things =
that you want to
have =93just in case=94.=20

When the engine was delivered, it was missing the warranty card. It took =
several phone
calls, in which AVP said that they had mailed me a copy of the card on two =
occasions
before (just one) arrived. I sent it back certified mail right away. By =
then I was already
trying to get something done about the leaks.

Curiously, the warranty card must be returned to AVP within 5 days of =
engine delivery for
the warranty to be in-force. At the same time, the warranty card requires =
the mileage and
date of engine installation to be written on it. I=92m not sure how strict =
they are on this, but
technically it would mean that the engine must be installed within a few =
days of arrival.=20
Yet at the same time, Erin told me that I would have 60 days to return the =
core as most
people take a while to get the engine put in.

Most people order engines without a flywheel and use their existing =
flywheel when the=20
new engine arrives. AVP says that they generally do not warranty the =
engine not to leak
at the flywheel seal. They say that improper installation of the flywheel, =
lack of greasing=20
the seal, etc. puts such leaks out of their control. I ordered my engine =
with a flywheel.=20
When it arrived, I was a little surprised to see the flywheel in the box =
unattached to the=20
engine. Even though the flywheel could have been installed at their site =
(and presumably
was for testing), they don=92t even install their own flywheels to their =
own enginess so it
becomes the customers problem if it leaks. If I did want to pursue such a =
claim, I would=20
have to pull the seal and send it to them for examination for improper =
installation before=20
such a claim would be considered. It happens that one of my leaks is from =
behind the=20
engine, Lou (my mechanic) is of the opinion that it may be leaking from =
the case or a=20
galley rather than the seal based on how it is leaking, but we won=92t =
know until we pull=20
the engine.

During the installation of the engine, Lou swapped the sump plate from the =
old engine=20
to the new engine because I have a temperature sensor installed there. =
(This is the=20
plate with the two bolts towards the right/rear of the engine). The proper =
practice accoring
to Lou is to install the plate with a silicone O-Ring (an $8 part!). On =
the new AVP engine,=20
Lou found the plate also sealed with silicone sealant which is not =
supposed to be there/be
needed)

As soon as the engine was together it began leaking from an area near the =
strainer. We=20
eventually identified that it was coming from the nut on the case stud =
rear of the strainer=20
plate. AVP had suggested that we try to tighten the nut and failing that, =
that we replace it.=20
To their credit, they did eventually send a nut, a lock washer and a =
strainer plate and the=20
promise to pay 1.5 hours of labor (-at-) $40.

With the nut removed, a drop of oil appeared in just 20 seconds or so. Lou =
ended up fixing=20
this leak with some grey silicone and a flanged nut. Even with the =
=93fix=94, it is arguably a defect
in the sealing of the case. The stud there is supposed to be holding the =
case together, not=20
being an oil seal. The leak there indicates that the case is not properly =
sealed above the stud
cavity.

After this leak, we identified a leaky strainer, which at first glance =
should be a piece of cake.=20
Several strainer gasket kits later, it still leaks. (This engine got many =
oil changes more than=20
spec=92d during break-in.) It now appears that the leak is not coming from =
the strainer-engine=20
interface but from the case halves in the area of the strainer. Since this =
area is close to the=20
other leak that was identified which was due to a case sealing defect, it =
seems likely that=20
the case was just not properly joined/sealed in this area.

The flywheel leak is last significant leak. AVP suggested that it might go =
away after 500 miles=20
as the seal breaks-in. Lou agreed that this was possible. Now at almost =
1500 miles it is still=20
dripping.

There are other minor areas where oil seems to be just weeping out a =
little =96 near one of the=20
pushrod tubes, near the large flat head screw (oil pressure relief spring =
cover?) near the oil=20
filter. It seems to be sealed with silicone also. I didn=92t even get into =
these with AVP. I figured=20
that if I get the major leaks fixed then I=92d live with the rest. Not =
perfect but after many, many=20
days laying under the bus, wiping things off, using Q-tips, driving to the =
mechanics, etc. I=92m=20
tired of messing with it.

My experience in calling AVP is that it takes many phone calls to reach =
them. The only time=20
I got a return phone call was prior to purchase when they called me back =
from their caller-id=20
information. Curiously, the only way that I was able to get through to =
them since then was by=20
dialing *67 (disable caller-id) first. I used to work in service, and I =
think it is generally accepted=20
that a customer of a business should get a call back during the same =
business day in all but=20
the most unusual circumstances. When the customer has to call many times =
and never gets=20
a returned call that just doesn=92t seem right.

The current situation: I sent them a fax three days ago asking that they =
honor their warranty=20
and fix these problems. I called them three times two days ago and three =
times yesterday and=20
did not get a return call or manage to reach them on an incoming call. My =
suspicion is that after=20
sending the fax that they are avoiding dealing with this issue in the =
hopes that I will =93go away=94.=20
I=92ve been very civil and professional in my dealings with them. My =
correspondance and phone calls=20
are documented and I have not called them screaming or upset. In short I =
have been reasonable=20
with them.

If I had to do this again, I would not purchase from AVP. If I did, I =
would buy it through Bus Depot=20
because presumably they have greater leverage to resolve this kind of a =
problem than I do.

If anyone on the list does reach AVP (perhaps prior to ordering) perhaps =
you could ask them to give
me a call. When this is finally resolved one way or the other I will post =
Part 3 which should be the=20
resolution to the saga.
