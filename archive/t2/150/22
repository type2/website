Chris,

A few years back a couple of local Westy owners were very unhappy with their
new Dansk boxes on their late models.  Danskes didn't put out any where near 
what the originals "asbestos" boxes did.  They took them back off and sent 
them to Jet Hot in Phoenix, unassembled. Jet Hot sandblasted them and
coated both the inside and outside of the boxes and put some different kind
of coating
on the finned part.  Back home, they resealed them and put on a "wet"
porcelain
looking wrap (got this from some Concourse guy in California) on the boxes
then fiber wrapped every where else they could.  The difference was
absolutely amazing.  Way better than stock.  Had to turn in DOWN once the
motor warmed
up, especially on the highway.  They had already repaired the center tube
and sealed all the pathways. I thought they were going way overboard but they 
were back country skiers and camped year-round. The repairs held up for
many years. Jet Hot will tell you that the inside/outside coating will 
preserve these boxes well over the 5 year mark.  I've got a BA6 in my '78
that cooks but have thought of doing this to the Dansk boxes I've got laying
around just to make them last longer.

HTH and good luck,
Craig
