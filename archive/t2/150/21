Subject: Re: [T2] FI 2.0L, high idle when warm

my 78 2L with auto tranny has an interesting problem, when I start it,
starts normally, drives normally but after warm up if I shift to N or P
the engine RPMs go way up 2,000+,  setting the idle back won't let it
start or idle when first started.  this is probably putting quite a strain
on the torque converter in stop and go driving.

changed out the temp sensor, went over the injection system works normally
can't find any vacuum leaks fuel mileage is about the same as it has been,
gotta be missing something (besides the idle speed regulator which was
never on the engine from when I got it, anyone got one??)
