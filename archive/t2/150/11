Subject: Re: [T2]  2.0L Engine Noise

Hi Rick,

My 2.0L engine started making a similar noise - right before I shut it down 
and rebuilt it.  It sounds like it could be a rod knocking, especially if it 
corresponds to engine speed.  You may have good compression, but if your 
rods are in bad shape, your engine may not be good for long.

I hope it's just an engine mount issue, but I fear the worst.

Good luck!
