First thing is to make sure you don't get a Bug engine with no provision for
mounting the rear engine carrier.

Second, in my opinion, is to steer away from thin walled cylinders which makes for
a hotter running engine.  My personal preference for a Bus would be thick walled
88s and either a 74 or 78 crank which works out to 1800 and 1900 respectively.  Or
if you go with a stock crank the size with those P/Cs is 1681.  The thick walled
88s are a bit of an oddity in the pre-built engine world.  Resist the sales
people's attempts to sell you on slip in 88s or larger P/Cs, which are all thin
walled.
