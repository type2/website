Subject: Cylinder head temp gauge ?s

I installed a VDO CHT on my 70 westy with a 1600 SP engine about 6 years ago.
I has always been running at an indicated 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
Now it seems to run at closer to 250 !
I do not think the engine is running any cooler.
Has anyone else had their gauge drop in readings?
BTW the CHT is much more rapid to cool off going downhill than the oil temp. 
You can see it drop 50 degrees almost instantaneously when you go down hill 
with VDO  (foot off throttle)
