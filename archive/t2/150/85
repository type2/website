If anyone is going south through Knoxville - I can meet you there and ferry 
it to Cookeville (halfway between Knox and Nash) where it can wait until 
Jason can get there. A dog list I'm on does this hand-off transportation 
all the time on pooches getting adopted halfway across the country. Works 
well.

IF this all acceptable to you Jason.
