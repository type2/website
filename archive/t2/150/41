The ultimate book is called "The Key to Metal Bumping."  This is an old school book originally published in the '30s and currently available with a 1953 copyright.  With this book you will learn the right way to do the job with
excellent explanations and pictures.  I worked in the auto body field for over 10 years and was amazed at what I could learn from this book.  Technology has improved materials over the years but when you are done reading this book
you won't need to use hardly any body filler.  The Karmann Ghia Club of N.A. sells this book for $15 postpaid and we (I'm the regalia guy) have sold about 30 copies over the last several years to Ghia and Porsche guys with
absolutely no complaints.
