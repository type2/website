Hal,

on '68-71s, put the gasket on the housing and put the housing up against
the inside of the opening.  slide it up and down to engage the slot on the
gasket on the lower edge of the opening, then take a small screwdriver and
work your way, a bit on each side, toward the top.  I suppose you could
use a piece of string, as you do when puling a window in as well.  The
process is very like installing a piece of glass, but you work from the
inside out.

On '72-79 buses, there are 4 small nuts on studs.  I *think* they are M6
and will  require a deep socket.  They usually also require a spritz of
kroil and a number of choice curse words.  And when the housing
disintigrates and lets the stud spin, they require all the curse words you
own, plus removing the lens and gripping the hex head of the stud with a
needle nose vice grip, thereby destoying the housing.  They can be gobs of
fun :-(
