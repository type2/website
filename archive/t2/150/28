ah, same thing, same place on the bus, different geographical location in
the world. that is a very sneakly thing in that it is a very hidden defect.
fortunately easily accessible. i wouldn't pull a rocker assembly as a
regular check up, but it is recommended to look very carefully during
rebuild and w/i 5-10k miles in install given the probability of mileage and
type of usage...'specially #3. we will survive.  was yours a type1 too?  -
