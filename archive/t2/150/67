Fill it to a max of 42psi. Start with less as the odds are it will leak.

Chances are the mist valve will be bad. You will know if it leaks from the
top of the steering column.

The valve is NLA. You can get the whole switch which includes the mist
valve.

It is cool to have a working washer system.
