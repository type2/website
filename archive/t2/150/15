Oh come on Tim, it's not that hard.  A few pieces of tin, couple of bolts, 
and the wires.  You don't even have to remove the exhaust.

I concur on not putting in a used one though - you will have no idea how 
long it will last before it fails.  Maybe a month, maybe ten years.  They 
do wear out.  If I were you, I'd spring for a Bosch rebuilt, which should 
be around $120.  Don't buy a non-Bosch rebuilt!  This is not the time to 
save a few bucks with low-cost parts - alternators are not the simplest 
things to rebuild and I've had more than my share of alternator failures 
over the years from Autozone/Pep Boys mass-rebuilt parts.  Go Bosch and you 
will not have to mess with it again.

In addition to the plate on the front of the alternator, there should be a 
plastic gasket sandwiched inbetween the plate and the alternator.  If you 
don't have it, you will need a lot of silicone to seal it up.  I'd call 
BustedBus and see if they have one.
