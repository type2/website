Subject: Kadron FART?

Greets -

I finally talked my brother out of his set of Kadrons (tm). I know, I know - 
why bother?. 'Cuz they're free!

Anyway, I want to hook this setup to a vacuum dizzy, and saw in the archives 
that there's an article on how to do this in the Nov 2000 VW Trends (tm). I 
should, but don't, keep real old issues of magazines hanging around.

1) Is this true?
2) Can anyone help a fellow VW (tm) Westy (tm) owner, and describe or send 
pictures of the article?

Thanks -

Mike & Itch
