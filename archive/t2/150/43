Mike,
Congrats on the comandeering of the Kads.  John 
Connoly and Nemo answered this question for me a few 
months ago.  Yes, it's true, but you have to have the 
carbs ported for vacuum signal.  BTW, don't attempt 
this yourself.

I'm having my carbs ported for signal this weekend at 
a local shop, I'll let you know how it goes.

Also, check out AJ Sims' website www.lowbugget.com for 
tuning tricks & tips for your Kadrons

Good luck,


Later,
