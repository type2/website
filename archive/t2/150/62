Hi Everyone,
I'm still pretty new to the list and have new problems with my 80 westy.  The 
first part would be that I just did the lifters and somehow let the battery 
go dead by leaving the lights on for a night.  So any way finished the 
lifters went to start it and it would not start.  So I jumped it a couple of 
time and it still would idle so I charged the battery.  I jumped in and got 
it to fire up but still would not idle so I made it idle with my foot and 
drove it about 100 yards, that has always fixed the idle.  Not this time, I 
put it back in my spot and saw smoke coming from the dash, and I notice that 
the fuel pump does not make its normal hiss type sound when I put the key in 
and check the warning lights but they still work.  Now I don't know what to 
check or replace, the double fuel relay or the fuel pump or both. Limited 
funds and I used to work at a parts store and saw way to many people replace 
lots or wrong parts,  I would like to not be that guy.  Not sure if I can 
check either with a Voltage Meter or just blindly replace one or the other 
and hope for the best?  I only have the idiots book and that's not helping 
much right now.  Any help with this would be great.
Thanks
Kevin
80 Westy
