i would think por-20 (the high temp por-15) or having
them jet coated would work fine if you wanted to wrap
them.  another idea would be to use por-20 with the
metal reinforced wrap por15 now makes to wrap them up
in.  they would be nearly bullet proof after that and
you would never have to worry about them being rusted
from the outside.  i know one of the companies does
the jet coat type coating and will do both inner and
outer surfaces but i'm not sure which one.  my main
concern with doing that though would be the heat
transfer inside and how much it would drop.
