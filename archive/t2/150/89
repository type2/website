Hello list,

I hate to do this but I have been informed that my
sodium exhaust valves were selling new now for about
$60.00 a piece. So they are no longer for sale for
$65.00 with free shipping. If someone would like to
make me an offer, I will consider it. Sorry.

I was also informed that the rods will also fit a 1800
as well as a 1700 in case anyone was wondering. Thanks
again. Have a great day!
