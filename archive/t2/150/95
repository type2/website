Subject: Sliding Windows/ Heater Elbows '77

I'm looking for sliding side windows that will fit my '77 transporter to 
replace the vent-wing windows I currently have. If anyone has these windows 
or knows where to get them I'd appreciate the tip.

Also, I'm looking for the elbows that connect the heater box to the flapper 
box (hope I've got this terminology correct). My heater boxes are the oval 
type and are in good shape, but, of course, useless without the elbows.

Thanks,

Scott Hutchison
'77 Transporter w/ Sunroof
