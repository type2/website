Ummm... if I'm not mistaken the '79 engine with it's larger flywheel, 
clutch and pressure plate will interfere with the '74's bellhousing.  I've 
heard that the bellhousing can be clearanced to make it work, but I think 
it would still be a very tight fit.  I would use the '74 flywheel and 
clutch instead.
