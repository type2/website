Subject: Need decent used Type IV motor, Oregon or Washington

I have a friend with a 72 bus and a minimum amount of money who needs a used 
1700, 1800 or 2000 in running condition. If you are in oregon or washington 
and have one for sale please contact me off list.
As a side note my 77 is running pretty well and i think i finally have the 
#$#(-at-)%#$ valve problem contained, now onto the front end....

ps. the northwest vw show (puyallup WA) last weekend was pretty incredible, 
but no one entered a bay window, where was everyone?
