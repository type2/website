That shuddering on take off could be a clutch problem. If the disc is in
bad shape or if the flywheel or pressure plate surfaces are warped you will
get the same problem. If its your engine sputtering and coughing well thats
another story. Does the problem occur if you are on the highway at say
50mph, then floor it? If so then I would not suspect the clutch,flywheel/
pressure plate.

For what it's worth, my bus makes an incredible shuttering, the whole
vehicle shakes sometimes when I'm starting out in first or second.

The list gave me some ideas, but this motor mount one makes a lot of sense.
I don't have the problem at speeds, just under the high torque of getting
started.

I'll be checking the motor mounts this weekend. It's a lot cheaper than a
rebuild anyway.
