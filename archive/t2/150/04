Results from another list:
The ceramic coatings are better than the wrap. The wrap
caused (on H2O engines, at least) severe metal failure -
the cast manifolds cracked after one year. OTOH, the
quality on the ceramic coatings varied from source to
source. Some coat individually, some batch coat...Try
and get references before choosing a coater...
