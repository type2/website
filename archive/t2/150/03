Subject: what i will admit to today

while getting ready for a little two hour trip this weekend, i thought i'd
check valves and timing on the doublecab. valves not too far off, but i
noticed something odd; more oil on the valve cover than the right side had.
thought i'd put it together to run and get some o-rings for the studs that
are on the cylinder head which hold the rocker assembly. (sure enough they
were bone brittle.) before i drove off i saw three cracks in the cast,
support fitting at #3 valves. when i returned with o-rings i slipped the
support off the stud and it fell into one piece and two big half inch
chips. never saw that one before. as i was about to slip on a new support i
noticed the whole stud was cracked very deeply right around the front hole.
well fortunately i have a few spare engines at my doorstep...literally. i
raided one of them and buttoned up. more fweem. moral of the story i guess
is that i read just last week about the guys that had broke down in nevada,
and i had followed their thread (vintage list?) - i guess i was more
conscious about my rockers since i recall they had a bit of damage with
that. i'll carry a spare rocker stud on board now in case the other shoe is
gonna drop. the old stud is a new drift.
