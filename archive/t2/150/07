Hi Brett,

I had a problem with things not working sometimes on my previous bus ('73) - turned out to be that the wire from the ignition switch to the fuse box was loose at the switch end.
The wire was fitted with a metal tag which fits into a small metal ring which is then squashed to make the connection, all I needed to do was to sqash the ring down a bit more to make a good contact.

Good luck
