Larry,

In my opinion, por-15 is worth every penny.

Go back to their site and read the FAQ.  You don't have to use all 4 
items...if you sandblast or clean otherwise, or some other gotcha's.

Their site lists everything you need to know.

Basically, por-15 like something other than shiny/greasy metal....it wants 
something with "tooth".  por-15 is suseptible to uv light(sunlight) so you 
need to paint over it if it is in sunlight.

A quart seems to cover more than I ever thought it would.

*Read* the warnings!  Wear a respirator.


Cheers, dave
