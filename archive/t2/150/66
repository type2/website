Kevin,
	I would start at the battery end. Make sure that you now have some
good voltage there. I believe that Sean reported a few days ago that
the fi system ran on something like 10 volts but ran bad. Since this
suddenly poped up after killing the battery. Give that a shot first &
give us a shout back. Oh BTW, you are sure correct w/ not just
pull/replace. That never seems to fix much. I'll let dr Tim expound on
how important procedure & testing is. It is.
