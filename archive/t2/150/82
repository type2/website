I know this  was covered extensively by others, but I wanted to say:

You can fit any T1 engine to any T1 trans and any T4 engine to any T4
trans......

you treat the flywheel, clutch disc, and pressure plate (or drive plate
and torque converter)  as being part of the transmission!  Despite being
bolted to the engine, they are really part of the transmission and have to
match it.  There are, of course, other issues involved in putting a '72
1700 engine into an 82 Vanagon, but the trans and engine block will work
and play well together if  you use the flywheel/drive plate from the
vanagon trans on the end of the 1700 crankshaft.
