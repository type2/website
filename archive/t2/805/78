Hi Jason,
  First you really should not post stuff for post-1971  buses on the
vintagebus list.
  Check your tires for proper weight rating.  For the earlier  lighter
pre-1968 buses this was 1,525 Lbs., when we went from bug 1,200 Lbs.  weight
rated
tires it made a HUGE difference in side winds.  Good shocks  will help also.
