Subject: Re: [T2] FI or carb

When I first started on the list, I asked the same question since I had 
worked on vw's since 1966, but not FI.

Bottom line...a bus that sat for 8 years.

Went thru the test in the book sentence by sentence and all was 
well....except old gas had destroyed almost every part it touched.

4 new injectors
new pressure valve
new fuel pump
new hoses

The *real* bottom line.....
Being able to start the bus remotely if I want to, cause it is FI!

Starting it without touching the gas pedal....Priceless!(and modern)

Cheers, dave

lots of snipping
