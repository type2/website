Subject: engine mount  rear adapters

Hey guys and gals,

I was wondering if there is such an adapter that will allow me to mount a
DP1600  bug motor in  Helen wheels {aka "71  Westy"}  I found what looks to be
a motor out of an early 70's  beetle in rebuildable condition for a spare. The
only difference seems to be that the case does not have the drillings for  a
bus rear engine carrier, the casting under the oil pump plate is bullnosed, so
I could not just tap it. Does an adapter exist?..... I've heard of
them,......never seen one avail. in any catalogs ..... are they mere folklore?
.....like muffler bearings?.... Please smack me if there is something in the
archives, I did look,..perhaps I missed it, After all I'm a drummer!

Any help would be greatly appreciated,
thanks,

Al , {only bus in Phillipsburg NJ, Helen Wheels} Wanamaker
