John,

I just followed Terry's advice and did a google. The search turned up a 
lot of baywindow Devons, not too many conversations of those 
"collectors'" years. Nevertheless, I've seen a lot of pictures of them, 
and they seem to be of two kinds. One is very crude; the wood looks 
like pine. The other is much more interesting, with fit and finish 
equal to Westfalia, but different. The table, for instance, stores 
under the high shelf in back. The sleeping arrangements are much like a 
Westfalia SO-23. In the earlier buses, the conversions were in 
non-walkthroughs, with a "cooker" behind the passenger. (Keep in mind 
that everything is bassackwards). In bays, the cooker is just inside 
the sliding door, next to the bench seat.

I say all of this for a reason: it's my guess that a lot of the Devon 
camper layouts you see in restored early buses has actually been taken 
from baywindows and modified to fit (keep in mind that working on older 
vehicles is a significant industry in the U.K., not like here in the 
U.S.)

So if you really want to find early Devon, you've got to make sure it's 
early Devon. Otherwise, be satisfied looking at the baywindow examples.

Anyone from U.K./Europe want to dispute or confirm?

Mark
