Subject: John Brown's Buses Report

Well I was so excited to type up the events of JBB that Gary is still
unpacking the bus as I type this. JBB was a complete success. The weather
couldn't have been nicer along with the people who showed up. There were about
35 buses total including the ones who just showed up for the day. There was a
very good turn out from the PA. crowd and even though the younger Pott's
couldn't make it the senior Pott's did. We had a great pot luck supper
Saturday evening and I think just about everyone got a door prize later that
night. We all agreed that we are moving the event next year because the KOA is
just to expensive and not very friendly. They don't know what they will be
missing next year when we don't show up. We are probably moving it to
Brunswick MD to coincide with the Railroad Days event in town. We have already
checked out a campground near town that said they would love to have us and
they are about half the price of the KOA. Gary has already come up with the
slogan and design for the tshirts for next year but we will keep that under
wraps until then. I just wanted to thank everyone who helped especially Jeff
Stewart and my husband Gary. We had a great time and we hope all of you did
too. We hope to see you next year in Brunswick MD. The campout will remain
John Brown's Buses so keep checking the website for updates.
