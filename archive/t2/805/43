Thanks for the input people.

I think someone got the wrong idea. I just wanted to know if we can obtain a
trip permit in Ohio, that is the only question. All the rest of the
importation details have been taken care of. John has answered the question
with a "no, you need to be an Ohio resident to get a trip permit". Some
states will issue trip permits to anyone who is the owner of the vehicle,
regardless of where they live, but not Ohio.

Thanks,
