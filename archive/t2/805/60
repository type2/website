Subject: Colorado Junkyard Bus Found - 73 Westy

73 Westy. Full pop top, good sink and jumpseat. CB case engine that turns
and feels like it has compression. Both carbs and airbox there as well.
Everything looks great. The doors and seatbelts were taken while I was
there... Tranny gone. I got the cooling flaps (top and bottom). The tent
fabric looks good but the seams have all come apart. Bed in great condition.

It's at Pick'n'Pull in Aurora.
