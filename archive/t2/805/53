When I do CVs, I just put a floor jack under the shock mount and jack the
tire just barely off the ground.  You can safely work under the car then
as long as you make sure that you have a few inches of clearance between
you and the bus.  This is easy with a bus, but I'd never do it with a low
modern car!  Leaving the tire on means that you can pull against it to
hold the CV still while wrenching.
