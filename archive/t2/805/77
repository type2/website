Hey Folks,

      Just a quick note to say thanks to all who 
came out this wekend to make JBB a success. It was really nice to see everyone, 
and it was great to meet some new VW folks as well. I arrived at the KOA 
Thursday night (not the first arrival though, as a Vanagon from Connecticut was 
already there). It poured all night Thursday, but luckily it did stop raining 
Friday, and the weather was great the rest of the weekend, tho a bit windy. I do 
have some pictures posted, follow the link below and click on "Photos" then the 
"JBB 2005" folder. I guess I was having too good a time to take too many 
pictures, as I was surprised at how few I had-only 9. If anyone else has any 
pics, please feel free to add them.      
Thanks,   Jeff
