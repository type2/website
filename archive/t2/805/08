Paul,

European woods and American woods are often different. Ash is usually 
used in upholstered furniture frames, holds tacks well, probably holds 
staples, too. And ash is currently one of the cheapest hardwoods on the 
market. Maple would probably work, but it's actually a bit too hard. 
Same for birch. Popular is cheap, and would work. But I would go with 
ash.
