1.  forget everything you know about carbs and old style fuel systems
2.  get the VW FI book (in type2 library if not found anywhere else)
3.  follow the trouble shooting chart to check out components.
4.  the brainbox (ECU) is very rarely the problem
5.  make sure fuel lines are solid (good idea with carbs too) FI is high
presure
6.  check each component independent of the system
7.  install, check, forget.
8.  enjoy your ride
