Oops.. guess nobody said to watch out for that.  Sorry.. yeah, those 
things will fall apart.

Did you read through the bentley?  Do you have a bentley?

I would highly recommend getting one because it will assist you big time 
in not only this project, but others as well.  It warns you about things 
like the balls falling out... it also talks about assembly of those 
joints which can be somewhat frustrating.

Also, make sure you don't let the whole cage fall apart because it can 
only go back together in a certain orientation.  Put it together in the 
other orientation and it won't flex like it's supposed to.
