Hiya Dan,

"the cv only moves a tiny bit"

This is not a good sign.  New CVJs tend to be "stiff", but have the full 
range of movement.  Older CVJs should easily move in all directions.  It sounds as 
if that CVJ has been reassembled incorrectly.  And this is VERY easy to do.  
Easy to do even when following directions.  Were it me, I'd take apart and 
reassemble.  The more you handle the CVJ in the disassemble/reassemble routine 
the better you will see how it operates and should go together.  Just hang in 
there with this - be persistent - you'll get it.
