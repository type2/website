It boils down to parts availability and cost.

I have lots of type 1 parts that won't fit on the type 3.... I have 3 
new stock type 1 exhausts... and I can't find a *quality* exhaust setup 
for the type 3 at a reasonable cost...just those aftermarket 
"performance" things that tend to rust away after one new england 
winter... I'm missing the intermediate heater boxes (the ones that are 
between the muffler and heater boxes..) from the type 3 and they are 
expensive to replace. I haven't seen a good quality aftermarket solution 
to replace the complete type 3 exhaust.

I also have a new carb and manifold for a type 1 setup which won't work 
on the type 3 (i'm pretty sure). I have no available dual carb setups to 
put on the type 3.

I figured it would be more economical to go out and find the parts to 
convert to type 1 style than get a dual carb setup and exhaust that 
would complete the type 3 setup. If I had the parts, it would be a 
different story.

The purpose of this engine is to swap into the bus while I rebuild the 
tired type 4 that is badly leaking oil out of the  flywheel seal. I 
fully expect the 1600cc to buy me some time to complete the job and then 
maybe end up in another bus in the near future.
