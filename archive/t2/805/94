That happened to me in my '70 Beetle years ago. Engine quit, so I
went to restart it and heard/felt a Boom!  I thought my friend
following behind on the way to my mechanic hit me...until I saw
the thick black smoke billowing up from my engine compartment.
Luckily, he had a gallon of water with him and we were able
to douse all the flames. I was lucky I didnt lose the whole car.
