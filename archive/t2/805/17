You are right, it is a fluctuation from 0 to 1v approximately you are
looking for.

The o2 sensor light trigger is a simple clockwork mechanism, it is not a
sensor per se, which means that if the dash light is on, it is 30k (iirc)
miles since someone reset the clockwork. But is does not mean the sensor is
bad. However, 30k miles on an o2 sensor and it should be replaced.
