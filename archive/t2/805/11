Hiya Dan,

Unfortunately the BIG problem with the CVJs is that they will go together 
(and look good) INCORRECTLY.  So you really do need to be careful at this point 
in the proceedings.  An incorrectly assembled CVJ will not give you the 
rotational (up, down, and around and around) freedom that a properly assmbled CVJ 
will.

Bentley is pretty much the standard and I am a big fan of Bentley.  But in 
this case, for this specific job, the Muir Idiot book will walk you right 
through it.  Diagrams too.

Oh, and by the way, there is an excellent article on doing the CVJs right 
here in the Type2 Library.  Check it out!
