Subject: Pop Top wood

Hi Folks,

I just finished with the archives, where I made myself dizzy reading old
posts, but didn't come up with a good definitive answer.  I need to replace
the wood in the fiberglass pop top on our 71 westy but don't know what the
best kind of wood to use is.  A local bus owner here on Long Island
suggested Maple and another suggested Pau Lope (whatever that is).  Any
other suggestions on what kind of wood to use that will accept the canvas's
staples without too much trouble and yet hold on to those staples so they
won't come out?  Anyone know what kind of wood was there originally?

Thanks in advance for the help.
