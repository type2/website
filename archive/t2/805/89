Subject: Re: [T2] FI or carb

I have a single Weber and have been pleased with it. 
I haven't had those problems.  But I have always
preferred FI in other vehicles I've owned.  Tell me
more about the AFC system.  What does it cost, how
hard to install, can a dope like me figure out the
instructions, etc?  I'm not opposed to change if it
can save me trouble down the road.  And I could use a
little better gas mileage.  Thanks...KR
