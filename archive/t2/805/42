Subject: Re: [T2] Ohio Trip Permit

Hi John,

With no title I wouldn't even TRY to get it across the border. I'm  
sure there is a title as Scott is acquainted with these regulations.

TITLE:
To import a vehicle into Ontario you must have a copy of the title  
filed at the designated border crossing point three business days in  
advance of the border crossing. Unless this is done you cannot get  
the customs paperwork required to register the vehicle in Ontario.  
Without that customs paperwork you cannot get an Ontario license  
plate. So it's not possible for Scott's friend to get an Ontario  
plate for the bus in advance of the import. That is not to say that  
he couldn't simply bring a different Ontario plate along with him....  
but I have no idea if that would be legal in Ohio or not.

JURISDICTION:
There's also the question of New York and/or Michigan state laws....  
Unless the bus is crossing Lake Erie somehow it's going to have to  
travel through those jurisdictions to get back to Ontario.

TEMP PERMITS:
I'm not aware if it would be legal to use an Ontario trip permit  
outside of Ontario, but I know for certain that one will be required  
once the vehicle crosses into the province.

FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE: (my father went through this almost exactly a  
year ago)
Last fall my Dad brought a 67 Splitty back from Seattle WA to  
Toronto... He drove it with a current Ontario plate registered to the  
new owner, and carried the title and bill of sale with him. He had no  
legal problems with this across the entire mid-west, but he wasn't  
pulled over, so that's moot. Once he got into Ontario the border  
guards would not let him continue using the borrowed plate, so he had  
to take a taxi to the MTO office and get a 10-day temp permit.

Happy trails,
