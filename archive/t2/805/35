Subject: more cv questions

i got everything back together.  i believe the joint that camre apart it
together correctly based on muir and bentleys.  on the side that came
apart (transmission end) the body of the cv only moves a tiny bit.  the
wheel end (stayed together) moved very freely.  have i put this back
together incorrectly?  i seem to recall it flxeing much more when it
came off the tranny.
