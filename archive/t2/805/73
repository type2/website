Subject: Fw: [T2] Devon Interior

I actually have an interior from a 62 devon - i'm in the process of pulling 
it out - it is missing a few parts and I disassembled the back over the 
engine bay cabinet with out taking enough pics - now a month has passed and 
I'm kinda unsure as tho how it goes together.  It has a long board that goes 
across and two (I think) cabinets that go on either side.

 Maybe the most informative site I found was this
 http://www.devonmoonraker.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/OthersalesBrochures.html

 But I'd still like to find some nice pics of the inside of a restored or
 original devon caravette.
