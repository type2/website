Exactly.

It's easy to find faults with an old FI setup after installing a new  
set of carbs. My advice to those having problems with FI, is to strip  
the engine of the parts, test them individually, clean the contacts  
and rejuvenate it. Find the faulty part and replace it.

The only downside I can see to the system is having to replace every  
part with a new one ($$$ cost) but I've never met or heard of anyone  
having to do this who had a competent mechanic.

The temp sensor II seems to fail after 100k miles of heat cycles but  
luckily it's a $12 part.

I've had to replace the cold start valve because it's spray pattern  
was poor but I considered that fix optional. I've also replaced the  
fuel pressure regulator because it couldn't hold the fuel lines  
pressure after the engine turned off. In both cases the engine ran  
well without noticeable problems but they were revealed to me during  
testing. That goes to show in part that the FI system has some fault  
tolerance engineered in.
