Everything Bob said, plus:

1. As long as each part passes visual inspection, there are two parts 
you should get new or rebuilt (in the latter case): fuel pressure 
regulator and AFM.

2. The biggest problems you will have assembling the system are that 
the harnesses tend to be fragile, and may need to be checked for 
continuity, and the hoses will of necessity be a mixture of new hoses 
and used. You must test for vacuum, using a gauge, to make sure that 
this system is tight.

3. If you include the EGR in the system, make sure the plenum is 
cleaned out.

There are abundant resources for restoring an FI system that has been 
changed to carbs. But it is not a weekend job; plan for a couple of 
weekends at least, with down time. Once it's set up, and working 
properly, you can practically forget about fuel delivery.
