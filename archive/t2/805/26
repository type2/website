Subject: Does anyone in CT know how to change window rubber and wanna

Hi, my Bay is in dire need of new windshield rubber, as well as the pass side rear window, and the rear window. With all this rain we've had, i got alot of h20 in the bus, and do not want it to happen again. 
 
I can offer help, beer, and some money, or my mechanical skills in trade since I am a mechanic. 
 
hopefully next weekend would be a good time to do it.....
 
peace,
Tracy
