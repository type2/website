Subject: Fuel Cut-Off Solenoid Valve

A while ago there was some discussion about how to install, where to get the
parts, etc.   I can't seem to find any of the info I saved on this.  I'm
looking to do this on my '71, and am wondering if there are any decent fuel
solenoid valves available that would thread directly on to the tank outlet -
at least, that is the ideal solution in my mind.
