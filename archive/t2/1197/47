Yes, I bought two ARC121SS 12V. One for my Bus and one for my Beetle.

I don't have them installed yet.

The SS designation means it has stainless steel guts.

This has alot of the same info. I contributed some. Hope posting Samba 
links here isn't bad form. ;)

Please share here any insight you might develop into the project.

I'm adamant about not driving a newly restored Westy (at some point) 
with a risky fuel system waiting to destroy my investment of time, 
energy and money.
