Subject: RE: [T2] looking for advice on a new camper

Seven years ago I found a car (someone had posted it to the Type 2 list) and
the boss lady allowed me to entertain the idea of buyng it.  The price was
right and it was a mid-life crisis kind of thing.

I got a list member (Troy Wical) to check it out for me - I was in Tennessee
and the car was in Colorado.  He test drove it and sent me a bunch of
pictures.  He helped me with the purchase and even towed it home to his house
on a trailer.

I flew out a few weeks later and he picked me up at the airport in it.  Then
we all went to the first annual "Parking in the Pines."  Sunday morning at 4
AM I set out for home.  Monday afternoon it was in my garage.  No problems.

I had previously shipped out a bunch of tools, I took the AIRs list with me,
and I had AAA.  Would I do it again?  You bet I would.  On the one hand, I'm
getting too old for this shit, but on the other hand, you only live once.

Foster is my daily driver now.
