It's a good start. Is it Chris who built this? We do a lot of User
Interface Design, so if want some feedback, let me know. First thought
would be to only show members who have updated their account info. That
would give a more realistic view of current members who could help. You
could potentially have a "Show All Members Regardless of Updated Info" or
some sort of similar option.
