Subject: New Airslist - www.aircooledrescue.com

I haven't seen this posted here yet and since it was just brought up I thought
I would promote Chris's website.  He made a new list and added everyone from
the old list.  The awesome part is that you can actually add yourself and
change your own info,  He has been very responsive also.  I was in the list
but of course it was all outdated info.  I created a new account and then
emailed Chris to remove the info.  It was done in less than a day.  Check it
out if you haven't already, I think you'll like it
