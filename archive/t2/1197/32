Subject: Re: [T2] Front of pop-top will not seat properly

It probably *is* the clip up front. Mine did it when I pulled the top
off for paint. 

That was 3 or 4 years ago so I don't remember which way I had to move
the clip to make it seat right again.

I'll go out in a few to raise the top and take a pic and try to get a
pic or video as it lowers if I can find a helper.
