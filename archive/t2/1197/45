Subject: Re: [T2] Front of pop-top will not seat properly

Wow Gerald,

That is a fantastic help. It was raining heavily today but I will attempt
it rain or shine tomorrow. The video really helps. Your guess is correct,
the top clip is sliding in front of the bottom clip rather than behind it.
I will push and pull on the tabs to get aligned again.

Pat, I'll double check those strips as well. Something triggered it to not
work after many years of proper up/down functionality.

I'll let you all know the results,

Max
