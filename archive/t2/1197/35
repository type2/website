Subject: Westy interior measurements

Hello list,

I did not get a bite on my last post, so I thought I would try again. I need
some measurements of the 68-72 or so interior. When the westy bed is in the
bench configuration, what is the distance from the seat back to the outer edge
of the seat bottom? ( seat depth) also, what are the dimensions of the stool?
The one with the metal tubular legs, not the box.

Thanks!
