Subject: Re: [T2] Front of pop-top will not seat properly

The pop-top has landed! It took several up/down attempts with pulling on
the metal tab between each attempt but it is now down. Everything is tight
and the slide mechanisms are lubed. It is still an abnormality that this
occurred but I'll look into that later.

Thanks again everyone for clarifying how the poptop is supposed to work.
