Subject: RE: [T2] looking for advice on a new camper

So I'm looking over thesamba pretty much any free moment. I'm currently
looking at a late model bay window. With a type iv engine, and hydraulic
valves.

 

I don't know anything about either. I thought that hydraulic valves meant
you don't have to adjust them, but not sure if that is correct, or what else
it might mean.

 

It is Fuel Injected, I had a '71 squareback with fuel injection. I vaguely
recall it being finicky, but when it is tuned properly it can run really
well. Could you say the same for a FI bus?

 

Any items specifically that you recommend I look into for this vintage bus?
Sorry, it is a '78.

 

Thanks for your continued support..
