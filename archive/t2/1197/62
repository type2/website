Here is sample of my update sent to me:
"Hi Folks~

  Our current inventory and prices are listed below; let us know if you 
have any questions. To Unsubscribe, follow the link listed at the bottom 
of the page.

Current Inventory and Models
Photos of our inventory below can be found on our website at 
www.poptopheaven.com. Don't be afraid, we can ship to all 50 
states...right to your door :)

*Please note* - The inventory listed below reflects ALL of our current 
campers, some of which have not yet posted to the website.  We post a 
camper to the website once the reconditioning process has neared 
completion.  You may initiate purchase of any camper at any time, 
regardless of its progress in the reconditioning process.  Doing so 
essentially "bumps" it to the head of the line, so that we can finish it 
for you prior to taking delivery.
