I have been re-watching all of the Magnum, PI episodes from the start  
of the first season, and there are heaps of buses in them.  I guess  
some of them weren't even 5 years old yet!

One episode featured a single cab, and in a flashback to Magnum's  
first case, he's driving a beetle (early 60s, I believe) that has a  
full flow system installed in it.

Gives me a smile every time I see one...

Cheers,
    Tom
