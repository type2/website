Subject: Re: [T2] Front of pop-top will not seat properly

Thanks for the ideas Stuart. The cot is folding properly and there is
nothing in the way of the pop top closing. The scissor mechanism has never
been lubed so I will look at that tomorrow. It doesn't catch anywhere
though and feels normal.

The metal tab seems to overlap properly. It forms a backwards S when
collapsing but that does seem to be the only piece that could impede
downward movement. Perhaps I will try to unscrew the metal tab attached to
the fiberglass and see if it seats properly.

Thank you again for the ideas,

Max
