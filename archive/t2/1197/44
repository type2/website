Mark,
 
This does bear a bit of further thought.  First you got to go to a
place that sells by the gallon (has a gage) not a place that just fills 20lb
tanks (that aren't even 20lb with OPD anymore) with a scale.
 
Next the guy
has to know what he is doing.  All old RV's are like this, but you will
occasionally get some kid who doesn't understand the concept, and that is how
tanks got overfilled and things blew up (if they really ever did.)  Now that
modern RV tanks have OPD valves, it will swing again toward people not
understanding "grandfathered" tanks like these with the tap.  Government
saving us from ourselves as always.  (If indeed any tanks ever really ever did
blow up, as they would simply vent from their safety diaphragm, which
admittedly might be inconvenient when camping near a fire for instance.) 
Anyway if the guy/kid seems confused by it having the 80% tap, just move along
to somewhere else.  In WV, most Southern States would fill them, and would
understand correctly as would LP places.   They should not refuse to fill
because of a non OPD tank, but they can refuse you if they feel the tank is
unsafe structurally.  Which bears checking as
 they love, love to rust under the welded on ID tag in salt belt states, even
to 1/2 the thickness of the tank rusted away.
 
Anyway, be careful, and enjoy
the wonders of cooking with gas.
 
John
