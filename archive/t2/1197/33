about the awning I have started with a blue tarp and just throw it over 
the bus with a couple of telescoping PVC pipe poles that I made for 
support,  now I have this canoe that lives on my bus so that gives a 
little more head room but is super simple and with a few bungie cords and 
tent pegs I can get it up in a couple minutes alone.
