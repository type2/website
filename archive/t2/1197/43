I changed my 71 bus seats for audi seats, about 10 years ago.  Reasons a) speakers in headrests,  b)  headrests.  Still going strong although I do listen to serius most of the time when south of the border.
Brilliant sun but still cold.  With windchill, -26C this am.  Zanderbus still in winter quarters.
