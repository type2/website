Subject: Propane

I have no idea how much propane is in the tank under the floor - it  
had propane in it when I bought my Westy, and I've used it a few times  
on camping trips, to cook and to run the fridge. I tried the trick  
with letting the burners go for a few minutes and spraying water on  
the tank, but I couldn't see anything happen.

What happens if you take it for a fill-up and there's propane inside?  
Anything? Nothing?

Thanks!
