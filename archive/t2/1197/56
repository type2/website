Hi Jamie,

 

You probably know this already - but Muir talks about jacking the VW up, and
then  pulling on the tire at 12 and 6 as well as at 3 and 9. 

 

If there is slop at 12 o'clock, you've probably got problems with your
link-pins. If you have plan in and out-I think that means problems with the
wheel bearings. 

 

Wandering and squeaking-sounds like a swing lever issue. 

 

I hope that helps, and I also hope someone else on the list will correct my
errors in advice ;)
