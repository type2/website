My experience (YMMV) is that whichever camper you pick, you'll  
jealously covet the others. I had a 1976 (baywindow) but currently  
have a 1982 Vanagon Westfalia. The key point about my current camper  
is that it is CAVERNOUS inside. I routinely end up having six or seven  
students inside on cold evenings when we field camp.

I expect the day may come when I get a Eurovan.

I glance with longing at every splittie I see, have fond memories of  
my bay, and wonder whether I might be better off with an aqua-cruisin'  
Vanagon.
