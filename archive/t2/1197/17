Subject: Front of pop-top will not seat properly

Hi everyone,

I had my pop top open this weekend, on my '71 Westy and after I closed it I
noticed the front of the pop top was not lowered onto the roof as normal.
It sits about an inch off the top of the roof. This has never happened in 8
years of use.

The top opens and closes with no apparent binding, no brackets are loose,
and the front curved metal pieces appear to overlap properly. Does anyone
have any idea of what may cause this malfunction?

These are pictures at a variety of angles of this issue:

I have spent about 45 minutes poking my hand beneath the roof while I have
it fully opened trying to feel any thing that would keep the top from
seating properly.

Thank you for any advice on this issue,
