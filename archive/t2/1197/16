Brian,

I would order 4 rebuilt torsion arms with brand new balljoints from
Bus-boys.com

They are in Redding, CA. You just need to send them yours when you are done
to get your core charge back. Pretty much the easiest way if you don't have
a full service shop in your garage.

I've installed several sets now and never had a problem.
