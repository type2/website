Subject: remote oil cooler

Thank you to everyone that responded.  Not sure if engine "needs" remote
cooler or not.  Engine came from a donor bus that I bought to cannibalize
the poptop.  My old engine, 1.7L had been sitting with open intakes for the
past 15years on an engine stand and mouse pee got the better of it.

The GE Code 2.0L is unfortunately a GEX rebuild from the donor bus.  Lucky
so far that at least I have matching cases.  Not sure what kind of shape
the heads are in.  I have fired the engine sitting on the floor and it does
appear to run ok.  Checked compression highest 110, 105, 105, 98.  Don't
have tools for leakdown test yet.

I was just tearing down the tinwork to add the gasket between the stock oil
cooler and the tin when I noticed the heat pipe from the heat exchanger
missing and the hoses to the remote oil cooler basically in it's space.
(Doesn't seem like a good idea to me to be blowing hot air up towards the
stock cooler.)

From what everyone appears to be telling me, a properly operating 2.0L
should not need the external cooler.  I live in Maine and we don't get many
hot days anyways.

Should I remove the filter housing that has the tappings for the remote
cooler and replace with housing from my 1.7L?  I assume that if I plugged
them off instead that I would be stopping flow through the engine.

Thank you for all the help.
