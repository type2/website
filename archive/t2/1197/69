Subject: Re: remote oil cooler

I strongly agree with the advice given below.. many times I have seen the 
lines for a full flow oil cooler system are quarter inch, or maybe a little 
larger.. and the fitting have very small holes in them,, I think the remote 
cooler lines and holes in the fittings should be larger than the stock oil 
gallies...
this makes the fittings very large,,, but it allows flow,instead of pressure 
losses... ymmv

Absolutely correct. If you have valid evidence that the oil is running too
hot, clean the stock cooler fins. I have seen them 2/3rd blocked yet still
adequate for purpose. On type I, II, III and IV engines, as well as the
4cyl 356/912 Porsches of similar design. 

You must also insure all the proper pieces of tin are installed and
adjusted correctly. With cleaned stock oil cooler, plenty enough cooling
for all intents and purposes.
