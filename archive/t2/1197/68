Absolutely correct. If you have valid evidence that the oil is running too
hot, clean the stock cooler fins. I have seen them 2/3rd blocked yet still
adequate for purpose. On type I, II, III and IV engines, as well as the
4cyl 356/912 Porsches of similar design.

You must also insure all the proper pieces of tin are installed and
adjusted correctly. With cleaned stock oil cooler, plenty enough cooling
for all intents and purposes.

Several times I have replaced burned up motors with aftermarket back yard
DIY cooling "systems" that diminish effective cooling to the point of
short term death of the motor. In the worst case it was garden hose for
oil lines. Kid you not.
