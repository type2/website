I see no reason to go into the upper engine compartment. Most route
the hoses to the front of the engine under the floor. I don't like to
see that kind of distance. I saw one that cut out the left battery
tray and mounted the cooler there with a fan on the cooler to blow
upper cool air over the cooler into the hot air environment below.
