Subject: remote oil cooler

Can anyone help me with the proper way to route remote oil cooler hoses.
 Engine is a GE code 2.0L with existing standard oil cooler and remote.
 P.O. had remote cooler connected into straight adapters above oil filter.
 They then removed the left hot air pipe and routed the hoses through that
hole in the tin.  Engine is out so I can do what is needed.  Thanks for the
help.
