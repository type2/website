Subject: Fuel Shut Off Solenoid Valves

I found this supplier:

http://www.12voltfuelvalves.com/12-volt-fuel-shut-off-valves.html

Has anyone ever bought from them?  If you did, which valve did you buy?

Does anyone know what the tank outlet thread is on a 71 bus?

My goal is to have the solenoid valve threaded directly to the tank outlet.

Thanks, as always.....

Rusty
