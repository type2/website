Subject: Request for camper interior measurements. 

Hello Volks,

I have a request from somebody who has a 68-71 westy. I need some
measurements. I need to know the height of the bench seat ( floor to top of
seat cushion), the depth of the seat cushion when in bench configuration (from
back cushion to outside edge of the seat cushion). I also need the height
width and depth of the camp stool. I would also like the same dimensions of
the trash box stool found in later westys.

I am out of town on business but am working on a custom interior in my free
time and need those measurements. Thanks!
