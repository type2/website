The propane tank is exactly like your gas tank.. they put more in till it is 
"full" ... read the pump for the amount put in... done.
Thats all you need to know!

but... there is a difference... the propane tank has a "liquid level gauge" 
... which is a port that is 80 percent of full near the top of the tank...
that port has a bleeder screw.. so the fillerman opens the bleeder 
screw,vapour starts to escape..
 and opens the filler nozzle, and fills till the liquid spurts out the 
bleeder..
they shut off the filler, close the bleeder screw.. and read the pump to see 
how much liquid was sold ... you pay the bill,, and head to the campground.

hope that helps
Jamie
