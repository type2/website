	Even a decade of use makes it risky.  One young relative 
bought over the internet a 6-y-old Subaru in a town 300 mi away, and 
drove it home v satisfied; but ran a big-end suspiciously soon, and 
got only 'junker' value for the vehicle.
	After 4 decades of running, the chances of serious defects 
are far higher.  The question is whether the defects have been fixed. 
Unless you have some personal connection to the seller, such an old 
motor vehicle can be all too easily disguised as good value when in 
fact a major fault or two (or more) will make it expensive to bring 
to reliable working order.
	T2 List is one way to decrease such risks.  Most participants 
would not try on a swindle, or even claim expertise they don't really 
have.

	I hope it's not too pessimistic about human nature to advise 
generally against sight-unseen purchase of a vehicle claimed to be in 
good order and priced accordingly.  (A bus claimed only to be fit for 
major repairs, and priced accordingly, is a different proposition.)

	Good luck!
