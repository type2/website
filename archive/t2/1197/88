Subject: New AIRS List 

AIRS has had a great ten years run time.  The ones that started it, Dave
Raistrick, Ken Hooper and others did a good thing.  It was a great idea and as
I recall it was all because Steve Dolan was having troubles while traveling in
his bus and couldn't find any list members close to him.

At any rate...
