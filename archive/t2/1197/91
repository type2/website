Trey,

type2.com (especially the mailing list) is not currently affiliated with 
aircooledrescue.com.

You'll need to reach out to the owners of that website directly, instead 
of asking on this list.


For the rest of the community - we (the type2.com folks) are trying to 
work with aircooledrescue.com to figure out wtf is going on.  I won't say 
anything more for now.
