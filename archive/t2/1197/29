Subject: RE:looking for advice on a new camper

Another question to add - what is the situation with Automatics? I have
never had an automatic VW. Do these have a clutch? Are they more prone to
problems, harder to find parts/fix? Do you downshift in them when going up
hills? I don't know if I'd know how to drive a bus over hills with an auto
transmission ;)

 

I've seen a couple campers on thesamba that look great-but then I notice
they are automatics. Then again, I think my wife would prefer an automatic.
Any thoughts on pros/cons of an automatic transmission. Also how hard would
it be to convert it to standard transmission?
