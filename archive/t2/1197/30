Well, only maybe one of the five siblings was young enough to want a child car
seat at the time, not that they had those then.    they were not all infants!

Jan does not like to drive a stick, which is why my Dad got that Vanagon
westy.    automatic was not an option until about 1977 in buses.

if you want a full bed up there, get one already like that.   Guess you might
be looking for a later bay or a vanagon with a full bed upstairs and an
automatic?
