I can tell you what's going on.  People for the last 5+ years have wanted to
get their information change but it never happened.  Someone with web skills
made a new site, one that you can update immediately.  I for one tried to get
my information updated several times over the years and finally gave up.
Granted I should have put a disclaimer on my post saying it has nothing to do
with Type2.com, for that I apologize, I have nothing to do with the new site
except love it because it is in this era, not the 1990's, and it works well.

Trey,

type2.com (especially the mailing list) is not currently affiliated with
aircooledrescue.com.

You'll need to reach out to the owners of that website directly, instead of
asking on this list.

For the rest of the community - we (the type2.com folks) are trying to work
with aircooledrescue.com to figure out wtf is going on.  I won't say anything
more for now.

AIRS has had a great ten years run time.  The ones that started it, Dave
Raistrick, Ken Hooper and others did a good thing.  It was a great idea and as
I recall it was all because Steve Dolan was having troubles while traveling in
his bus and couldn't find any list members close to him.

At any rate...
