How about an industrial rubber supplier? We have one here in town that 
supplies pipe wraps and restaurant freezer insulation and so forth and 
they had all sorts of foams and rubbers.

If you're doing a winter refresh - you better hurry - winter is about 
over... GRIN! We're on to spring storms around here.
