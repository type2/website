"In the 1950s, the Volkswagen arrived in the U.S., where the initial
reception was tepid, due in part to the car's historic Nazi connection
as well as its small size and unusual rounded shape (which later led
to it being dubbed the "Beetle")"

From what I recall of Beetle history, it was Hitler's original design
criteria that the car be shaped like a beetle because he mistakenly
believed beetles are aerodynamic.
