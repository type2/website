Subject: Re: [T2] 1968 Door Handles

I'm not sure about the interchanging of the parts, but I am going through
some re-keying on my '69 singlecab. It is a pain if you want everything
keyed the same. Even if you don't know, you may at some point in the future.
So try to plan for that.

 

I like having just one key for my vw, so think before you act, or you could
get stuck like me. I have some new repro stuff, that cannot be keyed to
match some of my original stuff. If you get replacement stuff, try to get
stuff with the same profile as what your other locks and ignition are.

 

Just my suggestion..
