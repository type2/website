Subject: "clear burn"?

    Folks/Volks: The mechanic who worked recently on my '82 Westy used a term
I hadn't heard before, "clear burn."  He referred to oil slipping past the
rings and burning at high (but normal) rpms in an air-cooled VW engine but
producing no blue smoke or any other visible exhaust. I asked around among my
learned mechanical friends,  none of whom speaks vw, and they said they'd
never heard of such a thing either. I can rev this engine at top heat and get
no visible exhaust at all. (But, on a recent freeway trip from california to
washington state, I had to add a quart every 300 miles, so it's going
somewhere. Around town, maybe a quart every six weeks. Strange.) Any thoughts?
