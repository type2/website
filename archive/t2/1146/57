 thinking about writing practically the same post.  Why anyone wants to hide
 modern techniques, knowledge sources, and not learn is beyond me.

It's not about hiding, it's about knowing your target audience and
using good judgement.

If you are a substitute teacher, you don't present your 12th grade
lesson plan when you are called in to teach first grade.

We have novices coming in here for advice, and we have a
responsibility to the community to protect and preserve Volkswagens
belonging to all owners, regardless of skill level.

So if someone who is not mechanically experienced talks to a friend
who is, and said friend tells him he has a problem because his bus is
running lean, and said driver comes to the list to get help, and
someone tells him it's not a problem because running lean is cooler,
we have a problem.

If that bus which is having a problem because it is running lean is
running in the 13:1 to 14.7:1 death zone, and has maintenance
postponed because the list told him it is okay, we have just put him
at risk of a snapped valve, dropped valve seat, and a hole burned in
the head because someone told him lean is cooler.

It's about being responsible to the community, using good judgement,
and being aware of who you are talking to and what they are ready for.
