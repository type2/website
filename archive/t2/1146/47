Subject: 1968 Door Handles

In the finishing stages of putting my 1968 Kombi back together, part of the
driver's side door handle broke.  Looking at the diagram

	http://www.bus-boys.com/frontdoors79.html

It would be the equivalent part "H" on the 1968 version ("D").

I know 1968 is a "one year only" system, so what are my options?  Bus Depot
sells a pair of door handles listed in the 1968-71 section, but these handles
don't match up with the door hole correctly.

I see a handle for 1964 - 1968 at

I guess the mechanism inside the door might be different, but the handle
mechanism similar?  I think I understand the changes that make 1968 unique
(push button handle, interior lock mechanism in the top sill of the door).  My
question is can another handle be substituted (like the 64-68 handle mentioned
above) or am I left to scour the bone yards for another 1968 handle and
mechanics.  The stuff I've read is not all together clear.

The passenger door handle is missing the lock cylinder, so I don't mind
replacing the both units completely.

Thanks in advance.
