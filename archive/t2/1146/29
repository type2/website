Subject: Looking for an oil cooler seal

Hi all!  Nice to see all the activity on this list recently, for a newbie
lurker such as myself it is entertaining reading.

I have a '78 bus and am doing a winter-time engine refresh.  I have the engine
broken down about as far as I'm going to take it and am trying to find an oil
cooler seal.  Not the round plugs, those seem to be everywhere, but the rubber
rectangular seal that sits on the top under the tin.  Mine is chewed up pretty
good.  I've searched the normal online vendors that I use but can't seem to
find one.  Anyone have a source, or is there something I can use in it's place
at a FLAPS?  I'm probably just not searching for the right term but I'm sure
you guys can help.

Thanks!
