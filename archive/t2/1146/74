Subject: Early bay Front bumper bolt size for Cab Step to chassis

Hi

I've tried all the manuals and forums and can't find the answer to this simple question so I'm hoping an experienced Bus owner can help.

I'm refitting the front bumper on my 1970 Devon and notice there are two bolt holes in the cab steps on either side which the PO had not bothered to use. looks like it requires a slightly smaller bolt than the bumper iron to chassis. Maybe an M8? I need to drill and tap one of the holes due to a broken bolt and want to make sure I get the right size.

Can anybody tell me size and length of the four bolts I need? 

Kind regards

Rick
