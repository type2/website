I am very much enjoying learning about the interrelation of air/fuel
mix and timing, and also of extreme (past stoic) lean physics. I
understand that in the real world, with a typical VW engine, I must
run somewhat rich of 14.7:1 for good everyday street performance.

If I understand correctly, within reason, greater advance timing
requires a richer mix.  Since a typical vw engine is tuned rich, the
trick is likely to lean the mix slightly, then reduce the advance
slightly (at cruise) over and over until some measurement indicates
efficiency is no longer improving.
Am I correct that the measurement I am looking for is the some value
indicated by an exhaust gas analyzer?
