Thanks Jim.  When I took a closer look, mine wasn't actually that bad it had 
just come off the channel.  It reinstalled pretty easily and looks like it 
will do it's job.

But, out of curiosity I did contact Chris at Busted Bus, he does have them 
and quoted me a price of $19 if anyone else needs one soon.

Contact Chris from Busted Bus.  I got a few nice used ones from him a
couple of years ago for a couple of Type 4 engine projects.  They
haven't available new for about 18 years now.
