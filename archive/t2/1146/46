Subject: Re: '82 westy, gagging-fixes other than filter

Been there-
1. If rust silt, let the gas run freely after you disconnect it from the 
filter.  After "starvartion hesitation" on the way to a show, I did this 
into a pail and noticed the silt that came out.  Ran fine for years 
after that with periodic fuel filter changes.  Cut the filter around the 
middle with a bandsaw and you can see when you separate the halves to 
see what has been caught.
2. You can get larger tank contaminants like a peeling tank coating, or 
something that fell into the tank like silicone from a DPO filler seal 
hack, that can cause outlet tube blockage without ever getting to your 
fuel filter. It's unusual, since there is a 5-6" baffle around the 
outlet that prevents rolling around stuff from getting to the outlet. 
There was no strainer in our 78 tank. Dribbling gas would be a clue when 
you pull the line off the filter. A quick fix is to blow air up the line 
as I had to do on a trip- put a T in so I could add a tube to hold 
higher than the tank, then blow air into it to free up the outlet.  Got 
us home.
    You can check the tank through the sender hole; not sure of your 
year, but I had to drain the tank, cut the access port over the tank, 
remove the sender, and dropped in a light bulb that fit (appliance 
bulb?) and checked out the tank- the baffle box and outlet are visible. 
  Using a shopvac 25 ft from the bus, I attached a metal flex line 
(3/4"?) for a house gas appliance I got from Home Depot to the hose with 
duct tape and then custom bent it to clean the tank bottom of all the 
peeling treatment I found- Use earplugs as the flexline will scream like 
a banshee.  Have had no problems since, but I keep the T and extra tube 
with me just in case.
