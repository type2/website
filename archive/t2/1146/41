Subject: '82 westy, gagging

    My 82 Westy has been stalling in traffic and it appears it is
starving for fuel. It can go for a mile or two or more and then
stalls, gasping and choking.  An electrical problem has been
tentatively ruled out. Could a clogged fuel filter act like that?
The van can run for hours or days with no problem, then gasp to a
stop with no warning. Thanks any suggestions. Art McGinn
