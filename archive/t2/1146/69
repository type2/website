Unless you are a purist just disconnect the digital idle stabilizer and
connectthe wires together and unless you can find a used one, leave it that
way.There are hundreds (if not thousands) of air cooled Vanagons out there
withthem disconnected... and they have been for years.This is a known failure
item and it has been for lets say ..... 29 years!!!!  This wasand is the first
diagnostic disconnect for AC Vanagons that are experiencingno idle, or erratic
idle or intermittent stalling.  Larry ............... back at the barnWhen
would you like to travel to Haiti?
