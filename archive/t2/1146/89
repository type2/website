Subject: Fw: [T2] "clear burn"?

     Jamie: Man, do I know about those tiny oil spots all over the back of 
the
 bus -- in my case from a blown No. 3 piston, especially at freeway speed
 (three times, on my '68 bus, due to something overtorqued on a new 
rebuild).
 There is no oil anywhere on the back of the bus or on the engine, which 
runs
 very cool, too, although the underside of the engine is pretty damp in
 places but not enough to leave serious oil spots on the pavement. Only
 half-hearted ones. This thing runs too strong, believe it or not, to 
reflect
 those low numbers. But I, personally, am not, probably closer to 60psi and
 dropping.  Art
