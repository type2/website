Subject: '82 westy, gagging, contd.

    Larry: Many thanks for that info; somehow, the stabilizer on
 mine waited 28 years before delivering a swift kick in my pants.
 I'll now know what to do if it ever happens again.  It's good to be
 back on this list after a couple of decades away. FYI, I had a '68
 bus from about 1971 until about 1980 (about five blown pistons, no.
 3, usual cause) and an unusual bench-seat '82   Vanagon (with a
 retainer wall behind the front seats -- designed to protect against
 shifting cargo!) for several years after that (good engine but
 transaxle finally blew) and, for the past eight years, an '82
 Westy, which got a new top end about six years ago and has run
 great (despite a couple of worn cam lobes) ever since except for
 the aforementioned gremlin. Just can't seem to swear off these
 things. All best, Art
