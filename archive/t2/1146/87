   Greg:  No work on the rings when the heads/valves were done.  (It  
evidently was not needed at the time or, if it was needed, nothing  
was said to me, which would be unusual; the work was done at a  
Porsche-Mercedes-BMW fixit joint, independent, by the friend of a  
friend who spoke VW, and there is no present evidence of a valve  
problem.)  The valves are hydraulic and self-adjusting, although I  
suppose other things could go wrong with them. The mechanic blames  
the low numbers on worn cam lobes, citing the sequence of the  
cylinders that have them. I have found an VW guru who claims 71psi is  
the fatal number. Art

P.S. My wife and I camped for three months in Europe on an '87 hard- 
top Westy, perfect for rough weather. These are really rare  
stateside, and too bad.
