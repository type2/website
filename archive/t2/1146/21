Long before Hitler had anything to do with the Volkswagen, there
was an NSU prototype designed by Porsche that looked very much
like the VW Bug:

So Hitler had nothing to do with how the thing looked.

The roundish shape was partly due to aerodynamics (and aerodynamic
it was, compared to the other cars at the time!), but also due to
the plan to paint the body by dunking it into paint: the excess 
should run off everywhere without leaving ugly traces in the cured
paint.  (They never actually did that AFAICT, but I think they did 
apply the primer that way.)

The "Beetle" name was coined later.  In the 1930s, in Germany, the
car was only known as the Volkswagen, or VW (or by its official name,
the "KdF-Wagen", of course).  Even in the 50s, the name "Kdfer" was 
still not widely in use in Germany.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Ermel.
