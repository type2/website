Subject: Re: [T2] 1968 Door Handles

Hey Greg,

The door handles for '66-'68 are the same.

I gave BustedBus some extra '68 doors some time ago. I saw them
complete with the handles still on them on Friday, so send him a parts
request. I don't think they will be that expensive. I'll look around
my stash for an extra set for you as well.
