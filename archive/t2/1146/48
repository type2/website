I've had a similar problem on my 71 - also after a new seal install.  Haven't
ried to fix it yet, but did run across this while doing some research.

71 Westy.



When it gets cold (40-50') the sliding door is hard to open - that is the
rear latch doesn't pop out all the way. I have to grab it and pull on it
while grabbing the handle to open it. Anyone out there tackled a problem
like this? The door rolls great - very smooth. I lubed and lubed everything
and adjusting the cables inside the door doesn't do much.
