    Thanks all for your responses. A mechanic sez he believes the problem
has been caused by a defective digital idling monitor (not the official 
term, but
descriptive here). This small plastic-looking device is bolted next to the 
coil and regulates impulses
from the coil to the distributor but is supposed to function only
when the engine is at idling rpms, he says. But a defective one, he adds, 
can interfere with
impulses at operating rpms and cause misfiring or non-firing. His fingers 
are a little crossed here so we'll see.
If so, the problem was electrical after all. But based on your suggestions, 
we are replacing the fuel filter too -- it's likely the
original or close to it -- to hedge that bet and we'll see how it goes.
    All best, Art, Spokane
