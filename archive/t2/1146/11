Jerry,

Do you only have problems at idle or do you get problems or loss of power at 
other speeds?

Did you also check the operation of the idle solenoid when you re-tightened it?

Just curious as I recently had problems with my 34 PICT-3 cutting out at idle 
and at cruising speed.
After cooling down a bit my engine would start fine and sometimes it would idle 
until any sort of throttle was applied.

So your symptoms sound a little similar to mine.  My problem ended up being dirt 
in the carb (also suggested by another reader here).
Have you done any work lately to your carb, fuel lines, or fuel filters?  If so, 
then there is a chance that some crud got knocked loose.
