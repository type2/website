Hi Scott,

Not quite. John Connolly calls 13 to 14.7:1 the "death zone" that will
burn out any engine, even water-cooled.

Your VW was engineered to run in the 11-13:1 range. So when mechanics
say that your engine has been damaged by running lean, they are not
talking relative to the 14.7:1 stoichiometric ratio, but rather
relative to the factory engineered ratio.
