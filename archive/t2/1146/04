Thanks for the suggestions so far.  So the vacuum readings sound fine?
 Which of the two screws (large and small) do I pull out and clean on
a PICT 30/31?  (Bentley might tell me, but it's on a shelf at home.)
Sorry to be dense here, but I'm on limited Internet and can't research
things the way I would normally hope to do.  I can also report that
the solenoid (?) on the lower-left body of the carb was loose; I
re-tightened it, which seemed to have no effect.
Thanks,
Jerry
