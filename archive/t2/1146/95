Kevin: As I understand it, SeaFoam is some kind of oil-based detergent
which dissolves carbon deposits and other junk and gunk in an engine. It
seems to have properties similar to synthetic oil, which apparently does 
the
same. Two folks have suggested I try it on my '82 Westy engine, which has
some serious compression problems. Subsequent research suggests that 
SeaFoam
could, or would, lower compression by removing carbon that is actually
keeping compression higher than it would be otherwise, not a good thing in
my case. SeaFoam is evidently just one of several products that do the same
thing. Art
