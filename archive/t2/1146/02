You have to give yourself credit for your accomplishments. At one time
I was pretty competent at both air-cooled and water-cooled VW/Audi
fuel injection systems, but when I looked at Megasquirt, that was over
my head, yet you are conversant with it, and when you start talking
about programming it, it is over my head.

Lean running is the number one cause of destruction of air-cooled VW
engines, and when lay people come to the list for help, telling them
that running lean is cooler is dangerous when they don't know all the
ins and outs and caveats that that entails. Even at your advanced
level, you have problems with hot running, and I don't think you have
the issues of transitioning from rich cooling to lean cooling nailed
down yet.
