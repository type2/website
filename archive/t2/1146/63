Subject: AADCO new sway bar design - VOLUNTEER BUS NEEDED

I have been in touch with AADCO Suspension Company and they are interested in
possibly redesigning and manufacturing a sway bar package (possibly front and
rear) but need a volunteer loaf (68-79) to stop by the shop(s) in either NC,
or FL for measurements, mock-up, and test platform possibly for R&D.

Is there anyone out there that can assist... it will benefit us all if they
start producing these like the old Sway-A-Ways... Which were tucked up nicely
against our undercarriage WOW... we'll have a sweet ride again.

If interested in volunteering a loaf, or if you want to just let them know you
are interested in purchasing a package, or single bar. The person to contact
is:

Mr. John Wright
