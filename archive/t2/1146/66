     John:  Disconnecting it caused the engine to suddenly idle
better, creating an "Aha!" moment. The mechanic said you can actually
run without one of these but it's probably better to have one -- that
works.  A random engine shut-down was exactly what has been
happening, as if at least two or possibly three plugs were not firing
or barely firing. No smoke or backfiring, however, just sorta
convulsions with the engine gasping and shaking but too weak to even
pull over to the curb if in traffic. Art
