Subject: Ball joint replacement in MD

Hey,

I have trying to find some place in Maryland (Baltimore area) that can press
the ball joints out of the torsion arms and press new ones in.
Every place I have tried tells me they won't or can't do it.

Any ideas?  I really dont want to purchase new torsion arms with ball joints.
(particularly since I already have them).


Thanks,

Brian
