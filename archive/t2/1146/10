	This is indeed an important issue.  Frankly, my long-standing 
belief is along the lines of John's.  But now I have to review its 
factual basis.
	The aero-engine GAMI article was interesting but I fear it 
didn't settle the matter.
	May I propose a truce until I can extract some informed 
opinion from a friend who has recently been the leader of the SAE in 
Australasia?  He may take a fortnight, as he departs tonight for a 
big court case in Singapore  ...  tai hoa  ...
	Meanwhile, let me try to pour oil on troubled waters.  The 
term 'lean' has at least a couple meanings.  Just think what was its 
working defn before any exhaust-gas analysers existed   ...  I fear 
that much of this discussion (not to say wrangle) has been at cross 
purposes on account different defns were being used.
	Watch this space.

Peace
