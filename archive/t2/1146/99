Hi Chris,

 

Wow, just read that samba thread. I can't believe the guy flaked out like
that, I wonder if something happened to him?

 

I did get some confirmation of my belief that the majority of the sound
comes from the engine bay, and I need to isolate that area. I may try some
of his other products inside the engine bay.

 

Like I think I said in my post-I think the product works pretty well, my bus
is basically an empty shell(except for front seats) and driving around it
does not sound like it.
