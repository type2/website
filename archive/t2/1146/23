Couldn't have said it better.  Nice post.  I was walking to work this morning
thinking about writing practically the same post.  Why anyone wants to hide
modern techniques, knowledge sources, and not learn is beyond me.  They dont
have to read or implement the techniques.  Fortunately, we still have that
freedom of choice.  jon

"But more importantly, and why I had trouble with your initial comment -
some people may ignore the above, some people may learn something (as
many have expressed during these discussions).  But I would never say
that people shouldn't discuss topics that I feel are more advanced than
the "lay people".  I think that is their decision.  This is a great
place to both learn and share knowledge.  I think people on this list
are smart enough to ignore what they want to, and chime in when they
want more info.  Like I mentioned in a previous email, I've talked about
this stuff for years, and I've been on this list for a long while.  I
have yet to hear of someone destroying their engine because of what I
said.  In-fact, I've heard exactly the opposite.
