Subject: Sliding Door Woes

71 Westy.

 

When it gets cold (40-50') the sliding door is hard to open - that is the
rear latch doesn't pop out all the way. I have to grab it and pull on it
while grabbing the handle to open it. Anyone out there tackled a problem
like this? The door rolls great - very smooth. I lubed and lubed everything
and adjusting the cables inside the door doesn't do much. I'm wondering if
the spring on the latch assembly might be worn but these things look like
they would last 100 years. 

 

Ideas? Trying to develop a better game plan to tackle the problem.

 

I did install a new sliding door seal a couple of years ago and the problem
started a few months later (coincidence I think) , I have treated the seal
via Ratwell's suggestion and no change when it gets cold (Don't laugh I'm
here in South Texas).
