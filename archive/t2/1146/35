Jerry,

You can check the solenoid as below, but thinking about it some more (and 
re-reading the Type 2 library http://type2.com/library/fuel/cutting.htm), have 
you checked the intake tract for air leaks?
Too much air getting into the mix could also cause dropping out at idle.
This may be easier to check and would be helpful to rule out first.

Get your engine running at a constant RPM.  Not too high; just off idle if it 
will hold there.
Give a one-second shot of WD-40 at the top of the carb where it joins the air 
tube from your air filter.
Same for the sides of the carb body and where the bottom of the carb where it 
joins the intake manifold.

With each application of WD-40, listen for change in RPM.  If that happens then 
you have an air leak that needs to be addressed.

For the solenoid:

Yes, the solenoid is on the lower left of the carb body for the 34 PICT -3.
Did you have a 30 PICT-2 or -3? Not sure if it is in the same place for this 
carb.
It should be the little cylindrical item with a wire going one of the terminals 
on the coil.
You can sort-of check operation by listening to it click as follows:
	* Disconnect the lead from the solenoid to the coil
	* Turn ignition on
	* Reconnect and disconnect the lead you removed in the first step
	* You should hear a click from the solenoid when you connect and when you 
disconnect
I say "sort-of" as other folks have mentioned that the solenoid may still not be 
working correctly or might be jammed up with crud even though you hear a click.
Remove, inspect, clean, and replace.  I don't have any specs handy as per the 
inspection and replacement so maybe someone else has that info.

From here, my personal experience ends.  I've gotten a lot of help from this 
list and other lists.  My hope is that I've been somewhat helpful and not 
mis-informative.

Josh

Josh,

Problems only at idle.  At other speeds, the engine runs well, though
if there's no load, there is a tendency to surge.

If the idle solenoid is that part on the lower-left of the carb that
has an electrical connection, I'm not sure how to test it.  I assume
that if I pull the wire while the engine is idling, I should see some
effect, indicating it's working, right?  Also, is this the "idle
circuit" that I see mentioned in some emails, and if so, how is it
supposed to be "cleaned"?

Thanks,
Jerry
