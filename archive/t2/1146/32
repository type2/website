Josh,

Problems only at idle.  At other speeds, the engine runs well, though
if there's no load, there is a tendency to surge.

If the idle solenoid is that part on the lower-left of the carb that
has an electrical connection, I'm not sure how to test it.  I assume
that if I pull the wire while the engine is idling, I should see some
effect, indicating it's working, right?  Also, is this the "idle
circuit" that I see mentioned in some emails, and if so, how is it
supposed to be "cleaned"?

Thanks,
Jerry
