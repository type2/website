For the loud buses - be sure to look around the motor mounts. My '78 had 
two mounts over the bellhousing that were torn. This allowed the bracket 
to slide over a small distance and touch the chassis. Boy has that 
noisy! I didn't realise this until I drove a friend's '78 Riviera and 
found it to be very quiet by comparison. Like quiet like a modern car. 
Her Rivieria was stock insides except recovered seats and side panels in 
fabric.

Anyone think fabric would be quieter than vinyl?
