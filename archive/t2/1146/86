Hi Art,

Do you know if the rings were done when the heads were replaced?

The compression numbers you are quoting are not good. 90PSI is the 
cutoff point. The 95 on #1 might be considered marginal, but the 80 on 
#3 suggests that something has to give.

Given the oil consumption, I'd recommend a valve adjustment followed by 
a leakdown test to determine where the cylinder leakage is occurring. 
This will tell you if it's rings or a valve issue.

Happy Trails,
