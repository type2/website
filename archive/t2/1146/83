Subject: Re: [T2] "clear burn"?

Don't know the term.  
What I do know is that EVERY VW I have ever owned has "used" some oil,
and except for some cold start "blue" fog, none smoked excessively.  
Never mind the habitual small seepages around pushrod tubes and such, I
feel just 
about any VW engine will make oil disappear without much evidence. 
Higher speeds,
higher temps and higher loads all seem to magnify the mystical loss of
liquids.

Drive by a local small plane airport some time and just watch for awhile
when 
their engines are fired.  There will also be that telltale Air Cooled
loose assembly
fog on the first start of the day.  Thankfully our aircooleds are quick
to heat and expand,
so the smoke is usually brief.

Use the proper oil at proper viscosity to match ambient temp and load and
check it at every
gas stop and you will be OK.  I couldn't find it on a quick look, but I
do remember reading
that some oil consumption is to be expected and the factory stated 1 pint
per 1000 miles 
was considered acceptable (that's what I remember).

Bear in mind that the industry standard for automotive oil consumption
remains at 
1 Quart per 1000 miles is ACCEPTABLE!   And that isn't even taking into
account
the cooling system type.
