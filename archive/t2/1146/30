Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for an oil cooler seal

It's part # 021-119-329

On the second half of the Bus-boys page it's part Q, listed NLA.

When I needed one I got an okay looking one from my parts bus.  If you have
any VW yards around you might try calling them.  BustedBus is always an option
for this sort of stuff.  There are a couple of AZ shops I can point you
towards if you want, too.

Good luck!

Zack
