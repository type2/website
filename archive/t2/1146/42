Kerry - I had a Beetle doing this very thing b/c there was rust in the 
tank clogging up the fuel outlet on the tank. In my case there was a 
screen on the fuel outlet that had rusted almost away, allowed trash 
into the fuel line. Looked like water had settled to that part of the 
tank and caused the fuel screen to rust around the base. Anyhow the fuel 
outlet and fuel line were clogged up.

On a good day, no problems.

On a bad day, it would stall at random times, bucking and so forth. If i 
waited (before I knew the cause) it would fire back up and run for a 
little while.

I cleaned out the fuel line with a broken e-brake or clutch cable 
attached to a drill per John Muir (Idiot book). When i drained it, the 
first little bit was rusty. Got ALOT of trash out of the fuel line.

On a side note I recently went though the same thing with my water 
heater in the house. One day I'd have good water flow, on another flow 
would be reduced to almost nil on the hot water side. One evening the 
system coughed and spit out some rust and I knew then what was wrong. 
Replaced the 19 year old water heater and no problem since.

Good luck, let us know...
