Subject: Bus Storage (may be off topic)

Well, that majic time is upon me.

My oldest son will be 17 in July.

This means that in order to qualify for occasional driver status.I can only have 3 vehicles on the road.

We need to put my wife in a vehicle with good clearance and my son is getting the Jeep.

So how do people store thier westies for extended periods.

Battery out obviously.

Wheels off and jack stands?

I look forward to ideas.

Alan
