The ignition lock cylinder, steering lock and electrical switch on a
71 (actually 71-72) is entirely different from the 68-70 style, none
of the items are interchangeable.

However, if the entire pod with the above items is installed on the
steering column from a 71 or 72, this can be do-able, as the column is
basically the same.

The 71 switch then can be used by doing the following:
The Red wire is your main power in
The Red w/Black stripe wire goes to the Starter Solenoid
The Black wire goes back to the Fuse Box and to the Ignition Coil
All other wires are to be ignored - simply tape the ends and place
them out of the way.

The 73-Early 74 style pod is radically different to allow a Wiper
Switch Stalk Assembly, so that may not work.
