Hi Art,

I'm going to chime in late here and make three recommendations.

1. Get the Bosch factory L-Jetronic FI manuals and print htem off. They 
will help you understand the function of each component in your fuel 
injection system AND tell you the proper way to test them.

2. Does your vanagon have a tachometer? If yes, does it nosedive when 
the engine starts to misfire? If yes, then the problem is at the 
distributor or coil. Most likely the hall sensor on the distributor.

3. Getting inside the fuel tank with a borescope might be worth trying 
if you can get hold of one; then you can see whether there's a piece of 
debris blocking the outlet. If yes, you'll need to drop the tank and 
flush it. This is also a good opportunity to replace you fuel lines in 
case that hasn't already been done.

Happy Trails,
