Subject: Re: [T2] '82 westy, gagging

did 82 have an electronic ignition, or oxygen senor, if either it might be 
that.

I  had a bus 76 that acted like that, the fuel pump took a final crap 2 days 
later, didn't probably help that the fuel return line at the regulator was 
hooked up to the vacuum side.
another one 72 had a crappy electronic points replacement in it that would 
overheat and kill it, but it started up fine hour later.
