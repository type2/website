Well, there's blow-by, which is when air from the combustion chamber 
escapes around the pistons into the crankcase - and then if it's going 
the other way, it's just rings that probably aren't broken in properly. 
  If they weren't broken in properly, then you'll get cylinder glazing 
which means that there's a layer of oil that burned to the cylinder 
walls and isn't allowing the rings to make the seal that they're 
supposed to.

How old is this engine?
