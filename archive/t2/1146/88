hmm,, ZERO is the fatal number ! lol.   ...   If he was lucky to drive a bus
with 71 psi in all cyl..  he must have lived in a town that was DOWN HILL
all the way!

Unfortunatly for me.. I have to go uphill both ways,, and usually thru snow
as deep as the telephone poles!   <grin>

I personally can't drive a bus with less than 80  psi even ...

Art.. did you check to see if you have tiny oil spots all over the back of
the bus?
