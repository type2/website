I would give a hearty second to Gary's statement below. I know the largest 
noise component in my bus is the engine vibrations. It was build with 
balanced components and the compression is close on all the cylinders yet I 
have quite a large amplitude engine vibration that produces the low 
frequency noise in my bus.

 I also have heard a bit about even combustion between all the cylinders. 
Maybe fuel injection is a plus over standard carbs and intake manifolds.

The biggest improvement I've made in sound suppression is to totally
balance the engines I built. Statically and dynamically, cc the
heads, deck height,  the whole 9 yards. You can blip the throttle and
the engine just purrs. This is the place to start making a bus
quieter.  Gary Gibson
