Subject: Wandering Idle - solution

I must admit, I was really thinking this would turn out to be an intake leak...but turns out the little spring-loaded button in the top of the distributor cap was hanging loose causing the rough idle.  I pulled off the dizzy cap to look at the points and the button fell out.  I like it when it's something simple!
PEACE!
