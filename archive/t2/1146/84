   Mike: I've had the van about eight years and I am assuming the short 
block is the original. It got a new top end (heads, valves) about 10-12k 
ago. (The compression ratio, by the way: #1, 95psi, #2, 125, #3, 80, #4 140, 
indicating, mechanic sez, two worn cam lobes*. I read that these are in a 
low but can-live-with-it range, the low numbers.)  During that top-end work, 
no work was done on the rest of the engine, nor did I hear that any was 
needed. By my humble standards, the van runs quite smoothly and well, even 
strongly, with the sweet spot at 62 mph.  As I get older, this increasingly 
takes my breath away. Art

* This was checked with a cold engine which had been sitting unused for a 
week and turned-over with the starting engine, cranking maybe three seconds 
or fewer per cylinder. i read later this is not the way to get correct 
readings.
