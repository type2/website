Subject: Must be "Friday' somewhere!

Because I am so lucky to have a 'great volume' of 'knowledable icons:"  at
this site,and since it is prolly FRIDAY somewhere, and because I don't really
have a lot of the hairs left on my head to pull out, I Have an off topic
request, that in some measure, is VW related!  I also own, an '86 Toyota 22RE
4x4 pickup, and I can't seem to find a 'source' to purchase, for the  coolant
sender, to 'tell' the computer when the motor is warm, as well as the .."start
injector time switch sender", which 'tells' the CSI, to stop working!  My
engine is quite new (60,000Kms), all 'stats', are adjusted, but the tailpipe
is black, and gas mileage, on some trips, has gone as low as 6 MPG!  I
can'teem to find a site, to purchase 'these' sensors at,..and failing that,
can I 'basterdize' something, that will 'overide' those switches, so I can
finally 'appreciate' the economy of a 4 cylinder!  I am in Canada, yes I am
sorry for those 'nasty' ..storms 'we' sent to you!  I have tried Toyota
Nation, and all the local suppliers, and Dealer says..too Bad, those parts are
NLA!
Cheers
SYD
