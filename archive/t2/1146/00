Subject: Re: [T2] Carburation woes with 1600 DP

I've had similar problems on a Bus as well as on another "old" car.  
There was a loose wire which, when the engines were "vibrating" at  
"just the right speed" made good contact and when at (rough) idle  
would die.   On one it was the high tension lead from the coil to the  
distributor cap and on the Bus it was the low tension wire to (or  
from ??) the coil.  I hope your problem is as easy to fix as mine were.

My 34 PICT-3 also had some issues with the wire to the solenoid being  
loose but I don't think your carb has the solenoid.

Good luck,

..... engine has been running for long while and I come to a stop, the  
engine dies.  I can
then start it easily, but it won't idle.  I need to goose it a little
to keep the engine running.  After the engine has cooled, it starts
and idles fine.
