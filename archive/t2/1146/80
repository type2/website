Subject: Re: [T2] Ball joint replacement in MD

To all,
I know this might sound like I am timid, but I have worked for a few
well known VW specialty shops in the last 30+ years and NONE of them 
have done Type 2 ball joints for years.  I have learned to value my life
when it
comes to attempting some procedures.
The process is not much different than any other BJ replacement ....
with one serious difference.........
The original joints must have been put in with the largest press known to
man.
At the one shop that I worked at that used to do them, we used a 20 ton
shop press
while standing behind a piece of 3/4 plywood with a hole in it to put a
cheater bar on the 
jack handle.....
That was until the shop press came apart!!!!  Start calling around to
machine shops, you might find 
one that will attempt it.  Or order replacement arms with new BJ's
already installed.  
This is NOT a job I would tackle at home.
There used to be a tool called the "time bandit" for doing BJ's on VW
bugs,,,  we broke two of them attempting
BJ's on buses....
