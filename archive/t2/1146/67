    John or anybody:  A question arises whether a short in the wiring  
serving the Hall sensor, fixed earlier, could have fried this digital  
idle monitoring device?  A wire had been brushing against the body of  
the distributor -- the insulation had crumbled -- causing a very  
similar reaction by the engine. Finding this thing has been baffling  
to two mechanics. I'm hoping we've finally nailed it.  It ain't  
cheap, schooling some of these mechanics, of which there are few to  
hardly any in my area. Kinda like tryijg to find a guy who can work  
on a Sopwith Camel. Art
