Subject: RE: [T2] Ball joint replacement in MD

It is my understanding that replacement of the joint itself requires a special
jig to align it properly.  It is supposed to seat in one, and only one
location in its bore.
Bus Boys has the VW jig.  I believe there is a photo of the tool in the
Bentley as well.
