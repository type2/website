Also look around for old Mom and Pop pro- auto parts stores. They might 
have one on the shelf from 1984... It works for VW projects sometimes 
too. All the big players have used up their stock but the Mom and Pop 
stores might still have a few.

Check that auction site too. Junkyard hunt? What else that Toyota made 
uses the same sensors?
