I would worry that the temps wouldn't be accurate and then you're 
playing the same kinda guessing game when people screw their CHT onto a 
head bolt instead of under the plug.  The sensors are supposed to be in 
the exhaust flow about 4 inches from the vales, so that's my goal.

Honestly, the hardest part about all of this is getting myself to jack 
the thing up, lay on my back and crawl underneath :)  I'm so anal about 
drilling holes in just the right spot, putting grommets in the metal, 
routing the wires just right, etc, that I end up delaying it until I 
feel *really* motivated to do it.  I just called my welder friend and 
he's back in town, so I'm going to try and get on it as soon as I've got 
some free time from my new hobbies (hang gliding and helicopter license 
:) ).
