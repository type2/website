<<You were describing what I tried, but it seemed invariably to jam>>

Jam Where?
What type of blasting equipment are you using?

If it isn't a pressure fed gun, I can understand why it may jam--even
with fresh sand, or any media for that matter.
A Syphon feed just doesn't work as well.

<<I'm aware of deterioration in principle, but I thought that blasting
cabinets were inherently set up for continuous re-use of the media(?)>>

They are.

But they clog often and occasionally as they are syphon feed also.

Not uncommon.

I suppose it can all be attributed to the size, & type of nozzle, and
the air pressure your using.

Big HP compressor-- faster recovery, more continuous big air pressure.

And believe me they do suck up air fast.

The Craftsman, Home Depot, or Harbor Freight 1.5 horse compressor won't
cut it.
