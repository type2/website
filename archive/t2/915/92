<< I used children's sand box sand and the blaster was OK as long as the
sand was Sahara dry...Any moisture in the sand and it stopped...>>

BTW--sand box sand it pretty aggressive to be blasting away on sheet
metal--
Yea, the unit your talking abut really just sucks the sand---but Silica
sand would be a much better bottom line, as far as the finished product
goes.
And is Goby Dry. 

Any moisture in the compressor will put a stop to the blasting procedure
too.

It's best to use a pressurized sand blaster to get the job done in a
timely manner.
