Subject: Which accelerator cable to use??

I pulled a progressive Weber carburator from a '74 bus with a GE coded '78 -
'79 engine.

I noticed that the PO had 'attached' an extention to the cable in the '74 to
reach the Weber, as it sat right between the 'fresh air' intakes (fresh air
intakes when the engine was sitting an a '78 - '79, but now air/fuel
intakes!!)

I envision that if I attempt to install the carb + manifolds setup in my FI
'78 that I will need a similar adjustment in the length of my accelerator
cable.  Currently, my '78 cable stops at the throttle intake.

Can I replace the '78 accelerator cable with another acelerator cable, like
the '73 - '74??  Is that longer/long enough??

If not, are there any suggestions for adding a removable extention to the
end of my '78 accelerator cable for about 6".  The PO had permanently
'welded' another tail onto his accelerator cable.  Apparently after the
cable was sited in the engine compartment.

TIA
