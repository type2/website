Yes... That moment when you review not only all the
events of the previous moments but also everything you
have touched and thought about through the entire work
session. It is, of course, why we do it ourselves:
Much harder to figure those things out when it quits
after someone else did the work!  BTW - I find your
comments about adjusting the valves quite interesting.
When you say, "close enough..." it makes me think you
are checking clearance as with a feeler gauge.
Hydraulic lifters are adjusted to no clearance and
then a bit less. That is, on initial adjustment, no
clearance then  (and here is where there are many
different ideas) 1/2 turn more is what I used... Some
say 1.5 turns, some say leave it at zero clearance and
don't tighten anymore.
The valve lash adjusters for regular lifters are set
at a clearance that essentially "barely goes away"
when the engine is at operating temp. The hydraulic
lifters are designed to allow the valves to fully
close while maintaining zero clearance at all
temperatures. If you have one that is noisey you can
tighten it a quarter turn or a half turn. The valve
may not fully seat for a couple minutes, but it will
eventually.

If the noise is a seasonal thing and has become
annoying with the onset of cooler temps, change your
oil and try a slightly lower viscosity rating. I had
an engine that liked straight 50 and another that
liked 20/50 and one that I absolutely had to run 10/30
in for the cooler months. -BaH
