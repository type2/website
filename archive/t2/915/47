cutiing and splicing the wires are by far easier, but if you really want
to torture yourself there are two small protrusions or ears that hold
those things together, you need to slide two very thin "things" into
either side of the connector from the wire side until you push in those
ears then the connector will slide out of the plastic.

now I used the techinical term "Things" becaause I have found screwdrivers
will generally not work. in fact I use dental tools to open them when I
absolutely have too.  they are really designed to go together and not come
apart.  (haaving a freindly densit helps too)

good luck
Bob
