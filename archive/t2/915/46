Subject: Plastic Connectors

Hello All,
I have a 1979 FI bus.  I hope this isn't too much of an idiotic question 
(I've already spent half my lunch hour perusing the archives), but I gotta 
know:  Is there a way to open the small plastic rectangular electrical 
connectors you often see between two connecting wires (that is, the ones 
that hold and connect the metal spades at the ends of the two wires)?  I 
need to replace my cylinder head temperature sensor and last night went out 
to have a look at everything and found this connector where the sensor wire 
connects to (assumably) the wire leading to the FI harness.  The plastic 
connector seemed permanently closed and not meant to ever be opened.  Is 
there a way I can open that thing up?  I don't want to have to remove it and 
then splice the wires if possible.  Thanks for your help!
