Who says it was theirs? Does it say anywhere on the artwork? It could
just as easily be one of these:

I'm not denying it's a bus (the descriptive text I put on CP describes
it as "Bay Window VW Bus" afterall.)

BTW: They didn't get 'em all:

I'll take it down in the morning I guess, just to cover my butt.

There's no dilution of trademark involved, and since I'm not
manufacturing busses, no design infringement. It's just a vague
artistic representation of a bay window bus used with a social
commentary.

I'm allowed to sell my social commentary if I so desire. If that
wasn't the case, newspapers would cease to exist.
