Hey, Mark.  My dad was a cross tie and lumber inspector for the  L&N railroad.  He's been dead for many years but I grew up  around trains and still love them.  If you're ever in Chattanooga,  the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum is also a must see.  And you  can take train rides, even steam trains at times, to Crossville and  back.  And every day that they're open on they run between their  two properties here in the city.  Lots of neat trains.  I'm  going to have to check out yours in Roanoke.  Cheers...KR


Did the  Norfolk
and Western sue O. Winston Link for selling photographs of  their
locomotives?



hey george     I am a norfolk and western(now Southern)  baby  my father was 
chief civil engineer for 25 years.   The  N&W did get to use o'links pictures 
for adds. He was the only person other  than the CEO that could hold up a 
train from moving. They turned the old  passenger station in Roanoke Va into his 
museum . It is a must see if you are  ever in the Roanoke valley . back to 
working on buses  later  mark  dearing
