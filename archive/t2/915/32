Subject: Re: [T2]  VWoA Still screwing with people

I've got a father and son team in St. Paul that work on my Mercedes' when I
can't or don't want to fix something, haven't had a Bus in the shop in many
years. They are great. It's worth bringing them in just to see what's in
there, a '52 MB cabrio, Lotuses, a '28 Rolls Royce that belonged to JP Morgan
among others. All in an unmarked warehouse, you would never know there's
anything in there except for the occasional restored Mercedes they have for
sale outside from time to time.
I see more Lotuses there than on the road. Pity.

  My brother had similar troubles with his mid 90s Jetta -- the door handle
  and locks just as with yours.  I love the VW aftermarket guys!  Without
  them, we would have no A/C VWs.  FWIW, North Penn VW in Colmar, Pa. is
  OUTSTANDING.  They've done well by me with my Touareg woes.  And get this
--
  their Touareg tech actually installed a new harness in a customer's 1964
  Bug.  Those guys LOVE the old critters and it shows!

  Maybe this website will convince my wife to quit looking at new VW/Audi's.
  She
  still misses her unreliable '96 Jetta in spite of the horrible seats,
leaks,
  electrical gremlins, and fragile locks (both sides broke one time after
  grocery shopping, in the summer of course).

  I just hate the way VW dealers treat us air-cooled owners like pariahs. Can
  you imagine a Mercedes, BMW or Porsche dealer refusing to work on the "old
  ones"? Thankfully we have the Bus Depot, German Star, and Go Westy.

  It will be a cold day before VW sees me in one their water heads.

    So true.

    It's too bad when VW clearly has more important things to worry about:
