Follow this logic to its conclusion and you've just made art and
photography illegal!

If I made a copy of a VW bus and wanted to sell it, VW would have a
legitimate beef.

If I make a picture of a VW bus and put it up for sale, VW has no beef.

The problem is that freelance IP lawyers have the same scruples as
liability lawyers.  They make money on the number of targets they hit, so
they don't care if their targes are legitmate or not.  Since the targets
cannot fight back, all of the IP lawyers' fights end up as victories even
when they are on the wrong side of the law.

We have to talk a big-name artist like that Thomas Kinkaid guy into
putting a VW bus into the corner of one of his paintings. :)
