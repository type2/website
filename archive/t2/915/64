Please note that I'm not denying the possibility that I have no
defense. I'm just exploring possibilities and showing my thought
process...

As a photographer, I too am concerned with illegal use of my work.
Before I continue, let me quote from the US Copyright Office's website
at http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html:

"Section 107 contains a list of the various purposes for which the
reproduction of a particular work may be considered "fair," such as
criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and
research."

Yes, it does specify "for profit" as a factor, but not a factor that
automatically dismisses fair use. (Note this is in regards to
copyright, not trademark, but the same basic concepts apply.)

So let's do a comparison:

http://pics.bbzzdd.com/users/DurocShark/animal2002_001.jpg
I copyrighted, published and sold a photo I took of a gorilla standing
on a rock, hand to mouth, on the right side of the image against a
gray background.

Now, let's say an artist creates an image like this:
http://pics.bbzzdd.com/users/DurocShark/gorilla.gif

Should I be able to say that they cannot because the photo is similar
to mine? Maybe. It's close in a vague sort of way. But what if they
did this:
http://pics.bbzzdd.com/users/DurocShark/gorilla2.gif

Now it's become commentary on the plight of gorillas, with only vague
similarities to my photo. And the art was wholly created with my photo
only used as inspiration. Even if they say, "Yeah, we used Don's photo
as inspriation because we really respect his work."

So we have two separate possible defenses against my attempt to
supress their work:

1. Fair Use for commentary.
2. Created with my photo as inspiration.

And what if the creator of the second artwork sold shirts with that
image so he could feed his pet gorilla? Would that somehow make it
wrong or more wrong?

If I was using a photo of an actual bus in my CafePress stuff, or
using the VW logo, or even using it without the "Not Compensating"
text, I would bow my head and shut up. But I take issue with VW saying
my artwork that only vaguely resembles a VW Bus somehow infringes on
their rights to a design they haven't used in 30 years in this
country.
