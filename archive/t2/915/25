Silverman & Associates won a $14,000 settlement for me over the nearly
thirty warranty service appointments made due to quality defects in my
Touareg.

Seems to me they have a lot of nerve wasting money on lawyers -- either to
protect "IP" or defend pissed-off owners because they sell garbage at top
dollar.
