Subject: Sad bus sighting/fire in Sacramento

Sadly, I just had a bus sighting right outside where I work in Sacramento -
nice cream-colored maybe '77 or '78 Westy caught fire.  Completely torched,
front window melted and all.  Found the guy's mechanic inspecting the mess and
unfortunately he had just been working on it a few hours ago...

Definitely going home to make sure all my fuel lines are secured.  One of my
friends alerted me to the fire thinking it was my bus!
