You really do need a water extractor in your air line.

My blaster is Grainger 6ZA37 with a 4RA15 filter mounted
to the blaster inlet with a short length of brass pipe.
If you are adding such a drier/filter, you want it as far
away from your compressor as you can, not attached to the
compressor's output port.

IMHO, a good compressor with a mediocre blaster beats a
mediocre compressor with a good blaster.
