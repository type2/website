It is not designed to be opened. Just pull and one
side comes out... The sensor end comes out. If you can
reach in a bit and grab the shank of the connector
with needle-noseds you should be able to wiggle it a
bit and pull it straight out. The other replier was
referring to removing the connectors out of plastic
plugs - not the same situation. What you are doing is
designed to pull apart easily. -BaH
