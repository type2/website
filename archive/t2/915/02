Hi Don,
It would appear to me that they would not be able to enforce a cease and
desist order on an artist's rendition with no logos on it. I think you would
have a good case.  

I must say that I am no lawer, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn last night.
:-)

Sorry to hear they are harassing you. Good Luck and wishing you many miles
of smiles!

My cafepress sites got shut down, along with any other ones with an
image of a VW in it.

Here's one of the images I was using:

Totally created by me, no VW logo or anything. Complete B.S.
