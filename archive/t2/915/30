Subject: Re: [T2]  VWoA Still screwing with people

Maybe this website will convince my wife to quit looking at new VW/Audi's. She
still misses her unreliable '96 Jetta in spite of the horrible seats, leaks,
electrical gremlins, and fragile locks (both sides broke one time after
grocery shopping, in the summer of course).

I just hate the way VW dealers treat us air-cooled owners like pariahs. Can
you imagine a Mercedes, BMW or Porsche dealer refusing to work on the "old
ones"? Thankfully we have the Bus Depot, German Star, and Go Westy.

It will be a cold day before VW sees me in one their water heads.

Doug,

'76 Westy "Peapod"
'80 MB 300SD "Phoebe"
'96 MB E320 "Dixie"
'86 BMW K100RS


  So true.

  It's too bad when VW clearly has more important things to worry about:
