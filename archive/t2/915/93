<<Does anyone here have an effective, low labor trick for re-using their
blast media?>>

First Dan,you have to be blasting on a clean concrete floor.

Then you need a super sized funnel, and some fine window screen.

Shovel the silica sand back into the funnel with the screen in it, and
back into the blaster. 

You'll only get maybe 2 reloads from the used sand.
The cuttng edges of the sand will round off and be usless after the 2nd
re-load.

<< All the "this should work" ideas I've had are not clean enough.>>

Well it does work--in my 100 lbs. pressure blaster , as well as with my
hand held captive blaster, and my cabinet blaster Dan.

I forgot 20 years ago how the inexpensive, low dollar, sand sucking,
bucket system worked--because it sure didn't--not real good anyway.
I hate sand blasting and went and got the right tools for the right
job's, that would get it done quick ,and threw the garbage out---
