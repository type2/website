I'm assuming (sorry, Felix...;-) that Eastwood's is probably the same
as Sears' and H. F. ...Looks like a big aluminum pistol with a rubber
hose...?
If so, I've got one of the Sears models. I tried it with my 2hp com-
pressor and it "worked" just barely. I used children's sand box sand
and the blaster was OK as long as the sand was Sahara dry...Any
moisture in the sand and it stopped... YMMV, of course
