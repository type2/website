Subject: Correct radio for a 78?

Just had my Kenwood stolen out of Kermit last night.  Rat F($&%#$ Bastards.


Well anywho, I've decided to go stealth and insert a good old stock deck,
and stealth install a head unit elsewhere.  Is anybody familiar with what
make and model of radio was common for a 78?  The info from The Samba so far
indicates Sapphires may not have been used after 75.  Anyone have any better
info?


Cheers,

Duke
