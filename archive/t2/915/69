I recall Hanna Barbara going after a guy who made his
bus look like the "mystery machine" for infringement.

I think it depends on what you are doing, and are you
making money at it. 

The guy doing meals on wheels is simply using his bus
as a place to sell food out of. 

A guy with a Herbie bug could be chased by Disney, if
they chose to. But they actually seem to embrace
Herbies. Now, if that same guy was getting paid for
appearances, they would likely become upset. 

Don, as for your Gorilla analogy, I couldn't follow
the link. But. If the Gorilla has given consent for
you to take his picture without giving him royalies,
you are okay. But, if the Gorilla requested royalties,
than you would be responsible or getting him paid for
any subsequent usage of that image. If the image was
used without your permission, the Gorilla would be
able to sue the end user. However, if the end user
only used your pic as inspiration, and took thier own
pic, than that Gorilla wouldn't have a case. If the
end user used your pic, as it is, than you and the
Gorilla would have a case, regardless of whether or
not the end user was using it for "social commentary".
So, make sure the Gorilla signs a usage agreement.

BTW, sorry for the excessive quoting in earlier posts.
