I am surprised that no one has mentioned that one should not use silica
based sand as the very real danger of silicosis.

This disease is not something that you want, it is a pervasive, aggressive
particulate that infiltrates the lung tissue, and much like other
particulate diseases, is not shed.

see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicosis

Kindest Regards,

Mark
