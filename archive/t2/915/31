Subject: Buses By the Beach - Bus Boo is this weekend! 

Ya-Hooo!!! Bus Boo is this weekend in Grand Rapids, MI September 15th 16th
and 17th. It looks like we are going to have wonderful weather. It is going
to warm up and dry out. Current forecast for Friday through Sunday is sunny
80 degrees for the high and 53 degrees for the low. It doesn't get much
better than that. It looks like we are going to have another great turnout
of bus pilots from all over the countryside. I have received many emails
from first time campers so we are really excited to meet all the new folks.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. 

 

So grab your Halloween Costumes, Candy, and Site Decorations and come join
us for a fun filled weekend for the whole family. 

 

If you have not made your reservations yet, please call Tom at Grandrogue
Campground at 616-361-1053. 

 

Saturday night we are going to have a Chili Cook Off so if you are
interested in bringing your special recipe please reply to this message so
we can have a count of how many are bring Chili. We want to make sure we
have enough to feed everyone.

 

It is going to be a great time, with great friends, and great weather. Can't
wait to see everyone again.

 

Wishing you many miles of smiles!

Todd Olson
