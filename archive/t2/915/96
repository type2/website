You were describing what I tried, but it seemed
invariably to jam whether I was trying it with
Black Beauty or official blasting sand from 
the auto body supply shop.

I'm aware of deterioration in principle, but I 
thought that blasting cabinets were inherently
set up for continuous re-use of the media(?),
so I've been trying to re-use.

I don't do enough small things for a cabinet;
it's mostly de-rusting farm machinery and the
like though the most recent use was actually
prepping the bus wheel-well for a bit of
fiberglass...
