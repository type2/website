My VW mechanic mentor in Redding says that a T1 engine in a later bay
with higher gearing than the early bays will burn out an engine.


hmmm,, maybe he should have said... might have a tendancy to "burn" out that 
style engine ,, faster .. depending,,,

Lets say that T1 engine has a CHT gage , and the driver only drives 15km to 
and from work, in a mostly flat area.. and some weekends he ventures out to 
within 100km of his place to go to the beach,, etc.
that gear box will not burn out that engine..
but,, in another senario ,, you're mechanic mentor is quite right!
ymmv
lol.. like I said before,, the one fellow I know who has a T1 engine in a 
late bay for years,, and actually didn't have the correct tin for years...no 
tin or seal at all.. and no rear engine support,, for years,, finally put 
the seal between the body and the engine,, simply to stop people for 
chastizing him everytime they found out [gasp] that he had no engine seal on 
a T1 engine in a T4 body [/gasp]  lol
he puts lots of km on his bus.. but not like me.. he does it all week, and 
short weekend trips all year... I tend to drive 10hr days for a few days,, 
attend the event, and drive home a couple 10hr days.. with a fully 
overloaded late bay with the T4 2 liter engine tuned,, and a freeway flyer 
trans ratios. that keeps my engine on the edge of burning out all the time, 
the way I drive..  so I drive by my CHT

your right to point all the options out,, as there are soooo many 
permatations
