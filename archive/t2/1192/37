Subject: Re: [T2] Best External Oil Cooler Choice

doktortim said what I wanted to...
What evidence do you have that you are overheating??

 I feel there is no need for extra oil cooling,  but if you do it.. make 
sure the lines are short and larger. 12mm inside,, and the fittings flow and 
are about 12mm inside..

most I have seen use tiny lines, with restricted fittings and then the 
bearings starve for oil...
