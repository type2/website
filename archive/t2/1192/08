That's right. I forgot diesels are smog exempt. Thanks for sharing the
2 threads. TDI looks like an interesting conversion. Do you have an
estimate on the cost? I was also wondering if 2 half-size radiators

muffs. Doesn't seem like it would be too hard to find radiators that
would fit that form factor.
