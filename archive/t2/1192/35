Subject: Re: [T2] Best External Oil Cooler Choice

It's actually for the conversion I'm doing where I have installed a  
1.6 turbo diesel into my 1971 bay window.

Due to the somewhat marginal cooling provided by the radiator (due  
wholly to placement), I have installed a 96-plate mesa cooler that I  
had lying around.  This has made a difference with regards to cooling  
load, but I'm curious as to whether there are other, more efficient  
oil coolers that might work better as I am considering moving to a 1.9  
TD at some juncture.

As an aside, the Mesa was originally intended for my '67 bus, but was  
never installed due to the sufficient performance of the stock cooling  
system.  Well, except on really hot days when loaded down, and this  
could be remedied by reducing my speed to a juncture where I was in  
the ~3000-3400 rpm range.

Cheers,
    Tom
