You know Monty if it was me, I would choose the biiger 1915cc engine using the 94mm jugs. It requires the same machining as the 90.5's for a 1776 so the price is the same. Free CC's. I've built both for my HP bugs, and the 1915 wins hands down. With a good torque cam like a Engle 100 and dual Kads set up properly, you'd have a really strong powerplant. If my type4 blows in my 77 Westy I will def. be putting a type1 in there for simplicity, as that's where my strengths lie.
