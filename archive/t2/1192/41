Hi, Chris.

I'll get more pictures soon. I need to put a little time into it (which
I'll have plenty of come the First of January).

Things that are broken that I already have the parts for:

Driver's window regulator
Passenger sunroof cable
Felt sunroof gasket
Passenger valve cover gasket
Clutch cable (not broken, but I've had to adjust it twice recently)
Fuel gauge and/or sender

Soon:

Front door seals (I knew I should not have gotten the Brazilian ones)
Front windshield (pitted and two pebble stars, probably original)
Ball joints sometime (torn boots)
finish the interior
repair dent in right rear quarter panel and replace rear bumper (I plan on
doing that prior to sale). Body work is not something I do myself.

I think that's about it.

I haven't altered the suspension in any way, except to reposition the rear
torsion bars to specifications.

Here are the Mcodes:

92 119 491

508 560

D9D9NP D02 027 227 246

14 4 7454 UA 2313 61



Here's the translation:



****** 1st line ******

92 119 491 = chassis number

             9: model year 1979

             2: this is an extra number that was

                used to distinguish 1970ties and

                1960ties chassis numbers. The '2'

                would turn into a '3' as soon as

                1 million vehicles of this model

                had been produced. This never

                happened with the Transporter

                production.



             119491: the serial number.





****** 2nd line ******

508 = Mcode: Sliding window in side panel

             opposite the sliding door

560 = Mcode: Steel sliding roof





****** 3rd line ******

D9D9NP = paint- and interior code

         D9: paint colour lower half -

               'mexico beige LE1M'

         D9: paint colour upper half -

               'mexico beige LE1M'

         NP: door panels and seats -

               material: leatherette

               colour:   canyon brown



D02 = Mcode: this code stands for a groups of Mcodes

             Unfortunately I don't know exactly which

             M-codes. It has to do with things

             standard for the US market such as:

             - USA electrical system

             - USA seat belts

             - odometer in miles

             - exhaust emission control

             - padded dashboard

             - backup lamps

             - rear window defroster

             - ...

027 = Mcode: plate for emissions value and engine

             with catlyst for unleaded petrol

227 = Mcode: Detachable headrests for all seats

             in cabin

246 = Mcode: ??? unknown ???





****** 4th line ******

14 4 = this code is a date. This date is mostly

       a few days later than the actual

       production date.



       week 14, day 4 (=thursday), 1979



       5ht of April, 1979



7454 = code related to production planning



UA = destination code: USA, Los Angeles



2313 = 23: VW Kombi (delivery van with windows)

       1:  LHD, sliding door right

       3:  with M015 (3 seater middle bench seat

           in cargo compartment)



61 = 6: 2000cc Fuel Injection engine

     1: manual 4-speed gearbox


It originally had a headliner only over the front cab and sunroof. The rear
panels are all plain grey painted masonite.
