he next year, I decided to buy my first car, which of course was a bus.
I
saved up $1000 and bought the first bus I saw for sale. It was a rusted
74
burnt orange and white transporter. The engine was smothered in a layer
of oil
and dirt and the brakes didn't work so well. My dad wouldn't let me
drive it
home, so I had to follow him driving it in his car. That bus never
drove on
the road again.
