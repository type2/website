Subject: RE: Paleolist

I enjoy the list. I've been on here since around '99 when I bought my 1st bus
& the one I still have.  I've bought parts from people on here, received
valuable information, and have enjoyed reading the posts. I don't post much,
but sure hope the list stays around.

Somewhat off subject, but it would be great if we could get the airs list
updated/more user friendly. I've seen a vanagon list that has a smartphone app
& is similar to the airs list. I wish I knew how to create an app like
that...
