Heh.. that wire mesh is toast after 30 years.  I've taken two apart and 
the asbestos is much finer than the mesh, which was pretty much falling 
apart.

That said, you can open them up and change out the lining.  I was going 
to do it and bought some foil covered ceramic fabric from Heat Shield 
Products.  I never finished the project, but it looked like a good 
solution to refresh the heater boxes.  It is a project, though.
