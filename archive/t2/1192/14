Subject: water in air swaps

IIRC there are some pages of aussie water-in-air swaps using Jetta radiators,
one on each side, using the air intake ducts.  As David says, custom radiators
are more reasonable these days and can be had plenty thick.  I thought the
cowbus method, with high rad, was a good solution.  Gets the rad up out of
stones and debris, allows for a good sized rad-no need of custom made,  and
makes it easy to bleed. The rear hatch method doesn't turn me off personally. 
Could be disguised  with painted expanded metal, or even louvers, and made
kewel.  Certainly its a good low pressure area to exhaust hot, radiator-air
into.   One thing to remember is that the cooling air inlet and outlet only
need to be as big as the "hole area" in the radiator, not as big as the whole
radiator surface area.  A bit extra for fudge factor for sure, but lots more
is not going to help much. 

I know y'all have read this stuff before, but it really does apply to our rigs
too.
