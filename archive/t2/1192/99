Subject: VW Super beetle help

Good morning all. 

 

I removed the pedal cluster from the chassis over the weekend in order to
clean the floor pan in that corner and to make sure it was sound. While the
cluster is out of the vehicle, I thought I would take it apart and clean and
repaint it. I got most of the thing disassembled. When I was knocking out
the pin for the accelerator pedal, I broke the ear off the bracket. It looks
like pot metal. Can this be brazed? If not does anyone have a bracket for
brakes and clutch pedal clusters for a '74 super beetle? I have a bunch of
splitty and bay window parts that I am willing to trade, or I will buy it
outright.

 

Mid-America Motor Works lists one in their catalog, but it is out of stock.
I have looked all over the web for just this part, but mid-America was the
only one who even listed the part on line.

 

Also, is there a logging program I can use to keep track of repairs,
maintenance, etc? I see Kevin commenting on looking at his log book to see
the last time he preformed any work on his VWs.

 

Thanks for any suggestion the group has to offer.
