I've heard of folks wiggling it off without a puller, although I'd be
worried about potentially cracking the wheel. A puller is safest, and there
is a cool tutorial on thesamba to do so with large washers to leverage the
puller, leaving the wheel unmolested. Should you try without a puller, it
is probably a good idea to leave the nut on at the end of the shaft so no
one gets clocked on the noggin' while pulling... Mike
