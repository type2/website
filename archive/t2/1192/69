Subject: RE: [T2] Gas Heater & Sean Bartnik

Hi Dave,

Thanks for the heads up-for some reason I thought it was Sean. Not sure
why...

I have the metal duct that goes through the firewall. It is rectangular. The
rubbery adaptor that went between the heater and this rectangular tube, that
was situated in the engine compartment-basically disintegrated. I was going
to replace this with some dryer hose.

After it comes through the firewall-I have a curved piece of metal, similar
to what Caspar shows in his pic. I was just trying to figure out if the last
piece before the black hose is duct tape or a piece of formed metal. The
heater I have is actually a stewart warner, but based on this pic-it looks
like I could get something like what he has. I could search around here for
a sheet metal place that could fabricate something for me-or if it is a
pre-made piece-that might make life easier. 

I'll search the net for more pics of this connection...thanks for the tips.

That's not Sean, that's Caspar (de Lint) (see the title line..)

The metal bit in http://type2.com/rvanness/images/bn4outl2.jpg

is a factory piece.  there's a big rectangular hole in the bus, a piece of
metal on the inside and a piece of metal in the engine compartment (the
outlet of the BN4 irrc.  mine are 6 hours away so I can't look at'm).


Worst case it should be easy enough to fabricate...that pic shows plenty of
detail, or go hunt for pics of bn4's in and out of the bus and I'm sure 
you can find better ones.   Both of my bn4s (my original and my 12v) have 
that part. It's usually removed when the heater is removed... ;)
