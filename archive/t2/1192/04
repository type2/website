I've never sucessfully straightened any, T1, T4, inline VW 4, inline Audi 5,
Triumph 4 (ahh sad, beautiful rust free stock chromie but I can't get it not
to leak like the rusty one on my car), SBC, nothing myself.

I've improved
some from leaking like gushers to seeping, mosltly inlines where you can
flatten out overtightened bolt area, but never made one straight.  The good
ole thick OEM gaskets not the cheapo thin Felpro style T4 ones can go a long
way FWIW, but even then, bent is always a PITA.

over 25 years of putzing with type 4 engines and have never
"successfully" straightened out a bent or warpped valve cover..
