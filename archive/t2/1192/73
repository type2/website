I spent six years in the Navy roaming around in little cars (Beetles, 
Rabbits, CR-X, Mustang) only to discover about two years after my 
enlistment was up that the Type 2 Westfalia was the IDEAL vehicle for a 
sailor like me. A ride back and forth cross country to visit friends and 
family with pullovers to snooze when I needed to and room to carry stuff...

I had a few hints and peeks into life with a Type II but I didn't get it 
before I returned to civilian life. Guess I'm a slow learner.
