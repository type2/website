Wow, that wasn't a very polite response to a legitimate question - 
remember, he asked about an oil filter and he never said he was 
overheating - those were assumptions that you made.  And just because 
you made the assumption that he's running a stock engine doesn't warrant 
ill behavior because you decided you didn't want to respond to his 
actual question.

And to go a step further, the VW engine suffers from inherent 
dependability/reliability issues, not only due to age, but purely by 
design.  I can't say much about the type1 engine, but this is a known 
issue that plagues stock type4 engines, something Jake Raby has repeated 
ad-nauseum.
