Sorry,,, lol.. I have to laff..     sorry,, I am over that now!
it is a pain when you offer advice on assumed information... then the rest 
of the info is offered, so , as much as I feel for doktortim.. lol, I don't 
quite put it that way! altho it is a legitimate response in my opinion.. 
:-)

so,, i have looked into many conversions, I did a ford capri V6 in a 74 bay 
window sportsmobile in the early 80.s ... that engine wasn't built for the 
transmission ratio's ... the cam was built for ~2k rpm,, the trans was 
running the engine at 4500 rpm at speed...
I really didn't get any long distance driving on that camper , and someone 
else wanted more than i did ,, so I sold it without any real experience with 
it.

I have seen many conversions,, from wankel rotary [worked well!] to V8 
crazy,,, and lately , all the I 4 stuff..

Right now  I have a Toyota 22RE ready to put in a bus... but after talking 
to a fair number of folks with their conversions,,, I am content to stay 
with the aircooled for now.. the water cooled engines have their headaches 
tooooo...

we'll see in the near future if I get off my a55 and do it !  but I don't 
really need to see if it will work,, because I learned something years 
ago... people will tell you it works.. and won't come forward anymore when 
they finally learn they didn't really accomplish anything in the end... 
other than learning...
ymmv
