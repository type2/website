Yup.

If I wasn't as close as I am now to finishing (well, and if I wasn't as 
stubborn as I am), I would probably punt on the project.

I've learned a lot, mostly about diesel engines, love how the vehicle 
runs now (power wise, although I'll need new tires or gearing at some 
point) and am happy that I embarked on all of this, but I also don't 
feel the need to do any more conversion work.  I think this is largely a 
symptom of my larger feelings that I'd rather be driving my VWs than 
spending all my time working on them, but it is what it is.

Then again, talk to me 5 years after its finished and I may be a lot 
happier.  :-)

Cheers,
    Tom
