Subject: Re: [T2] Steering wheel

I've heard of folks wiggling it off without a puller....a good idea to
leave the nut on at the end of the shaft so no
one gets clocked on the noggin' while pulling. --Mike

I agree with Mike. However, if you have two people use a hammer as well. My
helper used a rubber mallet and whacked the center with the horn cap
removed. While whacking, I pulled on the wheel and it popped right to the
top of the nut. Then you remove the nut and wheel comes right off.

To get the horn cap off, use a very thin blade and insert it between the
metal ring and the black cap. Give a little twist and it should pop off.
