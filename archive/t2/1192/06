OK, maybe this is a Euro/ N. American thing.

Having previously owned a '76
bus with an 1800cc I will say that the Type IV engine gives more poke.
My
current ride and daily driver is a '79 fully loaded camper with a
from-the-factory 1600cc engine.
It is never a "pedal down" affair and cruising
on the motorway (Interstate) at 65mph is fine.  Although a hair over 60mph is
more comfortable.


VW may have started putting Type IV engines in buses in
1972, but, in Europe, the 1600cc remained the standard option until the end of
the T2 in '79.
The Type IV was available, but as an additional option.
A
version of the Type I 1600cc (engine code "CT") was even used in the
T3/T25/Vanagon for the air-cooled years (-'82) along side the Type IV 2.0L.
So there must be something to the 1600cc engine in a bus even though it has
been said that it was "not designed to push a bus around".

If you're driving
the bus a lot, you'll probably need rebuilds more frequently with a Type I
than a Type IV.
But even so, that should be over 100K miles on an engine
that's been looked after and driven within its limits.


Someone else replied
that you would get better fuel economy with a Type IV.
I will say that in my
experience, the heavier '79 with 1600cc/34pict3/SVDA gets better mileage than
the 1800/dual-carb did.

That all being said, I would stick with the stock
power plant unless you completely abhor the Type IV or the parts are hard to
come by.

Monty,

Sounds like a good find. Contact
Chris at BustedBus.com or Ken at
thebusco.com for a good used dash and all the
many, many, related parts you
will most likely need if it is completely
missing.

As for your motor choice:

You may want to consider keeping the
1700/1800cc (depending on the
manufacturing date). This is of course if it is
running it has many
advantages. The 1800cc type 4 engine is far more robust
and better tuned
for the weight and aerodynamics of your bus. Your '74 would
have come with
dual carburetors so there isn't any fuel injection to be
learned. A 1600cc
motor was not designed to push a bus around, that is why VW
invested an
enormous amount of money replacing it in 1972. Your mileage will
be better
with your 1800cc motor if it is tuned correctly. With a 1600cc
single
carburetor motor, you will be "pedal down" all the time, which can
consume
fuel at an alarming rate.
