Hey Keri,

 

I second that thing on the AIRS app or updating. But I don't really know a
thing about setting up something like that-wish I did, but then again it
would take time away from working on my bus J

 

I've been on this list (vintagebus style) since I think '98. It is
invaluable, and the fact that Troy got the archive search thing going again
is great. I asked so many questions, and read so many posts on subjects -
that I plan on getting to sooner or later, it is great to be able to search
through those old posts. For example-working on getting my 6V heater to work
on my now 12V bus. I remember posting questions on this, and was able to
find old responses from Matt Roberds (although I'm not sure if he is still
on the list). He is an electrical genius or something...and is great to
read. I could go on and on about other members great knowledge that has been
passed onto me through this list.

 

When I first got my '65 it was my first vehicle, and I knew nothing about
VW's or automobiles at all-except where to put the gas, and how to work the
pedals. This list has given me the courage to tackle things I know nothing
about-because I've got backup. I often brag about being a member of this
great list, where I can post a random VW question at 11 at night, and when I
get up in the morning I'll find answers. 

 

I have found that activity has dropped off considerably, so even when I know
that the answer may be in archives, or found on the samba-I like to post
here, kind of feel like I'm stirring the ashes.
