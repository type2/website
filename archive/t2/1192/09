Subject: removing wires from connector plugs

Hi guys,

 

Merry Christmas to all!

 

I had to stop work on the bus in order to replace the heater channels and
passenger side floor panel in my '74 super beetle. In order to do it
correctly I have tagged and pulled the gray part of the wiring harness out
of the fuse box. The problem I'm having is that I don't know how to pull the
wires out of the nylon plug in order to be able to pull the harness back
though the heater channel.

 

Any suggestions?
