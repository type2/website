That's not Sean, that's Caspar (de Lint) (see the title line..)

The metal bit in http://type2.com/rvanness/images/bn4outl2.jpg

is a factory piece.  there's a big rectangular hole in the bus, a piece of 
metal on the inside and a piece of metal in the engine compartment (the 
outlet of the BN4 irrc.  mine are 6 hours away so I can't look at'm).


Worst case it should be easy enough to fabricate...that pic shows plenty 
of detail, or go hunt for pics of bn4's in and out of the bus and I'm sure 
you can find better ones.   Both of my bn4s (my original and my 12v) have 
that part. It's usually removed when the heater is removed... ;)
