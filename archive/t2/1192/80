David,

In my experience, installing a gas heater would be overkill for your
geographic location . I have found a Type 4 engine in proper tune, properly
sealed and with good door and window seals makes more than adequate heat
above when the weather is 20 degrees F or higher.

Best thing to do is get your Bentley manual out and start collecting parts
to get your factory system installed nice and tight. Ratwell has a great
diagram on how the T4 heating systems work and where the key pieces are
located.

Online and Used parts dealers will have the rest of the parts you will need.

Used Parts Dealers of choice are:

www.bustedbus.com (Chris has a nice parts diagram up for ordering specific
pieces)
www.thebusco.com (Ken)

theSamba.com is helpful with parts from individual sellers.

Some Online Suppliers (in no particular order):

www.busdepot.com (use the code list1e for 5% discount)
www.airheadparts.com
www.aircooled.net
www.wolfsburgwest.com
www.westcoastmetric.com (which sells your missing long center heater tube
duct)
www.cip1.com

Hope this helps. Work slow and make sure you have all the parts. Anything
missing will compromise your heat delivery.
