Subject: Re: Squeaky front wheel

Thank you for the thorough primer on sounds emanating from the front end. I
am not sure if the sound repeats faster when I go faster. It is hard to
diagnose as it is not easily repeated. Sometimes the sound is there,
sometimes it is not. As I am driving the sound can appear and disappear.

Anyway, you have given me something to look into and I thank you for that.
I'll try to get KK jacked up tomorrow and the front-wheel off and apply
some lube. In past brake jobs on KK, my MG, my motorcycle, etc... I have
never used Silaramic just synglide. The Silaramic stuff sounds like a great
product.

Thanks for the assistance Jon, I'll let you know how it goes.

Max
