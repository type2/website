Subject: Re: [T2] Squeaky front wheel

Max,

I have a similar issue, but it comes at low speed and goes away when I
apply the brakes.  The rub is I have a 1968 so it is drum brakes all
around.  It appeared right after front brake and suspension work.  It also
goes away making left turns (the noise is from the right front).

I'm looking forward to hearing other potential causes.  I don't drive my
bus much so I've been ignoring it for about a year.  My trusted mechanic is
30 miles away so it takes effort to get the bus into the shop
