It would seem to be, but that doesn't turn out to be the case.   
Greenbus Pilot over on the TS Bay forum switched to an underfloor  
radiator from his original in-place-of-the-hatch unit after finding  
that the fans ran all the time and the temps were higher than he  
liked.   Most others I've talked/messaged with a radiator in that spot  
had similar findings.

Mine is under the floor, big single-core unit for a V8 Explorer with  
pusher fans on top tucked up as tightly as I could get it .. hangs  
maybe 1/4" lower than the lip of the frame rails.  It's fairly well  
sealed along the sides and rear but no fancy ducting, and temps stay  
right at 190-195F.  The fans cycle off & on in traffic but moving down  
the highway they never kick in.  But I'm "only" running an ABA/JH- 
hybrid VW inline engine with 105-ish HP.
