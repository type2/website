His solution based on equations was to louver the engine hatch. I never
tried it out but if the math holds true, it might be a really slick way
to
put a radiator there.

Quite a few years ago I saw a Baywindow with a Buick V6 in the engine
compartment but what was really neat was the radiator...It was mounted
to the outside of the engine hatch but what got me was the hose setup...
the guy had used some sort of heavy machinery hydraulic hose - covered
with stainless steel mesh about 1 1/2 inches in diameter...but what
amazed
me was the flexibility of the hose... even tho' the hose passed thru'
two holes
in the lid up near the hinges, you could open the lid and it and the
radiator
swung up...and then down again and the hoses didn't kink...
