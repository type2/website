If you can afford it, it's a good way to go. Otherwise you'll be scouring
economy wrecking yards, which don't have many buses anymore, but they are
sometimes to be found where wreckers don't know what they have, or are too
far gone to save. It also has the advantage of keeping your bus original,
but if you're cold, a good modern system is the way to go.
