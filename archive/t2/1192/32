Subject: Best External Oil Cooler Choice

Hey all,

I'm going to install a new external oil cooler and I was looking for
suggestions on what to install.

I've heard of VW folks using both the Mesa Coolers and the Setrab Coolers.

That said, I've also heard of the Mocal 19- and 25-row coolers, and
people also rate the oil coolers by Fluidyne pretty highly (it looks
like they offer a couple of different types:

Please share your experiences... :-)

Cheers,
   Tom
