Subject: Gas Heater & Sean Bartnik

Hey guys,

 

I have never contacted Sean directly, but read his posting a lot on the
type2 library.

 

I was trying to contact him regarding the heater install he illustrated
here- http://type2.com/rvanness/caspbn4.htm

 

If you go part of the way down the page into the "Drilling and Cutting"
section he shows some sort of adaptor to connect his gas heater to a black
accordion type duct and then to a hole in his cabinet. I was trying to
figure out how to make that adaptor-and I can't quite tell based on his
description if he fabricated this-or was able to get it from an Eberspacher
Dealer?

 

Anyone know what I'm talking about? Any help.

 

I'm working on my '65 and getting the gas heater working again.
