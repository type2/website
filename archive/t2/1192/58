HI Max,
           Put some of this on the back of the pads, on the contact points of
the anti-squeal springs behind the pads, and the caliper faces where the
pads/springs contact.  Don't get any on the disc or the front (friction
surface) of the pads.

Comes in little sachets too - enough for one brake job

High temp grease on the pins and clips.  Just a smear, not a glop.  I use
anti-seize grease.

The Ceramic stuff is supposed to be the current "good thing".  Use in both
applications; anti squeal and lube.
