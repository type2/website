Subject: 1974 BUS FIND Type 1 motor 

Thanks for all the good info.  I picked the bus up yesterday and it looks
awesome........ Im thinking of a tin-top conversion, with a 1776cc type1 style
engine..... or is that 
going to overheat?  I'm not even going to paint it. 
It still has the 
original paint.  I believe I'll just compound it and polish
it out.
