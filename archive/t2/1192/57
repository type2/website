Subject: Squeaky front wheel

Hello all,

Two weeks ago I had a trusted shop replace my front brake rotors and pads,
rear shoes and drums on KK, a '71 Westy. Pretty much a full brake job
except for new front calipers. The brake hoses are new within the past five
years. The brake fluid flush according to the shop was very clean.

I picked it up and went for a drive and noticed an ee--ee--ee squeak from
the front right wheel. This happened after driving 55mph for twenty minutes
or so. I brought it back to the shop they tried to reproduce the sound with
no luck for two days.

I was okay with that, I drove it all of this week around town, normally it
is my daily driver, and could not reproduce the sound. However, today, on a
long drive the sound reappeared. The sound immediately goes away if I step
on the brakes or come to a stop. It is also intermittent, sometimes it was
there and at other times it was not. The wheel itself does not seem to be
warmer than the other front whee either so I do not think it is a sticky
brake or caliper.

There is not much that I could find in the archives about squeaky wheels or
on other VW forum sites besides either a sticky brake, a collapsed hose or
a bad wheel bearing. Since the sound goes away when I step on the brake it
does not seem to me to be a brake issue.

Any ideas for diagnosis? It seems that sustained higher speed causes the
issue to appear, though not consistently.

I am grateful for any ideas,

Max
'71 Westy "KK-Louise"
