Several years ago I was able to pickup several turbo diesel engines and I
had the idea of putting one in my bay. It was a fairly interesting
exercise. Eventually I sold the engines without putting on in KK. However,
an engineer friend and I worked extensively on where to put a radiator.

His solution based on equations was to louver the engine hatch. I never
tried it out but if the math holds true, it might be a really slick way to
put a radiator there.

Best of luck and please keep us posted.
