Updated the number Jim. And for the record, we've attempted to spin up a
dev team to get AIRS v2 underway, but time is not always easy to find time
and the team we pulled together initially has not been able to work on it
much (including me.) We have a dev box sitting offline right now, along
with API's etc that are ready to be used. If the vanagon folks can run with
it, or we can get a dev team back together on our own, either is fine by
me. I agree that getting AIRS back in shape is a must. If anyone has
thoughts, you have my email address.

If anyone is inclined to update their info on the current AIRS page, send
it my way and I'll take care of it.

Peace,
Troy
