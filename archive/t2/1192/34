What evidence do you have that you are overheating??

The only experience I have with aftermarket oilcoolers on aircooled
VW/Porsche engines is replacing the burnt up engines that result from
fooling with the lubrication system as originally designed.

Clean the stock cooler and assemble the air flow flaps properly and you
will have no concerns about adequate oiling or cooling.
