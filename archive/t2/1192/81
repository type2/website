While I do think that the type 4 heater system can pump out some serious 
heat, it doesn't do well at altitude and it also is lined with asbestos 
soaked in oil.  The only way I'd like to continue using my heater system 
(which does get so hot that it'll burn your hands at the front vents), 
is if I redo my heater boxes lining with new insulation.  I don't know 
how many of you have opened those boxes before, but it's not pretty.
