As a young teen, I day dreamed about driving a spray painted, Grateful Dead
Bear covered, VW Bus with Denise Huxtable from the Cosby Show as my copilot
following the Dead across the country.

When I was in high school, I entered a contest to win a Bay Window Bus by the
local rock station Surf 107.5. A girl that I had a crush on saw the ad for the
contest so I was trying to win it for her. I didn't win, but seeing the green
painted Sun Drop Bus in person fueled my interest. It had a red velvet L
shaped couch in the back with a wall of 12" sub woofers in the back attached
to a killer sound system.

The next year, I decided to buy my first car, which of course was a bus. I
saved up $1000 and bought the first bus I saw for sale. It was a rusted 74
burnt orange and white transporter. The engine was smothered in a layer of oil
and dirt and the brakes didn't work so well. My dad wouldn't let me drive it
home, so I had to follow him driving it in his car. That bus never drove on
the road again. I did spend the next 3 years honing my mechanic and body
working skills on it. I did everything from replacing body panels to replacing
the engine. I finally had to sell it because I couldn't afford to finish It. I
did learn a lot though.

I used the $1000 I sold it for to buy the bus I have now. That was 10 years
ago now. It was my daily driver for a few years and I got to take a few really
cool road trips with her. Now I am doing a full resto of her. Hopefully I will
be done in a year or so. Any way, I will stop rambling now. Peace!
