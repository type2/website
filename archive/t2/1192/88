So many places any preservative might not potentially reach but salt 
might. Personally I don't know at this point if I'd think it was worth 
it to restore and then "use up" my bus i.e. risk rust.

I'll not worry about it getting wet or dirty - but salty I'll worry about.

All you have to do is read this "rustoration manual" I bought a while 
back. The guy is in the UK and reconstructed a 70s era bus for his book. 
The number of body panels, angles and supports that the guy had to 
reconstruct was impressive. Anything that bad off here would have gone 
to the crusher.
