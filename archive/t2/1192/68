Subject: Re: gas heater

As ive stated in earlier posts, im a bus virgin, so im trying to digest
this information.
my 77 bay has all the heat ductwork removed, along with heat control levers
( not sure why).
I obviously dont have a gas tank or the orginal plumbing for gas.
I have been considering a propex(?)
system since this looks to be the easy way to get useful heat.
Any thoughts?
