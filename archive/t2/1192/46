I've got a 48-plate Mesa-style (B&M) cooler on the ABA/JH (2.0 bottom)  
gasser in my '75.  Used a thermostatic Wahler sandwich adapter (95C  
IIRC) off a turbocharged Volvo and -8AN Aeroquip lines between the  
two, and tucked the cooler roughly above/beside the clutch cable  
wingnut.

No oil temp gauge so I've got no idea how effective the setup truly  
is, but it's never given me trouble either.  My radiator placement  
under the floor is less than ideal, but coolant temps (read at the  
outlet on the head) never get above 195F with the current  
configuration so it's at least "good enough". =)
