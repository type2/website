Tiny little tabs hold them in place. Use a teeny tiny screwdriver or a
scribe from the front to push them back. There is a little channel in the
plastic holder to provide for this release. After cleaning, bend the tab
back just proud and they will snap back into place.

This is essential for a proper cleaning of both the terminals and the
holder to prevent recurring coorosion. A very light crush on the females
will re-establish tight connection. If they break, it is just heat cycling
has taken out the temper. Just replace those as they potentially a poor
connection anyway.

Not just every FLAPS will have these German DIN standard terminals, but
many will or can get them if they want to.
