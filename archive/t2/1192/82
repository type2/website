Subject: Re: [T2] Re: gas heater

My customers and I start at 5280 feet and go up from there. The heaters
still do very well and are adequate through most conditions.

One key point I forgot to mention, heat means having a fully working
thermostat. Without one in cold weather, there will be very little heat
regardless if the rest of the ducting and seals are in place.

As for the worry of asbestos in the heater boxes, the only real solution is
to buy a set of Danish replacement units. I run the factory boxes since the
amount of asbestos is minimal and they are fairly stable being encapsulated
in a wire mesh. But I don't want to get into a conversation on the dangers
of asbestos. I know it is bad stuff.

I had a tutorial posted a while back on how to eliminate the asbestos
collets and sleeves from the flexible heater tubes but I let it lapse. I'll
repost it soon.
