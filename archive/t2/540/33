Subject: motor question...

Hi all ...
I'm picking up a beat 68 beetle ...mostly for the motor...and what ever other 
parts will come off without breaking ...anyway... the motor will not turn 
over but it's all there ...any secrets on getting the motor to turn over without 
takig it all apart ?...was it a good year for the beetle motor??? ...I'm 
paying only $50 for the whole car ...is it worth rebuilding the motor ?...the motor 
is still in the car and has been covered...
thanks !
Jim...
