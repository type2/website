Subject: interesting new oil research

Oilheads, 

From a pointer on the vintagvw list where they are getting ready to rehash
the famous more or less zinc than in deisel oil debate.

http://www.ibmwr.org/otech/oilreport.html

I am *not* advocating either or, just passing on the pointer so you can
read and make your own decisions.  Seems to be a well written article.

Cheers, dave
