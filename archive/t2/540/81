Subject: Re: [T2] oil drain plug POPED OUT!!!!!

Hello Guys   I once used a stick to plug the hole to get home without a drain 
plug. Just be careful not to use something that could push the bottom of the 
screen up and block the oil pick-up tube. Ask Everybus Chris about the cheap-o 
screen he put in his motor that blocked the pick-up  and cooked the rod 
bearings on a new motor in his 68 bus  later and have fun  Mark dearing
