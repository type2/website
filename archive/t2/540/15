Subject: electronic voltage regulator to replace mechanical one??

I'm having no end of grief with an intermittent drain, and have checked everything I can think of. My last shot is the VR itself. Since it's the old mechanical one, I"m wondering if it likes to stick once in awhile. Does anyone know of a Well's electronic one that will replace these old mechianical ones? Someone spoke of a Canadian Tire no. awhile ago that was the right Well's VR but not sure what application it ws for? I've got a 70 bug with generator.
Thanks,
courtney
