I have taken my bus to  two Vokswagen shops here in Bakersfield, because my 
high beams will not go on . Only the low beams work. Both shops said they could 
not figure it out. I replaced the relay , high beams still won`t go on. Can 
anybody recommend a good electrical VW repair shop. I am willing to travel 
North to Fresno or South to Los Angeles area.       Long Beach.

     Thank You
