Subject: oil drain plug POPED OUT!!!!!

I'm out for my first "drive about" after installing my new clutch when this
lady pulls up next to me at the stop light and says "hay something just blew
out and your spraying water all over the place"



So I pull in to the gas station (luckily the oil light was't even on, yet)
and "shut'er down", I get out walk to the back and find a HUGE pudel of oil
forming. All draining out of the drain plug. "whew" I think to my self  "at
least I didn't dump all the oil in the street so the motor should still be
ok"



So how can I fix this???
