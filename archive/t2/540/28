I picked up a pair of those at a swap meet several years back, and my local (at the time) VW APS *had* seen
them before, but didn't have much good news.  Apparently they were imported for awhile (6 months to a year, 
IIRC) back in the early or mid '80s, then vanished from the market.  He didn't remember much more about
them, or who had imported them.  

My accel pump diaphragm and needle & seat were in good shape, so I cut some new gaskets and used 'em 
for about a year, then picked up a decent pair of Solex PDSIT carbs.  I *think* I've still got 'em around
someplace, if you'd be interested I can dig around in my boxes and see if I can find them for you..
