Subject: I think I may have found my culprit - Was electronic VR to

OK, replaced the voltage regulator in the bug, but first I tested it's
charging voltages. I used a battery booster to start the car and let it run
at it's fast idle. It was probably 1300-1700 rpm, but didn't hook my tach up
 just a WAG at the sound. In any case, the battery without running the
engine was sitting at 10.5 volts which wouldn't start the engine. After
boosting it and running the engine at the above rpm's the voltage across the
terminals was at 18 + volts, which I figure is WAY too high for the VR to be
working right. I then turned off the car, and changed the VR out for a NOS
one I forgot I'd had on the shelf, (genuine USA made too). :-) After
reboosting the car to get it fired up again, the voltage at fast idle was
now down at 13.5 to start with and reached a high of 14 volts as measured by
my digital multimeter on the 20 volt scale. I'm thinking the original VR was
hooped, and this new one may fix my current drain. Anyone care to display
their technical knowledge and comment? :-)

Thanks,

Courtney
