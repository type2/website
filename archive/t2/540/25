The dissenting view: the fact that you ask the question suggests that 
you take pride in saving vehicles, maintaining and even upgrading them.

For the average American motorist, the choice would be obvious: buy the 
better vehicle and ditch the old one. But bus owners are, from the 
start, not average motorists.

Also, if you build you own engine, you know what parts, tolerances, and 
care goes into it. Even Doctor Tim's inspection doesn't involve opening 
the case and seeing what's inside.

If it's important for you to feel pride in your vehicle (and this isn't 
important to everyone), then you have to ask yourself the fundamental 
question: am I proud when I pay cash, or proud when I make with my own 
hands?
