Subject: front door panels - all the same ?

Hi

I am working on a 71 bus and also a  72 Westy  poptop

just wondering if all the door panels are the same 1968 till 1979.

if not where do they change ?

Do not really car if the "look" is not the same
more interested if the function is diffurent , like window crank holes, clips 
to mount them etc.

might need to make a pick-a-part run and hate to buy ones that I cannot use

thanks for your advise
