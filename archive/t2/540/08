Subject: regulator dead

The voltage regulator is dead--with only the cable to the battery connected,
it is grounding sufficient amps that trying to re-attach the battery negative
strap results in welding......

I have a generator, not an alternator.  Can I drive with the voltage regulator
removed, without damaging the generator?
