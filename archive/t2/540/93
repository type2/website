Trey,

Easier to just mark down the mileage.

But if you want to do it, attach an electric drill to the speedo drive, lock
it in the on position and let it spin for a good long while. Depending on
how many miles you need to add on to get back to zero, it might take an hour
or even longer, but it will work.
