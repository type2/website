Subject: parts for dual carbs

Does anyone have the balance pipe and a mixture distribution assembly for a
set of stock dual carbs for a 73 1700cc engine that they want to get rid of? I
would love to purchase these items from someone on the list since I am having
trouble getting in touch with companies on the web. Some of the used parts
places on the web have not gotten back to me yet.

Thanks,
Corbett
