i changed mine on my 76, i wish i didnt

it wasnt hard to do, i needed a fuel pump, a few clamps, a length of fuel line, the carb, manifold, seals, linkage (make sure you get the linkage that makes your adjustment screws face the rear of the bus) i think thats it....

the reason i switched was because my airflow meter was a 6th month only part, and it was $750.....if i had known better, i would of fixed it, or went with a solex dual setup....

the weber was a pain to get into tune, and i never seemed to get it just right...while my fi was working, it ran so nice

anyway, good luck
