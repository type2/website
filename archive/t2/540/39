Subject: RE: [T2] F.I. to Weber carb conversion on a 2litre

Vary simple to do... no mods that I know of.. you can buy a "carb conversion
kit" from several retailers... not shure how much...

I'm vary happy with mine... simple to work on ect....

Down side is I have to replace the fuel pump (availel (-at-) NAPA / FLAPS) every
3 years or so...

But other than that no major problems...

Good luck
