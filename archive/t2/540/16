*****I was talking to the snap on driver about gloves. He used to have to 
source
them from medical supply companies but now the demand is so high they are
easy to get.

I finally found a decent brand of nitrile gloves that fit snug and are
thick. The old mr clean nitrile I was buying at the store although a good
price was "one size fits none" and tore too often. Now I'm reusing the same
pair of gloves over and over.*****


Richard,

Have you ever tried the local NAPA. I usually find great ones there. They 
are caller "Thicksters" and they are. Reusable, too depending on the task at 
hand. They cost a little more up front but, compared to buying two boxes of 
regular nitrile gloves. I have been using them for about three years and 
have seen the price drop on them from $20 a box to about $14. They are sized 
and fit very well.

TravelOn,

Michael Knight

Mr. Brown have you been using my gloves again? That's what I thought...same 
single pair of thicksters for two years running now.
