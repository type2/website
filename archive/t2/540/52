Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone try Seafoam?

Hello Guys    Snake oil !!  Herr Dr T will probably chime in here  Seafoam is 
a little different from Marvel but does the same thing.  Marvel is probably 
better for the valve train, seafoam seems better for lifters also seafoam makes 
a good additive for auto trans. The way the formual Vee guys store their 
motors is to run in the marvel then take the rockers off so the clys are shut and 
no tension on the vale springs  later and have fun  Mark dearing  Salem Import
