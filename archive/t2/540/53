Hey guys , I just pulled a working set of  stock dual solex's off a 73 bus.
The carbs work great , the only reason we took them off was to put a single
weber setup on. I have almost everything minus a few balancing tubes, but
have the air cleaner,manifolds, linkage,carbs and a few othe thing so if you
want me to bring them to every bus let me know.We are leaving tonight so
email me before (-at-) thejanesfam(-at-)yahoo.com
