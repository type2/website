It's a solvent type spray and/or liquid that you allow to get sucked up 
into the motor (until it stalls!) and let sit in the hot cylinders.

After you let it sit awhile, you fire it back up and there is supposed 
to be a tremendous amount of sooty smoke that comes pouring out of the 
tail pipe-  and after awhile things are supposed to be right as rain.

Watcha 'tink?
