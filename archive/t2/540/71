Marvel Mistery Oil and Kroil both worked fine for me. I used MM on a '59
Opel engine that had not been turned over in 20 years. I allowed it to
soak for a couple of weeks and then started turning the engine with a
pry bar on the flywheel. Back and forth for a couple of degrees more
each time until I could turn it all the way. This car is now a daily
driver without even pulling the head (I have yet to see the cylinder
walls ...), but it runs strong and only one cylinder fouls the spark
plug a bit more than the others (possibly some damage to the oil ring
there).

I used Kroil in a similar procedure last year to free up a '60 Opel
engine that had not been turned over since '69. It is free now but it is
not running yet due to some other issues.

ANY oil you have diluted with a bit of mineral spirits to thin it. 

Took me several days but I freed my Corvair engine this way. Each day I
would 
try to rotate it a little eack way and after  acouple days, it broken
loose 
and after 1 more it would rotate. In it runs good these days.
