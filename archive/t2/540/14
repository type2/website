Hi James,

If I were in your shoes, I would seriously consider the "new" bus.  
Rust-free (or mostly rust-free) bodies are much more desirable than rusty 
ones.  Body work can be expensive, time-consuming, and difficult.  Given the 
choice, I'd rather replace the engine on a great body than deal with rust, 
holes, bondo, and welding on a Bus that runs like a top.

That said, I must echo the previous posts about inspection.  Make sure the 
shiny paint isn't covering lots of bondo, basket-case metal, and dangerous 
structural issues.  Make sure the "well-loved" Bus was well-loved at the 
mechanic, the dealership, or in the garage.  Shiny paint and a rust-free 
undercarriage won't make up for mechanical neglect and (worse) half-assed 
repairs.

I looked for a Bus for 6 months, searching all over the Southwest, and I 
finally found one about 2 hours away.  It runs great, the body is in great 
shape, and it was well cared-for.  They are out there, and they cost less if 
you don't have to bring them back from the dead.

Good Luck!

P.S. How much do you want for your current Bus?  Ha ha!
