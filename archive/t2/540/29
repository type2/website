Subject: What needs doing when #3 Exhaust Valve snaps in Two?

Q1- Does this usually mean it'll need a new head?, valve guide?, Cylinder?

How much rebuilding is needed?



Q2- On the other side is a broken head bolt that fell out when pulled 
upon. How terrible is this going to turn out to be?


btw- I have a loose leaf Bentley; remaining pages include most all the 
ENGINE section.
