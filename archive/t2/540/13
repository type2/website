I only buy oil that doesn't say "may contain peanuts". That way I know my
money is going to the right place: greedy arabs instead of weasels. :)

I was talking to the snap on driver about gloves. He used to have to source
them from medical supply companies but now the demand is so high they are
easy to get.

I finally found a decent brand of nitrile gloves that fit snug and are
thick. The old mr clean nitrile I was buying at the store although a good
price was "one size fits none" and tore too often. Now I'm reusing the same
pair of gloves over and over.
