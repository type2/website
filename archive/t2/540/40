Marvel Mystery Oil is prob a better choice for this although even some 
plain (fresh) oil squirted into each spark plug holes would be a good idea.

Of course you can turn it over manually with a wrench on the crank bolt, 
and then there is the 'leave it in gear and bump the car a little' 
trick, just to break the grasp of the rings on the sides of the cylinders.
