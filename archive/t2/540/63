Vincent,

Study the Bently diagram.  Makes sure that the wires from the relay go
where they are supposed to.

Get your VOM out.  If I remember correctly, the bright/dim switch
provides ground when you pull on it, to the relay.

Does yours *really* do this?

If the relay is a good one and has +12v to the other side of the coil,
then apply ground to the side where the switch goes should cause a relay
"click".

Does the relay *really* work in another bus????

Can't tell you too much about bad parts straight out of the box....





Cheers, dave
