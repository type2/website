ANY oil you have diluted with a bit of mineral spirits to thin it. 

Took me several days but I freed my Corvair engine this way. Each day I would 
try to rotate it a little eack way and after  acouple days, it broken loose 
and after 1 more it would rotate. In it runs good these days.

Heat is a good addition here...Easy to add on an air cooled motor. Once the
cylinders have some oil in them a paint removal heat gun to get them hot
helps the oil to penetrate the ring/cylinder sticking points...
I know of a Jag engine that was freed (and returned to use) by filling it
to the top of the valve covers with a mixture of kerosene and ATF and
letting it just sit for a week... ;-)
