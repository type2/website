Know that if the motor never sees dirty oil and is maintained
properly, you will never build up excess carbon to begin with.

Note taken Doktor. No excess carbon but carbon non the less. What's wrong 
with cleaning things out? Not directly related to what I was talking about 
but, I just used it to clean my injectors. Oil change and regular maint. 
have been performed by me routinely and mostly before due. At 88K miles and 
never touching the injectors or snake oils, I did. Worked for me YMMV. You 
are correct this is no solution to regular maintenance and clean oil. This 
is something that should be practiced by every owner/operator of any 
vehicle.
