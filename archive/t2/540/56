Subject: re: Bus Tow Bar?

Hi Martin,

Don't know if this will help you but I was in a shop near Baltimore a few
weeks ago and there was a VW tow bar for sale in the lobby. Here is their
info:

DURMS Glen Burnie Generator & Carburetor Co, Inc
phone 410-766-4767, 410-761-0056

'71 VW Type 2
'72 Saab 96




Afternoon all,

I was wondering if anyone in the Washington DC area might have a bus tow
bar I can borrow this/next weekend. I am going to pick up a non-running
bus in VA Beach, and my truck is broke. I'm concerned that my 97 Volvo
wagon might not be able to handle a bus on a tow dolly.  I am willing to
compensate you for your time and inconvience.

Let me know,

Thanks,

Martin Green
