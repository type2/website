Subject: Re: [T2] Shift rod coupling in situ

     I did this just the other day, and I found it too tight with the 
shifter still in.  I put the transmission in second, then pulled the shifter 
off which allowed me to disconnect the coupler from the trans and lightly 
tap the shift rod a bit more forward than the normal shift pattern would 
allow from underneath the bus.  This gave it an extra inch or so and made it 
fairly easy to pull the old coupler, put the new one on the shift rod, tap 
it back onto the trans, and put everything back together.

I hope that helps.
