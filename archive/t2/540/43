A solvent bath for the upper end and cylinder's--

Marvel does the same thing---

I fog my 502 Chevy marine engine every winter the same way as you
described--only with the MMO
Only I leave it sit in the engine until spring start up---

I also fog my Westies  the same way durring winter storage--this keeps
the rings from sticking,  the cylinder wall from rusting, and softens up
any carbon deposits---

Don't let anyone stand behind the tail pipe when you fire it back
up--:>)



 
It's a solvent type spray and/or liquid that you allow to get sucked up
into the motor (until it stalls!) and let sit in the hot cylinders. 
After you let it sit awhile, you fire it back up and there is supposed
to be a tremendous amount of sooty smoke that comes pouring out of the
tail pipe- and after awhile things are supposed to be right as rain. 
Watcha 'tink?
