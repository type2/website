Subject: Help identifying an old Weber carb

     I am having trouble identifying the carbs on my bus.  It's a dual Weber 
carb set-up.  They are small, similar to what is often called the 'baby 
Weber' on the VW scene, but not the same.  It is a single barrel carb.  
Specifically, I need the needle and seat for one of them.   The seat for the 
needle is threaded on the outside with a 10mm, 1.0 thread pitch, and the 
port through the seat is 2 mm.  They are also just plain getting old so I'd 
like to find full rebuild kits for them.  My local VW shop had not seen them 
before and could not help me.  I have a picture (not a great one) of the 
right side carb installed on the engine if you want me to send it to you.
     The only markings on the carbs themselves are "made in Brazil", the 
funny Weber W, and one plate per carb with the following info:

Left Carb:
W     228092
Lado Nireito
      B     81

Right Carb:
W     228093
Lado Esquerdo
     E     81

     Are these stock at all?  Please let me know if you have any info that 
might help me.  My girlfriend works at a machine shop and they are 'cleaning 
up' the old needle and seat for me so I can hopefully use the needle I have 
for now, but I'd like to see about getting rebuild kits for both carbs.

Thanks in advance,
