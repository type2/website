Subject: Re: [T2] Where do these wires connect??

Hey, Don, I finally figured out the wires.  It seems that my coil terminal 
15 [positive] has 5 male spades, and it is used for 1 & 2 wires to the fuel 
cut off switches, via the thermostats; 3 is from the ignition switch, 4 is 
for the automatic advance cutoff switch and 5 is for the backup lights.

The ignition switch wire is the black wire, in the black & white wire 
configuration [see link below].  And the white wire GOES TO THE TEST 
Terminal block!!

Now, on coil terminal 1 [negative] I have 3 male spade connectors.  1 goes 
to the condenser, 2 goes to my dash tach, and 3 [grey & green striped] GOES 
TO THE TEST Terminal block!!! [only two wires in link below]

It shows that right in the Bentley.

I was looking at Haines [sic] and I could not see it.  The white wire from 
15 went into a black blob, and the grey/green wire from 1 went into a black 
blob.

But Bentley had the lines ending in a circle with a number in it, and the 
note at the bottom of the page in Bentley said that wires ending in a number 
within a circle went to the TEST Terminal block!!  Sure enough, with my 
magnifying glass, I could see the numbers in the two circles, and just where 
they were connected in the TEST Terminal block.  remarkable.  And it made me 
pretty cocky to be able to finally understand something like that!!!

Someone could look at that TEST Terminal block and figure out where all the 
connection come from, and then it should be pretty easy to create a testing 
computer hookup.

You know, I am really kind of thick.  I just now realized that there can 
ONLY be ONE INPUT wire to the coil, and all the other ones have to be power 
OUTPUT wires ! ! !
