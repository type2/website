Subject: engine failed to run

Hi-ho List:

I've got a bit of a problem with my bus (79, 2 liter, FI).

Last Sunday I drove it apx 40 miles to my brother-in-law's house, to
pick up some items he had asked me to help him move. Just before I
arrived the engine began to stutter. It had been a while since I
changed the fuel filter, so when I got to his house, I changed it.
Then I drove around the block, and it ran fine.

We loaded all of his things into my bus. I drove about five or six
miles, then the stuttering resumed. I pulled into a gas station and
filled up, but when I tried to restart the car, it would run for only
a few seconds and then stall.

I had the bus (and all of my brother-in-law's stuff) towed back to my
home. Couldn't look at it again until today. But when I turned it over
today, it started right up and, of course, it now runs as if there was
never a problem.

All vacuum hoses seem to be in their proper position. The fuel pump
runs when I activate it with the air flow meter. The coil produces a
spark when the engine turns over (although the spark is on the
yellowish side).

I've still got all of my brother-in-law's stuff.
