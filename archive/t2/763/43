my problem,  I have no "Stock" heating system, long ago removed. so there
is no tin under the engine (yes the piece between the cyl above the push
rod tubes is there) so there is no place to put a thermostat.  yes I have
flaps in position. and I do run synthetic for better cold lubing (78 2L)

  would love to put a thermostat back in but with it sticking out in the
slipstream under the bus I doubt it would work very well.  In fact I have
my thermostat and linkage in the garage, just haven't figured out how to
put it on.  and NO I am not going to reinstall the heat exchangers etc.
with about 8 years and over 100,000 miles like this I guess any damage is
already done ;8*(-at-)

  but in very cold weather the bus never really gets the engine hot.
maybe oil temp of 190F or so...
