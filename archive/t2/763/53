IMHO, the ground<green> should be attached to the vehicle chassis,, the
neutral<white> should not be,, and neither should the hot wire.<black>

Some people ground the chassis, and the neutral as done in a residence.... and
this is not correct, really won't harm anything,, but might circumvent a GFCi at
a power post, depending on how the ground fault occurs

hello?   HELLO?
damn,, he must have touched the wrong 2 wires..................
