History
"A Scottish-born sea captain, Robert Fergusson, noticed that when raw fish 
oil spilled on rusty metal decks, corrosion stopped spreading "

Current day formulations are deodorised and contain rust inhibitors. I used 
a primer made by the same company as made the fish oil so it went over the 
fish oil no problems.
