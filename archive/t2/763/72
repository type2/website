Subject: It just wont run

Anyone with any engine mechanical experience wanna come over this
weekend?

I replaced all the fuel lines from the filler neck to the injectors
and now she wont run.  I took out the ECU, and the injectors, as well
as the firewall.  It all went back into place (some with a little
coaxing) with out too much trouble.   But now, the bus just wont run.

I just purchased a vacume tester and a battery charger last night so
that I can continue with the diagnostics, but even with that, im not
very good with engines.

suggestions and/or voulenteers are welcome.

Thansk again,
David.
