Subject: Re: [T2] wiring a trailer to the bus!!!!?? 

hey... I get your stress. take a breath. have a glass of ice water.
turn on some jazz or something (maybe JGB circa 1978?). Let's see what
Greg posted:
White - Ground
Brown - Running lights
Yellow - Left Turn Signal & Brakes
Green - Right Turn signal & Brakes

you have 2 filament lights with one wire per filament, one red and one
black... and the light housing is the ground.
So, I would connect it this way:
Harness - Trailer
White   - Wire that connects to the trailer body (metal, not paint).
Brown   - Black wire on both lights.
Yellow  - Red wire on LHS.
Green   - Red wire on RHS.

Once the lights are mounted onto the trailer, they should work. If the
lights are not mounted, the circuit is open, and they won't light up. I
hope that helped, and wasn't just wasting your time. I really hope you
get the lights hooked up ok.

Good Luck,
