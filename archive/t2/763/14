Subject: 82 Westy alternator light, noisy lifter

Hello,
 
When I first start my 82 Westy in the morning two things occur.  First  the 
alternator light does not go out until I rev the engine just once after  about 
20 seconds of running. It then remains out until I stop the engine and  
restart it.  This always occurs at start up during the day.  Just one  little punch 
on the gas pedal and out it goes. Is there a fix on  this? 
 
2nd issue at start up is a very very noisy hydraulic lifter.  After  about 10 
seconds when the oil has reached the lifter it quiets down and remains  quiet 
for the day.  Every so often, as this morning after camping over the  
weekend, the lifter remained noisy for about 30 seconds.  Besides replacing  the 
lifter should I
1. Run  a quart of ATF in the engine for 5 minutes before changing the  oil.  
(Castrol Syntec  20-50)
 
2. Add Lucas Oil Stabilizer (synthetic)
 
3. Use Marvel Mystery Oil upper lube in gasoline
 
4. Fahgeddaboutit
 
Chuck
