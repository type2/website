Subject: Re: [T2] Pulling Side Windows

Mark,

I just did this to a '79 I had to leave behind in California.

From inside the bus, push on a corner near the frame with even pressure from
the palm of your hand, have a friend outside to pull once enough of the
seal/frame is there to pull safely.

They will pop right out.  My seals were well worth saving.
