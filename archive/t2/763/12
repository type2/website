Subject: endplay

in idiots guide, it says to adjust end play on crankshaft
to .004".  Then you put in the paper gasket, and torque
the flywheel on....

the paper gasket is .009".  This puts .005" tension
on crank.

Right now I have .009 endplay.  is it vital to reduce
this play to .004 before installing paper gasket/spacer
and torquing?

thanks,

Jen
