Wasn't the lead additive (home and industrial paint products) for easy 
application, i.e. brushes on smoother.

For the last 40 years an Alkyd Enamel (petroleum based) top coat was the 
most popular with OEM's

Wear a respirator and your ok, Beware of paint striper, there is no approved 
respirator for this horrible stuff. In-line max air flow and a body suite. 
That stuff burns the skin on contact. Ouch.
