Subject: cooling flaps

I read lots of discussion about cooling flaps.  I have not seen
definite information.  I am
reassembling a vw engine, and I need to know where to place the spring
that keeps tension on the flaps.  I do not have a thermostat and I am
not planning on getting one.  I live in San Francisco and there is no
reason to have it...

Which way does the spring pull the lever that attaches to the flaps?
I read that this is a "fail safe" system, and if the thermostat is
broken (or missing), the flaps get pulled to the "safe" position...

any help appreciated.

Jen
