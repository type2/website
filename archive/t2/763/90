Subject: Re: [T2] fan housing

The biggest problem is the heat exchangers they wont allow the fan to come 
out far enough past the studs with out bending the heck out of them (hack 
job).

I have never done this. I pull the engine. Seems like a lot of work but hey 
the bus probably needs it, being 32 years old. Trans, and engine main, 
clutch can all be looked at as well.

Don't forget the oil cooler bracket that mounts to the fan housing. Inspect 
the crank pulley hub these are a big cause of major engine problems. The 
crank can get scarfed and constantly throw hubs, remedy... new crank Ouch. 
Oh and good time to replace that cracked dried out dipstick boot (cheap 
part).
