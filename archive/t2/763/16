Subject: Rear-alignment recommendations for SE Pennsylvania

Anyone have experience in a competent shop to do rear-wheel alignments in 
southeastern or central Pennsylvania?  My rear camber is extreme and my 
highly-recommended local shop just decided he couldn't do the job after 
promising otherwise.  Help!
