>Sure!  I'd love to come!  Where?

Im in La Plata MD 20646 (for mapquest purposes).


>1. Do you have fuel?

I replaced all the lines and the fuel filter as well, and i dont see
fuel in the filter?  Its very possible that their is not enough fuel
in the tank.  I'll put 5 gals in via gas can tmw.

>2. Do you have air?

I rarely use rags, only my shirt because I've lost them, left them
and they've caught fire.

I just got a vacume guage and a remote starter so that I can check
the vacuum.  I'll do that tmw as well.

>3. Do you have compression?

I dont have a guage for that, ill go to sears and get one.  its safe
to say yes however, because it was running perfect before i started
this a week ago.
