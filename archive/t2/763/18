Subject: Painting / Cleaning the Undercarriage

Hey guys,

  
     Well... I'm considering scraping away and repainting the entire underside
of my 73 VW Bus. My Bus has lived it's entire life in South Florida since
well before I was born. I wasn't even a thought in 1973. So, although all
of it's external rust has been repaired.. the rust that it DID have was the
type of rust you'd expect in a tropical climate like that. Rust in the 
sills, thinks like that. I don't have any of the typical salt-belt rust 
in the wheel wells or anything (they're actually perfect).

But, I'm trying to get some sort of an idea of what I can expect from this
job. Typically, in the undercarriage, what areas are the most rust prone?
Which areas need special attention?

The reason I ask is because the entire underbody has some sort of rubberized
undercoating, but everything seems to be covered in this brown dirt.. so I'm
not sure what's rust, and what's just dirty...

I really have no idea where to start. I have plenty of power tools and an 
air compressor. What do you guys recommend that I do? Has anyone done this
entire job and have a good process for doing it? Do I just go from front
to back or something?


Thanks for any advice...




Thanks!!!

Todd,
1973 VW Type-2 Transporter
