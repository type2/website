Removing oil cooler =

No, do not remove the oil filler tube.  You will regret.

You are probably hanging up at the bottom, where the two heater boxes are 
coming together with the fan shroud.

I wound up taking the muffler off (i don't know if that is necessary0 and 
loosening the heat exchangers from the afterburner 'U' pipes, and dropping 
the heat exchangers down a bit

To get the necessary movement on the cooling tin on the left side,so I could 
get at the oil cooler, I wound up removing the two real tough to get at 
cooling tin screws on the riser tube from the left side front (FIF) driver 
side (USA), sort of on the outside of the engine compartment, next to the 
transmission.

Please do not just torque the three oil cooler nuts when you are finished.  
YOU HAVE TO BE SURE THE THREE NUTS ARE FULLY SEATED before you can torque 
them.  You should work those three nuts on their studs while the oil cooler 
is on the floor of your garage.  Make sure you can turn them al the ways in 
with the tips of your fingers.

And be sure the oil seals are on correctly and have not slipped.

The oil seals I got off my '76 were like petrified!!  No wonder they 
leaked!!!

And I vote to keep the alternator attached.
