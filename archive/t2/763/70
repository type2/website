Subject: Pulling Side Windows

I have a van with a rust free body that I want to get ready for selling. 
I want to get some things out of it first, some of those being the sliding
windows.

My question is, how do I pull the sliding windows out?  Should I just use
a sharp utility knife and cut the seals?  Or do people use rope/twine
soaked in soap to pull the seals out like they get installed that way?

Any help woould be most appreciated.

Mark
