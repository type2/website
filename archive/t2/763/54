Alright!  I didn't want to mention this.. but I have a "survivor" '57 Beetle,,
that has many many miles on it ,, year round in Ontario,  Canada, where we
pickle the roads pretty well..

The PO coated it with "Fish Oil" ...

I have had it for 10+ years and basically just stored it... the "Fish Oil" has
started to peel as it is drying out ... and under neath it is shinny black floor
paint,, like it was fresh from the factory!

What is "Fish Oil"  ?   How can you paint over it....?
