I'm in the process of doing this very job. The process I am using is to 
wash off dirt, remove any rust back to bare metal (the underside is 
generally in good condition), coat with fish oil, rust proof primer and 
finally bituminous paint (for sound deadening). The only problem is that I 
am doing it all by hand and it is taking for ever! I have been doing it in 
sections whenever the weather is warm enough and I'm not even half way 
there after several weekends at it.
