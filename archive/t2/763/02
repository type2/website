Subject: Re: [T2] Speedometer Read Error

From: "Jon Stiles" :

 The speedometer reads 10mph too fast at pretty much any speed but reads 0 at rest.

 I have checked everything and it looks fine. My tire size is 185 75 R14
standard size.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, 185 75 R14 is NOT the standard size. It is smaller. Standard would be 195/75R14 or 185R14 with NO aspect 
number, which makes it a 82.

If you go here: http://www.miata.net/garage/tirecalc.html and put in your size on the left and the 195/75 on 
the right, you will be a little off but not 10 mph. You will read slow but be going faster.

"Speedometer reading with non-stock tire is 2.4% too slow. When your
speedo reads 60, you are actually travelling 61.4 mph."

To be showing 10 to much, you have a problem with the speedo head.
Either the magnets are weak, the spring broke, or the needle moved on the shaft. You can check the needle by 
removing the speedo and gently lifting the needle over the zero [10] pin. The needle should point to the white 
line down by the VDO on the bottom edge. On a clock, the mark is at 31 minutes.  The mark is where you preload 
the spring.
