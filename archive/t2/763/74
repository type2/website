Subject: Re: [T2] It just wont run

Same thing happened to me when I replaced the fuel lines on my '79 CAL
engine.

Karl discovered with his multimeter a disconnected ground to the ECU located
underneath the intake manifold which killed power to something.  I had
inadvertantly bumped it off while working.

I mention the '79 CAL specifically because I seem to remember Karl mentioning
that this ground is located somewhere else on other engines or something like
that.

Check all your engine grounds, and other silly disconnections, ECU? Battery?
Distributor?
