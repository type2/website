I used a bottle of valve medic and never had trouble again. Available

 2nd issue at start up is a very very noisy hydraulic lifter.  After  about
10
 seconds when the oil has reached the lifter it quiets down and remains
quiet
 for the day.  Every so often, as this morning after camping over the
 weekend, the lifter remained noisy for about 30 seconds.
