Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing Steering Gear Box

First off I removed the ground cable on the battery and unlocked the
steering with the ignition key.I lubed the nuts and bolts with PB
Breaker.

I left the steering column connections inside the cab (2 nut and bolts
and the blind bolt under the dash) fitted while I loosened the the
brass bolt that pinches the couping assembly to the gear box. It
seemed easier to loosen or remove the underside nuts and bolts while
the steering box was supported.

When I removed the nuts and bolts and the floor mount escutcheon that
mounts the steering column inside the cabin I pulled up on the
steering column. The coupling broke free from the input of the gear
box.

I replaced the rubber coupling (from Bus Depot) from underneath and
the loosely fitted the new gear box into place with 1 (of 4) lower
mounting bolt. I had a friend (wife) move the steering column around
inside the cab while I slipped it on the input shaft of the gear box
and loosely fitted the other three steering gear box mounting bolts to
the frame.

The coupling assembly (rubber coupling, lower pinch bracket and upper
connection to the steering column) didn't slip all the way down onto
the input shaft of the box. It looks a bit cocked, needs massaging and
maybe a little spray on white grease. The coupling assembly doersn't
appear to be seated deeply enough onto the input of the gear box. The
coupling sits a little high on the input shaft and isn't located below
the big round hole in the floor.

The new box is in place and the coupling replaced (the old one was dry
and cracked (OE VW). Bolts aren't tight yet and that should make it
easier to make the final adjustments. Tomorrow I'll work on making
adjustment to correctly fit the steering column to the new box,
putting on the Pitman arm (drop arm in Bentley?) and fitting it to the
drag link. Then an attemptat centering the steering wheel.

Then it got dark and the skeeters came out.

Richard, Do I detect some gentle sarcasm here? Of course I removed the
arm from the drag link. I guess I took Bentley a bit too literal and
eventually figured that I didn't need to remove the drag link at. both
ends

I bent the big washer straight and the big nut (I had to use a pipe
wrench cuz I didn't have a big enought metric tool) came off easy
enough. It wasn't on as tight as I thought. I suppose the force of the
big nut will press it into the splined output shaft of the steering
box enough to secure it onto the shaft.
