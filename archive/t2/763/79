Sure!  I'd love to come!  Where?  Are you buying the airline ticket or am
I?  Seiously, if you are within an hour or so of Washington, DC, then,
yes, I can come.  If you are in Fourecks (aka Australia), probably not.

OK. Basic diagnosis:

1. Do you have fuel?

Pull an injector off the intake manifold, point it at a cup and crank for
a while.  If there is no fuel in the cup, let me know.

2. Do you have air?

Breath in, breath out.  Remove the air tube from the throttle body and
check for a rag.  take the air tube off the air filter housing and check
for a rag.  Open the air filter housing and look hard at the filter....
replace the filter.  Reassemble.  Check all the connections and all the
vacuum lines.  Hook a vacuum gauge to the engine.  Even while cranking you
should draw > 5" of vacuum.  Running it should be 15" or better but

3. Do you have compression?

Remove all the spark plugs and test the compression in each cylinder.
Minimum is 90psi with 10% difference between high and low.

4. Do you have spark?

Hook up a dwell/tach and make sure that it registers.  Nothing quite as
embarasing as having a wire off the coil.  Check for spark at the plugs
with a screwdriver up the wire end and close to ground.  Rotate the engine
to TDC and check the static timing.  Should be at ~7.5BTDC.


If you do all these things then the engine will start.  If not, then it
won't.

OOK!
