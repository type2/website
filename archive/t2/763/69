Subject: Installing a sliding sunroof

Hello All, I am installing a sunroof in my 1971 ex-Westfalia. Can anyone
tell me if there is some sort of pad or weatherstrip between the
aluminum slider rails and the body? Does anyone have or know of a source
for new or good used cables or the front slider (the part that screws to
the bottom of the sunroof) ? Many Mahalos, Timo
