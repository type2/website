Things to check:

- fan belt tightness (should have ~ 1/4-1/2" of play)
- battery connections
	-- clean battery cable ends and terminals
	-- clean where ground strap attaches to frame
	-- make sure all connections are tight

- battery water level
	-- if your battery is servicable, pop the tops and 
	--  check to see if you can see the water level.
	--  Top off with DISTILLED water as appropriate.

- starter wires: check to make sure all wires are connected to the 
    starter and tightly screwed on


Hope this helps.
