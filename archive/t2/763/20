Ned,

I used these folks last year for two of my VW's...bus and another car.

http://www.i-van.org/

email or call and see if they have an appraiser in your area.

Cost is not especially cheap, but I thought very reasonable.

The person that comes out may not know VW's well, but they will research 
it thru their network and let you know.

Cheers, dave
