 The MC  I removed didn't 
 have this!  So, did someone drill the hole there
 then decide to bring the 
 part back to my local FLAPS so I could buy it and
 get this far?  What would 
 be the reason to drill a hole there, and what will
 it affect?

That is the drain hole for when the end seal leaks. It
is supposed to not let the brake fluid go into the booster.
