Subject: fan housing

I am trying to take the fan housing of my 73 van.  I suspect the oil
cooler or seals are leaking.  The Bentley manual seems a little sparse
on information.  I should be able to remove the for bolts and it slides
out with the alternator attached.  I checked the archives and applied a
little common sense.  It is loose but just won't slide completely off
the studs.  I removed the alternator adjustment arm from the heat
exchanger.  From what the archives say I should also remove the oil fill
tube.

Do you have to drain the oil to remove the oil fill tube?
Do I have to remove the heat exchangers as well?

The manual also suggest separating the housing.  Does this make it
easier and is it worth wrestling with the bolts?

Thanks for any advice!

Daniel
