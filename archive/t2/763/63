Subject: Manassas Bug Out & Window Seals

Hi.

Someone posted that they were going to the Labor Day [past] Manassas Bug Out 
and they had some Bay Window window seals for sale.

I have now determined that I should replace my window seals, and if you did 
not sell them last May, please contact me off line.

Thank you

Barry
