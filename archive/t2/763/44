For me there is a very practical reason to have working flaps in a type 1
engine.  Without flaps the electric choke goes off long before the engine
is warmed resulting in an awkward period of low power and stalling until
the engine finally does get hot. 

With flaps the engine warms quickly, in about the same amount of time it
takes for the choke to go off.

Cheers,

John
