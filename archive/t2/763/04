Hi Chris,

Trailer light systems use 4 wires for two dual-filament (1157) bulbs. 
If the light housing you're using has dual filament bulbs in it then 
the red wire is for the brake/turn (Bright) circuit and the black 
wire is for the running lights (dim). Ground is the metal body of the 
bracket.

The standard 4-wire trailer harness uses these color codes:

White - Ground
Brown - Running lights
Yellow - Left Turn Signal & Brakes
Green - Right Turn signal & Brakes

The problem with wiring this harness into a bus is that the bus's 
amber turn signals add another two filaments to the equation, so that:

White - Ground
Brown - Running lights
Yellow - Left Turn
Green - Right Turn
Red - Brakes

To accomodate the bus wiring into a standard harness you need a 
wiring adapter that converts the 5-wire output from the bus to a 4- 
wire input to the trailer:

I used one of these with the Westrailer for three years but last 
summer I added extra lights installed behind the amber portion of the 
lens. These lights are each wired into a separate harness that is 
connected to the bus along with the standard 4-wire harness.

Sticking to the standard configuration may make things complicated at 
first, but if you work according to the system then it makes 
troubleshooting a lot easier later.
