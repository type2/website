Hello,

I had a similar problem with my bus when I installed
my fuel injection. What my problem was I did not
connect the signal wire to the coil. It should be
connected to the side that the distributor condensor
is connected to. If this is not connected, your
injectors will not fire. Also make sure that you
didn't knock off any vacuum lines or distributor
wires. Good Luck!
