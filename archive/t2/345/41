Subject: Re: [T2] M Plate

This is the location where the m plate should be BUT to read it is another
thing, since the place is dark and almost with out space unless you take the
dash panel out (not recommended) I suggest to you to find a piece of carbon
paper (the one used so many years ago to makes more than one copy on a type
writer machine) place it upside down over the m plate, then place a piece of
paper over an rubbed with something flat to get a print of the m plate ( you
can also use a credit card Boucher to do the trick).
