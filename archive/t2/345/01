Hi Phil,

    Ok, I'll step up! Just kidding, It depends on the type of top ring
material your working with, as to the hone pattern. A "Cross" pattern works
for "Cast Iron", and "Chrome" rings! If you are using a "Chrome Moly" (check
spelling on moly) ring you need a "Straight" hone pattern.
    Now the "S..t" can fly.
