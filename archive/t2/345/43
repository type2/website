Subject: window rubber reconditioning

I was wondering if anyone on the list knows of any
kind of chemical that can be used to recondition the
rubber around the windows on my westy. My original '78
windshield is leaking at the bottom and getting the
carpets all wet when it rains.
The reason I ask, is that when I was working on
computers, we used a chemical to recondition the
rubber on the printer feed rollers, and I thought
there might be something out there for auto rubber!
Any help would be great.
Thanks,
