Excellent, Will, thanks!

I was able to ID my carb as either a Weber 32/36 DFEV or a 32/36 DFAV from
the diagrams.  Went out to the bus and confirmed it when I found "Weber"
stamped on the carb pump cover.  I'd like to find the carb number, but don't
know where to look on the carb.

Any suggestions as to where the number might be found on the carb, and could
someone tell me what "DFEV" and "DFAV" mean?  Thanks!
