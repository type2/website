Subject: RE: Remove my head

I've said it once, I've said it twice, now I've said
it thrice. Yes the heads can be removed without
pulling the engine, I personaly don't reccomend it
because it's too hard to get everything apart and back
together as it should be, I've had to repair engines
that people have tried to do this too, pinched tin
between the head and cyl, severly bent tin, causing
overheating,(not enough room to do a proper job) the
list goes on but go on and try it. I'll pull the
engine every time, let us know how it was for you.
