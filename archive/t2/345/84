I disagree, but he is the one responsible, so do as he says. The first
thing I do upon receipt of a reman motor is install the dizzy, then grab
the pully and turn it by hand through 7200. If I can't do that, I won't
waste my time installing it.

If this is just a problem with a slick or loose fan belt, then do as he
says and resolve that. If the belt does not slip and you can't turn the
motor with a big wrench on the alternator nut, then I concur with the above
statement.

You should follow the advise of your builder, and if it fails, make him eat
it if you can. I'm so glad I NEVER have these issues with my rebuilder. You
might want to have someone with experience verify the problem before you
scream bloody murder.
