Mine was under the dash on the air tube like described.  I used a bit of
modeling clay to take an impression of the plate, then "translated" the
reversed impression by writing down the markings on a piece of paper.

Then I had a bright idea, and went to my shop and poured resin
over the clay impression of the plate.  Voila!  A resin copy of the
M plate from Giacomo. :O)

If I did this right, his M Plate reads thusly:
