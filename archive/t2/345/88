Subject: New Half-shafts go Clickity Clack!

What am I doing wrong I ask?  I just had my 'Half-shafts" for my 77 Bus,
automatic, rebuilt by a reputable local CV Joint company.  Four brand new CV
joints and boots.  When installed, they "click" pretty loudly.  I took them
back to the shop and they confirmed they were assembled correctly.  He said to
drive them to see if the noise would stop.  I re-installed them and did a
couple loops around the block.  On acceleration, they are fairly quiet, but on
deceleration they make a heck of a racket.  The ride height of the bus has not
changed.  He rebuilt the axles that I took off of the bus.  I have compared
them to other shafts that I have and the new joints look the same. The shafts
are different length on the automatic, and I am sure that I have them on the
correct sides.  I have swapped them end-for-end.  I have read every bit of
archive and tech help, every manual I can find, and I am stumped.  Your sage
advise greatly appreciated!
