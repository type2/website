 Now I have heard that Armor All is actually harmful to rubber and seals,
and
 shortens their life in the long run, contrary to popular belief.
 The Porsche folks seem to like Zymol, which is pricey, but apparently
 protects/restores seals pretty effectively.
 YMMV.

 I can agree with this one from personal experience, for sure.  Rain just
 beads up and goes away, no wipers needed!  And the faster you go, the
better
 it works.
