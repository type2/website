Subject: Re: [T2] What H4's is everyone using in there Buses?

But--
Some of you might think of this product as a good high visibility
headlamp--which I have used in my 74 Westy as well as my 85 Vanagon--
Hella Vision Plus head lamps.

I would venture to say the have increased my visibility at night by
25%--and with no relay installation.

I have been purveying genuine 40 amp VW relay set ups to the Vanagon
community for some time--with excellent results in allowing the use of
higher wattage bulbs (80 / 100's) with no adverse effect on the wiring
or switches--
I'll work up an easy way to install these in the type 2's and report
soon.

I also have a new revelation---
The front turn signal / parking lamps are pretty lame not only in the
type 2  but also the Vanagon--all of them.
The std. bulbs are 5 / 21 watts--almost kerosine lamps.

I have found a replacement bulb which puts out 10 / 48 watts--and gives
the front end of the Bus / Van some recognizable character--

I have these in stock for $2.99 each.

Later,

Terry

What brand and wattage are everyone using in the Buses> Are you doing
the Relay routing? I'm getting closer the starting that phase. 

Standard H4s are 55/60W: the same wattage as the stock lights so no
wiring improvements are required. If you already have a noticeable
voltage drop at the headlights (measure it) because the long wire from
the engine to fuse panel is culprit you can decide what to do. 
Info from the Hella relay catalog: Voltage vs. Luminous Intensity... 
13.50V (100%) 100%
12.83V (95%) 83% 
12.15V (90%) 67% (not a big drop but only 2/3 a bright)
11.47V (85%) 53% 
I'd like to put in a relay if only to take to load off the headlight
switch. 
According to the wiring diagrams, the stock wiring is 2.5mm which is
just a little bigger than 14 AWG so the wiring can handle about 15AMPS.
If you put in 80/100W bulbs, the fuses may just be on the verge on
blowing on high beam but the wire will definitely be under stress. 
A quality H4 housing with running normal wattage lamps will look just
like poor quality unit running 80/100W bulbs. And there are even higher
wattage bulbs. 
Sylvania and Osram are the familiar brands at the local flaps when I
live. I find some stores don't have great stock of these bulbs so you
might want to call ahead and save some gas and frustration. 
Sylvania H4 Halogen
Osram Bilux H4 64193 
Both are $10 and Made in Germany. At first it would seem any motorcycle
store will carry H4s because they are the de-facto for most models but
they often sell junk and sometimes cost $15-$20. Avoid them. 
Bosch makes an H4 but I don't know the part number to order one. 
Sylvania has a premium H4 called SilverStar for $24. Not worth it.
