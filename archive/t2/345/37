For some reason they require four fasteners instead of two per side which
means more work.

If it's like the Type 1 covers, the nut is replaced by a elongated nut
(forgot the name) that you still use to tighten the rocker shaft. Then you
secure the cover with 4 hex head bolts that screw into the other end of the
elongated nut. Included are o-rings to keep it sealed.
