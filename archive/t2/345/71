Phil,

You don't need a flame suit. Trying to remove the heads with the motor in
the bus is just a big waste of time, and it is a sure way to get a poor seal
at the heads when you put it all back together. By the way, take a motor
with an already low compression ratio and introduce a big head leak, and you
will overheat on a regular basis, and then you'll be pulling the motor for
sure because it will be all over. If you are on the side of the road
somewhere, then yes, it might make sense to leave the motor in the bus while
pulling off the heads, but in any other circumstances it is a bad idea.
