Subject: Re: [T2] 72 WITH WEBBER CARB Mileage?

Hi Darren,

When you say "quite a bit of gas", what kind of mileage are you 
getting?  While it would be great to get more than 20MPG, a 1700cc 
engine has to work pretty darn hard to move a heavy, non-aerodynamic 
box down the highway.

My 72 with a single webber carb consistently gets 19-21 miles per US 
gallon driving approx 80% on highways (but rarely over 60 MPH).  My 
wife and I have been travelling for months in this vehicle and it is 
HEAVILY loaded with stuff. (litres / 3.79 = US Gallons in Canada & 
Mexico)

You may get slightly more MPG, but I think around 20MPG is typical 
based on previous list postings.  Other Volksters, what kind of 
mileage are you getting on your 72's ?
