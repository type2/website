Some thoughts and questions:

I had the same problem: carpet completely soaked when there was heavy rain. I'm still not 100% pleased but I've sealed the leaks until I can get the body work done. It's probably very rusty under the windshield like mine and that combined with a cracked and/or shrunken seal allow the water to leak in. Is it true that new seals are slightly smaller than the originals?

Someone recently gave me some advice for repairing that area. Weld in the necessary repair pieces or use the filler of your choice. Then, convert the rust (rust mort etc). Prep it, paint it. The last step is to use a product like Wurth's body wax to seal the oxygen out from under the seal area. I haven't tried this yet but that's the advice I got from a good restoration shop and I'm planning to follow it.

Some good pictures that I've saved on the under windshield area designed to freak you out:

Until you get the repair done you can do several things. Seal the area off with clear silicone. I see busses all the time with all that black goop trowled around the windshield. Yuck. Anything you use will need warm temperatures to cure properly. The clear stuff is a good choice because you can watch it change color from white to clear to see that it's cured.

Permatex makes a silicone windshield product that will wick under the seal:

BMW makes a weatherstripping treatment called Gummi Pflage. It will condition the seals and make them last longer but I don't think it will ressurect a seal from the dead.

I'd like to hear more from people about reconditioning the rubber. At some point it's just too dried out right?

Does anyone replace the seal every few years for preventative maintenance?
