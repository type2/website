Subject: Re: [T2] How do you turn a tight engine

Here is a follow-up on what happened:

I called AVP on Monday and left a message (and mentioned the warranty
serial number) and they called right back.

I had the honor of talking to Leonard.

I explained that I could manually rotate the engine when I first put
it into the Vanagon but was now no longer able to do that, even with
the spark plugs out. The engine had less than 120 miles in it.

Leonard said that it was perfectly normal: as long as the starter
could turn the engine, it was okay and that I was worried for nothing.

When I asked how I could turn the engine to adjust the valves at 1500
miles (AVP warranty requirements), he suggested tightening the
alternator belt and/or using gascacinch to make the alternator belt
more "grippy" so that rotating the alternator would rotate the engine
(that does not work now).

Now, according to several people I talked to, including the local VW
shop, a tight engine like that is a precursor to overheating and an
engine failure.

So I don't know how long that engine is going to last.

Any ideas what I should do?

I have a head temp sensor which I will put in.

Thanks.
