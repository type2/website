Subject: getting rid of joulise windows

i think that i spelled joulise wrong. how do you spell it??. Now that 
everyone knows i cant spell my question is I was thinking about getting rid 
of those ( joulise) windows in my 72 westy and I wanted to know if i could 
just take them out and put in normal popouts from a standard bus. would they 
fit?? also, Does anyone know of a good vendor for an svda type dist.? I cant 
find it on busdepot. Maybe i missed it. and i havent been able to find it 
anywhere else. and another thing while im posting, Where can i get cooling 
tin for my type4 engine in my bus! all i see is tin for the bugs and busses 
with the damn type1 engines. But what about us late baywindow owners!!! the 
ones that i know i need for sure are 1) left heat exchanger cover plate and 
also the engine bay seal. what im not sure about is does the bottom left air 
duct (page 20 ch. 5 fig.7-1 part #3 -- in my bently [the 68-79 one]) does it 
go under the pushrod tubes and cover the cylinders??? so you dont actually 
see the cylinders or pushrod tubes, but only the bottom left/right 
coverplates? if so then i also need the left and right of that. well if 
anyone knows where i can get these pieces or they can answer any of these 
questions please let me know. i hope to hear from some of you guys soon. 
thanks
