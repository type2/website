For your info, I was once quoted (late last year) a price of $2700 for
a complete rebuilt of a Type 4 (2.0L) engine including R&R by a
reputable shop in the Bay Area (Redwood City). My problem was also a
very leaky engine.

The $2700, based on my recent experiences with a phone order rebuilt
engine, is probably worth it.
