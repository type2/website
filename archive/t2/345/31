Subject: Re: [T2] top end update : rebuild?

Goodmorning all:
     I needed some tools for a T4 I am going through and got in touch with
vw alley which I got from someone on the list.  This is a mom-pop machine
deal, they have some realy nice tools already, though he said if anybody
needing other type4 special tools he would see about making them. 
     Special tools I have seen no where else.
