Subject: RE: [T2] Westy cabinet tee- molding

Here is a link to the exact product that I ordered.
http://www.outwater.com/graphics/extrusions/105-662.jpg  This picture has
the exact dimensions.  I didn't go with the 11/16 due to the thickness of
the T.  I had samples of both and trust me the 5/8 with the thicker T looks
just the same is stays put.

I didn't mean to imply my purchase was the other place in my first email,
but I ordered this item from Outwater Plastics.  I went with a slightly
thicker T to avoid having to glue the item in.  That way if it shrinks I can
move it back into place easier.  I looked up my invoice and I got 250' for
less than $45.  Shipping was very cheap via UPS ground.  I gave the source
to the guys at the Bus Depot, but I guess that they never did anything with
it.

Hope this helps,
