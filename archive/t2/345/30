I have a digital meter, I use to work on PC's. :O)

Apparently broken.  The turn signal switch seems to be shot, the lever hangs
lose in the switch and doesn't click into either position.  I'm going to
pull it and see if I can rebuild it before I look for another one.

Ah, I didn't know that each headlight had it's own fuse.  I'll check the
fuse block first to see if there's any corrosion on the contacts, first.

Thanks, Chris.
