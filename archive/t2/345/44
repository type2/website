Well I wouldn't worry to much about hurting his feelings. I'm not saying 
you should be rude but ask questions freely. If he can't answer the 
questions in a reasonable tone or with some reasonable answers that you can 
check out later you don't want to do business with them. My point is if he 
can't discuss this like an adult would you be able to rely on him or her if 
there was a warranty claim because the engine died?

Ask him your questions. Try to know something about what your asking, 
research his answers a bit to confirm the truth, ask about materials, 
tools, procedures.
