I have 77;  assuming that the 73 setup is similar, there should be two large
round posts on the solenoid, and one or two small blade (push-on) type
connectors also on the solenoid.  One of the large posts should have only a
single ground strap connected to the starter.  The other large post is where
all the large wires go.  I have two blade connectors; one for the actual
ignition-switch wire, and one for a wire to the fuel injection ECU.  The two
blades are actually connected to the same metal base, so it shouldn't matter
which push-on connector goes on which blade.

If you're not fuel injected, I'm not sure if you would have the second
push-on connector.  Also, if you have a "hot-start relay" your wiring might
be somewhat different.  If in doubt, remove the battery (you should anyway),
hook everything else up, make sure everything is turned off, then use a
multi-meter to check the resistance between the positive battery cable and
the vehicle gound.  If the resistance is zero or very low, something ain't
right.  Email me if something doesn't make sense.
