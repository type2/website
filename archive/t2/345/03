The most important measurement before re-honing and installing new rings is 
the side clearance of the rings. The grooves wear, and the new rings biting 
into the fresh cross hatch can and will hammer and break the lands between 
the rings if the clearance is over spec. You can't just measure some of the 
specs when rebuilding, you must VERIFY them ALL if you don't want to risk 
short term failure.
