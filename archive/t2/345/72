Subject: RE: [T2] Westy cabinet tee- molding

I purchased 100' of this for redoing my bus.  It is a dead on match and
doesn't require glue as the shaft is slightly thicker than the original.
Great stuff!  I didn't purchase it from Go Westy because it was so much more
expensive.

I found this place for Tee-molding. I havent ordered mine yet, but its only
about $.28 per foot instead of GoWesty's $1.25.
