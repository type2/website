A lot of possibilities, but I have seen several in the
wrecking yards that were breaking apart in the
mechanism for the turn signal arm / high/low beam. As
I recall, there is also the possibility that the left
side forward screw is loose. What I am referring to is
what you see after you remove the steering wheel.
There were thin copper slivers one time - IIRC they
were peeling off the underside of the steering wheel -
but I would have to disassemble again to trigger the
memory! Coulda been a different vehicle... Anyway,
once you get the steering wheel off (Loosen the nut a
bit, then rock the wheel hard until it pops loose) it
will then become quite clear. I think I've been
running without that forward screw for the last 10
years or so to "solve" the problem. Lemme know what
you find. -BaH
