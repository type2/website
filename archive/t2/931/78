Hi,

Sounds like low voltage associated with the voltage regulator, big block 
upper right of the firewall back of engine.

I would try to clean the back of the regulator and the surface it is set 
on to, make it slightly rough with sand paper.

Pull the plug for it gently (almost 30 years old you know) Check the 
condition of the connectors there.

The whole problem in my mind points to a contact associated with the 
computer saying to it's self, "OK, all the cookies are in the jar, I can 
start now)

Think like the computer and look for bad grounds on sensors, or 
corrosion on a sensor that screws in, show up as green/ white fluff.

That's my 2 cents.

Alan
