Subject: Re: [T2] Thanks for the battery advice, everyone

I got a new battery this morning, rather than mess
around all weekend with the old one. Even though it
was only three years old, I figured it was blown, and
fifty-odd bucks was worth being able to enjoy the
SoCal sunshine in my bus for the first time in over a
year. 

Thanks everyone
J
