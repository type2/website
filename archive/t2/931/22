 I got a new battery this morning, rather than mess
around all weekend with the old one. Even though it
was only three years old, I figured it was blown, and
fifty-odd bucks was worth being able to enjoy the
SoCal sunshine in my bus for the first time in over a
year.

The average lifespan of a battery is 27 months.......

When you buy a 5 year battery, all you are mainly paying for is the additional warranty.

Mercedes used to warranty their replacement batteries for 4 years.... with a proration on years 2, 3 and 4.
Now all MB replacement batteries are a straight 2 years. 100% up to the end of 2 years, zip after that.
