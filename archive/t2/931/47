Funny you should mention Nokians - I was going to (if
I can afford) buy a set of them, but I have exhausted
all my resources without finding a load range C Nokian
14". There are "Reinforced Sidewall" passenger car
tires, but no "C" range - according to Discount and
TireFactory and hours of web searching! Discount
quoted $130 per tire for the reinforced sidewall
version. Back to the Coopers for me!

Thanks for the info on the Yoko's. I guess D's are a
bit harsh. I'm happy with the BF Goodrich "C's" and
the Cooper "C's" so I guess I'll stick with what I'm
happy with. The siping I did on the worn out Coopers
seems to have helped tremendously. -BaH
