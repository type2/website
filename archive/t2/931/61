 Short answer, yes you can do it and it will work.

 However,IIRC I think that the lobes on the distributer
shaft that actuate the points may not all be same.  I
think that maybe one of them is cut a little
differently to provide a slightly different timing or
dwell to one of the cylinders (maybe #3 the hot one?)

The 3 degree retard on #3 lobe was back in the late 60's on the type 1 engine with the vacuum only dist and
pre-doghouse oil coolers.
