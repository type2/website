sensational. nothing short of sensational. ken was great on the  
phone, with explanations, returning calls. he gave me free range of  
the facility, to talk with whoever, whenever. he let me watch as the  
men tore down my old transmission. let me hand pick a rebuilt one.  
warranty choices, and great staff all around. go with them.
