Lightest to heaviest...

1) Gasoline
2) Kerosene
3) Water

Gas and kerosene are about 6lbs/gal, water is about 8
lbs/gal.

Water sinks to the bottom of the fuels tanks in cars,
buses, light airplanes, and jet airliners.

I think I got it backwards.  The water is lighter than
Kerosene  and heavier than gasoline. Kerosene pushes
it to the top, drain it,  then the gasoline will push
what's left back to the bottom.  Then  pump it through
the fuel line until it's gone.
