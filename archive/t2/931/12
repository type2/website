Subject: Re: [T2] How long to run bus to charge a battery?

What would be a bunch faster to verify if the battery was any good at
all would be to charge it for 12, and stick a hydrometer into each cell.

If you get zip--- it's junk---toss it.

If you have a week or two to be charging / discharging a battery to test
it --
You have waaay too much time on your hands.

The thing more than likely is so sulfated, and the cells shorted out--it
adios time.

He never mentioned how old it was prior to sitting in the Bus for the
extended period of time.

It's probably an antique ----
