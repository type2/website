Subject: Re: [T2] Breakdown - Resolution

My 78 sat for many years in a heated garage - the PO bought it in 1980 and 
between 1980 and 2003 he put on 50,000 kms.  I went through a phase, after 
buying my bus, of changing fuel filters quite frequently - I think there was 
a point where I'd change it every two weeks.  Then it went to 2 or 3 times 
per season - now - once a year.
