Thanks for the responses guys. I'll check the CV's, wheels, lugs and try to
pinpoint the sound. Hopefully I'm not out a bunch a bread. I'll post an
update when I find out more.

front tires from the front and back. Run it in 1st gear at idle and see if
you can ID the noise.

>Drive Axles

>Wheels (re-torque them to 94ft/lbs)

>Transmission throw out bearing (pre-71, 71-79 would be rare)

>Pressure Plate coming loose (uncommon)

>Forign object caught in your drive axles and whapping against the car.
