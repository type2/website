Don,

My filters (I just smash them open with BFH) look way worse than
yours.  Mine are full of black silt/sediment/crud.  My fuel lines are
only a few years old and I have a fuel pressure guage so I can test my
pump/regulator.

I got a pretty cheap sears guage kit with all American size parts.
Modified to meet my needs.  Sure it nice knowing your pump/regulator
are in good shape when you start troubleshooting fuel supply problems.

> I've been changing my filter every two weeks or so. Ugh.

Something to look forward to.

Billy
