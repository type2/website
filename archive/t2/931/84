Subject: low rpm = poor running

folks,
1800 t-4 engine with Idf 40 dual webbers.

at high'er rpms she runs like a dream. but at lower
rpm, even when warm, she stumbles and backfires. not
that bad, but not that good either. i have messed with
jets:
main: 1.20
idle: .50
(2500' elevation)
but didn't change that much.  can someone give me some
troubleshooting tips here. sounds like i may have a
vac/air leak but haven't found any yet. unless i need
74.5 idle jets?

thanks
matthew
