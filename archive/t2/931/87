Since it is bus-speed, not engine speed, related and
varies with turn direction, that points to a CV joint
or just maybe a tranny. It's probably a CV... maybe
failing, but far more likely just loose CV bolts. 

I've had this happen a couple times, usually shortly
after I had the CV's disconnected for some reason.  I
learned to avoid this by:

1) Don't grease or anti-seize the CV bolts or their
holes.
2) Use new OEM lock washers every time (cheap at the
dealer).
3) Make sure you have the metal backing plates that go
under the bolts (3 on EACH CV).
4) Give 'em a little extra torque above the book
value(using the correct tool, not an allen wrench).


You have probably damaged some of the bolts, so
replace any that are bent.
