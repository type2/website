Subject: Testing dash electrics, engine out.

I went over all the dash, underdash and fusebox electrical connections
on my 78 westy, cleaning and checking them. The wires, components and
the wiring connections looked good.

I installed a new radio and speakers, VDO tach, oil pressure and temp
gauges and a cht. I want to test the radio and the gauge lighting.

Question; Is it ok to install the battery for testing purposes (radio
and lighting) without the starter, all the EFI stuff or engine
electrical connections connected?

(I found a good case for my rebuild. Thanks to everyone for their
help. I found one near where I live. It needed nothing and I got a set
of standard sized main bearings to fit the case and .020 under for the
machined crank.)
