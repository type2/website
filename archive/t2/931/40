Subject: To Sipe or not to Sipe?

Anybody sipe their tires? Do it yourslf? Improved
traction? How much improved? Long range - detriment to
tire wear? Other comments?

I just tried it on an 80% worn-out set of winter
tires. Last winter they were very squirrelly
especially at any pressure over about 25psi. I just
took them out for a test spin in heavy rain storm and
the results thus far are way beyond my expectations.
With pressure up to 35, they are more surefooted than
I can ever remember them being. This is very
preliminary. -BaH
