Apologies if the answer to this is somewhere in the rather daunting
archives.

Front right turn signal has failed to work, even after a new bulb.  Once
before the trouble was in the mechanism for the turn signal arm.  Any
other suggestions where the problem might be?  I'm scared to probe the
mess of spaghetti and electricity under the dash, let alone stand on my
store-bought new neck to reach the stuff.  If I have to take it into the
shop, where should I recommend they start looking?

Thanks.
