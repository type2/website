Changed the fuel filter.  Second time in maybe 2 months.  Black crud
leaking out of the supply side, filtered side not too hot either.

Did not execute tank drain/flush/aerate or anything like that cuz I
put of repairs till 8pm Sunday.

Anyway, it is evident that I've got a tankfull of nasty.  What's the
preferred mechanism for fixation that I can do at home without
dropping tank?

Thanks,

Billy
