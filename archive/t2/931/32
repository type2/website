Subject: Syncro drive train Swap???

Volks,

I have a 87 syncro passenger van with a rotten body. The interior is clean and the vehicle shows 200k on the odometer. I also have an 82 vanagon auto with a great body and no interior. Can I swap the drive train from the Syncro over to the 82, thus making it into a synco? I have an aircooled engine that I want to install on it and will look for a camper interior. 

Any information would be greatly appreciated.
