This happened to me, but the circumstances weren't quite as exciting.

The horn relay in my '71 was toggled between the on and off states 
when a brown wire inside the steering column is repeatedly grounded. 
In a nice world, this happens only when the driver depresses the horn 
button. In our world, it can happen when that wire lies up against a 
sharp piece of grounded metal.

This was the case for the '71.  Unfortunately, I forget the details 
of how I got at the wire bundle. I think I had only to remove the 
turn signal indicator. Once the wire bundle was exposed, there was 
the brown wire with a 1/4" slit of insulation rubbed away and 
beautiful copper peeking out at me through the slit.

It was one of the few AHAAA moments of my bus ownership.

I wrapped the slit with tape. The problem disappeared.
