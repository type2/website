I've got a set of Nokian Hakkapeliitta's on my bus for the winter.  They've
got great traction, the ride and stability is great, and they're load range
D.  As far as I know, all the Nokian 185R14 van tires are load range D.
Take a look at Richard Atwell's tire page - it looks like he's trying out a
set of Nokians:  http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Tires.html
