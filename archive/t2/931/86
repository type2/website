What? I had my eyes closed when I was reading...

I just like to make folks rebuild their motors for no reason, It makes me
feel better about my seemingly constant Westy(s) motor situation.

Well, he said it got worse w/ car speed, not RPM.  And also, the sound 
changed when turning one way or another.  If it were in-fact the engine 
that's having a problem, I'd venture to guess that it would make the 
sound at the same intensity whether turning right or left ;)

I'd look to see if there were any broken boots on the CVs as that would 
be a very good indicator of which joint might be failing if it is the CVs.
