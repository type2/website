Actually, I think westy is a perfectly valid way to describe your bus, 
especially on the list, but not so much to general parts dealers.  For 
list purposes, it implies that you have a pop-top and various 
accessories.  Plus, it's a given that it's a vw as you're posting on a 
vw list.  To think otherwise would be illogical ;)

78', well.. hehehe
