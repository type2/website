Subject: Stall when braking

Hi

Drove Polly around the block on Sunday, everytime I pressed the brake 
hard, she stalled.  Also happens when stood still!

I have read the archives, and the library, so I guess this is a torn 
diaphram, id there anything else (le$$) it could be or is that it

Thanks
