Thanks Don - Been here quite a few times, but now it
is beginning to make sense. The 185 tire is rated at a
minimum of 1764 pounds per tire which is considerably
higher than the 1435 pounds for my LT 195/75R14 LRC
tires. The 195 is rated at a minimum of 1984 pounds
per tire.

Apparently the dealers are looking only for the load
range "C" or "D" designation and not the per tire load
rating. -BaH
