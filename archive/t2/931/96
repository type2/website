Hell yeah!!

2 summers back I was SURE that the vanagon I was driving had a bad CV  
joint...that was up until the drivers side rear wheel passed me by.  
Luckily I had a couple nuts left in the hubcap and I was able to find  
another on the road so as to limp home with it.

I check the lug nuts IMMEDIATELY whenever I hear a sound like that.

Happy Trails,
