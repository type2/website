Subject: [T2] 76 brake problems...

ok heres what i am thinking....
  i think its the master cylinder also...?
   
  the brake pedal when pushed is soft but has a rubbing tightness at the bottom.....
   
  i still no see no leaks from the master cylinder though......
   
  any thoughts on this would be helpful.... do all bad master cylinder leak .....? or just stop working...? 
  the guy told me that putting onthe new rear wheel cylinder coul;d have made it go out.....? sounds right to me....
   
  my wife has helped me a many a times now to bleed brakes so i know she is doing it right...
   
  and it seems i got fluid back in the back brakes now... but stil a soft pedal....
   
  could it be anything else besides the master clyiinder...?
   
  thanks again...


                                                                Better start thinking about sealing up those windows and leaky doors....
  Winter months are on there way,dont forget to break out the heater and Lets Go CamPing~!
