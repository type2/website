Hi,

Have you checked the brake booster vacuum line? Certainly cheaper to
fix. In my '71 the vacuum is ported off the 3/4 intake, runs to a one
way check valve, then through the firewall and along the left side
frame rail (some section of the line are metal) to the booster.

15/32" vacuum line I believe but 1/2" should work. Try a truck parts place.

peace
