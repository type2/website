so whats the trick to bleeding brakes by youreself without buying the bleeder kit to do it yourself...
   
  guy on the phone told me that i could just hang a can with some wire on each tire and hook a hose to it and bleed umm that ways.....  says that longs the hose is in the can with the fluid now air can get back up.....
   
  i thought you must hold the pedal down to not let air back in no matter what....
   
  so hmmm... how can i see the bubbles or no bubbles....
   
  i am sure you can put something to hold the pedal against the seat maybe ....?
   
  and run back and lock off....????
   
  i been bleeding them with a hose and a jar..... the way i always do....
   
  he thinks my master cylinder might of went out....?
   
  hmmmm? i dont see any fluid around it either...?

While you're waiting, can you pull the metal lines? Or just pull off
the soft hoses and try blowing compressed air through them to see if
they're plugged?
