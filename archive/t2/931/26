Subject: Re: [T2] Washer Bottle / Kick Panel

Todd,,, answer to your question is Yes...If you can see the bottle cap with 
the air hose.... then you are missing the other cap... it sorta looks like a 
top hat with a wide brim.. it just slides over the bottle cap and covers the 
hole of the kick panel.
