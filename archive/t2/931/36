Check for vacuum leaks. Retorque intake and carb fasteners. Verify 
boots not split.

>New exhaust.

Oxy sucked into exhaust can cause popping. Retorque fasteners and 
verify gaskets.

You can verify cam position at each cylinder by watching rocker 
movement while rotating engine and feel the piston come to TDC with a 
screwdriver. If you still have poor adjustment, it may well be the 
rocker face is heavily worn.

You can verify TDC #1 to within a few degrees with the tech given 
above for the valves. You also must verify you have the proper dizzy 
installed. Different dizzy's will require different initial timing 
settings. Stock dizzy with retard hose blocked and advance hooked up 
is the easy way to go with the Weber. Otherwise, the 050 is all 
mechanical and has a good curve for the T-4 motor.

Symptom of vacuum leaks, false air.

Popping upon decel is symptom of lean mixture. Richen a bit and see 
if it doesn't improve. Always verify mechanicals first, compression 
and valve lash, then ignition timing and energy, and only after that 
should carb adjustments be attempted.
