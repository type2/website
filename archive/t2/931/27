Subject: Re: [T2] Horn question (was Re: [T2] Horn decided to start

Before diving into anything else, thoroughly check out
the easy-to-reach stuff that is most likely the
culprit anyway! If it is ONLY the right front that is
not working then the problem is likely right there at
the light or the wiring leading specifically to that
light assembly.

1st, does the right front parking light work? If not,
then you likely have either a second bad bulb or a bad
ground, or even the terminal pad in the base of the
socket has either corroded and has no bounce in its
spring, or has twisted so the terminals don't align
correctly. If there is any sign of corrosion, you need
to clean that all up before anything else.

Does the right rear turn signal work but not the right
front? Do the left turn signals work okay? What year
is the bus? Do the hazard warning lights work all the
way around? (Try this: turn on the hazard lights, then
off-on-off-on several times, being just a bit harsh
when turning them off. Any difference in the turn
signal working?)

The fuse should be for all the turn signals, so I did
not mention the fuse.

Now, what about the horn? Mine honks when I turn on
the left turn signal or flash the high beams but not
when I push the horn button. I figure this is normal!
(Actually I know the cause and have made the proper
modifications to work around the issue!) -BaH
