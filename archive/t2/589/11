Subject: Re: [T2] DriverSide 'Nose' totalled. Any ideas?

Hi
I think your being pretty optomistic about getting this thing into nonrust
shape.
I parted out my first bus with less rust. Im using the body as storage. The
time
and money you spend, you could probably find a parted out body with less
rust,
cut the pieces out and weld them in. Or just use a different body and swap
your
parts in if it's mechanically sound.  I didn't see any pictures of the
bottom,
how rust in the front crossmember, floor and frame? If your just wanting to
drive
it around regardless, have fun with it, fill the front corner with bondo and
do
a tremclad paintjob. Maybe change it more into a troll and paint it as one?

Odds are the rust is right through so any pounding will make a mess.  Por-15
does some neat and cool stuff to rust but it won't help to hold together
rust. Still
needs some good metal to keep it intact.

Sliding door : How's the assembly? Rust on the lower track?  Resist
temptation
to pick the rust out, the slider will fall through and the door will come
off when
you don't want it to. POR15 it right away, topside and underneath. Maybe it
will
stay together for a while.
