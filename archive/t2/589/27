Don,

Check out www.roadcow.com to learn more about a good location for the
radiator. From what I read, the radiator will work in place of the back hatch,
but roadcow had a better solution. A little more work and it changes the look,
but the cooling is not a problem. Plus it has fans when stopped. This toyota
engine has many miles on it and has proven to be reliable.
