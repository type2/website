You don't think that having a more reliable and forgiving engine is
worth the time and effort in the long run?

Granted, if I had a fresh 1700-2000 I wouldn't be considering this.
But I have a fresh Toyota engine that I'm saving from the scrapyard.
To me this, along with the obvious benefits of the Toyota engine, is
worth it. That and the fact that low mileage replacements are
available for a few hundred dollars and I can drive 40 minutes up the
freeway to pick it up.

Mounting the rad isn't as big a deal as I had initially thought when
first considering this. The radiator from the Celica fits quite nicely
where the engine hatch is. A bit of sheet metal and fiberglass to
pretty it up and it will just look like a bulge in the back. Nothing
up front (or on top).

Water heat > heat exchanger heat. 
More and smoother power.
EVERY auto parts store carries parts for the Toyota engines. Only a
few odds and ends are available for the T4 unless I want to drive 30
+_ minutes to another store.
20R vibrations will actually be worse than the T4. I'm thinking about
options to alleviate that including dampeners. I'll have to see after
the engine's installed.

I'm sure there are more reasons to convert, but they aren't coming to
mind. But you get the idea.

I normally would think it was stupid too, except the benefits are
great! And not having to adapt another transaxle to the bus is the
clincher.
