Through this whole conversation I haven't seen anyone ask Doug what he's
measuring. If its oil temp where are you measuring it? There are several
different places where one might install one of these and get different
readings. But the first thing to do is stick it in boiling water to find
out how accurate it is. I recommend you go to http://www.geneberg.com/ and
read the tech tip on 'Why We Don't Sell Gauges.'
