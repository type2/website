Subject: electrical issue?

out of nowhere, I went to start my van (79) and it was dead. I had turned it off not a half-hour prior to that. I managed to get a jump and everything was fine until I tried to start it again...again...dead. It still had the battery that was in when I bought it so I thought that might be the issue. So I forked over the cash for a new one and hooked it up today. Now when I turn the key, nothing at all...not even warning lights. It is as if the battery is not even hooked up. I checked the connection and they all look fine. Anyone have any ideas?
 
thanks,
Colby
