Does anyone know how much a transmission weighs? I know I can easily pick
one up but I didn't weigh it on a scale when it was out of my bus to find
out.

Greyhound has a 100 lb. weight limit but they're inexpensive.
-----------------------------

my fox tranny crated was about 95 lbs in a custom built crate i made.  i
have the actual shipping weight but i don't have excel on this computer to
check it right now.  a fox trans should be pretty close to a bus trans.
alot can depend on the crating.  i just built a crate for a 1.6 inline
head and manifold combo and it weighed as much as the head :(.  the crate
can be seen on ebay in the photos for item 7909613197.
