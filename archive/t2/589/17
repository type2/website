Subject: RE: [T2] DriverSide 'Nose' totalled. Any ideas?

>>>I think your being pretty optomistic about getting this thing into
nonrust shape.<<<
Yeah, but I have access to a good sandblaster, and I've just come off of
restoring a pick up truck in even worse condition to nearly show shape.
:) 


>>>>cut the pieces out and weld them in.<<<<
Yep, I think that's what I'm gonna do for that nose and the wheelwells.
Except for the nose the other pieces are readily available and cheap
enough for me to do like one piece a month or so. :) And someones
offered to cut out the piece of the nose I need from a junkyard. :) 


>>>I didn't see any pictures of the bottom, how rust in the front
crossmember, floor and frame?<<<< 
The floor has one small rust spot, not even all the way through under
one of the seat mounts. Just really badly pitted. And the crossmembers
and rest of the bottom are in GREAT shape. The undercoating is holding
fast, no soft spots at all. That's why I'm going to go for it. It's
Mechanically sound. It's just cosmetics that need tending to! And just
think of how proud I can be if I actually manage to restore this bus to
near show quality!



>>>Por-15 does some neat and cool stuff to rust but it won't help to
hold together rust.<<<<
I'm well aware. The Por-15 in that idea was to stop it from rusting
MORE, while I have other stuff on top.


>>>>Sliding door : How's the assembly?<<<<
Theirs rust on the bottom of the door itself, but all the rails and
mechanics are in GREAT shape!

It hasn't been ran for nearly 10 years. And it's been in a carport. And
in Seattle's mild weather that keeps stuff in pretty good shape. :) 

Thanks for your advice. :) 
I'm Soooo inspired now. Kinda a little kid "oh yeah?!? You'll see!!" Lol
Chris and his 76 "parts car" resto. :-)
