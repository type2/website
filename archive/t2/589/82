I thought AC was for AirCooled. HUH?

AC can trace it's history back to 1901 in Merrie Olde England...The
original cars were named Autocarriers, but it was shortened to an
AC inside a circle in 1907...The AC Cobra was an AC Ace aluminum
(or aluminium ;-) body and a Ford 289 eng. and trans...Caroll Shelby
presided over the marriage and the Rip Chords did the music... :-)

If you're into name changes, BTW, Jaguar was SS before WW II
(Swallow Sports or Standard Swallow) but the SS was not a good
choice of name for anything when the letters also appeared on 
black Nazi uniforms... :-( 

Tony in NJ (Who drove a 289 and was taken for a very quick ride
                  in a 427...A car with no reason to exist besides a de-
                  sire to be over THERE before anybody else... 8-)
