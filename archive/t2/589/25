Subject: Re: [T2] Weekend Update engine is in

Definately a lot of good bus Karma at Michael's this weekend!

When I got to Michael's house he had the engine completely assembled....even
the filler tube and muffler were on. I asked him how we were going to get it
in the bus with all the accessories mounted. He said it would just go right
in...I didn't believe him. Maybe it is because all of the pancake engines I
have installed before were mating to a standard transmission with the spline
sticking out (I haven't had a reason to pull the engine out of the auto
tranny bus I own now). Michael's bus is an automatic too. Well it went right
in with room to spare. I wouldn't have believed he could get a completely
assembled engine in (minus the FI system) if I hadn't been there. It's
comforting to know when I do finally pull my engine out for the one I am
rebuilding I can completely assemble it before the install!!! Which brings
me to my next post to follow...
