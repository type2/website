Getting it running is one thing, "reinventing the wheel" is another, even if 
it is a replica of a reinvention(ie. Road Cow). It is cool to try new things 
and do what hasn't been done. But i remember the late eighties phrase "Don't 
bite my style". He is also talking about money for a fresh rebuilt engine as 
opposed to the kit for the toyo, all the fabrication that will have to be 
done, the tools to buy to do it, etc.

We do need to support the list members. We need to help people like Don get 
their "VW Engines" running. But you can't help people that don't want help.

>I suggest we help this guy get his bus running....  eh?

If he can focus on the problems, I am sure we can offer solutions. "Pure bus 
solutions."
