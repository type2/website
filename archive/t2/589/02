Also while you are in there you might want to suck out any of the fuel that 
is in there. It is a good place for small sediment and rust particles to 
collect. You can take out the needle valve and blow through the threaded end 
as you push on the needle it should open and let the air pass through. If it 
continually passes through with or without the needle depressed it is shot 
or has some debris stuck in it. I learned this with some roadside assitance 
form another VW owner on the way home from my first show, in my first daily 
driver.

Check out the float to make sure the pieces that hold it in place are not 
missing broken or otherwise messed up. I had a set of dual carbs that came 
with that same daily driver. They continually flooded out on one side. While 
I was cleaning them up to sell at the previously mentioned show I noticed 
why the float on one was malfunctioning. It was being held in place by a 
paper clip and it didn't have the proper travel.

Good Luck,
