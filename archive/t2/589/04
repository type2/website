Is this the post about the Bus Sale or the One about the Celica Engine 
Inplant before the current issues are resolved and you can actually get to 
know the bus on the road. Is this Celica one of the other cars in your yard? 
I remember you stating that you had 3-4 other cars that you can drive. Maybe 
you could sell it and use the money to get a turnkey engine to install then 
you only have to learn the basics of tuning it for now. Then you would have 
more free time to dream about major modifications that can be very 
frustrating to even the still and focussed of hands and minds.

Wanting to beef up the bus is a dream of a lot of people who just want a 
little more out of there engine. To each is his own. It might be best if you 
finish what you have started and give yourself a comparison for when you 
start cutting and welding and trying to join two country's that haven't 
worked together since WWII. I am a Civil Engineer and understand why and how 
people build bridges, so if that is your plan...good luck.
