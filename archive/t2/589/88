From enjoy the drive.com:


"The California Assembly and now the Senate Transportation Committee have 
passed A.B. 2683, the legislation that would repeal the states current 
rolling emissions-test exemption for vehicles 30 years old and older. .....

On Monday, August 2nd, the Senate Appropriations Committee has scheduled a 
hearing on this bill.  If the Appropriations Committee passes this bill, the 
entire Senate likely will approve it as well and will send to the Governor 
for his signature.  Make no mistake, our backs are against the wall!"
