LoL!!! Thanks Ben!

Actually, the bus is running fine, thankyouverymuch. ;) Still
figgering out the vacuum dizzy, but otherwise a good daily driver.
(Well, not driving until I get the advance curve nailed.)

I'm looking to the future. The Toy engine swap is MONTHS away. I'm in
the planning, looking, learning stages right now. I wouldn't jump into
something like this. I may make some rash decisions, but this isn't
going to be one of them.

Nothing I've yet seen has convinced me that my plans for the Toy
should be totally discarded. But I've got time still to change my
mind...
