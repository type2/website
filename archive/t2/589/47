Indeed.

And perhaps some day I'll have a bio-diesel powered bus, however, I need 
to get an engine built for my splittie before I do anything.

And "amen" to the "go anywhere with the proper maintainence":  my '71 
never stranded me (well, except for the busted fuel pump 3 miles from my 
house).  Hopefully the splittie will be in the same state of repair before 
too long.
