I was tracking with you for a spell, Tony, but then I realized what was 
wrong. This is the wrong analogy. The closer analogy is to talk about 
someone taking a real, restorable AC today and sticking a Ford engine 
in it. I don't care how good it ran, there goes another AC.

Now, a 73 transporter isn't an AC, so my analogy isn't ideal either. 
But it's a tad closer than yours.

Look at Michael Knight's picture of his engine install. That's pretty. 
That's what we're about here.
