Subject: RE: [T2] DriverSide 'Nose' totalled. Any ideas?

Have faith - it CAN be done. We did this with a '35 Ford Coupe. Was so bad the body began to flex badly once removed from the frame. It was a steel bottom car unlike the earlier models. Dad and I got it back together. 

It isn't can it be done but rather can >I< do it and can I afford it? <grin!>
