Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Swap Info?

I'll have to agree with scott here. I'm 95% through a Corvair transplant. Haven't touched it in a few months now .The hard stuff was over back near the Holidays but life got busy and I haven't had alot of time to work on it. 

TRUST me - MUCH more effort than building a new OEM engine. Also a mechanic will not touch it and the next owner may be hard to find (not to mention they may cuss you once they own it). <grin!> 

It's your bus, but there are ALOT of hidden costs and hidden time in a drivetrain swap. 

I still expect to be satsified with my bus and the changes but I have been careful to keep it a bolt in swap and I have kept ALL of the VW parts in case I need or want to go back to VW power. No hacking on my bus. 

On another note we're going to Philly, PA to buy a Cabrio this weekend for a second car. Hope we can find Philly. Somewhere up north - right?

Anyone got any good suggestions for places to eat and sleep? Looking for a non-franchise more or less $20 meal (what restaurant would you miss if you moved away from Philly for a while?) and a decent hotel/motel not in a scary part of town (made that mistake in Ashville once). Dealer is in Frankford and we are arrived and departing on I-95 north.

Thanks!
