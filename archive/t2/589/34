I'd do that if I didn't have a hitop already. I can't imagine making
this thing any taller... heh

KEP says that electrics aren't enough, and only an engine driven fan
provides enough airflow. I'm thinking about installing a thermostat
controlled electric as a backup as well. Depends on how much room I'll
