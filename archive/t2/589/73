Also under that gasket there is a Fuel Pump Flange If it doesn't show signs 
of falling apart don't touch it. They are made of some kind of plastic, 
ceramic, acrillyc, delicate material. I has a shaft that goes down into the 
engine case. It likes to stay there. I have seen quite a few just break off 
believe me you don't want this to happen. You might be doing a rebuild 
faster than you think. A new fuel pump gasket should come with the pump. 
Some times two one has three holes about the same diameter and the other has 
three with one of them being very large. The one with the large hole goes 
under that flange. The other between the flange and the pump. If you can 
wiggle the flange by all meens go ahead and remove and replace the gasket. 
If it feels like it isn't going to budge I would leave it be. It's not a bad 
idea to apply a copious amount of grease to the undre side of the pump where 
the lever and spring are.

Good Luck,
