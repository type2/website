Subject: What's a "Pure" bus?

I've been following these postings for a bit.  I understand and in 
some cases share Don's frustrations over getting his bus running. 
I've worked on mine for 3 years.

A couple of years ago, when I was about to roll my bus into the 
Sacramento River after stripping a plug, the listmembers made sure I 
had what I needed to fix the mistake I made.

Don's dilemma is similar to mine.  Bus in yard, wants to camp / drive 
but no $$$ to finish getting it running.  Yes, he's got a spare 
engine for his Toyota laying around, so why not think about it.

I agree with Mark about the Zen being wrong on this, but as a group 
of people we either need to support our list members in what they 
want to do with their busses (including cutting them in half and 
welding them to school busses -- ARRRRGH!)  or help folks like Don 
get their VW engines running.

Other than the problems with dropped valves, these are amazing 
powerplants.  But learning them takes work.  I'm not anything 
remotely resembling a mechanic but between the list resources and the 
Muir / Bentley books, I've got my bus together and on the road.  And 
I could not have don it except for the folks on this list, including 
the folks who offered to come by with tools.

I suggest we help this guy get his bus running....  eh?

BEN
