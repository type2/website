the fuel pump is one of the easiest things to fix,  there are good ones
from a few of the suppliers and a $20 or less alternative electric one
from your local parts store.

gas in the oil can cause loss of lubrication, and in a worse case scenario
even could cause a fire...probably wouldn't hurt if you changed the oil
and just drove the 40 miles. but a fuel problem, especially if the bus has
sat for as long as yours has, begs for fuel line replacement anyway

good luck
Bob
