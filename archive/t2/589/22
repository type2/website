Subject: Re: Re: [T2] Locking Gas Cap

Richard is correct.  The black plastic cap fits, but it 
fits very, very poorly.  I have one on the 86' DC and HATE 
it.  I should get a replacement cap from my local shop 
today or tomorrow, I will report if it works well and 
provide contact information for those interested in getting 
one.
