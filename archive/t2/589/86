Subject: Remember this piece?

There was a posting a few weeks ago about a piece of the cooling/exhaust 
system. I think it was a support strap/bracket from the cooling tin to the 
exhaust or heat exchanger to exhaust. It is a piece of flat steel that is 
about 6" long and about 6.5" wide holes drilled in either end to install to 
whatever. I have the piece and will post a pic tonight. But I can't remeber 
where I removed this from and I am going to be installing the rest of the 
tins and such and do not want to leave anything out.
