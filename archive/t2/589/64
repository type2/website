Subject: Re: [T2] driving advice? + fuel lines

Thanks for everyone's advice, and I did change the fuel lines when it 
was sitting... last August in fact. Should I replace them again?  I 
would do the fuel pump myself, but also want this guy in Loveland,CO 
(Vee-W Unlimited)  to check out a couple of other things I'm unfamiliar 
with, and he's only charging me $40 for the fuel pump including labor, 
so I reckon he can get dirty instead of me (and maybe he'll let me 
watch!).
