Subject: Oil Drain Plug Woes

This is a common problem regarless of the location.  I've had drill bits break
off in head studs.  My suggestion would be to get some cobalt or titanium
bits.  CENTER punch the tap and drill a small hole.  (Oiling the bits and taps
as you go through this process is helpful).  If you can find a reverse drill
bit (Eastwood sells some although they are relatively expensive and break
easily) you might get lucky and be able to back out the tap.  If not continue
drilling with progressivly larger bits until you get just to the edge of the
existing threads.  Once you get this far the remaining stud metal should be so
thin it is easy to cut out with the tap.
Fish around in the hole with one of those antena like magnetic picker upers to
catch easily accesible large pieces.  Pour oil in filler neck to flush as well
as possible.  Get a rare earth magnet from an old pc hard drive or order one
from allelectronics.com and put in place of the screen before you start it up.
Once you have run it with fresh oil and the magnet in place, change oil,
filter and screen.
Disclaimer - I have not had to do this with a drain plug, only head studs, but
is how I would do it if in the same situation.
