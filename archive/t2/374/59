At $40 you are just getting the joint. You need new boots probably and hardware and that whole kit runs $50-60.

If your own labour is worth money to you and you don't have a puller you might need, get the complete axle. If you want the experience (and sometimes it ain't pretty) and don't mind spending money on tools get the joints.
