Subject: 78 Westy fuel Injection- Gas in oil

Hi List Members,        
        For the past several months I have been working on several
problems with my bus motor. It finally started idling very rough and
dying while cold. After checking all components of the F.I. system for
this and the fuel in the oil and all checking ok I replaced the ecu and
both problems have disappeared. I also fixed the exhaust manifold pipe
leak with new gaskets and 2 new studs.I thank everyone who shared their
knowledge and helped me with these problems. The list has been very
helpful.

       Thanks, Ralph
        '78 Westy
