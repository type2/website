Subject: Re: [T2] VW Hippie Bashing

Hi Folks,

I just had to jump in on this one.  Even though I'm not old enough to have 
been alive during the "heyday" of the hippies back in the late 60's, I 
remember the counterculture ideas were still very much alive in the early 
70's.  Though I never got the chance to enjoy those days firsthand from 
behind the wheel of a brand-new '67 Kombi, I grew up in a VW Beetle (a '74 
Std), and have owned various VW's over the years.  I like the idea of 
community, of grass-roots movements, and of being counter to the corporate 
and governmental greed and control.  I try to follow a pretty simple and 
earth-friendly lifestyle, and I really love my Bus.  Now that a new 
generation of Bus owners is coming to the fore, I think it's our 
responsibility to keep those ideas alive.  Perhaps if we keep pushing for 
more environmental, personal, and spiritual awareness, someday the greedy 
ones will figure it out.  I enjoy passing a plastic minivan with its plastic 
occupants in my "original" minivan, complete with all of its 
user-serviceable parts.  I enjoy the smiles and waves from strangers, and I 
especially enjoy the love of the VW community.

Keep the faith, all.  Heck, we even have VWoA trying to get friendly with us 
again...

Take care,
Jason Upper
