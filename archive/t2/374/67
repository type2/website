Subject: Re: [T2] BB in vacuum line?

OK, the saga continues. I did the test you stated below and it seems that
the EEC valve is not functional. It must be closed all the time since when I
tried to blow through the hose at high RPM there is no flow. So why the BB
in the first place I dont know. Let me make sure I did it correctly first. I
pull the hose off of the charcoal cannister end and try to blow into the EEC
during acceleration right? The distributor still advances as it should.

This leads me to another question. Is the charcoal cannister and EEC valve
necessary for anything but cleaner emissions?

Thanks for all the help
