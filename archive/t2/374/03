Subject: Re: I need new carbs?

Hi, First,

>>>They say the compression is good - 150 everywhere.<<<
That's a bit on the high side!

The only way i found to somehow "diagnostic" my/your carbs is to check your plugs! Color? 

I have 3 sets of Solex 3/4 pdsit's, yes 3! All were rebuild, 
http://www.letambourin.com/west_carbu_rebuilt1.htm 
only one set is working...OK, no more. One of the set as a "Brand new" right one, i bought this one in a VW box! The left one was rebuilt and re-bush. This should be my best set, everything was done by the book! But, on my last trip ( http://www.eurokitplane.com/intro.htm ) i was unable to have this set working properly (puffing, big backfire at 2000rpm, dificult start????), 
About the third set!!! Well, it's a pain in the as*, something (passage) is block inside (left one). The only "somewhat" working set is the most "Used" one, bad idle but working ok otherwise with "some" backfire once in a wile.
This set is now on my friend Bus, same problem! (just for the sake of a test, he as 125psi on all 4) 

The conclusion: what you see is not what you get!
 
I would first check for an air leak at the intake/head junction or/and carb/intake junction. Also check all vaccum of the central idling system (if you still got most of them) Check all O-ring of the adj. screws (central idle system). Check buterfly gap, synchronize the carbs(1000, 2000, 3000rpm.)

About the Weber(prog), i have one also, we did some tests on my friend Bus (guinea pig, he he he), the carbs is also a pain in the as* to adjust, you need to play a lot with the idle jets before you get a somewhat decent idle (1200rpm ar best). The very cheap mating surface (head) of the very cheap intake needs to be perfect, air leak are easy overthere. 

Like i said before, the only other "Cheap" solution is to go FI.

Or buy some decent 40mm/44mm dual Weber/Dell. 

Cheers and good luck, Ben
