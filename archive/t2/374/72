government to stand aside and let us.

And I know, that VW and other big corporations are like the wide trees that

give shade, food, shelter, and solace to all manner of creatures. They

provide industry and exchange; they make products to make our lives more

satisfying... and they pay the taxes and put food on the table for workers

and for those who can no longer work. Is that such a bad thing? >>

That includes Enron, Global Crossing, The various energy companies involved
in the California energy fraud, Bechtel, Halliburton Ind. , Brown, Root, and
Kellog...et al...?-(
And the golden parachutes at American Airlines...
BTW, you might ask Eliot Spitzer (NY state attorney general) how he feels 
about those big trees...
