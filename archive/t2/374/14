I'm curious why all these past tense terms are being associated with this 
culture?  Seems to me "Hippie culture" was around long before the 1960's, is 
still alive and well, will no doubt be around for some time to come!

By its nature and the very principles of those who embrace it, it tends to 
exist on the fringe of what can loosely be defined as "mainstream" culture.  
It just happens to catch the media spotlight once in a while providing the 
"mainstreamers" a glimpse of it.  

These glimpse are merely snapshots of something that is quite fluid and 
changing.  Unfortunately it then becomes an identity frozen in the mind when 
in reality, the thing itself happily continues to move along 
as_all_culture_does!
