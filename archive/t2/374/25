I presume it has to do with flywheel size and starter mounting.

I don't care about the tranny side -- I just want it to bolt up to
my engines properly. What range of model years should I be looking for?The 002 and 091 bell housing will both work on a '74.  The 091 bell housing will allow for a flywheel size up to 228mm. but you then would need the late model starter; '76-'79.  The 002 bell housing will fit up to a 215mm flywheel and uses the bug starter.PFG
