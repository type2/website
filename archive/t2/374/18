Subject: Birth Certificate... the next step?

Hello,

I recently received my "Birth Certificate" from the the VW museum in 
Germany. It was pretty cool.

However, I would now like to get more details, specifically where in the US 
was the bus shipped? Who purchased it? etc...Does any one know how do get 
this information?

Thanks.
