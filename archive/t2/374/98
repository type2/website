Ah, you might want to check that out...Henry was virulently anti-
semitic and some of his writings found their way into Adolf's
Mien Kampf. In 1938, Henry accepted The Grand Cross of The
German Eagle, Germany's highest award given to a foreigner.
Adolf kept a photo of Henry on his desk and Henry had one of
Adolf. In 1940, Henry refused to build Rolls-Royce engines for
British fighter planes. The Ford plant at Koln, Germany built
trucks...For some reason it was never bombed by Allied planes.
