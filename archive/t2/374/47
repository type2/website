Subject: Re:  VW Hippie Bashing

A loooong time lurker comes out of the 
dark to comment on this hilarious thread.

"In fact, capitolism (sic) is not responsible for putting the VW on the Earth. Hitlerian(sic) socialism is..."

Actually, the British who took over the VW plants in the late 1940s made the Beetle the
a viable industry for struggling post-war
Germany.  The busses and beetles I drive 
have nothing to do with Nazi Germany.  Nothing.

As a child of boomers, I've always harbored a 
bit of suspicion when it came to hippies:  too
many idealistic notions lost when the real world came calling...I don't blame them, the world is hard enough without forever being
ostracized and railing against the majority
culture.  That said, I appreciate those who
came before my generation, try to live up to
the spirit of those ideals and am glad I grew
up in the 1980s and 1990s.  

And I love my bus and all she stands for.

Peace in the mideast...
