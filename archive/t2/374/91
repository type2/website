T-2 is a class of cars, T-1 Bug, T-2 Bus, T-3
(squareback-fastback), T-4 Variant(Big and bulky) Had
a big pancake engine(1.7 L & 1.8 L) in it and this is
what the engines looked like in the 72 and up buses so
they just called the engines a T-4 engine. Sounds like
you engine is going to have to come out for some major
work, with what is wrong with yours I would overhaul
it.   http://www.thepartsbin.com/vw_parts.html   try
