Well, I lived through the 60's. Not all did. Drugs can kill. But lets say for 
instance that folks had to pay something for their busses. They were not 
free. Food had a cost as well as housing and education. Tie dyed stuff was 
bought and sold or made with sheets and dye that were not free. So my point 
is that many folks rebelled against the same stuff we are fighting today. 
Corruption. Either we work to get bread to buy bread or we hunt to eat or we 
farm to eat. Or maybe we fish to eat. For us in the USA we mostly work in the 
cities. But farming has lost a lot of profitability, but some still do well. 
So we get buy the best we can. Now my own self went to work, had kids to 
feed, paid for my own education, Helped pay for my kids education, and live 
an O.K. life today. Many in the world dont live as well. I still have my 60, 
s ideals and a bus and a Ghia.  and try to live my life honestly and with 
character and integrity. I have come to learn that treating other folks well 
makes me feel better about myself. I like that. 
           Adolph and Henry shared ideas in manufacturing. Not politics. 
However the v.w. helped give the German people back some dignity and it could 
be argued that self esteem is certainly a great benefit when one earns his 
own way. It cannot be given. Freedom to do what one wishes without hurting 
someone else is in itself a great ideal is it not? But for us it was not 
given, or free. 
Thanks for trip down memory lane.
