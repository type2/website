Hi George,
	While I agree about not over charging (for the conditions), those
voltages you mention are not quite cast in stone.  They are quite
temperature dependent and, in fact, 15 volts may not be enough for many of
our higher latittude members in winter.  I lived in Alaska for 12 years
and speak from experience. Especially with short trips and high electrical
loads (lights, fans, audio, rear window defogger on) 13.5 volts at mid
range engine rpm will probably not get the job done due to idle rpm drop
out at every traffic light.  For some pages covering various chemistry and
construction alternatives see

Their cell voltage specs for sealed lead acid batteries are under 

battery chemistry -> lead acid cells-> "this so-called gassing voltage is
temperature dependent, for a chart of the temperature dependence click
here (blaupunkt ;))"

for a second site with a nice battery basics write up including a
discussion of basic i.e. non temperature compensated, charge rates related
to charge voltage I recommend

Of course it would be nice if automobile charging systems incorporated
battery temperature sensors to adjust the charge voltage, as do modern
marine systems, in the mean time we should keep an eye on our battery
fluid level and put some distilled water in occasionally.  IMHOP
'maintenance free battery' is an oxymoron.
