     No matter where we are or what we have done and interpreted by others
we are still  as we hoped to be in the 60' even if only in our minds eye.
We still need a lot of help. As we would say in the "Sky River Project" Sky
River Lives" ideals are still alive if only in our spirt.
     Just not only working on my 76' westfalia I find being on this list
for a short 4 or so mths. that their are many people out their that still
care which throught the years became less and less throught my strange
places of short travel. Just a short  "Thank You All" and also for all that
I have learned about my 76' westfalia.

                                          Enjoy
