Oh the memories of a really wonderful time in my life. The hippie thread 
made me smile a lot.
Woodstock: I left California with 3 weeks of vacation time driving my 
red 1959 Austin Healey "bugeye" Sprite (a trade for a non-running 
splittie) with no top. 948cc's of raw power! Had approx $300 in cash. I 
stashed my clothes, ice chest, minimal tools, a spare tire and "stash" 
behind the seats. Somehow I found myself back in California 3 weeks 
later. It was a wonderful time in my life! Momentarily "forgotten" 
memories crept into my consciousness over the next 6 months. My employer 
cut me a lot of slack for several weeks as I seemed a bit "out of it".
Retrospectively, my employer's largesse had little to do with kindness 
and a lot to do with practicality----I was the senior programmer on a 
IBM 1401 and documentation was a time-wasting frill in those days---it 
was all in my foggy head.
Thanks for stimulating some long ago memories.
