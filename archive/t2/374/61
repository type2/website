The good joints (Lobro-German-OEM) cost up to $110 each with new boot and 
hardware and clamps and grease as a complete kit. If you think $40 is too 
much, a VW is much too expensive for your budget. Find something cheaper. 
Good luck.

The only complete axles cheaper will be quicky rebuilds with used parts 
without builders name attached, loss leaders from the generic FLAPS weekend 
flyers. Results will be mixed.

Good and cheap usually means opposing forces in play. Generally, too cheap 
means not too good and truly good means not so cheap as the junk.
