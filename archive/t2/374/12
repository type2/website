Those are it. Looks like those handles aren't color coded but things vary 
from brand to brand.  Channellock is a good brand here. Heavy comfortable 
tool. The rubber handles haven't slipped on mine which is a pet peeve for 
me...

Here's mine:

These are pretty decent strippers. Not very heavy for crimping though.

The ones I stay away from are the ones made from 1/8" stamped steel, often 
black or chrome plated. Most often found here in connector kits where you 
get 500 connectors and these crimpers for $10. Beware... <grin>

I'm not a "tool snob" <grin> and I won't say you've got to buy the $50 
pliers but there is a significant difference in the cheapie pliers and a 
decent set. If we were professional mechanics or electricians we'd probably 
see the value of the $50 pliers but the cheaper ones will last a shadetree 
mechanic a lifetime. The cheapest pliers might make it through the weekend. 
Not that they'd break but that I'd throw them into the river out of 
frustration.

Hope this helps.
