Higher voltage isn't always a good thing.  As long as the alternator can
keep the battery charged and supply the other systems it doesn't need to
be much above 13 volts at all.  13.5 is fine!  At 14, all you're doing is
boiling the water out of your battery.  At 15, which seemed to be the Holy
Grail to the writer of the first article, I'd be looking for what is
wrong!
