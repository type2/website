First of all, cut to the chase and completely remove the engine.  A proper
rebuild, which is what is most likely required here, happens with the engine
out of the car.

If the piston is really fused to the cylinder, such that you can't pull the
cylinder out of the case, then you'll have to split the case and remove the
rod nuts.  This will allow you to pull the cylinder/piston/rod combo and
decide what to do next.  I'd say you're looking at a *minimum* of something
in the neighborhood of $700 to get this thing back together *properly*
(could be a lot more) so you may want to cut your losses at this point
unless you really, really want to drive this vehicle.
