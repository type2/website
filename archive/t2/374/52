How sadly cynical. 

If you truly believe this, then for you it most certainly will prove to
be true.  Your belief will be communicated, however unintentionally, in
the way you relate to others. And people tend to behave as they are
expected to. You will close yourself off to people whom, given a chance,
would have proven you wrong.  Of course, if you conversely assume the
best of people until proven otherwise, you will be burned more than
once. But for every time this happens, you will have 50 other
experiences that are the reason that life is worth living.  I can't
possibly imagine living life on the assumption that everyone in the
world is out for themselves.  How very sad.

And were it true, then wouldn't this be all the more reason for a
proactive position of very high taxes for the rich, and other methods of
foricing those that "have" to provide for those that "have not?"  After
all, by your view, they will certainly not take it upon themselves to
share with the less fortunate unless forced to, as there is nothing in
it for them. Right?

In my opinion, to sit back in our comfortable armchairs in front of
computers that cost us as much to buy as some entire families earn in a
year, worried only about writing philosophical email rather than whether
we will be able to feed our children tonight, while simultaneously
claiming that everyone should just be left to fend for themselves, is to
say "then let them eat cake."  It's easy for us to say only because
we're among the "have's" rather than the "have not's." On the day that a
baby born in Ethiopia (or even Harlem, for that matter) is born with all
of the same opportunities in life as the baby born to a wealthy couple
in the States, then we can realistically consider that position.  Until
that time, let us never, even for a moment, forget thet but for the
grace of god, we could have been born in their shoes.  Whenever I suffer
a personal tragedy, I remind myself that in the big picture, I will
probably never experience the level of suffering that is a daily reality
to millions of people.  Even on my very worst day, I am still truly
lucky. 

Mantadory Bus content (sort of):
For what it's worth, a small portion of the money that you pay when you
buy a Bus part from The Bus Depot is donated to organizations made up of
individuals whose very existence disproves the theory that nobody does
something in this world without an equal reward. Organizations like
Doctors Without Borders, a Nobel Prize winning organization that
provides humanitarian and medical relief to innocent victims of war,
epidemics, and disasters worldwide, regardless of politics, race, or
religion.  And Teaching Tolerance, who helps teachers educate our young
children to see beyond racial and other differences between people, in
the hopes that by proactively teaching young minds to remain as open as
they began, we can largely stamp out bigotry over the next several
generations.  Not that I don't have a profit motive with the Bus Depot
as well, of course, but one doesn't preclude the other. If every single
one of us did just a little bit more to help those less fortunate, the
combined effect would be tremendous. Charity is, after all, cumulative.

I apologize for the rant, as I really was going to stay out of this, but
I just couldn't bring myself to stay silent and let this go without
presenting another point of view.
