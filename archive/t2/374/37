Billy,

Well, one more....


Not sure about your last p.s. at the bottom.

I was *in* Washington D.C. for the "days of rage" in 1969.  This article

Lordy, lordy...this is beginning to make me feel old!

Bus content....I went there in a bus.<grin>

Absolutely last comment before George or someone kills this one!!

Cheers, dave
