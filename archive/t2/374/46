Subject: Taillight

I recently bought from Bus Depot a rear taillight assembly complete with lense 
bulb holder and all for my 69. It fixed my problem but if your looking for a 
stock looking lense this part does not have it. It came with a lense that was 
about a cm larger in length that stock and no chrome bezel ring around light. 
The bulb holder is not a stock item either and already has wires on it 
(red/green) although it looks to me to be a better design. If you dont care 
about the stock look buy two of them and you'll be happy. Looks Italian?
