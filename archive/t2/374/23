Subject: Bell housing types

I'm going to go boneyard picking for a spare bellhousing to mount
on an engine stand for my '74 this weekend. I recall discussion about
some differences in bellhousings through the various years. 
I presume it has to do with flywheel size and starter mounting.

I don't care about the tranny side -- I just want it to bolt up to
my engines properly. What range of model years should I be looking for?
