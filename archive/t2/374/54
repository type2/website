Until, like all imperfect systems, it breaks down.
Dennis Kozlowski and Kenneth Lay certainly spread the love all over a bunch of decent folks who, foolishly, had hopes of retirement at a decent age. Fools!

They'll be dying as they shovel the love off themselves at age 88.

Take off the blinders and see it thru the years of human civilization folks. Capitalizm is at it's height now, or before Bushwack came into office.

It doesn't mean it's the "answer"! It doesn't mean it's the best. It's what's working now. And not very well. 

And like all systems of government/economy designed by man to date, it will fail.
