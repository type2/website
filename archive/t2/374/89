Subject: 82 Vanagon Type IV Engine? Rebuild Problems

I recieved a present, an 82 Vanagon.  It is a 2.0 L Aircooled.  I have been
told it is a type IV engine (it is the factory engine) but I have also been
told it's a type II or atleast a type II vehicle with a type IV engine.  Maybe
someone can clairify?

Anyways, the problem is the head cracked.  The Piston is fused inside the
cylindar (jugg?).  I have not taken the engine out yet, however I have jacked
it up and tried to get the cylindar off to replace it (the fins have been
damaged.)  I can not figure out how to detatch the piston from the rod.

I am thinking I will have to pull the engine and remove the rod to get the
entire, rod, piston and cylindar loose and then replace all three.

Any Ideas out there?  I would love to get this up and running!

Thanks!
Jeremy
