I pass stuff all the time. Why just this morning I went right past
this dead racoon on the road. Flew right by him like he was stand
still.... er .... wait ... he was still.


Reminds me of driving through Montana in a 70 Westy. The only thing I
passed on the road said "John Deere" on the side of it... and it was pretty
close at that.
