I like my bus because the first car I ever drove was
a 1963 "Texas kit" camper conversion that my Dad bought
when, trust me, there wasn't another bus within 250
miles.  I am definitely a refugee from the 60's and
look the part though these days I'm a pillar of some
communities.  The bus is me; I am the bus.  This includes
the body rot, the occasional breakdowns, the random lack
of air and water tightness, the un-crash-worthiness, the
irremediable stains, and the triumph of perseverance
over raw power.  I wear two bumper stickers -- Apple
and NRA.
