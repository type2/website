Subject: oil in fan houseing....

i have oil that is splashing up in the fan houseing...
i thought it was the dipstick for the oil so it now has a boot on it and a o ring...
thought maybe it was the dipstick tube boot...
well changed that &*^*&%(%*^%pain in the &^(&*%%$&/...

ok then i changed the push rod seals.,.,..
then i changed the valve cover gaskets...

i had someone tell me that it could be from the oil poresure switch boot...?
the boot wil be here friday scheduled date of delivery..
already have the new switch...

i was also told that this might be the cause before it could be the oil cooler leaking.,.,.?
the spot is dripping from above the oil filter but nto from the oil filter beyond that i can tell from laying under the bus lookng up..

question am i in the right area what else could it be ..
if it isnt the oil prssure switch boot or the oil cooler is there anything else that i should look for.. trying to narrow it down...

wishing that it isnt the oil cooler  i hear it is a %^&%%#$#&*% also to get to and work on..

the pressure switch  boot how hard is it to get to..?
cant i get to it and change it from up on top?

had somone tell me but i mistakenly erased e mail... when cleanig out the mail box..

thanks for all that can shed light into a oily place...
lol..
i will say that at least now with all the seals i have the oil comeing from a concentrated place fnally lol instead of all over the ground now its just in a couple of spots...
lol//./
