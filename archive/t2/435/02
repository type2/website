Subject: driving w/leaky push rod seals?

good morning all.

My push rod tubes are leaking oil, which is then dripping onto the heat
exchangers and smoking when the engine is hot.  I ordered new viton seas,
but they didn't arrive in time for installation this weekend.  I have a
trip that I need to make on tuesday evening (20 miles or so) and was
wondering if there were any problems with driving the westy in this
condition?  is it OK as long as I'm checking the oil level in the engine
and not too embarrassed by the smoke, or should i be seeking alternate
transportation?

thanks for the help...sorry if this question seems a little overly
cautious, but i'm a newbie.

thanks again.
chris.
