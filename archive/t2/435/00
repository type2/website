Subject: fuel pump, endplay and turning over motor ?'s

well, work is comming along quite well on the engine,
i needed 4 shims to set the endplay and that is a
little funny to me so any encouragement that this is
still ok please send it my way.

the fuel pump off the bad engine that is going on the
good engine has a 3rd line comming off of it running
into a little hole in the tin at the bottom.  where
does it end up at or does it just vent in their for
some reason?

noticed that after i set the endplay that i could turn the motor over from
the flexplate side so i then installed the motor.  when i went to turn the
motor over to line up the holes so i could bolt it to the torque converter
i couldn't get it to budge.  what would cause this?  i pulled the plugs so
their is no compression problem either.  i was using a 13mm socket on the
flywheel, is this the correct thing to use or is their a better way to get
more oomph on the crank?
