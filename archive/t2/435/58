If it's in as good of condition as you say it's probably worth that to 
someone. Personally I would offer 3000 for it.

I bought an aircooled Vanagon specifically because i wanted the aircooled 
engine. The water boxes are much more expensive to work on and fix. My 
mechanic says they are pretty much junk. With a 2L type 4 engine, the 
Vanagon isn't as underpowered as you are probably thinking. I'm happy with 
how much power my Vanagon has.

Yea the height of a hightop can be a problem, you won't be able to park in 
many parking garages etc. Not sure if it would handle worst than a regular 
westy. My Vanagon handles alot better than my 71.
