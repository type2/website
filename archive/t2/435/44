Subject: which way in & out CVJ's?

Hiya list..

I found a few used cvj's to replace a few very bad ones on the bus.

Can anyone tell me how I can find out which one's go to the transaxle & which 
one's
go to the wheel. I don't know what position they were in to begin with.

The two Germany one's are all right. I need to pick 2 out of the 3 "LOBRO" 
cvj's to
put on the other side. I couldn't find anything in the archives.

Thanks a lot...in advance.
