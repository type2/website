Laura,
Just had the same thing happen to me, that stud will just spin out of the
head (vice grips or something, as the stud is now junk).  The trick is
finding a new stud, I had a local machine shop modify a couple studs from
and older engine, but I think Fat Performace might stock the ones we use.
BTW the new studs I used were a little longer and I was able to double nut
them, therefore resisting the urge to over torque them.  Good Luck!
