Subject: solid  lifter valve adjustment?

i need to make sure that i adjust my valves correctly.....

i have recently replaced the push rod seals and need to make sure that i go ahead and adjust the valves while covers are off......


so question is?
how do i get each rocker arm set correctly to adjust that certain valve?

if i spin the alternator around to the mark on my fan houseing matches that of o on my timing scale,.....
and i start then on the passenger side valve and rocker arm closest to the front? would that be correct...?

i have adjusted them before but had the help of a mechanic and he did the turning of the alternator as i myself adjusted the valves ... the rockerarm he told me to adjust./......

dont you turn the alternator like four diffrent times...
first starting on 0 and then its like 180 degreees around and something and something....

can someone shed some light on this for me>?

just want to make sure that i am adjusting the right valve at the right time>?

thanks for any or all help on this...

will i need my timing gun?
shouldnt have to set the dizzy again right?
or wrong?

peace
