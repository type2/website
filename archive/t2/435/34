I didn't know that they were different.  No threaded cap on G, just a hole
with two notches to catch the tabs on the OEM cap.

The locking one that we picked up from AZ is made by MotoRad.  It's has four
tabs, two to keep the cap from rotating, and two to lock it in place.  It's
outer circumference is large enough to fill up the entire gas cap depression
in the body.
