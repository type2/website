I once drove almost 200 miles with one bad seal, only needed about a qt of
oil the whole time (thank goodness considering it was synthetic) but did
get lots of looks and did get pulled over by the police in New York State
he was satislfied after I explained the problem and didn't even give me a
warning by you may not be so lucky...

it's amazing how much smoke one quart of oil can produce

as alwways YMMV
