Drill thru the casting only.  It is about 3mm thick there.  Drill until
you feel it punch thru or until it catches then stop immediately.  The
casting is aluminum and needs very little force on a steel drill bit to
cut so don't push too hard and you will feel it when it begins opening
the hole on exit.

When you are done you will have a permanent hole in the casting. It could
be filled with weld and filed off or a set screw could be inserted but
usually it is simply left open.

                             OOK!
