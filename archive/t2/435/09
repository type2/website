Hi Yall,
Excuse me as I have just jumped in the middle of this thread.
If your compression is good then wouldn't the rings, valves and guides be 
good?
Did you check the plug wires for proper firing order or possible cross fire 
condition?
It was running OK before the tune-up?
Be sure to cover the basics before you remove the engine.
Sorry if I've covered old ground here but it should be checked twice and once 
more by a friend.
Rusty
