Subject: Fw: [T2] rear hatch seal

You can also install the rear hatch and sliding door seals without any
adhesive(gasp!).  I did and they stay in place very nicely thanks, plus
which I avoided the dreaded cement all over the place except where it's
supposed to be nightmare I usually suffer from when installing things like
that.

< While the profile is not identical to the circa-1971 VW/Germany seal, it
will seal acceptably, and in fact is the same seal that VW has used for the
last 20 years on their own Brazilian/Mexican made Kombi's. Line the corners
and latch area up first and work your way around from there. You can use
weatherstrip adhesive, available at any auto parts store. Rubber cement will
also work.>
