Subject: Fw: [T2] locking gas cap for 1969 Single Cab?

I bought the Autozone locking gas cap for my 70. I wish I hadn't because it
is bogus and doesn't even begin to fit. It is made for something entirely
different. The giant gas filler hole on my 70 is twice the size the locking
lugs of the cap are. I confirmed #5763 on their website and in the store is
the correct number. Save your effort. Now I have to hold onto it for weeks
till the next time I go to the USA.

Its surprising that the locking cap is the cheapest. Here's the detail
