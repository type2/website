Subject: driving w/leaky push rod seals?

>I have a trip that I need to make on tuesday evening (20 miles or so) and

wondering if there were any problems with driving the westy

Hey Buddy 20 miles is nothing.  I once drove fromo Canada all the way to
Central America and back with a bus that leaked and smoked oil more than
anything I've ever seen.

Personally I doubt you'd even use 1/2 a bottle or less in that short
distance.  Keep it mind when the engine is hot it will not show a full
reading of oil anyways.  I'd say unless you literally get puddles under
your car then I'd just leave it topped off and relax.

Also an oil light helps to know when it's low.  But don't worry, make the
trip, relax and enjoy yourself.  It should be nothing to stress about.

- Shawn.
