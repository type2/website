Subject: Buses at Hookahville Aug 29-31

Hey Y'all,
Anyone besides me bussin it to the "Hookahville" Music
Festival near Columbus, Ohio on September 29-31? 
Bands include: Ekoostic Hookah (a regional favorite
jam band), Dark Star Orchestra (this Dead tribute band
sounds so much like the Grateful Dead that it is
spooky), George Parliament and the P-Funk All Stars,
and a few others.
I'd love to hook up with some other Bus folks to camp
with while there so as to avoid the knuckle-head
neighbor syndrome.
Here's the web page:

Let me know who's going and I'll set up a meeting place.
