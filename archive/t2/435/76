Subject: Stripped screw head

One little 11mm nut that holds the valve rockers on just goes round and 
round, doesn't tighten. You know the one? There are four of them under the valve 
cover. I was replacing the valve guide tube gaskets and now I have this new 
problem. 

Do I have to replace the bolt or the whole head thingie? Is there a something 
that will recut the threads? I switched nuts around so I know it is not that.
