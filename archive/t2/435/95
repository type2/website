I was just in the Keys in June and I sure wish I had my bus. We stayed at a
cabin in Marathon but spent most of our time at Bahia Honda State Park. That
place is amazing. You can camp for about $25/night. There is enough breeze
that camping would be quite comfy in the bus. Not too hot and not too cold.

Bus camping is like a step above car camping and a step below 'RV Parking'.
Like in car camping, you still have a campsite to setup and you have to get
creative if you want creature comforts. But like RV camping, you get to sleep
inside the bus, which is a real benefit in inclimate weather.

Why not compromise on the first trip out: spend two or three days at Bahia
Honda (or one of the other parks) in the bus and spend two or three days at a
hotel in Key West. In order to really enjoy Key West, you really need to be
within walking or taxi distance.

And there are alot of buses in the Keys. Flat land and very little temperature
variation - much less than the mainland.

P.S. An FMBC campout at Bahia Honda would be amazing. I couldn't even begin to
organize it, but I would definitely go!
