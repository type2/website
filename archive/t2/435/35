Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] locking gas cap for 1969 Single Cab?

I bought one for my VW Thing off of ebay for 10$ because it said bus/bug on
the description and not Thing and i know it fits a 68-71 bus but not sure
about the single cabs.  it is polished aluminum on the outside part that
spins and is a stock part.  Most all the VW thing dealers, thing shop,
things unlimited, etc, sell them new but they are not cheap.

> 70 is way different than a 77. You have a threaded cap, no? 70 is way
bigger, and cams into place with 3 tabs.

I didn't know that they were different.  No threaded cap on G, just a hole
with two notches to catch the tabs on the OEM cap.

The locking one that we picked up from AZ is made by MotoRad.  It's has
four
tabs, two to keep the cap from rotating, and two to lock it in place.  It's
outer circumference is large enough to fill up the entire gas cap
depression
in the body.--
