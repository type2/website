probably so.  stock is usually best. you might also consider contacting
your insurance company & asking them about non-standard equipment & how
it might affect your coverage in an accident.

www.tirerack.com has 2 tires available in the stock size & load rating:
-Michelin Agilis
-Yokohama Y356
-Bridgestone 603V

someone suggested consulting the type2 library for tire information.
that is great advice.

good luck,
