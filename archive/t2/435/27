Rather than waving a can of combustible gas around in a running engine I'd
rather pressurize the system and swab/spray soapy water on all places where
leaks might occur.  Safer, and your engine comes out cleaner!  One thing you
didn't mention checking was the fuel injector seals.  If those check out
fine then I'd tend to dismiss a vacuum leak since we'd most likely be
talking about a fairly small one at this point, which probably would tend to
*raise* hot idle.

If you're saying that the engine runs strong when hot and it's only the idle
that's causing problems when the engine's hot, any chance that a simple idle
adjustment - engine fully hot - would be all you'd need?  One suspect here
that leaps to mind is the AFM.  Over time, as the internal spring weakens,
the AFM starts to run richer and richer.  It's not all that noticeable on a
cold engine since a cold engine needs to run richer anyway, and the aux air
valve is open providing a "foot on the gas" effect.  On a hot engine however
the extra richness can cause the engine to suffer and it's probably most
noticeable at idle.
