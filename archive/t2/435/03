Subject: Re: [T2] driving w/leaky push rod seals?

just my experience you might want to change them...
i dont know how bad they are but i do know that they can get bad enough where you will blow more oil than you can keep in it..

there again like i say i dont know how bad yours are leaking either...


if you go you might want to stock up on the oil..
20 miles up the road isnt that bad but ther again depends onthe seals condition...

nasty mess also..

i know someone once that put 12 quarts of oil in the bus from leaking seals for a 45 minute ride home.. stopping every few minutes to add oil..
didnt know what was wrong with his bus which is now mine but except that it had leaky seals...
we replaced them and the leak stopped..(only after getting home with it though)
12 quarts though in 45 minutes wow thats blowing some oil..
and smoke yes looked like cheech and chongs comeing down the road.. smoke boiling out the rear of the bus... LOL...

people blowing the horns and flashing lghts and such...

anyways like i say yours might not be that bad.. 
peace <grins>
