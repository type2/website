Yes.  Funny things happen to handling when you run tires of different
flexibilities on the front and rear.  You end up with really vague
directional stability and wandering.

Also, when considering fatter-than-stock tires on an early (72 or earlier)
bus, remember that the worm-and-peg steering box on the early bays is
relatively weak and can't handle the extra stress.  It was fine for narrow
bia-ply tires, but shortly after VW went to radials they also had to
switch to the stronger worm-and-roller box.  I wouldn't go larger than
185R14 tires on an early bay.
