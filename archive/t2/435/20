And if money's no object, then one could get some LN Engineering
"Nickies" http://www.lnengineering.com/nickies.html . One could probably
pull quite a sizeable trailer without risk of overheating with that set

competitive alternate to the type II and type IV rebuild that could
offer benefits over the standard practice.

And if you are really adventurous there is a great 3.1 liter conversion
using the Corvair engine with Type IV 2.0 pistons and jugs.
