create a mold and then cast me one out of solid gold.  Would be nice to
locate a hot wheels or matchbox bay window someday though that is actually
affordable.

I'll keep my eyes open for (VWoA-approved) opportunities...

BTW, I do do resin casts in "gold", "silver", bronze, copper & gunmetal
metalizer coatings, but the resin that I use is suitable for electroplating,
too.

The only bus-related casts that I've done were some N-scale model
railroading test (not for sale) casts of a splittie and a single cab.
They're about 1" (2.54cm) long.  The originals were injection molded, so I
had to remove the chassises and fill the bodies with clay and rework the
windows.  I'd planned on adding the wheels separately.

I also used one of the splitties as a start for the cockpit on a rocket
prototype for a table top game (about 5" long).

The unfortunate thing is that, had I permission from VWoA to reproduce these
little darlings, I have folk lines up to buy them.

On the bright side, I've sold 4 of the generic van key fobs. :O)
