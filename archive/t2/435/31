Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] locking gas cap for 1969 Single Cab?

I don't know, I don't think so. But, I only have my bus to look at. I did
buy a new normal cap last winter and it fits, so I can assume that it is the
normal size for a 70.  Autozone has it wrong.

is the hole a different size than the standard 70 bus?
