I just had this experience with my wife and I just told her that she should
try it once and if she didn't like it that I wouldn't ask her to go camping
in the bus again.  It took some discussing and telling her that we have to
share some common hobbies, but finally she agreed and said that camping in
the bus wasn't nearly as bad as she thought it would be.
