Subject: RE: [T2] Tire Size Question

What exactly is the wheel dimensions, 14x7? Or are they 14x6?

Would it be a BAD idea to put 215s in the rear? And 205s in the front?

My Fiero has 235/60/15s in the rear, and 215/60/15s in the front and it
drives pretty good, would the same idea not apply to the Bus?



Thanks!!!!

the biggest thing that I have found that will fit a stock rim and fit in
the stock wheelwell of a bay bus is 205R70-14   some folks say they can
get 215's in there but any I've tried rubbed on turning.
