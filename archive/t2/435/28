Subject: can't get tranny into reverse

I have a 1977 bus that I rarely use.  Recently, when I moved it from  one house to another, I found that I could not get the van into reverse

First things first, let's give the man something he can use. Shift rod adjustment per the bentley manual.

level ground, shift into second.

loosen (2) 13mm bolts on floor

align lower end of shift lever (below the bend) to be perfectly perpendicular to the floor (90 degree angle)

push the reverse-stop plate (has a small tang that sticks out on the driver side of the plate you unbolted the 13mm bolts at all the way to the right(?)(verify in archives or bentley) so that it is up against the shift lever.

that adjustment right there determines your reverse capability. sliding the plate forward or backward adjusts your 1/3 or 2/4 ease of shifting.

Got Bentley?
