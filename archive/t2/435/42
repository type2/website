You can use any bug motor but the easiest ones will have the 3 mounting
holes with threads in them so you can
just bolt on your rear engine carrier. If not, you can still use any
1300-1600cc upright bug motor, but you'll need
to buy the rear carrier adaptor plate and use the oil pump cover plate stud
holes for double duty -  to hold in the engine and keep oil in the engine.
These studs weren't designed for that and even if done carefully you'll leak
a little oil. Don't use the 1200cc motor with an adaptor plate - the 6mm oil
pump studs will not hold and the results aren't pretty. If you use a super
beetle motor you'll want to bring the alternator, wiring and regulator over
from the beetle to the bus, and the electric fuel pump. You could probably
bring the whole fuel injection system over from the bug, but I wonder if
they programmed the ECU differently for the bug so that it's incompatable? I
wonder if anyone has tried that?
