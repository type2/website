Thanks George!

And for all of you who need a name to go with the explanation, all of the 
powder coating folks call it the 

Farady cage effect

Lots of discussion several months ago on this one...mostly about getting 
powder coating to stick in the deep curves of older vw wheels.

Anyone ever watch the good movie called "Enemy of the State"...shows a 
Faraday cage used for different purposes...Movie might be a little scary 
if you are into conspiracy theories....LOL

Cheers, dave
