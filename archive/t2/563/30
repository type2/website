Subject: Source for cylinder shims

I am looking for a source for cylinder base shims (spacers).  These are 
the shims that go between the base of the cylinder and the engine case. 
  Bus Depot lists only thicknesses of .010", .020", .030", .040", .060", 
and .090".  By my calculations, I would need about .070" to get the 
compression ratio that I want (7.0)

Can anyone recommend another source for these shim/spacers?

Thanks

Tim
