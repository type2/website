Subject: Desperately needing alignment '70 bus

Hi Folks,
     Over the weekend I replaced rear torsion bars/bushings/bearings. As a
result, of course the alignment is off on the rear end of the bus. In
the past I've taken the bus to NTB to have the alignment done. Now
with their new nifty  alignment machine, they say they can't adjust
the rear. I show them the Bentley and they stand around and shake
their heads. Two shops have told me that it can't even be
adjusted--which we know to be incorrect.
     So here I am in Chattanooga, Tennessee. I've called five shops and
cannot find anybody who can align this beast. It's a '70 standard
bus.
     Does anybody know of any chain store that can do this job? Or any
shops here in Chattanooga? The rear end is horribly out. It feels
like the rear end is going to wash out from underneath me when I go
around any corners.
     Please help me find a place to do this! Thanks ever so much.

John Tracy
