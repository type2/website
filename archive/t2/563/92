I have a Blaupunkt Las Vegas model CD player in my 77.

We put the wire to the fusebox to the taillight fuse (#11 I think), and mine
has an inline fuse. We just used the inline fuse holder from the previous
stereo.
The bolt and nut on the back are for a support bar, if you use one. I had
one existing with the previous stereo. The deck should have come with some
sort of sleeve that will attempt to keep it from sliding back and forth.

Hope this helps
