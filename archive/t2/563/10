couple of corrections for that ad:

1. That first thing isn't an intake boot, it's an offset tube to allow 
the heater blower fan tube on the right side clear the air cleaner.  It 
connects to the right heat exchanger through a hole in the tin.

2. I think the intake boot is the same for all FI models, 75-79, not 
just 78-79.
