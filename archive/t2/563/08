Subject: Caps for the heater outlets on the fan box

Since there's a chance I'll be replacing the heat exchangers with straight 
pipes (will find out tomorrow how much it will cost), I assume I'll be 
needing to cap the ports on the fan box.

Is there a manufactured part out there for that? Otherwise, I'll have to fab 
something up with sheet aluminum...

Thanks!
