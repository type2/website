Subject: Auto Trans question / and Rust

I'm new to the list, currently looking for a bus between 1977-1979.

I have two questions.

1.) How available are the automatic transmissions to fit these
models/years? If I get a manual transmission, and
want to convert it, will I be able to find an automatic trans and about
how much will it cost me ?

2.) This may be an old thread for list members, but maybe someone can
give me the "master list" of usual rust spots on these models (77-79) so
I can be prepared when looking at the vehicles.


Thanks !
