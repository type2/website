Subject: "Stuttering" under load?

Well, I got to drive my bus to work yesterday after getting the exhaust done.
Woot!!! Tried to do a steady 65 on the freeway, but the silly bus kept wanting
to go 70! heh After driving my v6 Fiero for so long, it just seemed natural to
let it have it's head. =D

But at partial throttle, low-ish rpm's, under load, any gear except 1st, it
stutters. Kinda like I popped the clutch, but it keeps doing it... Doesn't go
away. And I didn't pop the clutch. Like the engine's bouncing on the
transmission.  This is new.

I've got a crappy little 99c plastic fuel filter (like you see on bugs all the
time) in there now. I finally chased down a larger metal can filter that I'm
going to put in tonight (I hope - Just got a root canal yesterday. Still
hurts.) Is it possible this is the problem? Anything else I should be looking
for?

Thanks!
