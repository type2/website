Subject: Steal Your Face Sticker

Hi Volks,

Last week I had a guy who makes custom die-cut stickers whip me up a nice
big Steal Your Face symbol with the VW logo in the top.  It came out really
nice and I thought that some of you guys might like to get your hands on one
too.  Here is a shot of mine on the back of my '85 Westy:
http://www.geocities.com/vwcamper72/stealyourfacesticker.  He says he can do
different colours and sizes to fit peoples needs.  His name is Michael and
you can email him at MCSD47(-at-)aol.com for more info.  Mine is in "etched
glass" vinyl and it is about 8" wide and 10" tall.  It set me back $10.00 +
shipping.

Happy Camping.
