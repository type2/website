Auto transmissions are not uncommon. Converting a standard bus to an 
auto tranny is a very complicated task which would require extensive 
modification of the vehicle. In essense, you would need an entire donor 
bus to work with.  If what you want is an auto transmission it's best 
to find an auto-tranny bus to start with.

Under the windsheild, under the floorboards, and the vent-wing windows. 
The rockers and dog-legs are common as well. None of those are as hard 
to deal with as rust in the sliding door track or front suspension 
beam. There is more info on rust detection and treatment in the library 
at www.type2.com.
