Well,

Looking at the window sticker for the 1981 ASI Weekender I have for 
sale, it says:

1981 VANAGON
120 CDI ENGINE
4 CYLINDER, FUEL INJECTION
AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION
CATALYST EQUIPPED

ESTIMATED MPG
16

And for the follow up question:

$11,830 + the cost of the ASI conversion and it was originally sold by 
Riveria Motors.
