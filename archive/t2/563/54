Thanks everybody for all of your help with all of my questions about my bus.
I've appreciated it.  I'm going to take a couple of months off of the list due
to the fact that I'm going to Cameroon, West Africa next week.  I'm a youth
pastor and taking 12 senior high teens along with me to put a roof on a youth
center that will be used for a number of activities, most importantly,
HIV/AIDS counseling/crisis center/orphan refuge.  It's one of the first times,
ever, that a group of only American teenagers will be serving in Cameroon.
Been there twice before, lots of busses in Cameroon.  I'll snap some photos
and send a few around when we get home in early July.

Thanks,

Paul
