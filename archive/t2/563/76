Subject: compression ratios?

Can someone check my calculations?

Situation:
Stock '79 Westy,

Stock 2.0L engine.  Brand new AMC heads/valves.  Using a buret, I 
accurately measured head volume at 57.5cc.  Using a depth gauge and 
micrometer, I measured/calculated compressed volume inside cylinder 
(not head) at 28.06cc.  Not knowing the volume of the piston dish, I 
calculated the volume of the dish to be 15.58cc from diameter and depth 
(6mm) measurements. (Does anyone know the quoted volume for the piston 
dish? )  I measured the stroke to be 70.75 mm.  I measured the bore to 
be 93.97 mm.  I measured the shim at the base of the cylinder to be 
1.14mm.  NO HEAD GASKET/SHIM.  From my calculations, I get the 
following values:
Cylinder and head uncompressed volume (total volume):  576.24cc
Cylinder and head compressed volume:  85.56cc
Compression ratio: 6.73 : 1

This CR seems a little low to me.  Would this be adequate for a stock 
bus?   Do I need to flycut the heads?

All advice is welcome.
