Try the alignment shop on the corner of Signal Mountain Blvd and Dayton Blvd. Cherokee Alignment?

Now it's been 15 years since Chattanooga was home (though we visit at least once or twice a month), so I may have my street names mixed up. Sign Mtn. Blvd is the one that runs in front of Komatsu, Mill and Mine Tools (I LOVE THAT STORE), and Baylor Private School. 

They are an old school shop and I'll bet they have the right tools. 

I deal with a shop like that here in Cookeville with much success. It helps too if the mechanics have been then about 100 years and not a Johnny-Come-Lately like at alot of the FLAPS. Have you contacted Scenic City VW's (the club down there?). 

Good luck! 

Chris
