Subject: dansk heater boxes, rant

I have never been as frustrating and disappointed with an aftermarket part
as I am with the Dansk heater box on the right side of my 74 Westy. 

I have the engine out and am refurbing lots of stuff, and obtained an NOS
74 left box from Ron at the Bus Depot. It fit perfecftly, nice seal at the
flapper end of the fan shroud, etc. 

The right side is a Dansk repro - I was unable to find an NOS right one.
It absolutely blows chunks. I am stunned that a 300 dollar part fits so
poorly. Misalignment at the exhaust ports on the heads, misalignment of
the flange for the stovepipe that goes up through the tin, misalignment of
the tin screw positions for the underside tin coverpiece, and an
absolutely BRUTAL fit at the fan shroud - no possibility of a tight seal
whatsoever (and yes, I am using the factory seals for those flapper ends).
It seems like the lip is about 2-3mm too shallow, preventing the flapper
cover box from snugging the seal down on the top of that heater box
channel to get a good fit. I had to resort to bending, hammering, hi-temp
silicone to make the seal at the fan shroud and stovepipe, etc.,etc. 

ARRRRGH!!!! 

I HATE hack job crap like this! 

Rant over, for now.
