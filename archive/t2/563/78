That's in the ballpark of heads I've measured.

Not sure is that figure was taken with or without the 1.14mm shim.  But,
assuming it was figured with the shim in place, that seems awfully large.
That works out to a deck height of about .160", which is way larger than
anything I've encounterd.

I've heard various figures in the 14cc - 15cc range.  I've must admit I've
never accurately measured an actual dish, though I should have, but have
used 15cc in my various calcs.

I must admit I've always used the "stock" figures for bore and stroke
because I have no way to accurately measure stroke.

That deck height just seems too large.
