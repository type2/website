Subject: TRIP REPORT: Sequoia National Park

Lists,

This trip report is largely inspired by Claras (VB) recent documentation of her trip to the bay area, and the great photos of her 63(?) making the trip.  Seeing those, missing a lot of the early season get togethers because of mechanical problems, and hearing list complaints about lack of true bus-driving really made me want to pull this one off.

Last weekend we took our 65 standard to Sequoia National Park in Tulare County, CA to visit Crystal Cave.  Beth and I and our boys followed our friends from Riverside in their rental car the 60 miles and 6000 ft. of elevation change to the middle of the park, where we then took a pretty beat up paved trek of about 10 more miles, losing elevation down to the caves.

We take the 198 out of Visalia thru foothill towns like Lemon Cove, past Kaweah Lake, a manmade reservoir of the Kaweah drainage, and through the quickly commercializing town of Three Rivers at around 1500ft.  The entrance to the park is around 2000 just outside of Three Rivers.

Its mostly a second-gear affair in the park, with a few stretches of third-gear pleasure just to hear the engine slow down a little.  Likewise, coming down hill, the second gear in my new transmission from type2parts.com held a perfect downhill pace with little need of brake riding.

Prior to the trip, I adjusted some mechanicals:

Brakeshoes: adjusted my brake shoes all the way around and found that I had not been getting them close enough to the drums.  What a difference!

Brake fluid: installed new rubber hoses, front wheel cylinders and master cylinder a few weeks back.  My reservoir is staying full, but it looks filthy already.  I did flush the system.  Maybe the new fluid just freed everything up.

Shift system: finally able to enjoy the new tranny after endless gear shift futzing.
Lost one of the rear coupler screws days before the trip, and found another spare old style one without the hole for a safety wire.  Took it over to my friends drill press and made a hole and safety wired it.

Engine:  This unknown 1600SP handled well.  After replacing plugs, wires, cap, rotor, condenser and points recently, all I did was set the timing again, check oil (1/2 pint down), air up the tires and roll.  I have adjusted my valves at least two times in the last 2000 miles, and they are never more than .001 off, usually loose.

Lighting:  suddently lost driver side head and tail lights.  Sounds like the 9-pin unit to me, what else could cause front/rear loss on one side?  Switch?

After the caves, which cannot be understated, we cruised up to the sequoia grove known as the Giant Forest where the largest living thing on earth, General Sherman, lives.  Set up a little campsite in the parking lot and my friend Jason grilled some Ahi and made us all fish tacos and wine for a snack.  Nice to have to put on jackets at the beginning of summer in the Valley.

All in all, the best trip in my 65 yet, after almost one year of ownership of my first split window.  The trip to the Sequoias for me is always the pass/fail for a bus.  If I make it up and down with my family and feel comfortable behind the wheel all the time, I know the bus is running well and reliable.  Now I am even considering taking the summer vacation to visit relatives/friends in LA/SD in the bus.  I will need to map out some side routes and the AIRS list though.

Thanks for listening all. 

Billy
