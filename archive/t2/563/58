Subject: Vacuum booster noise?

I have a new noise, when I step on the brakes I hear a loud 'pop' under my feet.  It sounds like a solenoid valve in a dishwasher.  It happens only when I first depress the brake pedal.  If i repeatedly depress the pedal it doesn't make the sound.  so it happens only when their is vacuum built up. Is their a check valve on the intake side of the brake booster or something like that?  I have not fully investigated with the belly pan off yet.  Thought maybe someone else hears the same type of noise.
 
Thanks, Paul
