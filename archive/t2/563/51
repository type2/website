I have the Vancos on my 80 Westy, and am very happy with them after 
several hundred miles.  They are $64 from Tire Rack (noticed that they 
are low stock now so they must be selling).  Without any other 
suspension work they cut down on sway/lean a lot.  They are very heavy 
tires however, may be twice as heavy as a near new load range A tires 
from the PO that I replaced.  Due to their load rating, ~1800lbs (-at-)54 lbs 
pressure, I can use much lower pressure in them and get a comfortable 
ride too.  They are being made in the Czech Republic according to the 
sidewalls.
