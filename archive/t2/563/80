Subject: other Bosch fuel injectors

I think you are not thinking this all the way thru, 

Bosch injectors (well all injectors ) are sized for the motor,

so much flow per hour , or injection cycle

so getting one from another car that is not  the same part number is asking 
for trouble....

unless you have a way to calibrate the FI computer to those injectors.....
