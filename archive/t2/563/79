list,

usually my policy is to speak on the list only if i have something
constructive to add to a discussion, but in this case i have to make an
exception.

the post quoted above is tasteless, self-serving and stupid. james should be
ashamed of himself for wasting his time and obvious intellect on drivel of
this sort.

never mind that jake raby may not post here again, that is a shame in my
opinion, but it gets worse. what about the simple inhumanity of james'
comments? the situation that occurred with jake's customer danny must have
been a complete nightmare for jake, his associates, to say nothing of
danny's family. anyone who followed what happened will understand what i am
talking about. it unacceptable for james to bring it into the discussion
here for any reason, and it is simply beyond the pale for james to poke fun
of someone committing suicide. the thing is, james' syntax is so obtuse that
most people probably either skipped over his post by force of habit, or just
plain didn't get it. i am appauled, quite frankly, and the post left me
speechless, until now.
