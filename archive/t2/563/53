Subject: Wanted - Dormobile Table Track

I am looking for some of the aluminium channel that Dormobiles use to
support the table. The stuff that is screwed to the units.

No vendor carries it, no autojumble stall at a VW event has it, except as
part of a complete interior. Dormobile have a duff website and don't supply
the stuff from their stand. No junkyard I know of locally has Type 2's in
and those that I have seen don't normally have an interior.

My plan is to allow the table to run the full length of the van, hence I
want to extend the track I have with another piece.

I'm happy to pay a reasonable amount (or trade) for this and even though
I'm in the UK, shipping from the other side of the planet will be
considered.

If this sounds desperate, it is. Three years looking for the stuff make you
like this :-)

Thanks
