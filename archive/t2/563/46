Subject: Re: [T2] 35 prong plug for ECU? Doesn't match Muir's on Pg. 141

All T-II fi systems have the 35 pin interface. The 25 pin system on page 
141 is for the ManifoldPressureControl (MPC) T-III system. Different 
animal. See page 164 in Muir for the AirFlowControl T-II info. Note Muir 
gives no wiring or ECU connector info or diagram. All the T-II have the pin 
numbers molded into the connector, and the wire numbers molded into the 
insulation near the harness terminals. Get the Bentley. It puts Muir to 
shame with regard to facts about your machine and will save you nothing but 
time/money far in excess of it's cost.
