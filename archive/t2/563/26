Hello Guys  I will be in the swap area as always.  Is there anything that 
anybody would like for me to bring ?? otherwise I will pack a little of 
everything   I'll be in the 59 grey panel with a red roof rack probably will be flying 
the USA flag on one side and the Virginia and confederate battle flag on the 
other side. Come by and say Hi  later and have fun  mark Dearing
