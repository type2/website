Hi Barry,

This sounds like a word to describe a D*mn Previous Owner.  Rather than 
saying "The DPO ripped out all the FI and replaced with a Weber 
Progressive...."  You could say, "My '79 2.0 has an IATROGENIC single-carb 
induction system."  It'll make the guys scratch their heads down at the 
speed shop!

Or, engines that are chromed could be said to have been iatrogenically 
enhanced.

Fun with words!  Thanks!
