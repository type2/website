If what you mean by 'catch' is that it won't turn over at all, I'ld look 
to the battery first.  When the temperature is higher, a weak battery 
will have more power.  Put a charger on it overnight.  If it starts 
easily in the morning like it does in the afternoon - go for a new 
battery.  Not many of the other problems associated with not starting go 
away with temperature, but if the battery is not old be sure to also 
check out the cables, alternator, etc.
