A fuel pressure gauge is a necessary tool when diagnosing FI problems.

You're right, the regulator is not adjustable.  If you do have pressure 
problems, then you either need to replace the regulator, replace your 
fuel pump, replace your fuel lines, or replace your fuel filter.

Take the air filter off, and with the ignition key on, open the flap in 
the AFM with a screwdriver.  The pump should come on, and should make a 
nice whirring sound.  If it is noisy, grinding, or struggling in any 
way, then you could have a clogged tank / line / filter, or your pump 
could be bad.

You can determine if fuel is coming out of the injectors by removing an 
injector, placing a rag beneath it, and cranking the engine, looking 
for a good spray pattern from the injector.  Make sure you have the 
coil disconnected from the distributor when you do this.

Do you have the Bentley manual?  There is a procedure there for 
diagnosing the entire FI system.  All you need is the fuel pressure 
gauge, a test light (optional - I find this useful), and a VOM, plus 
basic tools which you already have if you own a bus :-)

There is also a good article on the L-Jet FI in the type2 library:

...and scroll down to the bottom of the page.

The procedure is quite simple, and I've found the L-Jet FI to be very 
easy to work on.  I was new to FI, too (my previous VW experience was a 
72 Super Beetle), but it was quite easy to wrap my head around L-Jet, 
and now I think it's easier to work on than carburetors.
