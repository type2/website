Subject: FI Reversion update, Day II

Hi Volks,

Day II of the FI install on the Westfakia has been slow but steady.

The BIG "annoyance du jour" for today was the discovery that the plenum 
would not fit between the intake runners. Strange. Some careful 
measurement and the judicious employment of my trusty angle-grinder 
soon made things fit much better. Then it was discovered that the 
runners didn't quite line up with the plenum ports. But after some 
persuasion I was able to get them to fit properly. I also discovered 
that I have a Jetta fuel pump, rather than a bus pump. That will get 
swapped out tomorrow. These are the joys of piecing together a system 
from a parts pile rather than obtaining a complete system from a donor 
vehicle.

So far I have the following FI components installed:

Thermo Time Switch
Aux Air Regulator
Air Distribution plenum and throttle body, with plugged off EGR port.
Intake runners
Head Temp sensor II
S-Hose
3-4 side injectors and fuel rail.

The 1-2 side injectors are ready to go on, but a thunderstorm started, 
dinner time came up, and my back is getting sore. And the Sopranos are 
on tonight...

I put a few pics online, you can have a look here to see how it's going 
so far. The red and white color scheme I have going in the engine 
compartment is looking pretty good.

Tomorrow I'll get the vacuum lines done, and if I have time I will get 
the engine bolted back up to the tranny. Thank goodness for Civic 
holidays.

Happy trails,
