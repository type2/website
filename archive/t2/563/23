Subject: Manassas Bug Out Sunday

Hi.  I hope to attend the Manassas bug out this Sunday and show off the 
new-to-me '76 Safare hightop I brought home last night.

Thanks to H Steven Dolan and his work on the fuel system, I was able to get 
it running on all four, and cruising at a comfortable 60 mph.

The '76 Safare was inside stored for the past 15 years. and I am going to 
give it a Brillo bath tonight, when I get home.  Ten pads of Brillo. That 
should cover it.

I have to do the fiberglass high top and all the painted areas and all the 
glass (inside and out, as much as practical) and all the rubber window 
seals, and the tires (opps, no not the tires.  They are already replaced...) 
and the bumpers (I went over the front bumper with phosphoric acid, and that 
cured the rust speckled look. ) and any remaining chrome.  And a lot of the 
inside, too.

First step is Brillo, second is rubbing compound and polish / glaze.  The 
finish may be a bit dull, but IT WILL be clean!!!

If you are attending the show, please stop by and say 'hi!'.  Maybe I will 
have some cold H2O to share.
