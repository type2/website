Subject: Powder Coat Fuel Tank

I was reading Richard's DIY Fuel Tank Restoration
http://homepage.mac.com/ratwell/FuelTankRestoration.html and had a thought.
Is there any reason you couldn't powder coat the inside of a fuel tank?  My
understanding is powder coating is extremely resistant to solvents.
Seems like you could drop the tank off at the radiator shop for a good
cleaning, take it to the powder coater and be done.
I guess the two major considerations are:
Could you get adequate spray coverage from the available openings?
Will it hold up?
I'll probably do a little research with my powder coating sources but was just
wondering if anyone knew this off the top of their head.
Thanks,
Mike
