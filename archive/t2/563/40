Hi Meg,
     This is certainly a difficult question--as one can go crazy with 
maintenance, just as much as they do with lack thereof. It's hard to 
believe, but sometimes the old adage, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it 
painfully applies."
      Do you have one of the original owner's manuals for your bus? If 
so, it will list several maintenance items that are done every XXXX 
miles. You could start with the ones that are at the shortest intervals. 
For example, do you know about greasing the front axle beam twice a year 
or lubricating all of the door locks and sliding door mechanism? Also, 
do you dip your keys in graphite occasionally and add extra lubrication 
to your lock cylinders? These small maintenance items can often prevent 
huge headaches in the future. The owner's manual will outline all of these.

Just my thoughts...
