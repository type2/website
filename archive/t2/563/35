understanding is powder coating is extremely resistant to solvents.
Seems like you could drop the tank off at the radiator shop for a good
cleaning, take it to the powder coater and be done.
I guess the two major considerations are:
Could you get adequate spray coverage from the available openings?
Will it hold up?
I'll probably do a little research with my powder coating sources but was just
wondering if anyone knew this off the top of their head.
