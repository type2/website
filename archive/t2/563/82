I'm a curious about another point related to this issue.

How does the above mentioned ration of compression volumes relate to
the compression values you get using a compression gauge?

One is volume the other is pressure, right?

The compression ratio would have more to do with how much room
fuel/air have to expand on ignition, right?

The value you get from the compression gauge tells you (vaguely) 
the condition of your rings and valve seats, right?
