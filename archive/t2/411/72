Subject: Northwest US bus festivals, por favor

I'm just about to head out across the Louisiana Purchase and was wondering 
who i could talk to about any bus festivals in the northwest region:  Oregon, 
Washington, Idaho, Montana, Alberta, British Columbia or northern 
california...even wyoming.  Any festivals going on in july or august - - let me know.
