Subject: Fuel injectors made by GP-Sorensen?

Just got back from the FLAP. Asked if they had fuel injectors for my 75 
bus. Suprize, They said yes. Manufactured new by GP-Sorensen. $37.99 
each. My eyes nearly popped out of their sockets! After seeing Bosch 
injectors for as much as $80.00 to as low as $55.00. Big price 
difference. The tip of the injector looks a little different than the 
Bosch original.

Has anyone ever tried these? Are they any good or just a cheap imitation 
of quality? I think these were what I put in my Chevy throttle body 
injection with no problems. But I wasn't near as fussy with that old 
beater American Iron.
