Subject: RE: [T2] Mexico VWs?

I drove a water cooled Bus on my last trip, 2 month ago, i think the 
engine was a 1.6 Rabbit engine, or something like that. Power was NOT 
great at all. The Bus had about 50000km (30k miles)and was leaking like 
hell, dificult to start when hot and backfire was a standard issue (from 
the Mexican nice folks words who gave me a lift when my Bus was broke)

Why would you buy a Mexican "beaten" (they drive those bus's like it was 
a chevy V8) 5 year old transporter (they don't have Westy) Bus (made who 
know's where) whit all the import troubble when you guys can have great 
rust free 70' bus down there???? (USA)

When i came back in the US after my 35 days journey into Mexico/Baha, i 
had to wait 2.5 hours at the border (cultural shock), they DID check all 
paper and condition of the Bus, the US custom lady was quit aware about 
VW's and old car/van. She ask me what year was my Bus! a 30 years old 
Bus show's it's age, even when it's fully rebuild. Also, i didn't have 
that sqare rad in front. BUT, there is plenty of older rust free older 
bus over there, i bought many small parts from scrap yard, I even took 
parts from bus's just standing beside the road, for FREE! I came back 
with a door on my roof, she ask about it and i told her i found it on an 
old wreck, she said, OK!

As i had heavy engine trouble(NO idle) so she was nice enough to let me 
go without further questions...

Cheers, Ben
