Subject: 71 Hightop westy HELP

   Just got a call from Stewert Anderson in North Carolina. He is on his way
home to Texas and lost 2nd gear in his bus. He wants to sell the bus (71
highroof camper) and just get home. He wanted 3 thousand but I said with the
blown trans it's probally worth 1000 or so. If anybody can help him or is
interested in buying his bus his cell number is 817 658 8205
