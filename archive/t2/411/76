I found fabric very much like the "green gingham" on the top row and used it to make curtains for my Fauxwesty -- they really look sharp and they 
"feel" like original style curtains even though they're not even close.

It's not very complicated to make your own using "stitch witchery" (iron-on tape for seams).  Haunt the clearance bins at the fabric store.  I made very 
OG-looking curtain rods out of flat aluminum stock from the hardware store - you can bend it into position by hand.
