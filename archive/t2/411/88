Just to make sure we're communicating properly: you're saying that the
starter spins, the engine turns over, but the engine won't start?

There are 2 "spade" connectors on the solenoid.  There's a stout "free
floating" red and black wire to one and a blue wire (that goes into a
harness bundle) on the other.  Then there are 3 wires that connect to a bolt
on the solenoid with a nut holding them in place.  I believe that second
wire (blue, or maybe blue/brown?) actually connects to the combi relay;
without that wire attached, the van certainly won't start.
