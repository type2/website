I owned two different fibreglas bodied VW conversions, the one that was
on an essentially stock chassis was given a new VIN, the one that I built
a sq tube frame for used the original VW VIN, I have no idea why it was
one or the other, they could never explain it to me... the new VIN was on
a plate I had to epoxy to the chassis.

HOWEVER in Maryland to get one of these on the road took a very strict
inspection by a special officer of the MD State Police, the inspection
took a full two days, the vehicle was up on a lift and all the welds were
inspected, all of the systems of the vehicle were checked and double
checked... very nerve wracking to have to trailer my new vehicle to the
inspection pit and then sit there silently for two days while these guys
went over the thing looking at things I hadn't looked at.  fortunately I
must have did something right because they gave me the titles and clean
bill of health and allowed it with only very minor changes on the road.

every state is different and as always YMMV
