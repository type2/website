of them) try to get the original title, and swap all the identification

stuff I can from the old Bus, to the new Bus.

First off, this is a federal offense with the same fine and maybe a little
time for a Bus or a Porsche...This is in addition to the various fines for
a vehicle that doesn't have the DOT, NHTSA, or EPA certification...
I'd also tend to think that if you have a serious accident with the neo-
vinned Bus, and it comes under inspection by an insurance adjuster,
the insurance won't cover you...IIRC, most insurance policies don't
cover the vehicle while in the commission of a crime...
