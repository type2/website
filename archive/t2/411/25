steve,

the jetting will always be an issue. be prepared to purchase and change
jets, don't expect them to run perfectly out of the box. atmospheric
conditions, altitude and engine state of tune are major factors in the jets
you need to run, and the vendor of the carb set has no way of knowing these
details. luckily jets are cheap. when you are buying jets, get more sizes
than you think you need. they will likely have to come from CB performance
or dellorto.com, these two suppliers are both far away from, and it is
frustrating to not be able to go 'round the corner to get what you need. you
might also consider getting a set of jet reamers, then you can purchase
fewer jets and just open them up to the sizes you need.

you may want to get a copy of the des hammill book "how to build and
powertune weber and dellorto carburetors". this has little info on FRD's ,
but the tuning principles will all apply.
