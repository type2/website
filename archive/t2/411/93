Subject: CV Joint repacking/overhaul

Clear DayI have a 72 bus and decided to repack and regrease the CV's and put
on new boots and all. When going through the bentley manual, it mentions the
dished washer. It says to throw it out and not replace it. It mentions
something about that in the Haynes manual also. The CV boot kit that I got
from bus depot includes a new dished washer and a friend of mine said he
regreased his CV's and put the new dished washer in, in place of the old
one. He said if it was there before to put it back in. Has anyone
repacked/regreased their CV's and reinstalled the dished washer or is it
standard procedure to not put them back in.  Does is matter? Just wondering
why I have it in the kit, but the books say not to use it. Thanks for any
help.
