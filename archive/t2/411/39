Two years, '71-'72.  The pads were made thicker in '73 due to rapid pad
wear.  The later calipers don't brake any better, they just require fewer
pad changes.

Nope, everything between the ball joints and wheel is different.  I've
tried mixing and matching, but no-go.

Nothing wrong with the earlier disks.  IIRC, you can do some swapping with
early bay beams and later spindles to get disk brakes without modifying
the bus for the later beam.
