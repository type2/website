Steve:

To the best of my knowledge and belief (in other words, I'm not responsible
if I'm wrong) the answer is "Yes."  ETKA does not make a distinction in the
wiring harness between automatic and manual, only "Federal" and
"California."  There *are* different versions of the ECU depending on auto
or manual, but apparently all the differences are internal to the ECU itself
and don't require different harnesses.
