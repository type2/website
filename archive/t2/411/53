Subject: Ok, ok... how about this?

How about if I buy a hapless case of a VW Bus, maybe something from the late
70s (or would I need something pre-74). It would need to have a very
straight and clean body.. but everything else would be shot. Heck.. even
then....

I could go to Mexico, buy a VW Bus that's in good shape (there's gotta be
ONE out there), bring it to the US, and take EVERYTHING off of it, and put
it on my donor Bus? That way, I wouldn't be swapping VINS. I could take
everything, INCLUDING the water-cooled VW motor (I think that's awesome as
hell). I could basically make my OLD Bus, look like a NEW bus. I'd even snag
the doors from the new Bus. 

THAT.. would be legal, wouldn't it? So long as I kept the headlights and
windows from the old Bus? I mean, all I'd be doing is basically taking a
SHELL of a 70s American Bus, and swapping every good part from the NEW bus
onto the old bus, including things like suspension parts and whatnot.

You know it's ashame I don't live out in the country and have a massive
backyard or a barn to store cars in. If I did, I'd be buying stuff up left
and right. I SOO badly want to get a squareback (the station wagon looking
thing) and I promised Erica we'd get a Kharmann Ghia RIGHT after I get a
67-68 Porsche 912. :)
