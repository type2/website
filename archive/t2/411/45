Subject: R-12 alternative Update

 I couldn't hardly wait to get home from work to expound upon some new
found knowledge to the soothsayer's of doom, the non believer's, and the
proponents of an alleged rolling time bomb, when using propane, butane,
or methane alternative based refrigerants in the sacred Vanagon, or Bus.

Here's the story--short and sweet---

While in the local VW parts room this morning behind the parts
counter---I see a bottle of 134a--no big deal--but parked right along
side of this bottle--is two more 30 pounder's--"Autofrost"--
I pick one of the bottles up--and read it--yea, it's got this and
that--but the last ingredient---is Propane--

Interesting--

"Yo Dave-- ( the parts mgr.) what's this stuff for--???"

"Oh, we use this all the time for R-12 vehicles"

"Really, and how many have blown up?"

What in the heck are you talking about" he says.

"Well, folks around the globe in the Bus, and Vanagon community, on the
internet have instructed the masses that in fact the vehicle with
anything like this in the AC system upon impact will go up like
Hiroshima if it's used in any vehicle"

"Tell them for me they are wacky--all three of our stores have been
using this refrigerant for 3 years, and have had no explosions, and
furthermore, our AC tech, has been to an update school several times in
the last several years and VW suggests the use of this product, in leu
of R-12"

The Mercedes dealer a mile away uses it, I know this--because when they
run out of their supply they purchase a bottle from me on occasion--and
the Jeep and Mopar dealer down the block uses it too" 

Real interesting stuff I found out today--and to follow up on the impact
of the nuclear meltdown of any vehicle's in the area using any of these
alternative's in their AC systems--I'm doing some Q&A at several of
other dealerships tomorrow-- I'll hit Chevy and FOMOCO, and maybe even
BMW just to find out how volatile and dangerous this stuff really is--
right from the horses mouth--not from a few Edger Allan Poe novelists---

One more thing while I'm on the subject---
It was 90 plus degree's here for the last two days---
The digital thermometer permanently positioned in my rear vents of my 87
Westy read 36 degree's while at 60 --70 mph--and 38 while in traffic.

Must be some sort of fluke--it works real good--

6 weeks worth so far--and nothing but blissful cold air---

Hasta Lavista,
