Au Contraire, it is just as hot in the South.  Here in Dallas the entire summer is generally in the upper 90's to low 100's.  There may be a few less days over 100 degrees compared to, say Fresno, but when you're that close it doesn't really matter.  It's friggen hot.

I agree with you there.  No external cooler for me, just a blueprinted oil pump (well, the next engine will have it), synthetic oil and reasonable driving habits.
