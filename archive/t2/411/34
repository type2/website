Where are you? I know of a gold/tan 73 Adventurewagen with a 1600 upright 
engine that was formerly owned by a guy in Vista, California. He sold the 
bus and I lost touch with him.

The 73 Adventurewagen had the same stock engine as any other 73 bus -- 1700 
type 4 engine with dual Solex carbs. David Schwarze converted his (Safare)
  to a 2.0L with Dellortos, last I knew. I know some people convert to fuel 
injection, which requires a different front tin piece because the throttle 
cable comes through in a different spot. There are some other minor things 
you have to do, too, but I forget what exactly. Someone can tell you.

Otherwise, the AW has an auxiliary battery on the left side of the engine 
compartment, with an isolator so you don't run down your starting battery 
when camping.

How complete is your interior? The 73 was the first year they had the full-length 
high roof without the luggage rack on the back, though I did see one with 
the old version top. What color is yours? Here are some brochures I scanned:

Hope this answers some of your questions.
