Subject: RE: [T2] Mexico VWs?

This subject seems to come up quite often.  Now correct me if I'm wrong,
but didn't someone say in a previous thread that these vehicles can be
imported legally if they pass through Europe?  The same goes for South
African Vanagons, and Brazilian Type2's I believe.

If your really desperate to get one of these foreign made newbies, then an
indorect import from an authorized country may be one of the only ways.
