Subject: Workshop Manuals - Price Reduced

I found a workshop manual for my 86 Syncro so I am selling/trading these
Workshop Manuals  - Prices Reduced:

Bently Official Service Manual Type 2
Station Wagon/Bus  1968-1978  - $15

Haynes 1600 Beetle 1970-1974  - $7.50

- or I will trade for other vanagon/syncro items?

Thanks, HC
