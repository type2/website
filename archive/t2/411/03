Subject: Wiring Harness Differences Auto VS. Manual

Hello,

does anyone know if I can use a wiring harness fro the fuel injection system
off a manual tranny on my automatic?  The manual is 1980 2.0L , and mine is
1981 2.0L automatic.

What are the differences and can I make it work??

Thanks a ton,
Steve
