Subject: Re: [Syncro] R-12 alternative Update

Propane is R-290, people saying you will "blow up" are ignorant and
screaming "fire" of which they are clueless.

R-290 DOES have a higher head pressure then R-12, so that will be harder on
your compressor and hoses though. THAT is why most recommend it be blended
with Butane (70/30), it solves the problems.
