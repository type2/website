Subject: RE: [T2] Re: [vanagon] R-12 alternative Update

  I have been using FRIG C FR-12 for over 5 years now in all of my air
conditioned and friends vehicles. In the spec sheets that come with it are
all the goverment and military specs and approvals as a R-12 subsitute.  I
have not had any problems using it and it is 9.8 oz a can, I would use 1 can
of Frig c instead of 1 14 oz can of R-12 and still have the same head
pressures and low pressures as if using R-12.

ronnie  just my dimes worth

Wow, I didn't realize how much "fire and brimstone" this subject would have.
I think I was the one who posted information about Auto Frost.  I have a 25
pound bottle of it which has a big "non flamable" sticker on the side.  I
have put it in my '85 Jetta and will also use it in my 3/4 ton truck when it
needs it.  I am planning on installing a turbo diesel engine and AC system
in a splitty bus this winter and wanted an inexpensive alternative to R12.

I really was just giving a laymen's opinion on Auto Frost, it seems to work
well for me and I liked the tests that showed the oil remained suspended
better than in other "compound refridgerants".

Hey, at $6 a pound it sure beats the $45 a pound for R12 and it works for
me, at least as good as R12, maybe even a bit better.
