Subject: Buses Of The Corn reminder

Hi Volks,

Time for a reminder... only 6 weeks to go until Buses Of The Corn!

BOTC3 will be in Whitby, Ontario Canada, August 8th-10th. We'll have 
lots of cool activities to keep campers busy on Friday and Saturday, 
and then there's the Great Canadian Bug Show on Sunday nearby in 
Mississauga.

New for 2003 will be a Tie-Dye workshop. Bring a T-shirts or 
bell-bottoms, tablecloths, bedspreads or curtains... dye it at BOTC and 
wear it proud!  We'll also have some shirts on hand you can buy for a 
modest amount, but please let us know what size to bring.

Not to be forgotten are the other events... The bus camping 
competition, the driving competition, frisbee golf, scavenger hunt, 
Breakfast Burritos and a terrific corn roast and pot-luck dinner.

Please reserve you space soon... only $8 CDN pre-registered, includes 
camping fees and the corn-roast. The price rises to $10 after July 
30th. Let us know you're coming so there will be plenty of corn to go 
around. And be sure to visit the BOTC website and let us know what you 
can bring for the burrito breakfast. Payment can be sent via paypal, 
cheque or money order; see the website for details.
