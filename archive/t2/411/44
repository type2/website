Here are the ingredients and the recipe.

INGREDIENTS:
1. Beam from a '68 or '69 bus  ('70 is rumored to work, but I've only 
personally verified up to '69)
2. Trailing arms out from your favorite bay bus '71 to '79
          as George states, the '71 & '72 will work, my preference was to 
pull from a '79 knowing
          it would be easier to get parts.
3. Master cylinder, Brake servo & mounting plate
4. Front/Rear Proportioning assembly, (mounted on frame rail roughly, a 
foot or two to the rear of the servo.

I went ahead and added
    caliper rebuild kit
    new brake pads
    wheel bearings & seals
    Torsion arm seals
    New tie rods
    New ball joints
    new sway bar rubber

RECIPE:
The whole thing was a bolt up affair.  I rebuilt the '69 beam on my patio 
from end to end.  I then got some friends and loaded it into the back of my 
DC and headed over to my friends shop to borrow his lift one Saturday.

I removed all the brake lines, & master cylinder assy.
disconnected the shifter, (shaft goes right through the torsion arms)
disconnected the clutch cable.
disconnected the throttle
disconnected the steering
removed the wheels.
removed the shocks.

I then lowered the bus down to where the beam was lightly resting on the 
drums & supported the front under the steering pivot.
I removed the four bolts on each side and the beam started slipping off.
I slowly raised the bus and with a little wiggling from side to side, it 
dropped right off the frame.
Here's the key here.  I let gravity do the work and DID NOT put myself in 
jeopardy.

I wheeled the old beam out of the way and pushed the new one in place.
I cleaned up the surfaces that the beam mounts to the frame and applied a 
little axle grease on both the frame and beam.

I then with the beam lined up, slowly dropped the bus down onto the beam, 
going back and forth from side to side until the holes lined up.

Bolted it up and double checked tightness all around and was almost done.

I then cut some brake lines and mounted the remaining brake parts.  Filled 
and bleed the brake system.

reconnected all the items that I disconnected above.

All total, it took me three hours by myself and I was back on the road.

The biggest time saver without a doubt was the use of the lift.

BTW, I also have the '79 brakes on the rear to match wheel patterns and 
adapt the the CV joint trans that's in the DC.
