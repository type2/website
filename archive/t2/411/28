Subject: brake fluid resevoir to master cylinder

What size hose (and does it matter what kind?)  goes from the brake fluid
reservoir to the master cylinder in a 71 bus?  The OG style was clear
plastic.  I have it but problem is if I take it off to take in store and
match it up, I'll have to bleed the brakes in the parking lot of the store
and that is something I would rather do at home :)

So if any one knows the size and requirements of this hose and could pass it
along to me I would appreciate it ...
