Subject: difference between pearl white L87 and Cloud white L581 ??

has anyone a color chart/sample of these two colors, I
jumped the gun and assumed the original stock accent
color on my bus was pearl white, when in fact its
cloud white.. 

I bought two quarts of pearl white, and I'm pretty
much stuck w/ it. But I'm just curious to know if
there really is a drastic difference.

thanx,
