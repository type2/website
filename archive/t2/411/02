Subject: Re: [T2] ATV jackstand for engine drop

Yeah. I was just at "horrible Fright " yesterday and seen the ATV jack. It 
says it's
rated at 1200 lb. Should be cake for a 400' engine. It was listed at $149.00.
Of course, it goes on sale when I have no money in my pocket :(

I too have an OLD trans. lift that works by a hand wheel & worm gear. I don't 
think I'd
want to use it though. Once you get some weight on that thing ya gotta be a 
gorilla
 to turn that wheel!

I'll be getting the ATV jack before I put in the new engine. Even if I have 
to pay the $150.
