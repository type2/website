Similar design parameters, similar results.

The Toyota was a pretty slick design, though the engine was actually
located under the driver's seat pedistal.  Wow, was that engine stuffed in
there tight!

Although toyotas are known for quality, I don't see many of those vans
around even though they are a lot younger than our buses.
