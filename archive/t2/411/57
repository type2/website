Subject: RE: [T2] Brake won't release...

Did you check the brake line all the way back to the master cylinder?
Sounds like blockage somewhere in the line. Visually check the flexible
and hard lines. Maybe there's a pinch or kink. Rent or buy a brake
pressure gauge that screws into the bleeder hole. Repump the brakes and
verify the blockage issue. Disconnect the line from the cylinders and
blow air through the flexible and then hard lines. You may be able to
determine where the possible blockage is. It may save you the trouble of
pulling a good master cylinder
