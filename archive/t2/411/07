Subject: RE: [T2] Mexico VWs?

I am not so sure they would look at little things like that on the window
glass. I think as long as you have a US plate, registration, US insurance
and Mexican insurance you would be ok. Just make sure you have corresponding
VINs on the title and vehicle before you drive back over. When I lived in LA
we use to buy US cars take them to Tijuana, have them painted for $50 and
then drive them back over to the US with out any problems...had a close call
only once when Ernest got pulled to the side for a search of drugs...they
brought in the drug sniffing dogs and everything! What a site! I sat there
down the road LMAO watching them go over the car.

The legal way would be to have shipped over like the Swedes do. Of course
you would have to pay an import tax and then there is still the problem of
getting it to pass a US inspection.

Do we not have any list memebers living in Mexico that can shed some light?

There's a couple problems that could bite you real hard. Look at the glass 
in the vent window (top right photo, first link).
