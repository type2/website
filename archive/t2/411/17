If they did, they were wrong.  Even from Europe, anything less than 25
years old must meet U.S. safety and emissions standards. Period.
Mexican/Brazilian busses will not meet these standards no matter what
you do. Absolutely no legal way around this. Sorry.

I drove one a couple of years ago, with about 12k miles on it. It ran
great!  Tight, no rattles to speak of, and plenty of power - I actually
passed other cars at highway speeds!  I'm sure my old bus probably drove
at least as well (if a bit more slowly) when it only had 12k on the
odometer, but unfortunately I didn't own it then. :-(  I suspect that
the lack of power you experienced probably was related to the
backfiring, hard start, etc.  It probably was in dire need of a tune up
or a timing adjustment.
