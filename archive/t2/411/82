Elise,
    Here's info on a few upcoming bus campouts in this part of the
country

Transporters by the Tunnel, North Adams, MA - July 18-20, 2003 - info
at http://www.bcn.net/~limbo/Transporter.html
Kampers Near Knoebrels - August 29 to September 1, 2003 - check
http://www.geocities.com/bens_bus/knk.htm for info
Kampers on the Rocks, Lenhartsville, PA - October 10-13, 2003 -
http://www.geocities.com/kampinkombi/

    In fact check the events page of the LiMBO web site at
http://www.bcn.net/~limbo/webt/events.html
Also keep in mind that some, but not all, VW car shows will have
camping the night before.  You can check for shows at
http://www.gti16v.org/shoinfo.htm#shoinfo   With all of these
available I think you could be VW busy almost every weekend for months
to come.
    I don't know what part of PA you are in, but if you are willing to
drive west or south there are even more to choose from.
