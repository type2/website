I recently found an Adventurewagen Yahoo group. Their stated purpose is for
Adventurewagens of the Vanagon persuasion but they have accepted me into the fold
with my '71. There is also the beginnings of an Adventurewagen 'club' at
www.jaysvws.com.

Your '73 came originally with a Type 4 engine but someone else will have to fill us
in on what the exact size was for that year. The 1600 in my '71 gets me down the road
but I'm fixin' to put a 1904 stroker in later this year.
