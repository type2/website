Subject: External Oil Cooler Kits Whose to Use?

Ted,

It's not as hot in the south as it is in the west, where I and many busdrivers live in the central valley in california where it is regularly above 100 degrees thru the summer.

My bus had it's flaps wired to full open 
(missing thermostat) and I never had overheating problems. Keep the oil topped off, also you actually have gauges on your bus as well.

I think the aftermarket oil coolers are a money maker for somebody, a waste of time if VW didn't engineer them in the first place (HEAR THAT EVERYBODY!) and they make every bus I've ever seen with 'em look like absolute hell.

More holes thru sheet metal, external hoses, AND oil leaks?
Where do I sign up?

I don't like 'em.

Billy

Any other thoughts here folks? I have not had much of a response to this question and I would think you southern bus folks would be all over this
one...
