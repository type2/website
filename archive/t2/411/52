Hiya Snoopy
If you don't want to take it all the way apart right there, why don't you
just get it to the point where the master cylibder is empty, CAREFULLY
separate MC from line, and measure the diameter of the line at the top?

You will, of course, keep in mind that the line is expanded at the MC fitting
because of the fitting there.  Then you'll have an idea what diameter.  Then
guesstimate the length, add at least 15% because once you've cut it twice
it'll still be too short.  Then you can refill the MC and drive it home after
buying the hose.

I've used clear vinyl tubing a couple times now with no problems yet in over
4 years, can be found at any hardway store and I know there's a couple on
your way home from work.

Good luck.
