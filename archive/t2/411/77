Subject: Clutch behavior

okay,
Two 76 buses, both standard tranny.

My first Bus, Krista, her clutch disengages at relatively the same
distance off the cab floor as it engages when I am shifting into
gear.  Feels great, she has always been a pleasure and the supremely
most reliable vehicle that I have ever owned.

My second bus, Freddy, disengages very close to the floor(no biggie
there, easier on the diaphragm clutch) BUT engages very high in the
range of movement from the peddle.

Why would the engage and disengage points vary so much on the clutch
of my second bus?

Any suggestions for troubleshooting?  Is this a sign of a clutch job
in Freddy's near future?
