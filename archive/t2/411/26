Subject: Re: [T2] External Oil Cooler Kits Whose to Use?

Not a good idea to wire thermostat flaps open. Although the motor will 
warm-up.
The idea is for it to warm up evenly. The engine warms unevenly when the 
flaps are 
disabled. Which can lead to various stresses setting up. VW did a pretty good
job of designing their cooling system. As I have found out recently that even 
increased air flow can make the engine run hotter. I've heard nothing but bad 
about external oil coolers. Sounds like they would help, but, maybe just a 
little. Not worth
all the expense, leaks, labor,etc. I myself am truing to see if a Porsche 
type cooling
fan and tin would do anything to help temps. in the desert. Late
