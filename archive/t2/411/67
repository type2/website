We used to have 2 of them for my wife's business and they were real work horses. One went 250,000 miles without
a rebuild and could still pass smog when we donated it. The other went 160,000 before my daughter gave it away
to someone she owed money to.  They were surprisingly easy to work on given the location of the engine.

I think the difference is that VW owners are known for recycling and Toyota owners have a throw it away
mentality.
