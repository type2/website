Subject: An easy method of balancing wide five wheels(finally)...

Last weekend at the VW show in Niagara Falls,  I bought an old Beetle front
drum, with lug nuts. It was clean and painted flat black.  I took it to the
tire shop and got him to spin it on his balancer- it balanced 0-0, meaning
perfect. I bolted it to my 5 wheels in turn and they are now balanced. It may
not be a perfect method, but it is something that anyone with a pre-71 bus can
use at any tire shop out there. The balancing machine's centers worked
perfectly with the bore on a front drum.
