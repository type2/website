HI,

Last January I was in Thunderbay Ontario Canada and it was -42 farehight so
in order to start my 1975 Westie , I had to light the old charcoal broiler
and levee it under the motor for an hour before it would even turn over, I
also drain all the oil from the motor ad boiled it in the house, than I put
it back in the motor just before I had to start the motor. This was a very
common thing to do up north in the 1950. Then we would also boil the
antifreeze to help start the car.
Andri
