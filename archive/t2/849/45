Dewd - you be needin' a hot air popcorn popper - when I was in Winnipeg and 
needed to start my bus in the winter - 20 mins with the hot air popcorn 
popper under the engine and it started right up - and, as you know, Winnipeg 
is every bit as cold as Thunderbay. In fact, some folks say that Winnipeg is 
the coldest city of its size in the world (I'll let someone else check on 
whether or not that's true)
