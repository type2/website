Subject: Re: [T2] Warning : What a bad clutch driven plate will do to 

Mark,

OK--

I retract the whole thought I layed out there.

Let me rephrase the idea.

In a stock RPM , road driven engine under 100 hp an over balanced ( more
than the mfg. does at the time of building it ) pressure plate is not
necessary.

However, if your running a 502 Chevy mid engine powerplant in your type
2 then I would advise to have the pressure plate checked anyway--prior
to it blowing outa the scatter sheild.

My buddies ran blown , Mopar, top fuel rails, and after a run dropped
the clutch assemblies, and popped a pressure plate and a disc fresh outa
the box back in the car.
Balanced only from whoever they got them from.
Hayes, is one of them.

Not too common of a thing to beyond what ever the mfg. has done.
