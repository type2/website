I second this. I balance several engines per year and the PP always is way
out of whack, even if it is brand new. If it is Brazilian new it is out of
balance for sure even if it says sachs on it. The VW cranks and flywheels
seldom need much work, they are very good. The rods are always way out, but
the factory spec is pretty wide for them.
