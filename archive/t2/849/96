Subject: what yr is this engine?

The stamped engine number and the pulleys are confusing me.

I have a 71 Type 2, with a replacement engine, and I now think it is 
a 69 or 70.

The engine number 51722003 is not listed in the Muir book (p294) for 
any TYPE II,  or Type I, or III  or even IV. I am thinking "What the 
Hell is it"???

Would a 71 engine be a better engine?

One reason I think it is NOT a  71 as the pulley only has one notch, 
but pulleys can be changed, right? Also #1 lines up with rotor at 
180degrees from TDC

It is strong, and running smoothly.

Thanks, John
please cc: me as I only get digest. Thanks
