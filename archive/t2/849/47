Subject: Fog lights...

Hello to you all.
Is there anyone in this list with these kind (or similar) fog lights?

http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=143392

If so, is the chrome ok, or are they going to last only for a few months
before getting rusted?
Till now, i've only found these in a european internet shop:

rtfield=name&-sortorder=descend&Find%5fWeb=T2&Megasearch=hella&-max=10&-recid
=34039&-token.0=13420966&-find=

and I would like to make an decision.
My bus had a pair of black plastic and rectanguler fog lights...They were
completly out of the picture, and now that i've painted my front bumper white
I know they will be dreadfully on it.
There's another issue: on arrival, i will probably pay 12% more (custom taxes)
plus 21% VAT....Any thing that i buy from outside EC, must worth every EURO.

Any help will be very apreciated.
Thanks and i hope i'm not bothering any of you with this.

Regards from Portugal.
