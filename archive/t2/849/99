Some replacement engines came without a number so that the installer
could stamp in the number to match the original case since some states
require the original number to be present.

 not exactly before the number, but next to the engine crack, facing
 up it looks like an H or possibly an A.  The 517 number faces rear
 and is about 1 1/2 inches from the letter.
