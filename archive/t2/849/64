It's not the material that is the problem.  It's the fact that the
machining on the aluminum cases is not accurate.  VW does not make the
aluminum type 1 cases.  They are made by the aftermarket.  If they could
machine them right they would be winners.

If you want a well-machined aluminum type 1 case, all you have to do is
get a wasserboxer case and cut the water jacket off!  You get a spin-on
oil filter too!  This is no easy project, but probably easier than making
the current aluminum cases right.
