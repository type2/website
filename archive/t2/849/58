Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper color for 1970 cab

According to my spec charts I have on file, the following bumper colors were
used:

68-70 models:  L581 Cloud White
71-79 models:  L90D Pastel White

Cloud White is just a "touch" brighter looking than Pastel White.

And just for info for other colors for the 1970:
Wheel Rim:  L581 Cloud White
Steering Column Tube, Shifter & Handbrake Lever:  L41 Black
Seat Frame(s):  LD43 Grey Black

Info Source:  Factory Parts Fiche, dated 1972 and 1983 (Who needs ETKA? ;-)
)
