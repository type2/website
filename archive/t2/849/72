Type 1 gland nut removers,

I bought this to remove gland nut and of course I bent it (and
returned it - 'broke it' lifetime warranty). Can anyone on the list
recommend a 1/2 drive breaker bar or slider bar that happily takes
300+ ftlbs of torque. Sears is not an option, impact wrench is not
preffered.  Looks like everyone wants to sell those weak "flex bars".

BTW, there was *way* more than 300fllbs of torque on the gland nut
when I removed it. I was at three feet (~450ftlbs)  when the slider
bar decided to bend. It took a good 10 seconds with the neighbor's air
impact wrench to get the sucker out.

thanks - Arnaud
