Subject: Re: [T2] Fw: Cold wether starting

There I go,, acting silly again!  lol   I should have remembered that 
altitude has a lot to do with cold.. as my Camper came from California,, it 
had loads of cold weather stuff in it including,, Chains! ,, now,, Tire 
chains have been outlawed on the road for decades here...  but ... D'oh!  of 
course when you get into the mountains the climate is different....... I 
have learned that in my travels in the Camper...

Sorry Mark, I appologize!   One Wild Turkey on me!
