Lee,
Are you using a stock exhaust ? IMHO most aftermarket exhaust systems
fail to get sufficient amouts of hot exhaust gasses though the heat
riser. Is the heat riser near the carb too hot to touch after a
5-minute ride ? (that is the way it is on my stock '71)

It sounds like everything is fine, except that it does not start for
the first 10 seconds - maybe because it does not get fuel for the
first 10 seconds. Could it be lacking fuel when you start it in the
morning - because the carb lost its fuel reserve overnite ? Is the
flush bolt at the bottom of the float chamber tight, are the fuel
lines in good condition ? Is the carb cracked ?

One of these days, check that the float chamber is full _before_ you
go crank it. At least you'll know if it is not that. What's your gas
mileage like ? Remove the carb and fill the float chamber. Check that
the gas is still there 5 days later.

Also check the choke, choke electrical.

On jets : re-using old jets for anything else than testing may not be
a good idea. After 20'000 gallons go through the main 125, it most
likely isn't a 125 anymore but more like a 135. So it runs richer than
it needs Stock pilot jet on 34-3 is a 55. I think stock main is 127.5.
