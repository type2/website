Subject: Re: [T2] Aluminium or Magnesium case for type 1

The aluminum cases are JUNK, DO NOT MESS WITH THEM. I am constantly shocked
by the # of people continuing to ask if there are exceptions or something,
THE ALUMINUM CASES SUCK.

I have an 94 X 84 and 94 X 88 engine, I used OEM Magnesium for both for a
reason, even though it's more expensive.
