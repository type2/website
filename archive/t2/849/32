<<Last January I was in Thunderbay Ontario Canada and it was -42
farehight so in order to start my 1975 Westie , I had to light the old
charcoal broiler and levee it under the motor for an hour before it
would even turn over,>>

Sure--why not?

Wouldn't it be a bunch easier to install an engine heater and  just plug
the Bus in at night?

This is what most folks up in Hibbing Minnesota do when it gets down to
-50 below this time of year--

They do work well--no fires, or dropping the oil to heat it up prior to
the morning start ritual.
