So the balancer-man will bolt the pressure plate to the flywheel and
balance _the set_. So that when I replace the pressure plate, the
flywheel alone will be out of whack.

Why can't he balance my flywheel alone? Then the pressure plate alone.
So when I get a new pressure plate, the flywheel does not need to be
balanced (hey no need to remove the 1000000ftlb gland nut). Just
balance the new pressure plate.

What would it take to do home-made round-balancing ? Anyone does it ?
