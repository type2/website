hey terry  I inderstand how that is and normally the plate will be very 
close. I have never been much for drag racing but I do a lot with the Formual Vee 
guys and these guys take balancing very seriously and in the heat of fixing a 
car so that it can race the next race worring about the balance of the pressure 
plate isn't worth  thinking about. They will worry about something like that 
if and only if it gives them a problem in the race. The Vee guys use a 40hp 
motor that is mostly stock and that they will tweak them  to get 62hp from and 
run these little suckers up to 6800rpm.  later  mark dearing
