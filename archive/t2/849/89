Subject: Re: [T2] big-o 1/2 inch breaker bar

My Harbor Freight $39 (may have been on sale) 3/4" socket set has worked 
very well.  No complaints even when I've used very large "Helper Bars" 
with no bending of the bar or cracking of sockets.

I also bought their 3/4" drive 600 ft lb clicker torque wrench. works 
very well, but a hell of a big toy to store.
