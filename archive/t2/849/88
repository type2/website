When Jamie Auch's engine died while he was here for Buses Of The Corn the impact wrench was the only way
possible to get the gland nut off.

 Or so I thought...

 Fast forward to EveryBus 2004.  Mark Dearing came to help replace
AJ's clutch and brought along a VERY cool wrench that fit over the
gland nut at one end. At the other end it had a gear that meshed with
the flywheel. This was where the torque wrench was applied. It was
geared with a 9:1 ratio using the flywheel, so when you turned it at
30 ft/lbs you wound up with 270 at the gland nut.

The tool is in the bottom left of this pic:

A tool like that would pull your gland nut without an impact wrench.
Ask Mark where to get one... I have no idea.

The original Torquemeister was around $150.......made by Kymco.
Then the Chinese decided to make a knock-off of it.....
Supposedly, the original maker stopped making them. Said they could not compete.
Also said the Chinese ones were junk and broke..... mine has not yet.

Here is a Kymco [they said they quit making them???]:

$100 and you have to pay extra for the 6V gear!

Here is a Chinese one:
