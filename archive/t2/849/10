Physics fun.

Is it more critical to balance the flywheel than pressure plate
because it is heavier and bigger ?

What is the problem with not being balanced ? The problem is the
centripetal force that the _out of balance_ mass (m) spinning at speed
v creates on the bearings. The rest of the mass (the balanced mass)
hangs out there, but creates no centripetal force.

F_centripetal = mv^2 / r
v is on the disc and can be written as v = 2 .pi. r. rpm

hence F_centripetal = 4.m r. (pi.rpm)^2

so the force on the bearing is proportional to
1) the _mass out of balance_
2) the distance of the _mass out of balance_ from the axis
3) the square of engine rpm (!)

So a pressure plate with 10 grams out of balance at 10cm from the axis
will create exactly the same centripetal force as a flywheel with 10
grams out of balance at 10cm from the axis at the same rpm. The same
out of balance mass will create 4x the force when engine is revved 2x
more.

Bottom line : balancing matters, but revving hurts the bearing twice as much.
