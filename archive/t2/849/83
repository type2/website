bought the tool.

But when you bring an old and broken Craftsman tool back, you
get a new ready-to-break Craftsman tool... ;-(

BTW, if you really don't care who's name is on the pocket of your
jeans, L.L. Bean's catalog says, "Satisfaction guaranteed, forever,
period." And they really do back it up...I've mailed a few items back
over the years and gotten replacements...And once, got a check
because the shirt was no longer being carried... ;-)
