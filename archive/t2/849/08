Hi,

EB is coming up soon! The web site has been updated but everybus.com is 
down at the moment. You can access all the info at 
http://www.mindspring.com/~everybus/

The short version is 8th annual EveryBus will take place beginning 
Thursday April 20th, 2006 at Hagan Stone Park located 10 miles south of 
Greensboro, NC. This a fun family event for VW buses of all years!

If you have any questions please contact me at everybus(-at-)mindspring.com.

I would appreciate it if someone could post this to the Vanagon list.

Thanks
Chris
