Hi Arnaud,

Impact wrench may not be preferred, but it will do the job. If 450 ft/ 
lbs isn't moving it, I'd say that the impact wrench is the way to go.  
When Jamie Auch's engine died while he was here for Buses Of The Corn  
the impact wrench was the only way possible to get the gland nut off.

Or so I thought...

Fast forward to EveryBus 2004.  Mark Dearing came to help replace  
AJ's clutch and brought along a VERY cool wrench that fit over the  
gland nut at one end. At the other end it had a gear that meshed with  
the flywheel. This was where the torque wrench was applied. It was  
geared with a 9:1 ratio using the flywheel, so when you turned it at  
30 ft/lbs you wound up with 270 at the gland nut.

The tool is in the bottom left of this pic:

A tool like that would pull your gland nut without an impact wrench.  
Ask Mark where to get one... I have no idea.

Happy trails,
