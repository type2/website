Subject: RE: [T2] Tire wrench

Wal-Mart also carries a telescoping lug wrench that's not too bad.  I did
manage to bend mine once and that pretty much messed up the telescoping
action.  But for 8 bucks it's not a bad deal.

 

Of course if everyone would make sure their lugs are torqued (with a torque
wrench) and not let the tire shops just zip them on with an impact gun then
getting the lugs off should be no problem even with the stock setup.  Very
few shops will actually use a torque wrench though.  I usually just
re-torque mine when I get home from the shop.
