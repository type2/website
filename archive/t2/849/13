I'm sure you could talk him into it. . . and take your chances on the pressure plate, or pay him double to do it twice, or consider that the pressure plate will likely last 50k and maybe that's enough for a cheapo balance job, when you get a new one do it again. . .  My flywheel was WAAAAYYYY out (contrary to what Scott suggested) however my crank was basically dead on.  I did not get my pressure plate done.  I did not use the services in the link below (but similar).  just the best writeup I have seen.

good reading.
