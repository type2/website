Subject: ATTENTION: double cab with corvair motor ???

I am trying to relocate HANS... the white double cab that was cut up for a 
corvair motor, had Mecredes rims, and was trying to be sold a couple years 
ago. If anyone knows anything about this doublecab, please return a 
response.

I am also trying to locate a doublecab worth putting a corvair motor in, as 
I will not hack up another classic for a transplant... andone have a 68 - 79 
doublecab they will let go without a motor and trans !
