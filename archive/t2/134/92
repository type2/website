Subject: Re: [T2] Weber 48 IDA Value????

They are worth from $200-700ea, depending on condition. If the throttle
shafts or pump shaft bushings are worth, the fix is $700/pair, making them
essentially worthless. I have a great article on an IDA rebuild in our tech
section that I wrote last year, with a lot of pics.
