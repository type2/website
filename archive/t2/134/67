Hi Bus Gypsy,
Back in 81, I had a 72 westy w/o pop top that had
everything going against it: Dead stickers everywhere,
questionable items hidden throughout, and a very
questionable long-hair at the wheel. Me and my pals
drove and camped all over Southern Cal for many years
with no problems at all. The only incident I ever had
was when I was with my future wife. We were pulled off
onto a deserted road at night, testing out the fold
out bed when we were rudely interrupted by a loud
knock on the slider. It was a Riverside police
officer, but he just wanted to make sure we were both
there of our own free will - WHEWW! However he did
tell us we had to move it along and explained that if
he couldn't have any fun that night, we weren't going
to either. As he didn't search the bus, I was all too
happy to comply.
