I drive a 78 Riviera in good condition.  It is not show quality; but then 
again I drive it every day.  I live in northern Indiana and have had no 
problems with being a target of pull-overs here.  However, last July a headed 
to Yellowstone National Park to meet up with my brother and some friends for 
some backpacking and I was pulled over in the middle of Wyoming due to a 
flickering tail light.  I thought all was well until the officer began to ask 
the questions.  Have you been drinking or do you have any drugs with you.  I 
said "no", but he wanted to look anyway.  He patted me down and spent about 
twenty minutes searching the bus.  I was traveling late at night or early in 
the morning and I asked him if he searched everyone he pulls over at this 
time of night.  He said "no" but that he did search everyone driving a van 
like mine.  I couldn't believe he admitted to that but he did.  No worries 
though!  It made for a great story to tell to the people of the church that I 
pastor here in Indiana.  The kids in the youth group thought it was pretty 
cool that their pastor got pulled over and searched for drugs.
