Subject: overheating prevention/ gauges


I want to keep me and my new motor happy. Aside from the regular tune up 
routine, what is the most useful prevention tool for keeping an eye on the 
motor? Gauges? temp? pressure? cyl. head? Gene Berg rants on gauges and 
pushes his product that activates the existing idiot light earlier, I 
believe.So, what's the bottom line here?
