The 009 is at least 10=B0 shy of the total advance required for the T-IV=20
motor. It requires a compromise between good timing for idle or good=20
efficientcy at higher rpm's. The advance curve is just not as specified for=
=20
the T-IV.

IDF Webers will work famously on a T-IV engine, IF you have them jetted and=
=20
adjusted properly for your application AND you have a high quality linkage=
=20
setup and balance the flow at idle and off idle to the gnat's ass. If not,=
=20
you will have headaches. No used carb should be put on a vehicle to see=20
what happens. It should be verified as clean inside without knawrled and/or=
=20
loose jets and all base adjustments made before hand if you wish to avoid=20
fits and starts and redo's.

Be sure the compression test has all the spark plugs removed, the throttles=
=20
wide open, and the battery fully charged, or you will get false low=20
readings.  Any new engine that doesn't show good balance on all cylinders=20
is suspect as to specifications. Bentley gives the compression specs for=20
new engines. Believe them, and hold your engine builder to them. Anything=20
less than 130lbs for a new engine is not a sign of good workmanship. I=20
raise my eyebrows at less than 140psi after breakin miles for any T-IV motor=
