Subject: RE: [T2] 34 Pict 3 Problems

In changing the carb over to a 30pict 1,2 or 3 I have a few questions.
The bus currently has a dual hose distributor on it, would it still
function with the 30 picts or would it ineed to be replaced? Also will
there be any loss of power from the engine due to the fact it is a dual
port and the carb is from a single?

If the Throttle shafts are leaking gas, then air is also leaking in,
leaning the mixture and making the carburator difficult if not
impossible to properly adjust. Mofoco in Wisconsin used to ream the
throttle shafts for you, send in your old carb. Don't know if they still
do. You can buy a new Brosol 34.3, although if running this carb,you may
find it helpful to use the stock 71 distributor as opposed to...say, the
009. My personal inclination, if replacing the carb, would be to go with
a 30pict1,2 or 3 type carb from the single port bus prior to 71. You can
get an adaptor plate and file it to fit, and it appears to be a more
dependable and simple to adjust carb over time. Chris
