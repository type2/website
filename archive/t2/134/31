Subject: Re: [T2] different octane- different timing

I don't see how. Octane is simply a measurement of how gas resists
detonation. Here was a decent history on octane I found.

Now I can see you having to adjust your timing if your running low
octane fuel (knocks easier) and you keep hearing knocking. I suspect
this has more do to w/ the engine condition than the fuel, but you
really don't want that engine to knock.
