 Hi Craig,
Have you thought about going a mildly worked engine with say a mild cam, standard crank, machining the heads, ratio rockers & changing the standard bores out to 1640 or 1641cc(same difference).
All these things keep your engine almost standard but give you more horses without having to clearance the case & they won't suck that much more fuel either.
And it shouldn't cost you much more than a standard engine either.
What do other people think?
It's my belief that the 1600 is actually the most reliable & strong engine per it's horse power that VW ever built & these little tweaks only maximise it's efficiency.
Plus sticking with a single carb puts less strain on the engine long term as your not pumping all that extra fuel into the cylinders all the time & it also keeps the fuel efficiency of 1600's.
But definitely go a dual port.
:-)

I'm getting a rebuilt engine for my '71. It's currently single port-I know 
dual was stock for that year. I need a new manifold to activate the brake 
assist, so the only additional cost is the new carb. So, what to choose? My 
goal is long lived reliability period. I've heard arguments that the single 
port is a more reliable, less temperamental motor. But, let's be honest, I 
carry a lot of gear in mine regularly, and it's a Flintstone mobile up 
hills- a few extra horses might help! p.s. is the brake assist really 
helpful?
