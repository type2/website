I have a '71 Westy that is pretty clean. I travel along the north-east
section of the country except in the winter, doing as many camping
events as possible. Goldie, my bus, loves to run about 55/60 mph. Rear
window is full of stickers, mostly the clubs I belong to. Never been
stopped or hassled. See you all at EB. TBear
