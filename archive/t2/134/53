Subject: It is Friday

Where better than here to get support for a speed that is better designed 
for our buses.
I understand that those wanting to blow us off the road outnumber us by 
quite a bit.

Subject: Cast your vote on 55 mph vs 70mph

Governor Rick Perry is interested in finding out what Texans think about
the speed limit roll back to 55 miles and hour from 70. Please call Governor
Perry's office (1-800-252-9600) and let them know. You may have to hold for
a minute, but you will speak with a live person. It's fast and easy. You
can also vote at

Please pass this on to as many Texans as possible.
