Subject: single vs. dual port


I'm getting a rebuilt engine for my '71. It's currently single port-I know 
dual was stock for that year. I need a new manifold to activate the brake 
assist, so the only additional cost is the new carb. So, what to choose? My 
goal is long lived reliability period. I've heard arguments that the single 
port is a more reliable, less temperamental motor. But, let's be honest, I 
carry a lot of gear in mine regularly, and it's a Flintstone mobile up 
hills- a few extra horses might help! p.s. is the brake assist really 
helpful?
