You CANNOT set it at 10 after and expect it to run decently without having
manifold vacuum connected. If you do not have retard connected, set it at 7.5
BEFORE at idle. When you connect retard vacuum, it will go to 10 after. Go to
your 68-79 Bentley, section 5, page 72, Table I, ignition timing.
Model 73/74 dual carb manual trans. It says "10 after TDC Vacuum hoses ON" and
in the next column it says "at 850-950 rpm"
If you pulled the vacuum line from the advance side at idle, AND the timing
moved!!!, you have the wrong hose connected to the advance side. The advance
side gets ported vacuum = NO vacuum at idle, vacuum appears AFTER you open the
throttle.
