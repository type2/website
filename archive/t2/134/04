...Actually, the 6 ton pair (3 tons per stand..this applys to the ones
that HF sells also) from JWC are 19.99, the 12 ton pair (6 ton each) are
29.99.  HF sells a similar pair of 12 ton (6/e) stands for 79.99.  They
are manufactured by Central Machinery, whereas the JCW stands are from
"Big Red".....
