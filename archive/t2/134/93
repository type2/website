Subject: How fast do you drive your bus? (was Re: [T2] It is Friday)

I live in Dallas where, according to Bob's link these limits are already in 
effect.  The freeways around here all still have 60 or 65 limits.  Maybe 
it's referring to secondary roads?  In any case, I like to drive 60-65 (in 
my bus, which I drive every day now) depending on whether or not I'm in a 
hurry, so I would have to vote against it.  I never have trouble with other 
drivers when I'm doing 60 except for the occasional idiot that would have 
been just as upset if I were doing 70.

'Nuther good Friday topic - how fast do you typically drive in your 
bus?  My standard highway cruising speed is 62mph/100kph.
