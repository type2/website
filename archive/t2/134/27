1. while this far from ideal & I really don't like doing this. This is
that I did to tighten that same bolt up on my 2L. Remove the oil
filter, take a long straight screwdriver (or punch) and use a hammer
to hit on the edge of the nut. It should tighten up. I tried all
variations of completely hacking a 10mm wrench to try and get a grip
on it, but the cooler kept in the way.

2. I think you can remove the cooler, but I believe you have to remove
the fan shroud as well. Try idea 1 first.
