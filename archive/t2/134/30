Subject: Am i 180 out? (2 Q's)

List,
I installed a rebuilt dual vac distributor yesterday.
The part was sold as being for the 72-74 bus.
Things don't look right.  I'l try to be as clear as
possible here. Solid lift 1800 in a 74 std bus.

QUESTION 1

After bringing the timing notch to 0 deg and checking
to see that both valves on #1 are closed, i pulled the
009. I noticed that the smaller side of the split head
of the drive shaft points away from the case - towards
the #4 piston.
The shaft does sit at about 12 deg of the case parting
line - as it should, since I installed it that way.

I found that my new part would only install with the
#1 notch on the distributor pointing down towards the
#3 cylinder - because of the vac can. Also, in order
to get it to seat (offset on dist gear aligned with
driveshaft slot), the contact on the rotor had to be
pointing 180deg away from this notch- towards the fan
pulley.
The Bentley (figure 8-1 on page 23 of section 5) shows
a type4 rotor sitting at the #1 notch. My rotor is
sitting in this position, only my #1 notch is on the
opposite side of the dist body.
I did the valves before i pulled the 009 and i think
that its #1 notch also pointed towards #3, but if it
did then the rotor did too, and the valve adjustments
appeared to go correctly. It wouldn't run if i had
somehow adjusted both valves to .008" on the overlap
stroke...or would it?  I remember making sure both #3
valves were open and that #1 was at TDC when i did
valves after assembly.
The new part went in with the pts at .016.

So - is my drive shaft installed 180deg out or is the
distributor assembled wrong or am i crazy?

QUESTION 2

Also, i figure since i'm running close to stock now, i
could follow Bentley timing specs - (Table 'i' on page
72 of section 5) and set at 10ATDC with vac line on,
but it sure as hell doesn't like to run there.
I set it at about 8 ATDC and it still stumbles at take
off and 'lacks balls' in the high end. The vac is
working, as i could pull the line while it was running
with the light on it and watch the mark move -
although i couldn't tell you how much.
I don't have the retard side hooked up yet. Is the can
designed to only work right if it is regulated by the
presence of manifold vac?  Am i running at full vac
advance at idle in absence of the retard pressure?

eating humble pie,
