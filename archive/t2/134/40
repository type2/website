Hi Folks,

I've been driving my 1979 Westy for about a year, and have had no excessive 
problems with the law.  Granted, I've only been as far away from Aspen as 
Denver and Moab, and my Bus is in very good shape.  I have no stickers on 
it, I try to avoid large amounts of smoke billowing out the windows, and I 
can't even break Colorado's I-70 speed limit.  In fact, the only time I've 
ever been pulled over was when I was doing 72 in a 55 zone!

When I had a Toyota Van, however, I got pulled over several times in both 
Massachusetts and Colorado.  Though the van was in good shape, it had tinted 
windows, stickers on the back, and a ski rack on the top.  Perhaps it's just 
karma...

I'm about to embark on a road trip to Lake Tahoe and back, so perhaps I'll 
have more data to add to my run-ins with the law.

Happy Friday, everybody!  Good luck!
