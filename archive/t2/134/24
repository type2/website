If the Throttle shafts are leaking gas, then air is also leaking in, leaning
the mixture
and making the carburator difficult if not impossible to properly adjust.
Mofoco in Wisconsin
used to ream the throttle shafts for you, send in your old carb. Don't know
if they still do.
You can buy a new Brosol 34.3, although if running this carb,you may find it
helpful to use the stock 71 distributor as opposed to...say, the 009. My
personal inclination, if replacing the carb, would be to go with a 30pict1,2
or 3 type carb from the single port bus prior to 71. You can get an adaptor
plate and file it to fit, and it appears to be a more dependable and simple
to adjust carb over time.
