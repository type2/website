Richard,

The egr system pulls exhaust from the muffler into the filter where it is
then cooled and this causes particles to cool and fall out and get trapped.
This also causes condensation and collects moisture. Hence making used ones
undesirable. Rusty and full of stuff. I have added these and the other parts
you've requested to the web site. www.bustedbus.com

Can someone explain the inner workings of the EGR filter?  Is it ok to go
with a used one if it's not rusted or leaking?
