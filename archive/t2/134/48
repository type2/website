Subject: cooling air deflectors and thermostate


the controversy continues . . . are the stock cooling air deflectors and 
thermostate the saving grace of the air cooled engine or a rampant virus 
deployed  covertly by engine rebuilders? I live on the central coast of CA, 
where temps are moderate.
