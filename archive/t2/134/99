Subject: Bus Heat

Hi Everybody!
One of the previous owners of my '78 Westy gutted the heating system, all
that remains are the naked fins of the heat exchangers. I am wondering how
well the stock system worked in the first place, is it worth replacing all
those pricey bits?
Memories of my '62 Type 1 and '76 Super Beetle "heaters" during Minnesota
winters have left me suspicious about how effective heat in a bus could be.
My Westy is garaged all winter, so when it gets brisk during the spring and
fall months we just dress warm and use an electric ceramic heater (110v) and
the dogs to take the edge off at night when we're camping.

Thanks, Doug Swenson
