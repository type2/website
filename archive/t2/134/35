=========================>
In Houston it does not matter what year or condition of bus you drive.

Houston cops drive so fast they don't even see slow moving buses.

Additionally, their radar sets can't differentially adjust enough so as to 
properly Doppler compensate for the speed difference of their moving donut 
seeker vehicles and the speed of a moving VW bus.
