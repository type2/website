Type2 list.  While this was a frustrating topic for me, in no way would =
I hesitate to send any Bus owner to the Bus Depot for parts or advice.  =
Their service has always been top notch, and I'm impressed with =
everything they sell with this one exception. I'd like to publicly =
apologize to both Ron and the list as this wasn't really meant to go =
beyond me and him. =20
