Subject: RE: Mexican hatch seal

Ron,
All of this discussion on the Type 2 List regarding Mexican vs. =
Brazilian rear hatch seals has brought up a sore point I've had for a =
while now.  Back in December I ordered a Rear Hatch Seal from you guys.  =
Before ordering I wrote to inquire whether there was any significant =
difference between the Mexican and Brazilian hatch seals.  Your response =
was that there wasn't really and that they were both of good quality, =
the primary difference being the price and the country of origin.  So I =
ordered the Mex. one based upon that discourse.  Well now I come to find =
that there is a lot of difference between the Mex. and Brazian seals, =
principally that the Brazilian one has molded corners, etc. whereas the =
Mex. one is not molded at all.  I wish I had our original email =
correspondence, but I don't anymore. I've had a hell of a time getting =
this hatch seal to actually seal, and had I known about the differences =
I would have purchased the Brazilian seal instead.  I'll still continue =
to purchase almost everything from you, because 99% of the time I've =
been very satisfied, and I find your participation in the list to be =
valuable, but I just thought I'd pass this along, so that in the future =
you might make this difference in the parts more known. I'm not a =
stickler for something having to be exactly within OEM specs, or even =
Original German Only, but in this case I think there is a functional =
difference between the two products.

Thanks,

I would seriously doubt that this is really a German VW seal, but it may
well be genuine VW.  For a number of years, VW has been selling =
Brazilian
made seals, even in Germany itself.  I have seen them sold, and even
labeled, as "made in Germany", but they are in fact not.  I think one
importer may have bought some in Germany and erroneously assumed that =
they
were German made, not realizing that they were simply VW/Brazil seals
exported to Germany.  They are, however, closer to original than Mexican
aftermarket seal, despite where they're made.  In fact they are exactly =
as
you describe above: correct corners, etc., close to original quality but =
not
quite. They are the ones used on the Mexican and Brazilian busses.  I =
list
them as "genuine VW" but do not claim them to be German because I know
better.  There is also an actual German made seal available in Europe, =
which
I import from time to time.  This one is apparantly made by the one-time =
OEM
supplier to VW but is not a "genuine VW" seal (since the "genuine" ones =
are
in fact no longer German).  I have seen no significant difference in =
quality
between these and the Brazilian made genuine VW ones, and often I do
substitute one for the other based on availability.  I have not seen =
these
ones anywhere else in the U.S., at least so far; most of what I've seen
elsewhere are either aftermarket Mexican seals or the aforementioned
errantly labeled "German VW" ones.
