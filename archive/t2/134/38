I have been driving a bus in Southwestern Ohio for nearly 10 years.  Some of my buses have been in various states of repair and dis-repair. I have NEVER ever been pulled over by the cops. One time I even ran out of gas on the side of the road, and I had EXPIRED tags. Well, an officer of the Clinton County Sherriff, stops to help.  He gave me a lift to the gas station AND he agreed NOT to write me up for the expired tags. Pretty cool, huh?  However, when I was in college, driving a beat up F*ord Bronco with Grateful Dead stickers all over it, I was like a frigging cop magnet. A bunch of lame pull-overs, but no tickets! Cops were just fishin for drunks or drugs or hippies or something, I don't know.  They found no alcohol or drugs, just one tire looking hippie.  Anyway, I've found that if you be respectful and you're not an idiot (even though it's really hard sometimes when you're getting hassled by "the man"), most of these stops will NOT result in any sort of citation. FWIW.
