Changing the subject here a bit but your window full of stickers reminded=
 me of a recent event.  I was out working on my new Adventurewagon a coup=
le weeks ago and a couple came by that I've known for close to 25 years. =
 They live just down the street and are familiar with all of my vehicles =
including our original '71 Westy that I sold a few years ago so the direc=
tion the conversation went was kind of a surprise to me.  So, this lady p=
roceeds to tell me that when she was a kid her parents bought one of thes=
e in Europe (presumably a Westy, not an Adventurewagon) and they had trav=
eled through 21 countries that summer.  I could see that glint of fond re=
membrance in her eyes as I encouraged to tell me more.  I was a little su=
rprised at some of the details she remembered because she's mentally reta=
rded and the only job she can hold down is folding napkins at a local res=
taurant.  The specific number of countries was one of those details until=
 she told me that her parents put stickers
from each country on the window -- and they kept the window when they sol=
d the Bus.  She says they still have the window as a memento of that spec=
ial summer.
