Subject: 81 Vanagon

Hello,  

I bought an 81 Vanagon a couple of years ago.  It does not run and was told 
it needs a new engine.  I would like to have the engine rebuilt.  I love it 
and especially am looking forward to camping.  However is it smart for me to 
put money into this being that I have no mechanical experience?   Many people 
are trying to talk me out of this.  But I am hoping for a rebuilt engine and 
then nothing else to go wrong.  Any advise would be great.  Also, any 
recommendations for a VW mechanic in Northern Idaho.  Thank you.
