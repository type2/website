Humble Martinez
I too find myself humbled by my interaction with my Bus. I believe this is a 
proccess that has been sent to us select few to refine the higher qualities 
of humility and personal growth...:-]
Anyway
I can't help you with what to do with your present dilema, but I can tell you 
how I put together my oil temp rig...
I bought an oven digital thermometer (Wallmart $20); they come with a 12" 
probe (bent) and an 15-20 ft long mini jack extension (Radio Shack $10)...I 
carefully straightened the probe, it slides nicely down the oil dipstick 
tube, and blocked off the top with some rubber vacuum hose (kept in place 
with ties). Ran it under the bus to the top of the dashboard and plugged it 
into the gauge that has a magnetic bottom and Presto! it works great. The 
nice thing about this is that it runs on one aabattery; it can be unplugged; 
it has an alarm when  it reaches the temp you preset, the wires comming out 
of the probe are braided stainless, and its accurate and cheap (pretest in 
boiling water).
Aloha,
Jeff Raven
