I found this confusing also...I replaced my 009 with a 205s single port 
vacuum advance.  The problem is that it seems vacuum advance dizzy's install 
at 180 deg out.  I had to find #1 and reset the wires 1-4-3-2 
counterclockwise and set the advance at 8deg atdc.  This worked for me. You 
need 30cfm to advance. According to what Ive gotten on the list before, if 
you have the dual port, then you should plug the retard port on the dizzy as 
this is for emmission control and is not neccessary.  Also, I had been 
hearing for years about the advantages of the Tiger581 CDI, and got one of 
them (Aircooled.net)...After running one for the last 6 months, I wouldnt be 
without one...When used with a vac adv diz, the power difference and instant 
start is great.
As far as the coil is concerned, with just the vac diz, I believe reg blue 
coil works fine.
