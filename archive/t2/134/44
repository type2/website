Subject: Re: [T2] so we got in the red vw microbus...

Never been pulled over in my bus. It's a '72 hardtop westy, and while it'll 
never win a show, it's very clean. All electrics functioning, no billowing 
smoke, no stickers (except the fresnel lens), and very good paint with a 
couple minor scratches on the right rear.

On the other hand, I've been pulled over half a dozen times between several 
Saab 900s and my roommate's candy apple red Grand Am. Doing 60 in a big 
yellow bus just doesn't draw attention the same way doing 104 in a bright 
red convertable does, I guess.
