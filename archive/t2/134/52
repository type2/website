The fastest way to 
register is to use our Online Registration Form.  It
is on our website (http://www.northwestvwclub.org/) 
in the Spring Meet Preregistration Area under Spring
Meet.  Just fill in the info and click Submit!  You
can also 
download the Pre-registration form in either .PUB or
.GIF format.  If none of these will work for you, just
let me know and I'll get a form out for 
you.  (But all these are much faster than Snail Mail.
: )  )

Take Care and we look forward to seeing you at  Spring

Meet!
