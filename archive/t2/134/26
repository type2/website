Subject: Engine stand

I recently bought a 750 lb capacity engine stand at Harbor Freight for $40!  
I used it for my Type IV teardown and will use it for the rebuild 
eventually.  Took the engine out of the car with heat exchangers still 
attached, took off the transmission, put it on the stand, it held it all 
with no problems.  It rolls, will swivel the engine, etc.

I got it on the stand with the help of 1 person.  I attached the mount of 
the engine stand onto the bell housing.  I then used an SUV jack with a 21" 
lift to jack the engine up, set 2 cinder blocks on the floor in the upright 
(tall) position, lowered the engine down to rest the heat exchangers on the 
cinder blocks.  Put the jack on a cinder block in the horizontal (short) 
position, lifted the engine up.  The long leg of the stand would not fit 
under the engine with the jack on the cinder block, so I picked the stand 
up, inserted the engine stand mount that was attached to the engine into its 
position on the stand, then pushed the engine off the cinder blocks and onto 
the stand.  Worked like a CHAMP, and only needed a helper to balance the 
engine when lifting.

Pmail me if you have questions (or if I didn't explain myself fully).
