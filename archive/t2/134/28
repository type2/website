Hmm, about 10 years ago, my uncle, a mechanic and junkyard owner, did
a repo for one of the local banks.  He said that before he could repo
the car, the owners put sugar in the gas tank.  He repo'd the car and
shortly there after the sugar ruined the engine, or so he said.

If sugar doesn't dissolve in gas, then I wonder if dissolving the sugar
in water and then dumping the mixture in the (full) gas tank would have
any different of an effect, not that I aim to find out.

ObBusContent:  My wife and kids ran into several buses (and owners)=20
at a pet store here in Wilmington last week.  My daughter (she's 5)
informed me when she got home that some people actually drive their
buses on the highway, not just around the neighborhood.  Trying to
explain the exhaust valve problem on #1 got me nowhere with her, so
I guess I'll spend the evening cleaning up my shop and getting mentally=20
prepared for an engine pull (and head removal) this weekend.
