Subject: Need a couple parts

Hi all.
My 74 westy miraculously passed emmisions today even
though it is running the almost dead beetle motor that
is missing a few pieces of tin. So now that it good to
go and has plates on it. I can focus on install ing
the 1.8 motor that I aqquired recently. I need the cup
things that mount the hanger bar to the frame of the
bus. I could also use a functioning licence plate
light for a 74 because the extra 71 unit I have
doesn't fit. If anybody has these and would be willing
to sell them let me know.
Thanks,
Tyler
