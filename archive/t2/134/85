Subject: Re: [T2] 79 Cali dist

Sorry, your mechanic is wrong. You have to use the correct coil. Go get a
68 -79 Bentley. Section 5, page 78. 20.1 Special coil.
"The basic description of coil operation, installation, and maintenance given
in 19.1 Coil applies equally to the special coil installed on vehicles with
breakerless transistorized ignitions. However, under no circumstances should a
coil other than VW part # 211 905 115C be used with the breakerless
transistorized system."

And where are you going to get the special harness between the module and the
distributor??

Before you go back to him, get a 80 - 85 Vanagon Bentley, go to page 28.8.
Except for the idle stabilizer and the dist. drive at the bottom, THESE are
all the parts you NEED to make this swap
work. Sorry, you cannot piece together standard ignition parts with this
system.

Perhaps if he distrusts list info, maybe he will believe the info in the
Bentley.
