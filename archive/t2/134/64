In roughly 10 years of bus motoring, I have been pulled over once, by a
rookie deputy who didn't know how to properly enter an amateur radio plate
into his car's computer.  It came up "not found" which in the cop's mind
means "bogus".  I showed him how to properly enter the plate number with a
space in the middle ("N7 TNK" versus "N7TNK") and we talked buses for a
bit until he had to go investigate a domestic disurbance.

I have a standard '71 station wagon, original paint, lots of antennas, and
the only sticker is for the Disaster Communications Service, a Sheriff's volunteer
group.  My bus carries more of geek aura than a hippie aura!  :)
