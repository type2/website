Subject: Oil filter mount

Whilst changing the oil filter on my 1800 type two I noticed the lower bolt 
that secures the oil filter mounting was loose I have replaced it with a 
nylock one but when I did this I found the top one is not much tighter, Due 
to the position of the oil cooler I cannot get at the top nut. So my question 
is 1) has any body managed to get at this without removing the oil cooler (or 
damaging it)? 2) If not, is it possible to remove the oil cooler without 
taking out the engine? 
                                  thanks Mel
