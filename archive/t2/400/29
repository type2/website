So it's a painted-up Astro.  What makes it more real then the Scooby bus?
Is that what they used in the new movie?

The "original" was a cartoon.  It was a flatish-nosed panel van of some
variety.  Presumably, since it had a bench front seat most of the time, it
had to be a mid or rear engine van.

I'd assume it was Dodge, Ford, or Chevy van from the 60s, which had the
engine mid-mounted under the floor.  All of the rear-door shots I can
remember from the cartoons had double doors at the rear that opened to a
flat floor.

Bus content?  No VW bus ever had double rear doors. :)
