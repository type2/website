If you want to test it correctly, get a fuel pressure tester and stick
it on there.  There are two different pressures that you need to test,
anyways; with and without vacuum line.

Plus, you could probably have a few things going wrong.  For one, the
AFM could be off, so what's happening is that it's really running lean,
but then when you clamp the line it starts shooting more fuel so it runs
normal.  Fuel delivery is dependant on the correct pressure.  Check the
bentley for the proper order to test the EFI.

FI's great if you get it running right.  If you're even more daring, get
a Megasquirt and you can tune it to your heart's content ;)
