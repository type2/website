Hi Volks,

I just sent a pair of 76-79 cylinder heads off to a local machine shop 
for beadblasting and a valve job. They are also going to remove three 
broken exhaust studs for me.

Can someone please confirm whether these heads have 8mm x8 mm studs or 
are the studs 8mm x 9mm like on the 1.8L heads I disassembled recently.

P/N's for the correct part would be appreciated. With any luck I might 
be able to get things together and get a 2L into my bus this weekend.

Thanks!
