Subject: RE: [T2] 76 transporter hydraulic lifters?

ok thanks all i will go home tonight and try to make sure she is set in time and then laterz tomorrow night i will take a quick peak at the pushrods and that way if needed be then i can adjust them///
...

thanks for the info...
so when i get the pushrods out then i can try to see if a magnet sticks to them or not ?
and when and if the magnet does stick this means that they are hydraulic lifters...?
ok cool thanks..................
