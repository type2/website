You know I just had that same problem in my 85 Fiat X1/9 which has a similar
fuel injection system as your 83 Westy. Make sure your connections to your
fuel pump are tight and that it's held well to the car (how ever it's
mounted). Also check to make sure all of the engine mounting and bolts
holding the tranny and engine together are tight. If something is loose, the
jarring action of the clutch can cause chatter.

The Bowden tube idea may work too, just my option is easy to check first and
rules out issues. Heck if worked on my Fiat!

I'll be going along and then suddenly its like my car
loses power for a couple of seconds or like its
running out of gas.  the tachometer skips all over the
place and then if I push in the clutch and then let it
out again it seems to stop.  It almost always happens
when I have just shifted into a gear.

Is this a fuel injection problem, a coil problem, fuel
pump, or distributor problem?  or something else?
