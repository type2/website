The hyd lifters came on the 78 & up. But that's just if it been left
alone for all those years :) You need to double check & confirm what
you have though. The solid & hydaulic both have different pushrods,
but that wouldn't stop someone from using the wrong ones either. Here
is what I would do.

1. remove the valve cover
2. remove the rocker arms.
3. pick one valve (any) and remove the pushrod.
4. then use a magnet on a stick to remove one of the lifters. It
   should just slide right out.
5. look at the lifter. a solid one is one piece. the hydraulic is a
   few different pieces & if it's not primed the center (where the
	pushrod sits) can be pushed into the lifter.

now that you know which one it is, simply make sure all the valves are
set correctly.

after you confirm hyd lifters yes they are for the most part
maintenance free.

mabey. You can count on the notch & timing scale ligning up for 0 when
the #1 cyl is at the top of it's path. However it might not be TDC of
the compression stroke. You confirm this by watching the vales. I
verify that by making sure that the valves on #1 are not rocking (i.e.
opening/closing) when the mark is near the TDC spot. If the engine is
known to me to have the distributor correct I usually just make sure
the rotor button in the dizzy is pointing toward the little mark on
the distributor which indicates #1.

yes time the engine on #1 cyl. But save youself some trouble. just
hook the timing light to the battery. He might be used to having to
hook it to the coil from beetles (remember their batteries are under
the rear seat)

hope this helps. just verify this stuff. I would seriously make darn
sure your distributor is hooked up correctly & proper.
