Subject: Front sway bar clamps

Does anyone have the stainless steel front sway bar clamps their either got
with the sway-a-way F&R kit or from aircooled.net? The front kit I believe
uses the sucky stock clamps.

I'm in a desperate need to locate a set of these clamps so I can leave for a
trip on time. As no one seems to carry any stock, I believe I know where to
source them from but I need to know the clamp dimensions as I've never seen
them.

The stock style clamps are a SOB to deal with and I couldn't get them on. I
could get some help but if you ever have to remove a torsion arm in future
it seems like a big hassle to deal with all over again.
