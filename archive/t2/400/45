Details please! I've been chasing charging demons since I got my bus. Last
fall I replaced my alternator, battery, and tried three VRs and still don't
seem to get proper charging. It's OK as long as I drive 50 miles at a time -
but around town I occasionally have to get a jump.

I've cleaned my grounds until I could see my reflection in the metal. What I
haven't done (yet!) is replace the ground straps (which seem fine - no
fraying) or replace the wiring harness between the alternator, starter and VR.

I'm about to embark on a major overhaul of the organization of my charging
system. I'm going to install a deep-cycle aux battery with the Hella kit and
run just the headlights (using a relay kit and new wiring) and starter off the
regular battery. I'm considering moving both batteries under the passenger
seat in the back too.

Any input would be appreciated!

P.S. Thanks everyone for the input on the FRS radios. Seems to be the best bet
is to buy the cheapest set I can find. Avoid GMRS. And spend a little extra
for the boom-mike for hands-free operation.
