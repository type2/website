Subject: Re: [T2] my bus has NOTHING to do with ScoobyDoo!!

It can't be that bad!!

	My Bus gets called the Scooby Doo van. The girl across the way has
insisted to her parents that she wants a Scooby Doo van. She's 16 now, and
just learning to drive. Her parents asked me if I was willing to sell my Bus
to them and how much I wanted. I told them that I just got it less than half
a year ago, and I wasn't ready to part with it yet. (Which I don't think
I'll ever do unless it's to another car hobbiest). In any case, her father
said she wants a blue one just like ours and she wants to put all the scooby
graphics on it. Funny... I grew up watching Scooby Doo, I never thought the
kids of today would like it.. damn, I can't believe I said Kids of today..
I'm only 25 and I still think of myself as 16. 

Anyway, some people call it a Scooby Van, others call it a Hippie Van, I
call it a Bus. The point is, people appreciate it.. people appreciate the
fact that someone took the time and effort into fixing up and restoring a
piece of American history from the early 70s (even if it was made in
Germany). So even if half the pot smoking done in Fort Lauderdale was done
in this one VW Bus... that's ok with me, because now, it's my Bus. :)

does anybody recall what vehicle the mystery machine was in the scooby 
doo movie?  It was so awful I didn't get very far into it but I vaguely 
recall that the mm did have an appearance and something does tell me 
that if it was an aircooled VW I would have remembered.  besides that 
the cartoon car gives horrible details for determining which type of 
vehicle it is.  it's two demensional and painted trippy.  smoking more 
pot than shag or scoob had to be that freaky writers.

i can also feel for those who don't like mislabels for their buses.  I 
have a 76 bus that has been occasionally called a "hippy van".  1976 for 
cry'n out loud.  figure it out people.

Yea by 76, the summer of love was a memory and what you saw on the
street were either the chevy van "disco love machines" or "Spirit of
76". Funny, one doesn't see many of those still driving around.
