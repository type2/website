Subject: Alternator light blinks

I know that this is a long shot but I am going to ask before I get out the
Volt meter and really look into this so here goes. I noticed that at night
with the headlights on and engine running at idle or at speed  when I use
my turn signals the battery/alternator light blinks very faintly. I have
not tried seeing if this happens during the day by doing it in a dark
garage. I definately cant notice it even on a cloudy day. I am guessing it
is some sort of weak short in the turn signal circuit that only gets
connected when the headlights and turn signals are both activated.  So
before I dig deeper has anyone else ever had this problem and what was the
culprit.? I do know that the battery and charging system are in great shape
and I never notice any other symptoms like the radio display getting dimmer
or the headlights getting dimmer with the blinking. Any help is always
appreciated...

Also thanks for the part number on those type IV valve cover bails my
dealer had them for 7.25.
