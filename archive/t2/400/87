How interesting!  Great home fab, David.

I see that you have a standard Bay?  I have a late Westy, so I
have the felt-on-birch overhead liner which gives me a nice flat
surface (with about 3" of vertical, insulated space between top
of roof and birch) which should make a nice mount for a
late-model, digital all-in-one console.

I would LOVE to learn how I might rig a head temp or oil temp
sensor into an overhead console that otherwise digitally displays
outside temp.  And truthfully, the idea of a digital compass is
pretty exciting, too.
