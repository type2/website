Here's my view of the American mind-set regarding
Scooby Doo and VW buses.
Let's be totally honest with ourselves, Shaggy &
Scooby were pot-heads! Come on, they were always
sneaking away from the group, they were always having
the munchies for this weird stuff that they ate. And
the paranoia, these two were always wigging about what
was around the next corner or behind the door. So we
have these pot smokers (Shaggy also had long hair and
a beard) riding around in a flat-nosed van in the
1970's. 
Even though you and I know that VW buses are not a
hippy-pot thing, thats what they represent to a lot of
feeble minded American people, so, Pot + Flatnose van
+ 1970's = VW BUS!!
Yours Truly, 
John Baker, Definitely a child of the 70's

P.S. I have always thought that the Mystery Machine
looked most like a Vanagon, but of course VW hadn't
invented the Vanagon at the time Scooby Doo was in
first-runs. I think that the lawyers for
Hannah-Barbera should have sent a threatening letter
to VWoA when the Vanagon was presented telling them
they had to "cease and desist" use of this van that
was obviously styled after their Mystery Machine!!
