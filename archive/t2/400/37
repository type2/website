The only thing wrong wth these oder Chevy's was the front end--
The I-Beam wasn't the best for a smooth  ride--

Had one with a 6 with 3 on the tree, and the other was a 88 and had a
327 powerglide---

It boogied--and got one heck of a lot better fuel economy than any of my
VW's--:>)

Yea Pat--you could sit there and drive and "dial a tune" by cranking the
distributor around---pretty wild--and simple.

I had a 68 Chevy like that back in 78. It was realy nice to be able to
drive down the road & adjust the timing while you were driving since the
timing chain was so loose. Only van I ever had outside of a VW.
