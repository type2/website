I totally agree.  Personally I think design is really important when 
doing your costum stuff.  I would like some thing that 
looks-like-factory-if-only-they-had-thought-of-it.  I just don't want my 
bus to stop looking like a bus... after a point it just makes sense to 
get a jeep.  (which is why I don't like water cooled conversionsall that 
much).

A cool thing about the type 2 that seperates it from it's other 
aircooled counterparts is all that space you have.  In addition to a the 
overhead console - get this - one or two sound bars to hold a nice set 
of speakers.  also an SUV inspired idea.  something molded in fiberglass 
and then upholstered with matching liner from the roof.  obviousy 
campers would be different.  I don't know if anyone is selling or doing 
this already but I like and am considering doing it one day.

for a smooth design i really suggest fiberglass be done however i done 
think it could be done on a practicle budget.  The instruments will be 
the least of your worries.  Anything thats been wired once can be wired 
again.  Don't know about stuff that comes from other cars though.  They 
(their instruments) might be dependant on their computers to operate. 
 Who knows.
