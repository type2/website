I spent alot of time with the voltmeter - even running with it on my dash and
connected to the fat red wire underneath. I get the same thing no matter what:

About 11.5-12V until the engine is brought up to 3000RPM the first time - then
13.3-13.5V.

This is 'right' according the factory specs - but is this right for newer
batteries?

There is no real difference in price now for GMRS - except that they require
an FCC license to operate. FRS looks like it does everything I need.

Maybe the $0/fry's FRS for now and GMRS later...
