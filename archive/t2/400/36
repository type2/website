I'll be going along and then suddenly its like my car
loses power for a couple of seconds or like its
running out of gas.  the tachometer skips all over the
place and then if I push in the clutch and then let it
out again it seems to stop.  It almost always happens
when I have just shifted into a gear.  

Is this a fuel injection problem, a coil problem, fuel
pump, or distributor problem?  or something else?
