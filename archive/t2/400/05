Thanks, Richard.  G missed the 1975, being a `77. :O(

I suppose that I'll have to try to put things back to factory?  Dump the
carb and go back to FI?  (Please, this isn't intended to generate a thread
on carb vrs. FI!)

I was planning on having a certified mech help me bring the bus back up to
snuff, but I was thinking of Georgia standards, not PA.  Going to PA
standards may be a much more expensive proposition...
