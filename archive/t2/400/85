this is a high output pump. stock has 26mm gears.

the melling pumps are known to leak. you are better off with a schadek 30mm
type 1 pump. aircooled.net sell them already blueprinted.

a new pump can be blueprinted. get a copy of the book "how to hotrod VW
engines", there is a section on how to do it.

yes. if you have a melling it is a type 1 pump.

right. the reason people do it is because there is only one size of pump
available for type IV motors - 26mm. so if you want a higher capacity pump,
you have to go to a type 1 unit. plus the stock t4 oil pumps cost 3x what a
good 30mm schadek aluminum type 1 pump costs.

yes. another reason why the stock t4 pump is a good idea. - they have a
better sealing system and are much less prone to leaking. type 1 pumps are
leakers almost by design. but if you assemble things really well, they won't
leak.

the other thing about the type 1 pump is that there may be a clearance
problem with the cam, depending on what kind of cam you are using - if it
has a bolt-on gear you may need to clearance the pump body. the pump cover
also may need clearancing to fit on the case - it can interfere with one of
the fan shroud mounting bosses.
