Which is why I'm glad to pay the $24.95 per month for hosting at NTT/Verio
for my domains.  (I don't work for or advertise for them.)

I just couldn't find a free ISP that was dependable enough to trust with my
domains.  And I wanted the stability of paid hosting.  Here's what I use for
most of my domains hosted by them:

Bronze Plan (Minimum plan, others available)
Monthly Data Transfer Limit: 7500 MB
Disk Space Limit: 250 MB
E-mail Accounts: 20 POP, 20 Aliases, & 20 Autoresponders

One of the domains is for a non-profit org and uses a larger plan at 99.95
per month:

Gold Plan
Monthly Data Transfer Limit: 12,500 MB
Disk Space Limit: 350 MB
E-mail Accounts: 40 POP, 40 Aliases, & 40 Autoresponders

Great support, user-friendly control interface for managing each domain,
tons of free modifications for your website, marketplace goodies for
business domains, good email filtering at the mail server to help eliminate
SPAM, no pop-up ads or other advertising, and almost no serious downtime.
Worth the cost per year to have such good service.

If you need a lot of server space and/or traffic bandwidth for your on-line
bus content, this might be something to consider.
