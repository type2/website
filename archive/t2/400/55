Subject: Re: [T2] my bus has NOTHING to do with ScoobyDoo!!

does anybody recall what vehicle the mystery machine was in the scooby 
doo movie?  It was so awful I didn't get very far into it but I vaguely 
recall that the mm did have an appearance and something does tell me 
that if it was an aircooled VW I would have remembered.  besides that 
the cartoon car gives horrible details for determining which type of 
vehicle it is.  it's two demensional and painted trippy.  smoking more 
pot than shag or scoob had to be that freaky writers.

i can also feel for those who don't like mislabels for their buses.  I 
have a 76 bus that has been occasionally called a "hippy van".  1976 for 
cry'n out loud.  figure it out people.
