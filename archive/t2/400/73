yes, but it might be difficult to tell which alternator you had by looking
at the duct, but there are a few other ways to tell them apart:

1/ if your alternator has a fan on the pulley, it should be a 70A unit.

2/ the 70A unit has a cast aluminum rear cover, the 50A unit has a black
painted sheet metal cover.

3/ on the 70A unit, the wires are visible from the outside (you really have
to get in there to see this, but they are there). on the 50A unit, the
harness passes thru the rear cover in a grommet and you can't see the actual
connections.
