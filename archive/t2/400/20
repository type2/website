I saw the 1975 cut-off date at the PA Inspection website and assumed that it
was correct.  I did think that it was a bit excessive, though.  Thanks for
the update.

Is there any downside to registering the bus as an antique in PA?  Here in
Georgia it's mostly just the cost of the plate ($80.00).  There doesn't seem
to be any restrictions to go along with the antique status here.

Thanks.  My next question was going to be where to find a good shop. :O)

I grew up in PA and my folks (and most of the rest of my relatives) live
just north of Philly.  My parents are getting up in years, and my son has
spent his entire life down here (he's 16) and doesn't really understand what
it's like to have an extended family.

The casting business is fairly portable, too.  It's really just a matter of
raising the funds for the move.

Thanks for the help!
