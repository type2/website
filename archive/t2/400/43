Subject: 76 transporter hydraulic lifters?

--Cha,

new mechanic time.

solid valves on a stock 76. hydrualics on 78-79.
you must adjust your valves to .006" every 3000 miles.
What is your engine code? (ie: ge, gd, etc...)

timing 7.5 before top dead center on 76.

just hook the timing gut +/- to the battery. then you can make no error.

Got Bentley?
