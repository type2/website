I have a an older Radio Shack (gasp!) AM/FM Cassette player in my bus.  It's
the radio from my previous vehicle, and I've had it since the unit was new.

Interestingly enough, I had a problem with the battery slowly discharging
over a few days in the PV that I couldn't run down.  What a surprise when
the problem accompanied the radio to the bus...

Turns out that something in the radio has shorted.  I can even see a couple
of toasted diodes in there through the cassette slot.  Might be the result
of an old cola splash or simply old age, but the crux of the matter is that
as long as the radio is wired to a circuit that is "off" when the iggy key
is off, it works without draining the battery.  Hook it up to a live
circuit, and the battery will eventually go gently to sleep over a few days.

I'll replace it eventually, but for now it works well enough to suffice for
our simple audio needs.
