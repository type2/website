Subject: Oil pump questions

List,
  I have researched the archives and am now turning to list for suggestions.  
I am putting together a '74 dual carburetted engine with auto-transmission.  
This engine had a problem with HIOP in the past.  It will have a reground 
crank and new bearings etc.  I purchased a new Melling oil pump with 30mm gears.  
Don't know if it is supposed to be high output or stock.
  What do people mean by 'Blueprinting" the oil pump?  Is this something I 
need to do to the new pump?  My old pump had scoring in the chambers and .006" 
clearance on the gears and sidewall, and maybe .002" clearance on the cover 
plate: worn out junk-yes?
   Is it possible to use a Type 1 oil pump?  I read some articles about this 
but it didn't sound like a great idea to me.
   Last question:  My old pump had an "o-ring" to seal the cover plate and 
the new pump has a paper-type gasket.  The paper gasket is the correct seal 
right?
