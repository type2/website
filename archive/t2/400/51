Subject: RE: [T2] 76 transporter hydraulic lifters?

not really sure...
i have some old pushrod tubes that came from the bus that i could use to see if they are magnetic...
they are very light i remember and they felt like maybe made from aluminum but without going home and cleaning them up a bit and sticking magnet to them i do not know..

these old tubes were replaced with new pushrod tubes from the depot..
