In the winter I kept my trickle-charger connected to my battery and would hook
up an extension cord at night. Should really be necessary in Tennessee...

I'm pretty certain my radio is drawing power. It's not wired into the
ignition. But I wouldn't think the radio memory would really drain that much.
But that problem will be releived when I wire in the aux battery. I'll run all
accessories off the aux.
