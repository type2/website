Well to me on the surface this sounds like a hack job of a garage. A
VW friendly garage might do a quick "lets see what happens if" but
will follow it up with a proper diagnostic & determine if the part
needs replacing or if it was actually correcting another problem. But
this garage might just be trying to do it as good as they possibly
can. If the garage is simply not familiar w/ the VW FI system, & they
seem competent they really won't have any problem getting more info.
Perhaps fax them the FI section of the Bentley.

Anyway the regulator test is very simple to do & they should be able
to check it quickly w/ readily available tools. check the bentley (I
still haven't found mine since my move :(
