Note also that the "Mystery Machine" in the photo is a Chevrolet 
Astrovan. That model postdates the Scooby Doo series by about thirty 
years.  My recollection of the original series is that the cartoon 
vehicle was modeled on a Corvan. Calling the pictured van the "real" 
Mystery Machine is like calling the Batmobile in Batman Forever the real 
Batmobile <http://www.javelinamx.com/Batmobile/batcar1.htm> or like 
calling the "Bullitt Edition" Mustang 
<http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupe/112_0108_bullitt/> the real 
Bullitt Mustang. (Odd... can't find a link to the new Batmobile, the old 
Mustang or the old Mystery Machine.)

I guess you just have to be old. But Corvan would answer the question of 
American van styling and rear engine.
