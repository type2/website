Subject: [T2] Alternator, rebuilt, high output, lifetime fact warranty,

Hello,

On the same note as Snoopy post about different
cooling boots being used on the 55Amp vs. the 70Amp
alternators, I was looking through The Bus Depot's new
sight and they show an alternator that is suppose to
be a Bosch rebuilt high output alternator rebuilt by
Bosch. Here is a link to the alternator.

Is this a mistake or is this some type of new design
made with an exterior cooling fan so it does not need
a ventilation boot?  I am in the market for a new
alternator and was planing on buying one of their
Bosch rebuilt high output alternators to replace my
locked up standard 74 alternator but now I don't know
if it is such a good idea. I would also have to change
out the voltage regulator and install one made for the
70Amp alternator, right? Any insight on this picture?
Thanks in advance!

Regards,

David Kelly
