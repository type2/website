Subject: Re: [T2] my bus has NOTHING to do with ScoobyDoo!!

I get the same thing all the time with a
sage green westy.  I always correct them
and say that the scooby-doo van was
a chevy or dodge VAN not a VW BUS!
Why do i get comments about my bus relating to Scooby? My bus is not a
"ScoobyMobile". I don't want people to sing the scooby song when they see my
bus.

Arrgh, and also i hate it when people call my bus a van. It's not a van.
It's a bus.
