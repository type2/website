Subject: alternator 55 amp or 70 amp

How do I know which alternator I have?  I need to
replace mine (was still charging but it seized!) and I
don't know which one I have.  I assumed I have the 55
amp but now I wonder.

I have a completely stock 77 westy (no stove, or
fridge, just the ice-box), although I do have dealer
installed (under the dash) A/C but that hasn't worked
since I owned her.

Any help would be great!
