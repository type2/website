But you are assuming that this alternator is somehow being billed as an
"upgrade" to your stock alternator. It is not (at least not on my site,
can't speak for others). The higher amperage alternator was originally
found on some busses (notably later models with air conditioning), the
lower amperage one in others. The reason both are listed is so you can
buy the correct one, not because one is purported to be a drop-in
substitution for the other. (In fact, if you buy the Bosch-rebuilt
version, which has a core deposit, you're required to return the same
model core as the one you bought.)  Yes, you can upgrade from one to the
other if you can make or find a different boot. But like many
alterations from stock (i.e. putting earlier heater boxes on a later
bus, etc.) when you substitute parts from a different vehicle, you will
often come up against having to do a bit of modification. As the first
person said, we're not mind readers, and using a part for a purpose
other than that for which it was intended really is beyond our control,
(unless of course it is a case where we are ourselves recommending the
substitution).
