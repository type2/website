"...Is there any downside to registering the bus as an antique in PA?  Here
in
Georgia it's mostly just the cost of the plate ($80.00).  There doesn't seem
to be any restrictions to go along with the antique status here...."

Registering a vehicle as an antique or classic here imposes rather severe
limitations on use of the vehicle.  The law reads something like..."limited
to driving to and from parades and shows and the occasional maintenance
drive".  I think they define maintenance drive as once a week, but they
don't specify how many miles.

I do not have my bus registered as an antique or classic, to avoid any
issues with the local constabulary.
