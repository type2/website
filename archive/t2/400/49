Subject: RE: [T2] 76 transporter hydraulic lifters?

Another option is to use a magnet on your pushrods. Just got this figured
out a couple weeks back. The pushrods for the solid lifters are supposed to
be aluminium with steel tips. The pushrods for hydraulic are all steel, so
if the magnet picks up the push rod, they're for the hydraulic lifters.
