Well, a core by its very definition is a rebuildable version of the
rebuilt unit you bought. Rather than wait to have your unit rebuilt, you
buy a rebuilt one, pay a deposit, and get the deposit back when the
rebuilder gets your old one back so they can rebuild it for someone
else. In all cases, with any parts house, you must return a core of the
same model that you purchased. Neither could you buy a 2 liter engine
and return a 1.8 liter core. If everyone did that, there would be no
more 2 liter cores to rebuild (or high output alternators), as some
people might want a 2 liter in place of a 1.8, but no one buys a 1.8 to
replace their 2 liter.  (Incidentally our website says that you are
required to return the "old, rebuildable part" upon receipt of the
replacement. Nowhere does it say that you can substitute a rebuildable
part of an entirely different model.) If you are lucky, the Bosch
distributor might not even notice the discrepency. Worst case, you'd
still get the value of the low-output alternator core that you returned
(although I don't recommend this practice as a rule, as it pisses them
off).

We don't guarantee to catch all errors that customers make, and with as
many orders as we process, many (even most) do get by us. But we do try
to add that extra personal touch of contacting a customer we happen to
notice that he has ordered something that won't fit his bus.  Most
customers thank us for "going that extra mile" and saving them the
time/hassle of getting the wrong part.  If the person does not return
the message, the salesperson may be inclined to pull the part off the
order rather than to ship a part that he knows does not fit the vehicle
that was entered into the order.  As I said, we're not mind readers. If
we caught a customer's mistake yet shipped the part anyway after leaving
him a message about the error, they'd be complaining that we
intentionally shipped a part that we knew didn't fit!  The only way to
avoid this would be _never_ to try to help the customer when he makes an
apparent mistake - just make it "not our problem." But I think more
customers than not appreciate it when we try to help them out in a
situation like this. 99% of the time they did make a mistake, and by
catching it we saved them a lot of hassle.

Since the order form does ask for the year of your bus, you could note
there that it is for a different bus, or just put "multiple vehicles"
there so they know that you may be ordering for something other than
yours.  

But the alternator is a different story anyway. We'd have had no way of
knowing that you ordered it for a bus that didn't originally have that
model, as both versions are used.
