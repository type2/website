Interesting, so excluding exotic imports, the Mystery Machine is either
a VW Bus or a Chevy Corvair Van..... or a mixture of the two.

I guess that's one of the reasons they call it the Mystery Machine.

Freddie went to check the engine and lo and behold, it
was in the rear! Mind you, the MM looked more like a Dodge (to me
anyway)
and NOT a VW.
