you don't have to be a mind reader. item descriptions are within the vendors
control. you simply put a note on the item description to the effect that
this alternator uses a different cooling boot which is NLA.

if i were selling parts (which i am) we would do it this way. in this
particular case it may simply be an oversight by the vendor.
