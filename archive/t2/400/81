I don't think that a vendor should be responsible for every variation of
our "mix and match" buses.  If a bus owner is going to use non-stock parts
then it is up to that owner to resolve the differences in connecting
hardware.  When I converted my '71 to an alternator nobody warned me about
needing a different fan hub, but I'm not going to get mad at the guy who
sold me the alternator.  He probably wasn't even aware of the difference!
