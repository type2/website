Subject: RE: [T2] Exciting Alternator

A generator has a fixed magnetic field, which may fade over time/disuse, and
may require exciting to regenerate the fixed magnets (I'm not up on how to
do this for automotive units) .

An alternator has a magnetic field which is generated electrically, so it
should be able to fire right up out of the box...however it does need a
semi-charged battery to provide the regulator with the current required to
create the field in the first place. If you have enough battery to start the
vehicle, you have enough to run the alternator. Sounds like something else
is wrong. Did you measure bus voltage with the engine on and off? Check all
the connections again. If two alternators don't work, maybe the voltage
regulator is bad. It is not internal to the alternator; it should be on the
upper right of the forward bulkhead in the engine room (did I say I was in
the navy?).

Does a new alternator require exciting? I installed a new one, but the
battery doesn't recharge (old one was verified bad and yes, the battery's
good). I've gone through all the grounds and connections and can find no
mechanical reason for it to fail. A buddy told me I needed to excite the
alternator, but I thought that was for generators with external regulators
only.
