Subject: Nice photo of child's cot and curtain

Hey, volks!
  Sometimes I snoop around on eBay just to see what people are offering (don't
we all?) and someone is selling a '77 Westy. But this is no plug! What is
interesting about this particular auction is that they have a photo of the
child's cot and curtain, all set up. I thought someone might want to look at
it or save the picture. I do that, too.. I save pictures of nice and
interesting vehicles or details about their interiors.
