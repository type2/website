Subject: Starter?

Just got the replacement starter for my 69 (Bosch SR15N). Is this the right 
starter? From looking at the Advanced Auto website they listed the SR15X, plus 
this thing is tiny as compared to the previous one, I know it was a Jap starter.
The guy I bought it from seems to know his stuff and from talking with others 
is pretty reputable in the area. Just seeing what the list had to say about the 
Bosch part #'s.
