Subject: Re: [T2] Part number match/ compatabilty

 Regarding my previous thread on my bad decel valve. The Bosch part number
on my valve is 0 280 160 303. VW number is 022 133 551 B. I was able to find
one in a local salvage yard in a '75 bus. The Bosch number on it is 0 280
160 300 with VW number 022 133 551 A.

*AHA! Yeeee-ESSSS! That number, 0 280 160 303 is a "vacuum limiter" for a
Porsche 928. I thought that it might work, because the technology had to be
roughly the same for the same year Porsche and VW type 4. These are still
available and it looks as if they will continue to be, since Porsche has a
very active (and somewhat more affluent) collector community and Bosch seems
to be very responsive to and supportive of classic car (German and European
make) collectors.

Now, will the valve I got from the '75 replace the one in my '78 without any
consequence. When I did a part search on the Bosch site, it lists the 303
for 75-78. I am wondering if there is any vacuum pressure difference from
the early FI to the later that would not allow me to use the 300 on my bus.

* I believe that it works somewhat like a carburetor dashpot on earlier
American cars to prevent stalling from sudden deceleration.
But I don't know how well each of these particular parts (300 and 303) will
cross over. They will probably both work, with some minor differences in
performance. My concern with a used one is that since this is something with
a diaphragm and today's fuels are notoriously hard on rubber and composites
(especially when they are allowed to dry out after having once been used),
that your lucky junkyard find will be a short-lived delight.
