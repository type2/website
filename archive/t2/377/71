Chris,
Prices have soared in the last year for automotive paint--

A gallon of PPG Delstar 72182 ( Mack std red ) is 127.90, plus $29.90
for the hardener, plus 20 bucks for the reducer--plus tax your looking
at $202.82.
I remmeber when I could paint a truck for about $125.00 bucks total--

Not any more--

I think the EPA has something to do with this phenomina--

Later,

Terry

And what brand paint for only $75/gallon?? 
Acrylic enamel is less than that the best I recall. Tractor paint (not
that it would be very good for your bus) is about $20 a gallon here in
good old TN.
