Correct.

It's relative to vacuum. 36psi w/o any vacuum and about 28 psi with about
15" of idle vacuum. When you step on the gas the vacuum plummets and the
fuel pressure goes briefly to 36 psi and no more. As you rev the engine to
maxiumum power the vacuum increases to around 25" or so and the fuel
pressure drops to the levels you indicated.
