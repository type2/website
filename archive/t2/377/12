Subject: Re: [T2] 72 Westy Fuel Pump Rod problems

Tom-
I had to gently tap the rod in with a hammer
But had to use Vice grips to pull it back out

Remember this is a 72 with the fuel pump under the motor ahead of the #1
cylinder
It goes in and out, not up and down.
But the more I think about it, it doesn't move smoothly at all.
I'll see if I can't clean out the hole a bit and perhaps turn the rod down a
couple of thousands.

with the hose off, not a drop of gas at all.

Thanks for the reply

Thanks !
