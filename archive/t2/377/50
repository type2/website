Subject: Buses By The Mill

Time is ticking down to the first Buses By The Mill campout and picnic.
A free weekend of camping,eating and talking VW's on the grounds of B.F. 
Clydes Cider Mill. The oldest cider mill in the country.
While we won't be making cider(apples are out of season) the mill will 
be open for viewing and family will be on hand to explain how everything
works.(It's steam operated) Family owned and operated for 6 generations!
It's close to all local Mystic attractions like Mystic Seaport,Aquarium 
and Mystic Village.
Camping is available Friday and Saturday night.
Picnic on Saturday. Please bring a dish to share. We could also use some 
donations for the raffle table.
Sunday there will be a free breakfast for all the campers.
This is also the first Full Moon Bus Club campout in New England.
Hope to see you there. Please let me know if you will be attending.
