Indeed, the SR15 is smaller than the SR17, and apparently the Japan unit. 
Veryify 2 things, that the Bosch ReMan catalogs lists what you got for a 
starter is correct for your application and it comes in a Bosch Corp Box 
with the starter diagnosis and warranty documents they all come with. And 
if it's an SR15, it will come with a replacement bushing wire tied to it. 
If it's doesn't, it's not a REAL Bosch ReMan. The SR17 is MUCH more robust 
than the SR15 and worth every penny as a very easy, acceptable enhancement, 
bolts on with no mods, requires no pilot bushing R&R special tools, as well 
as having longer life. If it gives 15+ years life in a 911, it just might 
last 30 years in a T-IV.
