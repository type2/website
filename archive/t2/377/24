Put on a new pump and gaskets and toss the electric. Think about how long 
that stock pump lasted before it failed. Original Equipment pumps 
(Pierburg) for the T-IV carbed motors are available from Bus Depot, or at 
least they have been recently. Don't know where to look for a German pump 
for a T-I motor if that's what you got. But even a Brazillian will last at 
least as long as most electrics and without the noise or danger of feeding 
gas to a fire if you get rear ended and a hose tears or something.

I have yet to see one of these generic electric pumps still working with 
any age patina on them at all. They all look but a few years at most old 
when they fail, and I've seen quite a few with very much still shinny 
metal, no more than months of life.

Otherwise, remove it and use the spacer for a pattern and make a block off 
plate and seal it with a new gasket. Save that spacer and pump rod so you 
can go back to stock when, not if, the electric fails. There are good 
quality electric pumps designed to feed carbs low pressure, but they are 
not designed to be cheap and cost more than the stock pump, and require 
adapting English nipples and metric hoses to talk to each other.
