That molded hose is NLA. I am still looking for a replacement for mine. The
ID is 22mm. The largest metric vacuum hose Ive been able to find is 17mm. If
you could find a stout enough 13/16 or close smog hose that would work also.
I looked at some of these hoses in a salvage yard today and they didnt look
much better than what I had. It might be hard to find a used one that is not
all dried up and cracked.

Good Luck
