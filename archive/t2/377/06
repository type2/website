Slowly, slowly...

You guys want to look over:

http://www.type2.com/~archives/type2/maillist.html
http://www.type2.com/~archives/vintagebus/maillist.html

At least as of this writing the search links won't work.

There are still a few edit's i'm finding to straighten out broken messages
(ie: type2/msg00147.html)


One problem i'm seeing right of the bat is with the address munging...it's
case sensitive:

http://www.type2.com/~archives/type2/msg01408.html

the .Net didnt get converted.

I'm also seeing that the .COM isn't converted either.


<addressmodifycode>
s/(-at-)/_at_/g;s/\.com/_dot_com/g;  s/\.net/_dot_net/g;
s/\.org/_dot_org/g;s/\.edu/_dot_edu/g;  s/\.gov/_dot_gov/g;
s/\.mil/_dot_mil/g;s/\.us/_dot_us/g;  s/\.de/_dot_de/g;  s/\.uk/_dot_uk/g;
s/\.ca/_dot_ca/g;
</addressmodifycode>

I suck at regular expressions...if anyone wants to tackle'm to make them a
bit more case-flexible lemme know.  They should be similar enough to perl
regex for most cases.

Also, ignore the <><> or broken image at the top of each page...I've been
fiddling with something that still isn't doing what I want in the case of
/not/ having an image or link there.  (the gb-users layout, which is the
justification for working on this stuff at work, uses the same config-but
has an image at the top of each page...ours dont, at least not yet.)


Anyway,

Let me know what you think of the layout/interface at this point.
Suggestions and threats welcome...I like it, but I'm biased.
:)
