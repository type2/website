Subject: Exciting Alternator

Sorry if this has been discussed, but I couldn't find it in the 
archives:

Does a new alternator require exciting?  I installed a new one, but the 
battery doesn't recharge (old one was verified bad and yes, the 
battery's good).  I've gone through all the grounds and connections and 
can find no mechanical reason for it to fail.  A buddy told me I needed 
to excite the alternator, but I thought that was for generators with 
external regulators only.

Help!
