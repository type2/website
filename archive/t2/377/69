Subject: Re: [T2] Exciting Alternator

Don't confuse exciting an alternator with polarizing a generator. 2 very 
different things. The alternator is excited by the indicator bulb in the 
dash. Make sure the blue wire at the alternator is hook up properly. It is 
normal after starting to sometimes rev the motor to 2000 rpm briefly to 
kick in the alternator and shut off the indicator. It should then stay off 
at idle. If that doesn't do it, you have a burned out bulb or not hooked up 
right or poor ground or bad alternator or bad regulator.
