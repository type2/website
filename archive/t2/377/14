John,

Sounds great!  So what effect is the reducer supposed to have on the paint 
and what "bad" will happen because you left it out!

One of the few things on cars I have not done.....paint...but it is
starting to sound more interesting!  I would risk it on my daily driver 
bug just to see what it looks like...

And what brand paint for only $75/gallon??

Cheers, dave
