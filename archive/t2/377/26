They've always been able to do that.  All they do is say "I didn't see
your brake lights" and then proceed to sniff and peek for whatever they
can find.  Your brake lights magically heal during this time and they send
you on your way if they don't find anything else.

The difference here is that municipalities would be allowed to set up
roadblocks and check everyone who passes by.  They don't have to work on
one person at a time, they can cast a wide net.  Considering that the new
car dealers just about own our city council, this is of some concern.
They might decide to crack down on everyone driving a car more than 10
years old so as to promote new car sales and the tax revenue it would
generate.

Not good for us vintage VW folk!
