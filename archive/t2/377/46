Subject: Re:plywood floor in westy

Dave,
    I redid the floor in our 71 a couple of years ago.  The following
combination gave just the right height so there was no space between
the bottom edge of the furniture and the top of the floor.
    1.  One layer of 11/32 inch plywood
    2.  One layer of 1/8 inch masonite
    3.  Comercial grade tiles (about an 1/8 inch thick) glued down
Of course the first step was to clean, repair and paint the metal
floor.  If you need more info just ask.
