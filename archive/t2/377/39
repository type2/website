Subject: fuel sender location

Does anyone have a photo of the hole in the floor cut
to service the fuel sender in a 1975 kombi?

The excellent earlier post has me all motivated to
replace my dud one, I just dont know where to cut.

Whats this GEX ppl talk about, not being a local and
all.....

cheers
