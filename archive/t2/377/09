Subject: 72 Westy Fuel Pump Rod problems

As I mentioned before-
Newer fuel pump, brand new motor, but no gas

I pulled the rod out and checked the length (137mm)
Then last night while watching the Mighty Ducks I had a brain cloud
"what if the rod is fitting in the block too tight and does not return to
follow the lobe on the cam?"
In effect it would pump just one stroke and stop, being extend all the way
out.

So the question to the list is...
How tight is your rod?
or better yet, how tight should it be?

My new engine case was painted silver and I don't know if they got paint down
in there or not.
Could have

What do you think?


Thanks !
