Jasan,

sounds like people are thinking that the decel valve
has fuel connections. ("drying out")

it doesn't. it's a vacuum part. the one I got out of
the yard made an instant noticable difference. 

that's what the yards are for. give it a shot.

I don't understand why people are crapping on you about this. $100 parts are exactly what we try to avoid on this list every single day.

Later,

Billy
