> Can anyone tell me what pump it is?

it looks like a melling cast iron type 1 pump.

> Will a type 1 pump work OK in the type 4 engine?

yes and no. the stock pump works better for a stock engine IMO. the type 1
like this one pump works fine too, is much cheaper, and may have bigger
gears, so can pump more oil. the cons of this type of pump is that they leak
more than a stock pump, and the cast iron is not a good material to use in
the aluminum case due to different expansion rates of the two materials.

if it were my motor i would replace it with a stock type IV pump or a
schadek aluminum bodied type 1 pump.
