The best one I heard here on the list last year- rent an electrostatic paint
gun, and use tractor paint. Little skill required and less paint needed to
cover, so they say. Just like paint electroplating...

John,

Sounds great!  So what effect is the reducer supposed to have on the paint
and what "bad" will happen because you left it out!

One of the few things on cars I have not done.....paint...but it is
starting to sound more interesting!  I would risk it on my daily driver
bug just to see what it looks like...

And what brand paint for only $75/gallon??

Cheers, dave>
