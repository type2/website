Search the archives. It came up not too long ago.

I can tell you that the 7/8" hose they sell at Home Depot (washer,
dishwasher or something hose) is really stiff and doesn't fit despite being
so close to the metric size we all want.

I'm still looking for a great solution to this problem for the future. I'm
hoping to find a commonly available reduction coupling that will allow a
commonly found hose to be used in it's place.
