Subject: My van stalls when hot / rabbit pickup FS

Hey...  So, I took the bus to camp.  I drove for a little over an hour, 
and parked the van to check in.  Ten minutes later, i came out, and it 
wouldn't start.  So, i wait for a while, maybe ten or fifteen more 
minutes, and it starts.  

Now, it also stalls sometimes at red lights and things like that.  I 
don't even know that it stalls, except for the lights coming on.  I 
mean, i can't tell it's going to die so i can give it a bit of gas or 
something.  So now everytime i stop, i give it a bit of gas.  

This is really weird to me.  It's got a brand new #2 temp sensor.  It's 
a 77 2.0 FI.  
Please let me know what i should be looking for.

Also, if anyone is interested in an '81 Rabbit Pickup, with possibly a 
bad engine, but a decent body, please email me off the list.

Thanks...
