Todd,

Take it out and look at it.  Does it look like the other one?

Hook up a VOM to the other sensor and run thru the gears....see if 
anything happens in a particular gear....do you get continuity in a 
certain gear?

I can't imagine it having anything to do with a tach as the location
you are talking about only has gear shifting  mechanisms in it..IIRC

Can you take a picture?

Cheers, dave
