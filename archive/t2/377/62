Subject: Memorial weekend in the Midwest

If you haven't already heard and are wondering what to do this Memorial
weekend, you don't want to miss the MoKan VW show, campout and swap meet in
Lawrence KS.

Lawrence is a great little college town (Kansas University) that has a lot
of history and wonderful shopping on the old downtown main street.

This is going to be a fun event and is located in the beautiful Douglas
county fairground with lots of big old trees on the west side of Lawrence.
The show, swap meet and campout are all located within shouting distance of
each other.  Restrooms and showers are on site.  Some electric sites are
available for a little extra.

Some features of this event:
Friday evening picnic style meal provided by MoKan.
Saturday show vendors inside air-conditioned building.
Many great raffle prizes.
Lots of trophies.
Camp site and Camping vehicle entries can stay where they are for judging.
Saturday evening taco feed handled by the Buskatiers.
Live band Saturday evening inside air-conditioning vendor building.
Lots of great camping, no matter what you camp in.

leave out any VW people.
