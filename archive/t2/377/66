Subject: looking for THIS hose - see pic

    For a 76 FI it's the hose going from the S-hose to the oil breather. 
 Mine broke and I was wondering if this is sold by anybody new, if I 
should start looking in yards, or if a non molded replacement will suffice.

    Here's the link 
http://users.sisna.com/baca1/s_hose_to_oil_breather.jpg it's being held 
together where the break is to give an idea of what it looks like.  Sure 
enough right in the background is it's proud owner.

    Thanks for the help.
