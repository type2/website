Subject: Re: [T2] Need a decel valve

Checked the part number on mine and that is it below. I checked out the one
for the 928 on Pelican Parts and it isnt quite the right one. The 928 was
also a CIS injection. I dont know if that makes a difference. The good news
is I was able to find one at Rocky Mountain Motorworks. I called and the
salesman I talked to said that they were new Bosch units! We'll see if they
are "new" when it arrives. So, if you are in need thats the place.

Thanks for the ideas
