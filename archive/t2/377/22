George,

When the local legislators dropped the yearly safety inspection here, they 
added one that allowed stops for "safety checks".

I figured that was double speak for "now we can stop you and check you out
even if you aren't obviously breaking the law".

Bothers me a lot, so I don't take the convertible out much at night...I 
figured I was safer in my *un*attention getting "other car".

Cheers, dave
