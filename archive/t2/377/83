Subject: The Vengeange of the Generator!!!

Ouch! Last night I went down to the bus and checked the generator output, as
I had some strange battery problems on the past weeks.
What came out is that with engine hot and running, both almost idling or at
high RPMs, the generator gives out some 13.69 volts.
My (poor) knowledge tells me that it should read 'round 14.1, right? Is it
the Voltage Regulator to blame? How can I check/fix that?!? Where do I find
the thing on a 1600cc?

Thanks,

Andy
