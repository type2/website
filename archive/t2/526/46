Subject: Re: [T2] restricted EGR

I spent abount an hour with compressed air and bailing wire cleaning out 
my air manifold.  I had the part off the car, so I stuck the wire into 
the egr port, and then also pushed it through the holes where the 
exhaust air exits (by the runner ports) and kept at it 'till I freed all 
the gunk.  Then I cleaned it out with brake cleaner and used the bailing 
wire some more.  Once I got all the crap out, it flows air like a charm.

If you're using compressed air, use some ear plugs because the air 
flowing through that thing is really loud!
