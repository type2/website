Take Snoopy's warning on this!!  

I was using my 73 Westy about 8 years ago in the sultry south Texas heat.
Had my window-mounted AC unit in place and pumping out lots of cold air, and
was up top in the hammock/cot taking a snooze.  When I awoke and sat up, by
back side went right through the 23 year old canvas and I got some really
bad scrapes and bruises on my back and under-arms.  Thankfully I didn't fall
through while still lying down!

From memory, my 73 states something like 60 pounds on the childs cot and 150
on the hammock cot.  If the canvas is fresh I'd trust it for that.  If it's
30 years old, I would only trust about half that.  The price of new canvas
for your cot(s) is cheap compared to an injury.
