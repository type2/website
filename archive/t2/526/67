Subject: Extra Oil Cooler

Hello Everyone,

I want to add an extra oil cooler to my van (1976
2.0L).  I am wondering what is the best way to get the
oil into the cooler.  Should I use one of those oil
filter adapters or drill and tap holes in the engine
(if so please tell me he best locations for the two
lines.

Thanks
