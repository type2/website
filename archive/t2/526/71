Subject: [T2] aux battery stuff

Good enough, I am going to install my Hella relay this week to the blue wire
from the VR.

I would also like to monitor the volts of the aux battery as well as the
charging amps.  Problem is, all these gauges are very bright compared to the
"dim antique glow" of my speedo.  Does anyone know the best way to wire a
dimmer to the lighting circuit?  Will a simple rheostat do the trick or what
do I need.  Thanks.
