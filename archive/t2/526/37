Subject: Re: [T2] More tranny help , update still no 3rd

Update, after spending all the week days last week trying to get my shifter
back on, it is now.  If any one else wants to adjust the shifter plate (DO
NOT FOLLOW THE BENTLEY DIRECTIONS)  especially if the nuts are not welded
underneath.  I ended up pushing the bolts up thru the bottom (usually go the
other way) and then putting epoxy on the head to hold it in place.  This
worked great and I was finally able to get the shifter back on. After
adjusting it all sorts of ways, The best I could get was what I originally
had.  :((  No 3rd gear.

I know 3rd works as when I first installed the tranny all I had was 1st and
3rd.  I have drilled new holes in my coupling,  If you look in your bentley
go to transmission and rear axle page 9 fig3-13 and you'll see the coupling
I'm talking about, one tube fits inside the other so thats the easyist to
adjust
rather than cutting off a piece. I have drilled 5 holes looking for the
sweet spot.  At first I went too big so I have been slowly going back to
original hole.  Now there is no space between this hole and the original.
The original was where I had no 2nd or 4th.

Any Ideas, Please!!! I am all out....
