Heh. 2 Augusts ago I bought a '74 *PARTS BUS*, rusted and beat up, in
Boulder for $265. I drove it to the RMMW show, let the kids use it as the
"paint bus", drove it up to Bandimere, then drove it home to Texas -- WAY
on the other side of Texas (Port Arthur area). Blew out a plug part way
back but that's the only problem I had. Still have all the glass, the
pop-top (soon to be tossed as it's just taking up {LOTS OF} space), seats,
and motor (now dead, but I drove on it for 6 months or so).

What is your "daily driver" there in Boulder? Perhaps you could buy/borrow
a tow bar and just tow it home. I bought a '73 Riviera camper in Concord,
CA in January and towed it back to Texas that way (with a weekend stop at
BBB-8). Roughly 2000 miles one way.
