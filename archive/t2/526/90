Subject: COT OVER FRONT SEATS and more

Or you could simply have some fun with a sewing machine and make some.

Im having tons of fun doing cushions, covers, TigerStripe double curtains
and such.

It's just so cosy.
And yes more neon light pics with red and blacklights as well as Tigerstripe
curtains coming in the near future.
