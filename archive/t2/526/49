Subject: Engine identification

Hello!  I just discovered, and joined, this mailing list.  Thank you for
being here.

I am the owner of a 1973 pop-top bus, and I am a mechanical idiot.  It is
for me that John Muir wrote his classic repair guide.  I am just learning
about engines and just now starting to do my own maintenance on my own bus.
(Maintenance is a start!)

Last year, as the culmination of a number of dramatic scenarios (including
an engine fire in dusty Hermosillo, Mexico), I had the cylinders, pistons,
and piston rings replaced.  Unfortunately I was stuck away from home at the
time, at the mercy of an unscrupulous mechanic.  Long story short, he SAID
that he replaced my 1973 1700 cc pancake engine with a 2.0 liter engine.
(He also said this "new" engine had hydraulic valve lifters but it has
turned out it has solid valve lifters, so who knows what the engine is?  The
block is the same.)  I haven't had engine trouble since but right now the
bus is guzzling gas like a freakin' Hummer-- it badly needs its timing
adjusted and its dual carbs synced.  Trouble is, to what specification
should I set the timing if I don't know what the engine is?? (I've been told
the only way to tell is to pull the engine, and that's not an option for me
right now.)   I searched the mailing list library and archive and understand
about the letter codes for engines, but I don't see anything like that on my
engine block/crankcase.  Remember I am an idiot.  Could I be looking in the
wrong place?   All I saw on the crankcase was this number: 03105535.

Help!

I very much appreciate your time.  Let me know if I can give you any other
info for clarification.

Best,

Dee dee
