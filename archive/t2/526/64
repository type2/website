Mr. Cupples,

Can you keep the bus running by feathering the throttle?
If so then look for a vacuum hose that has come adrift.

If the engine dies regardless then look to an ignition or injection
problem.  First check dwell and timing. Next check the wiring for the FI
system.

                             OOK!
