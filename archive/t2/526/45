Subject: restricted EGR

With the plenum off the engine for painting I thought I'd pump some air
through the EGR port and see if it came out evenly through all 4 outlets.
Nope: almost all of it wants head to cylinder #3 because there is the least
restriction.

With the engine pumping air so fast I suppose whatever is sucked out of all
the holes will head to cylinder on the intake stroke but I can't help but
wonder if this design isn't going to unbalance the engine slightly by making
one cylinder run rich.
