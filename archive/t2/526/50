Subject: Magazine article on making a removable apron for a Type 1

Either HOT VW's or VWTRENDS did an article about making a removable apron
for your bug. I lent it to a friend in the summer and know he gave it back,
but it's vanished.  What REALLY is ticking me off is that I have every issue
of these mags for the last 3 yrs, but not that one!! Would anyone be able to
email me a copy of that article or a scan, so I could look it over? I've
bought the spot weld drillbit, and things needed to break the welds, but the
article was really detailed on how to make a brace underneath to keep the
structural rigidity and it also explained very clearly where all the welds
were that needed to be drilled out.

Many thanks,

Courtney
