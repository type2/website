Subject: 72 westy dash: knobs / controls

While tracing wires while diagnosing my "GEN light on" problem a short
while ago, I noticed some inconsistencies between what I was finding
near the dash, and what the Bentley drawings implied. For example, the
Bentley looks like there's supposed to be a wiper control arm attached
to the steering column. In looking through an old RMMW catalog, they
sell (sold) one, so it should be there, right? Ok.. how come I have a
knob with a washer button on it instead? The wipers are controlled by
the knob, but if that's not supposed to be there, what is? What else is
completely whack? Good thing I don't have an automatic tranny, the rear
de-frost switch might throw it into reverse :)
After searching the archives, googling etc, I am unable to find a good
drawing or picture of what my dash is supposed to look like.
Unfortunately, I don't have an owners manual, and I can't find one out
on the web anywhere (30+ yrs old, big shock). I assumed that the
Bentley wiring diagrams take all possible options into account, so
there may be functions not available in the westy (like the front dual
fans). Additionally, placement in the schematic is not necessarily
relevant to their location in the cockpit, right?
If anyone out there has a 1972 westy owners manual, and is willing to
visit the local copy-shop, I'd gladly pay for copying & shipping (or
would that be some kind of copy write violation. Ooops). Alternatively,
if you know what controls are supposed to go where, what they're
supposed to look like and how they're supposed to operate, that's what
I need to know. The more I read of this list, the more messed up my
controls appear to be. I'd like to get things right.
