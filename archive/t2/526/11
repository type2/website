Subject: 2nd battery tray bracket

I came across an interesting part the other day: 231 070 158. It's the
battery bracket for the 2nd battery in a Westfalia.

It seems the bracket was added to the battery tray afterward. This always
confused me why some campers had this kind of battery tray and some didn't.
