Hiya Dave,

There are a number of good west coast vendors for bus specific items both new 
and used.

That having been said, let me point out that the ignition lock housing for a 
1970 bus should be a 311 905 887A.  If you already have a 311 905 865A it has 
likely been replaced.  The 887A will only be available to you as a used part.  
If I had to put my hands on this particular piece I'd go to Ken at The Bus 
Company (www.thebusco.com).
