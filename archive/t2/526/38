Subject: Cylinder head temp Sensor

What are the symptoms of a sensor malfunctioning.  My bus seems to have a
poor time during warm up - hesitating and bucking with a very slow idle- It
stops bucking after it warms up but it still idles very erratically -
sometimes very fast sometimes very slow and erratic even after the engine is
warm- the bus is also going thru fuel like crazy

Thanks
