Thats the going rate for a 21 window. 23's are usually a little more. Check
out the classifiieds on The Samba for a better idea. Ive seen perfectly
restored 21's on there for over 30k. I don't know what they finally sold for
but they are selling. http://thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/index.mv?view+5+sum
