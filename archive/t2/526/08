Subject: Alternator voltage question

My Dad's vanagon is putting out 13v.  It's a new bosch rebuilt.  Should 
it be putting out more voltage?

Just so you know, there is a second accessory battery hooked up.  Could 
that be the cause of the low voltage?  My 78 puts out around 13.5, so I 
just wanted to see if 13's too low.

thanks,
Mike
