Jason, please drop me your email address. 

Jason, the would be great.  What was looking for was the pop top the one I took from my 72 is sun warp.  But now the bus is for sale as you know.  Let me know what I need to do in getting the stool from you.  I have lot of other stuff if you need anything let me know.

Thank you,

Chris Jackson
