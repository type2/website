Well, I laid on mine and it held... and I am 160 LBS!  This is a stock '69
westy child cot setup.  The bars & mounts are pretty darn strong, who
knows about the canvas (could be old and weak, mine held).

If any of you ever watched "The Journey", I remember seeing Kathleen
sleeping in the child cot!  That would be even MORE uncomfy than sleeping
in the cot up in the pop-top...
