Drew,

They seem to be asking(and getting) that much for pretty much perfectly
restored ones.

One of the club members here in Arkansas has one with *original* paint,
otherwise it is *perfect* and I believe that he has it at the painters
right now.

He will sell it when he is done, but I don't think he will ask that 
much...don't know for sure.

Cheers, dave
