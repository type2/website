Geez, I have written the differences so many times I
am not going to do it again.
LOOK in the type 2 archives AND library.
That is what they are there for!!

 While we're on this topic...any information on the

 between years?
 I've actually been looking to buy off Samba but some
 say all years are the same, some 68-71 are
 different, some black poles, some gray poles, etc. 
 I don't know what to get.
 What's the deal and what should fit on a 73?  gray
 poles yes, black poles no?  what's the difference
 between the poles?   -Chris
