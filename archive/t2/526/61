Subject: full flow and pulley tin

you have to cut the tin. if you have the berg unit, you usually just 
have to trim a 1" square area just where the tin folds back around 
the pulley. others might be different. and do NOT use teflon; besides 
getting loose into the oil, teflon on anything screwed into the block 
can result in overtorquing (and cracking) the block.
