Subject: my earlier questions, AIRES

Thanks for your replies, I apologize for neglecting to remember that 
some campmobiles are not poptops.  I think my 69 is not quite as high as 
the post 71s, but I appreciate the responses from those of you who answered.

FYI: Also, I emailed about 30 volks on the AIRES list today to verify 
that their contact info was still valid, only to have about 20 of email 
the addresses fail, according to my server.  
Best, Karen
