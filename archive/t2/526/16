Subject: TSHIRTS - EveryBus, Westfalia, LAST CALL

Howdy,and happy Friday. As Chris mentioned, EveryBus is coming up soon, (
http://www.everybus.com )and despite his excellent encouragement,
preorders for official event t-shirts are way down this year. Please note
that I must have your order IN MY HAND one week from today, Friday, March
19th. Thanks to the few folks who have already sent theirs in. I've heard
by email from a lot of folks, but I need the orders.
  I wish I could just order 100 shirts and have them all there to sell,
but the reality of it is that I can't afford to. I need the preorders to
help pay for the order when I place it. Also, I can preorder any size
you need, long sleeve, short sleeve, etc. BUT, the few extras I will
have to sell on site will be either L or XL, which leaves out a lot of
folks.
Please go to
http://www.teamspatula.com
and go to the t-shirt page, which has all the information about how to
order, pictures of the designs, addresses, etc. Feel free to email me if
you have any questions, but please read that page first. Realistically
orders need to be mailed by Tuesday, *maybe* Wednesday, in order to get
here in time. I have to submit the final numbers to the printer in enough
time to get everything printed up in time for Everybus.
  Oh yeah, shirts will cost more on site as well, because I'll have to
make up for the low numbers...just a little more incentive...Likewise
dash plaques will probably be a buck more, because I'll have the actual
cost figured in, not just my estimate, which I think is low...
Anyway, thanks, and happy bussing...
