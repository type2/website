Subject: Tip for anyone installing 30mm oil pump on vanagon air cooled

Volks,

I recently have finished my rebuild of my 2 liter vanagon
engine...............big valve heads , mechanical ceramic lifters, cut to
length pushrods (to get geometry perfect) Porsche 911 valve adjusting
screws, and 30 mm oil pump.  Well, on a vanagon case, there is an aluminum
bracket that the crossmember hooks to.  Well, you cannot use the stock 1600
oil pump cover to cover the new 30mm oil pump.   You have to machine the
edges off of it so that the engine carrier bracket can bolt flush to the
motor.

I hope this info helps the next guy doing this modification.
