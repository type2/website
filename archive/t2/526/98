Subject: Re: [T2] INFO IN THE ARCHIVES

Hi Darren,

I have seen Karl answer this question at least a dozen times, so I can 
understand how he would get miffed after a while.  Look at it his 
way... ONE snarly message just might teach a lesson to twenty or more 
newbies just dying to ask us all about oil, tires and 009 distributors.

The cot info IS in the Library. That is what it is there for. The list 
charter does suggest looking in the library before posting.

Just type www.type2.com into your browser of choice.

click on the link to the library

Click the link to C

Click the link to "Cot" or "childs cot".

You wind up on this page with the info:
http://www.type2.com/library/camper.htm#3

Yes, the archives can be a difficult way to locate relevant data. But 
using the library is a piece of cake.


Happy trails,
