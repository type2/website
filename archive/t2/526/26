Subject: Hotwired my bus, where do i buy parts?

Hey... I had to hotwire my bus today, because the electric switch behind 
the ignition switch broke.  That was a good time in the parking lot of 
the bank for a few hours.  Anyway, i'm from the east coast, and when i 
need parts i buy from bus depot.  But now i'm living on the west coast 
and this is my first parts purchase.  Is there a place, like bus depot, 
that's out here?  I like places that are T2 list friendly, it just makes 
me feel good to do business with someone who is on the list.  I know I 
could just buy from the Depot and have the stuff shipped out, and I'd 
kinda like to do that, but this is for my ignition switch, and time is 
of the essence, in that i'm going to be leaving my neatly pre-hotwired 
bus at the airport for a week and a half this tuesday... 

Any help would be greatly appreciated...
Here's part details, if you like:  311905865A  Ignition Switch.  68-70 bus.

Thanks
