Subject: One thing not to overlook when yuur  Bus breaks down

I'm driving my 71 Westy down the street when I put the clutch in , shift to
neutral to coast to the red light , then my bus back fired twice and died...
It would turn and even start somtimes but either wouldn;t start or die
quickley. I Checked all the usual suspects but found nothing, had the bus
towed to the local shop where the guys told me that the Dizzy had popped up .
This was the culprit.... They ended up filing down the clamp to keep the dizzy
from popiping up. I've had the bus for 2 years without any issues like
this.Over 10k miles


Anyone ever had this happend to them?
