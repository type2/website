The latest VWTrends was the usual chuckle. First there was the review of the latest pertronix product and the article even admitted that while there was no discernable difference besides a smooth idle they neglected to follow the instructions and regap the plugs! Then there was advice that painting engine tin will prevent rusting. Paint much be some kind of wonder coating!

Beside making me laugh as usual there was some interesting vendor info. Beside the poptop restoration article there was quick mention of a company called Venture Warehouse Group <http://www.venturawarehousegroup.com/> that are reproducing interesting parts. They reproduce the sliding door handle and some other interior items but this was a surprise: the 71-79 headlight switch.

I gave them a call but they don't have a catalog or sell direct. Have any of the vendors on the list though about selling their parts especially the headlight siwtch to replace the chinese/mexican piece of junk?
