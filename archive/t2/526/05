I once had a kit car that I built (VW) and wired the 4bulb headlights up
like that, but I had all 4 headlights with both high and low beams, so
even on low beam I had 4 low beam headlights.....good grief I had em aimed
correctly but every other car was flashing thier headlights at me to get
me to dim my already dimmed headlights.

manitory bus content,  have been considering adding two additonal
headlights to the front of my van,  has anyone put a four headlight system
on a bus. esp a bay..
