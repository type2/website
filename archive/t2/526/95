Oh lets not anger Karl.
It took him probably just as long to post a negative
message than it would to answer it?
kinda weird.

The archives don't hold all the answers
I have searched in vain for many different answers
to my own questions and have come up empty
after alot of wasted time. I like to see other listees
helping each other.

just my 2 cents.
