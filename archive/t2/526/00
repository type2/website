Subject: Re:[T2]Oil filler tube leak - 72 Westy

Thank you David!
I sent the address by private email
I'll be making a $25.00 donation to the list

I don't get to read all the posts all the time, and I don't get to
contribute much at all
but when I need help the list is always there.

Thanks to all who make it great!

Thanks !
