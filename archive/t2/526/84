Subject: Gas heater road test results.

As I said last week, I finally got the SW gas heater
installed under the jump seat in my 71 Westy.  Cut a
hole in the side of the seat where the walkthru is and
attached a vent cover from the hardware store. The
design of the vent cover makes half of the air get
pushed toward the back of the bus and half toward the
front.
Saturday morning temps were in the mid-teens, like 17
degrees I think, so I figured it would be a good test
for the heater.  At 17 degrees with the gas heater
running, I stayed comfortable with my jacket on. 
There were just enough air leaks in my bus to keep the
inside temp a little cool and for me to feel a cold
draft. Then on Sunday evening the temps were high-30's
or low 40's. At this outside temp the gas heater
absolutely sweated me out! I was taking off my jacket
and still felt too warm.  So, I figure if I replace
all the door seals and stop the air leaks and
everything (NOT going to happen) then the gas heater
would make year-round bus driving a possibility! 
Again, NOT going to happen just becuase we salt the
roads here in the winter like we do our french fries!
But, it WILL extend my bus driveing experience at
least one month earlier in the spring and one month
later in the fall, so basically from March-November
I'll be able to use the old bus for all of my daily
driving. In the past it has been more like May-October!
