Subject: 69 campmobile transport and dimensions

Wie gehts volken ,
my 69 has been sitting at my dear ol' mom's in Texas for too long and 
although I've managed to keep it up and running with several visits, I'm 
nervous about driving it back to Boulder.  I am considering having it 
transported and I am curious whether anyone here has used a specific 
auto transport carrier that was good and took good care of you and your 
vehicle?  Also, does someone who has a vehicle in their driveway confirm 
to me that the campmobile is under 6' 6" tall? I know I measured it 
before, and I wrote down the dimensions somewhere, but can't locate.

Thanks for your time,
Karen Eblen
