Subject: [T2] series resistor

just out of curiosity wondered if anyone knew what the series resistor is for...?
i have one and it has wires hooked up to it and i havent ever thought about it till now i guess... and was wondering what is its job.. i always plug the wires back up like i found ummm before engine drop or whatever reason i have unplugged them if it wasnt but just to clean a little dust out from around umm..
looked the part number up on depot and that what it told me it was ... said 2000cc and vanagon 80-83 which is funny cause my bus is a 76 even though my engine is a 2.0...
the right hand side of the resistor doesnt have anything plugged into it....?
the bus used to be on FI does this have something do do with that or the computer...?
in your spare time if you know it would honestly break the curiosity....
peace and thanks
Chris
