Subject: Exp radio installers plz help ~!~

thank you for any that can tell me what i am doing wrong or better yet what i need to make it all go good....
 
i got a cd changer (pioneer) and a radio (sony)
 
and well the amp is something like a pyramid or something...?
 
anyhow...
heres the problem there is no instruction for my radio wireing except for the back panel of the radio....
 
i have the radio already wired but my difficulty is that i cant seem to figure out whcih one of the jacks on the back of the radio are for the cd changer....
heres what i got....
the cd changer has a female plug and says ("Connect into the ANT switching unit only')
 
ok now the only thing i can figure is that this female plug has to be connected to one of the following female jacks that is on the back of my radio...
i have a single male RCA plug that i can if this is what is needed connect the females together with...?
 
heres what is on the back panel of radio....

hope you can make heads or tails of my drawing LOL.....
 
 
there is no other wires to be connected for the cd changer except for the loose female ANT wire...?
 
it has a wire remote with it.............. that just has a power button on it....
 
i have power to the cd changer just no way of running it through the radio so that it will sound the tunes that are playing in the cd changer... thats why i am settled that somehow that ANT wire has to connect to one of the following in the drawing... of the radio...? assumption can be bad though...!
 
 
ok my amp well not sure how it fits into all this...?
 
it has a high input plug but is missing the wires for it.....
 
it has rca jacks on it that say L+ R+  and they are red and white plugs ...female
 
on the other side of the amp is the  output plug and it has L+ R+ and there are four wires ...assuming that these are for the sub woofers....?
 
and then the plug next to that is the power plug with orange red and black...
 
red is battery?
orange is acc..?
and black is a ground...
 
ok so there is the lay out if someone can please help me.....
i have gotten this far and had to stop and cant install any further till i can figure this cd changer out...
 
thanks for all your much needed help..... all experienced car stereo installers...
peace
Chris
