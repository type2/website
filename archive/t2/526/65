Hi Ross,

Check all your vacuum hoses first.  The brake booster hose coming from the 
left side front tin is always a culprit on my Bus.  Also check the hose from 
the oil rebreather to the big S-hose from the AFM to the air distribution 
box in the middle of the intake manifold.  Any missing hose that has a 
bigger OD than a pencil will let in too much air, lean the mixture, and kill 
your engine.

If all your vacuum hoses are good, check your fuel filter.  If you've never 
replaced it, or it's been a long time, replace it.  Sometimes cheap gas can 
cause rust in the tank, and rust flakes can get thru the fuel lines and clog 
the filter, leading to fuel starvation.

As mentioned before, you may have some gum or varnish in your fuel, 
especially if it's been sitting for several months or more.  Dump a couple 
cans of fuel injector cleaner in the tank, let it idle, let it run thru the 
system a bit.  If the Bus will drive OK, fill it up with some 93-octane the 
next time you're out and about.

Good luck!
