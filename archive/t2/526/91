While we're on this topic...any information on the specifics of the sizes/poles/brackets differences between years?
I've actually been looking to buy off Samba but some say all years are the same, some 68-71 are different, some black poles, some gray poles, etc.  I don't know what to get.
What's the deal and what should fit on a 73?  gray poles yes, black poles no?  what's the difference between the poles?   -Chris
