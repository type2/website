Subject: Re: [T2] Rust Converter's Results and Finding's.

Bondo is like Kleenex, or Jello Jeff----and you got the idea.

Any flller needs an aggresive "TOOTH" to hold on, and laying it on an
un--ground surface is asking for it to pop off--any professional body
man can tell you ths--

I dislike the thought if short cutting the job--your right.

However--in all the time I've been refinishing vehicles--this is the
first time the short cut was the long way around--and with unacceptable
results.

And this is another problem in definition.

Your's or somebody elses acceptable results, possibly are not mine.

Remember this--

I am not doing this stuff for myself--I'm doing this for a client--and
the end result not only has to look good--but be a long term finished
product, and within a resonable amount of time.

The converter products offer's none of the above.

Professionally speaking?

As I have mentioned before, at best this stuff is for the back yard,
Wham Bam, hobbiest, and I'm real glad it has worked well for you--

Bondo is a brand name, and is complete crap-I'd never use the stuff).

 You seem to have such an intense dislike for this product that I didn't
really expect you to become a convert-all I know is it has worked for
me.   Jeff
