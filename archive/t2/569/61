Sounds like its got a little more in it than just chocolate...

>>What am I getting myself into?

I was once involve in the whole rainbow thing went to a few national
gatherings and such. I would say that its about 50-50 some of the folks are
true hippy minded people the other live in the under ground society rainbow
provides because they cant live with out it i.e. fellons running from the
law, smack addicts, and such. So I would be a little cautious before I just
let this "Gravy" fellow in my house.

Just my .02 cents
