Subject: breather line orientation, 74 bus

Morning; 

I have recently been replacing the breather line hose behind the firewall,
etc., and am in the process of reassembling the engine and engine bay.
It's a stock 1800 dual carb, EGR system recently removed. 

I can't quite visualize the final routing of the breather lines at the
T-fitting. On my bus, the breather lines leave the tank, go up high in
behind the air scoops on both sides, then dive down and turn into the
engine bay at the rear of the bus on both sides. The left side white metal
line crosses over to the middle of the engine bay where it meets a rubber
T fitting. The left side metal line ends at the right-hand edge of the
engine bay (not nearly in the middle). I have another piece in my hand,
steel breather line that could join the white metal line on the right side
of the engine bay to the T-fitting in the middle upper part, but where
does the third line of the T go?

I assume the third line, which would run to the front of the bus, must
vent the vapours into the exhaust system somehow. Perhaps I'm missing a
part, or just not visualizing it well. Of course, I didn't take pictures
when I pulled the engine... 

thanks in advance
