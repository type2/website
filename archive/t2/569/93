Subject: Rust Converter's Results and Finding's.

Well---quite the week--and I'm glad it's over with.

I tried the miracle in a can and here are my observations.
( for those of you who missed the initial post---I was prepping a Daewoo
rubber tired end loader for paint.)

First thing is that this stuff is a bear to work with.

After the elongated cure time of 90 some hours it is like sanding
crystal prior to paint--it hate sanding--and this stuff stinks.
The stuff is as hard as a rock. 
It made the job that much more miserable, and time consuming--the
overall cure time is ridiculous.

Second, --hey--after you sand blast, wire wheel, or sand off the
rust---how in the heck does the pot holes get filled?

The rust converter isn't a high fill item--so the pot holes won't get
filled ---
You can't spot putty or lay a light coat of Bondo on them --the Bondo
won't stick to the rust converter--and the rust converter is made to
bond / react to the rusty metal-- a no win situation so the pot holes
stay--

You could sand the converter with 180--360 to get the spot putty or
Bondo to stick--but you'd be back down to bare metal again--so what's
the point?

At least when I use the Vari Prime ,and the Uro Prime, I can scuff up
the primed area's and the spot putty will stick to it to hide the pot
holes in the metal--and with another coat of the primer the divots are
gone--

This stinks.

I feel this way about this stuff--from a professional standpoint--

If a guy has a bunch of time--and doesn't care what the end result
is--go for the POR product--it'll take twice as long to get the job
done, and the results aren't going to be as nice as using accepted
automotive refinishing preparation products.
It sure wasn't a shortcut, or any miracle for me.

It took 4 times as long to get the job done, and the results were at
best poor.

Thank God this job was on a piece of earthmoving heavy equipment where
the results weren't supposed to be pristine.

The only area's that came out looking good is where I buried the
converter with urethane bed liner--like on top of the front fender's,
and the floor of the cab--it hid all the pot holes well--and looks good.

I wouldn't use this stuff on a Radio Flyer wagon let alone any vehicle
I'm driving--or anybody else's.

At least I tried the alleged best way to get rust work done--and found
it to be tedious, time consuming, and not worth the time and effort for
at best, just an OK job.

I Pass on this stuff---

That's All Folks----
