Subject: helpin' hippies

Hey gang, this is Billy, I'm using a new email address, feel free to respond
here or at my old one if you have it.

So yesterday at the farmer's market, there's more smelly hippy kids than
usual so I get to talking to a few who
are friends of mine and find out that the Rainbow people were in the
mountains near us and have descended for
mirthmaking.

My friends put me on to this guy who's engine is having troubles.  Here is
where it gets interesting.

He can't get his valve covers on because the valve stems are so far out that
they do not fit.
He has apparently shimmed up the rocker arms just to be able to get them
over the valve stem.
Is this a "dropped valve seat"?  He wants to perform highway travel and I
think he needs a new/used
head at least, without having looked at anything yet.

Oh yeah, he wants to pay me for any time/tools/equipment in Chocolate
that'll "blow my mind", semi-precious stones,
and other trinkets.
He's trying desperately to land the vehicle at my house for undisclosed
periods of time,
He introduced himself as "Gravy".

If you run into this man, consider him armed and hippy.

I know I make fun of the hippy kids, but I was one for awhile and though I
still consider myself
left, lib, anti- whatever, the hardcore stinky kids are amusing to me now,
god bless 'em.

What am I getting myself into?

Billy
