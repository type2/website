Subject: Fuel pressure reg test as separate component?

Is there any sort of specialist to whom I could take a bare fuel 
pressure regulator (FI) for testing, and end up paying some fraction of 
the cost of a replacement (about $70)?

Testing as part of a complete fuel ring isn't advisable in my engine's 
current state, and may not be possible.
