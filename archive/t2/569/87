Subject: Re: [T2] Woohoo!!!!!  FI REVERSION COMPLETED!!!

One thing for sure.  Laying a bunch of rtv all over the mating surfaces is
going to bite you in the future.  Get the right seals, and when you got
time, mate them proper.  You would not believe how many cars i have had to
clean this mess up off off to FIX vacuum leaks.  RTV is temporary at best in
these areas..........

Good news though is you see how good the FI runs.  Now get the proper dizzy,
or time the one you got to total advance at 3500 rpms and you will be set.
