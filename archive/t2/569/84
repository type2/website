Subject: Re: [T2] CV joints & rear axle squeak-- FIXED!!!

Volks,
I found the problem. While we had the axle stubs (the pieces going
through the drum and which have the 46MM nut on them) my wife cleaned
them for me. She did such a wonderful job that they were absolutely
clean when we put them back in. The squeaking noise which I described as
metal against rubber was exactly that. The axle stubs were so clean the
new grease seals were squeaking as the axle turned in the middle of them.

Yesterday I applied a small amount of lubrication to them, and all is
well now.

Anybody else ever had that problem?

Have a great Saturday.
