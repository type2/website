 >>got pulled over one night by the State Police and they ticketed him
for not wearing a seat belt.  He told the officer that the vehicles 
were not
built with belts and he was not an engineer and therefore not qualified 
to
adapt the structure of the vehicle for such a harnass.  Well, he got the
reply of 'Tell it to the judge.'<<

bad cop, no donut. it is my understanding that this is pretty much the 
law in every state. but of course i could be min-informed.

 >>judge then informed John
(my buddy) that if he had modified the vehicle and found himself in an
accident, that it was very likely that law and the insurance company 
would
not have been on John's side because he was not qualified to make such 
an
adaptation.<<

this is why i decided against upgrading the seatbelts on the 72 i used 
to have.

that being said, does anyone out there want to purchase some vanagon 
front belts? color black. make me an offer.
