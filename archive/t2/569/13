Subject: Retorque?

I recently removed the heads from my 2.0L that had around 6500 miles 
since the heads were last installed and torqued to the Bentley 
specified value (24 ft lbs I believe).  Before disassembly, I measured 
the torque on the cylinder head studs/nuts.  I found the top (short) 
studs to be torqued to 24 ft lbs per specification.  The bottom studs 
(inside the valve covers) were all between 10 -15 ft lbs.  I have two 
questions.

1.  What is the conventional wisdom regarding re-torquing the lower 
head studs while the engine is in the car?  It would seem based on what 
I found that the top studs are not likely to need re-torquing.

2.  Is there any reason not to use a threadlocker to prevent the nuts 
from loosening when you install the heads?
