Subject: Witch way do Fuel Pump's go in '76? 

Ok, I got the normal fuel pump, little canister thingie, with hose on
either end and 2 wires on one end. The PO had it disconnected and in the
back seat, so I'm not sure witch way it goes. I replaced all the fuel
lines, and I'm ready to rock and roll. I have the end with the wires
going to the engine, and the wireless end getting gas from the filter
witch is connected to the gas tank. Is this the right direction, or do I
have it backwards? 
 
Walkin' down to get some gas now to dump in the tank. I'll check
messages when I get back, before I dump in the gas. :) 
 
Kk, thanks. 
Chris
