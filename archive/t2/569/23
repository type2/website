Subject: CV joints & rear axle squeak

	A week ago my wife and I replaced the rear wheel bearings and then took 
the bus to get aligned. We also reset the riding height on the rear by 
adjusting the torsion bars.
	Now when we drive the bus (this started before getting it aligned), 
from the rear driver's side wheel comes a squeaking sound that sounds 
like rubber rubbing against metal. It's no different whether I'm 
breaking or not. It doesn't change with direction (right or left hand 
curve) but it does change with speed, mostly disappearing above 15 MPH, 
but definitely noticable from zero up.
	While having the rear end jacked up to figure out the cause, I noticed 
as I turn the wheels either forward or backwards, the cj joints seem to 
"lob" at one point in their rotation. They just have this little popping 
motion like they go 1/4 inch off center for a moment, and then realign. 
This happens on both sides. These are recently (last year) 
remanufactured driveshafts from Autozone. Is this normal when the car is 
jacked up fully and one spins the tires, or are these bad (evil) CV joints?
	Also, any ideas what the squeaking could be? A bearing problem? I've 
never heard anything like it before.

Thanks volks,
