Subject: easiest AIRS mission ever--well maybe

I received a call at work today (Friday) at about 6 p.m.  Daisy and 
Wade Rohdman were stranded along the side of the road of I-29 in 
Missouri, their coil was shot.  I rushed home (1 hour) grabbed a coil 
and was set to leave when my wife decided to bring the kids and make it 
a family outing.  No problem after getting the baby ready we hit the 
road and made the approximately 70 mile trip.  Along the way, my wife 
realized it was going to be a longer venture than she had guessed.  She 
asked how long it would take to fix the bus..."Two minutes," I replied.

I found the stranded bus about 8:15 p.m.  About two minutes later the 
bus was running.  My wife stood in shock.  She declared it was the 
first time I had ever been accurate in estimating anything related to 
time and bus repair.  Good for me.

An hour later we were eating ice cream in St. Joseph, Missouri, Wade 
and Daisy's destination.  An hour after that the kids are in bed.

The DC ran great.  The kids were good.  The part worked.  All is well.

Cheers,
mjr
