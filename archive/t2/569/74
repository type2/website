Subject: Re: [T2] Re: helpin' hippies

having hung around with the rainbow family back in the mid 90's i came to
this conclusion.  i only helped people that were willing to help
themselves.  too many people just getting by and never giving back in the
true spirit.  this may be difficult with a group of people that say
"noon:30" but i would give this guy a schedule of how long he can keep his
van at your place.  living out west i saw tons of rainbow and other hippy
vans that found their final resting place in a yard other than the
owners yard.
