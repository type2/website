Hi Christopher,

If you have a stock pump and filter for a 76 (FI engine) you shouldn't 
be able to get this wrong.

7mm hose from the tank to the filter.

12mm hose from the filter to the pump. Use as short a piece of this as 
possible. (2" will be fine).

7mm hose from the pump to the fuel rail.

Just remember that you want to filter the fuel before it hits the pump 
and you can't go wrong.

But if you have an aftermarket pump (ie, ford pump or a PO carb 
conversion) all bets are off.


Happy trails,
