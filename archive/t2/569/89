Hi everybody,

Greetings from Paris. Jacques and George say hi. Well, since Richard 
outed me, let me momentarily come out of lurking :)

Aaron, learn from my mistake :( Don't attach it to the pop-top. It's 
not sturdy enough; especially the hinges are not strong enough for the 
extra weight. Mine held up fine for about 4-5 years, then suddenly gave 
in as I was about to pop the top one evening. (Since my westy website 
got moved to type2.com/dakhlia I'm no longer able to edit the page, but 
this long-term outcome is a comment that might be worth adding to it.)

Since your hinges are marginal already, I most definitely would not do 
this. Consider alternatives such as lightweight, flexibles solar pads. 
Or mount the panels over the luggage rack. Or better yet, make it a 
removable installation that can be oriented towards the sun. When 
traveling, attach it to a Thule or Yakima gutter-mounted roof rack, the 
kind with extra long legs that will reach over the pop-top. But it 
would be a bit more work when you want to pop the top in the evening... 
Just a thought.

Happy creativity!

Au revoir,
Sami
