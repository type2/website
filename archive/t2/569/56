Subject: good movie with busses

I watched the film "The Dancer Upstairs" last week, in addition to the 
lots and lots of air-cooled VeeDubs, it was an excellent film.  It was 
set in Latin America.  Very good.  I have ordered a copy of the film 
and the novel it was written from.  The author did the screenplay so I 
am hoping it is also excellent.
