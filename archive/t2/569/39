Chris,

Mine goes with the wires on the carb end of the pump.  The wireless end
toward the tank.  Not sure if this would apply to your pump, though.  Can't
recall if my pump was actually marked which end is which.

I've got a filter on both sides of the pump.  A clear disposable filter on
the carb end and a clear glass one with a replaceable filer element between
the tank and the pump.

Are you running carb(s) or FI?
