You can, but start buying "baggy style" jeans, because you're going to 
develop big right quadriceps pressing that brake pedal so hard.

Myself, I prefer to have a more balanced leg work-out[*].  So if I were 
you, I would most certainly have my brake booster rebuilt :-)

[*] ...come to think of it... Summer League is coming up, and a 
stronger right leg could really help my swing... "hmmmm......" :-)
