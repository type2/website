Subject: Removing gutters

The idea of griding off the rain gutters from my bus has been rattling 
around my head lately. There are two rust spots that can be easily repaired 
but...

Are there any STRUCTURAL reasons why they can't be removed?

Note that I probably won't do it just because I'd lose some rain protection 
and a convenient mounting point for shades or whatever. Just a thought...
