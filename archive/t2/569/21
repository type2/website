Subject: Re: [T2] mudflaps

Did the '78 come with mudflaps behind all four wheels or just the rear? I have something behind both of my front wheels that appears like brackets for mudflaps. 

I'm thinking that I'll add 4 flaps in my effort to build a "continental tourist" bus with a handful of exterior accessories.

Thanks!
