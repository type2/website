Owch Nemo, that's harsh. All I was saying is that a person should be aware
of what the DMV expects in these situations. A clerk can tell him that. As
for the people who are better qualified to give info on where to secure
harnesses, I would more than likely look into my local race shop that builds
roll cages into 4 x 4's and such. That was my thought. Are these people
better qualified? I sure hope they are, because I don't know who else I
would ask. If they aren't qualified to put in safety equipment, then maybe
they should look into a profession that puts their business endeavors in a
less risky and litigious position. I know that anybody can be dragged
kicking and screaming into court for just about anything, but to do nothing
or to do something without any attempt to find out what the situation may be
(if there is an accident) is not so wise. I completely agree that child
safety is a necessity. I sincerely hope that I did NOT give the impression
that he should do nothing and conscent to ejecting his baby out of the bus.
This was never my intent. So in summary...
Accidents=bad,..... Safety Equipment=good
'nuff said

no no no lol... my 6 year old is fine.... right now she rides in a car seat in the back that has the lap belt that goes through the back of the car seat and then the car seat it's self has straps in it that she buckles around her...

it just looks uncomfortable...to her and she is old enough and weighs enough to go into a booster seat now and i wanted to have a  3 point strap in there...

i knew it could be done...just wasnt sure how... i also knew that some of you had done it..

if i buy the right strap i will myself bolt it in the factory holes for it... and then put her in a booster seat with the booster seat attached as should be with the lap belt... 

i mean come on i cant leave her in the car seat till shes old enough or weighs enough to sit in the seat with nothing but a lap belt..?

can see her scrunched over in the car seat at age 8  lol 

she will grow out of the car seat before long so wont have any choice but to get the 3 point belts and hook it into the factory holes...

everything else is left up to the Great Spirit...

awaiting some more pics from someone on there seat belts ... will post them up as soon as i get them..

if i get into a wreck last thing i am worried about is a law suit as longs as we all survive,,,,..... i would think also that the 3 point seat belt would be better than nothing.... i will deffinetly make sure that it lays across her chest also and not around her neck like most cars i get into and the belt goes across your neck and you have to keep pulling it down...to your chest...

 

peace
