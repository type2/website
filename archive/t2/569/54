Subject: Generator pulley nut 

Hi Folks,
    Just thought I'd pass on a quick tip I found out the hard way.
You see, a couple of weekends ago I drove out to Westies In The Woods
and after arrival discovered my generator belt looser than I'd like
it.  So, Saturday right after dinner and before the campfire I broke
out my tool box to adjust the generator pulley shims.  Well to my
surprise I discovered that my socket for the generator pulley nut was
AWOL.  My first thought was to go around begging for the proper tools,
I'm sure someone would have had them.  Second thought was to try and
get it done with what I had.  After all, what would I have done if I
wasn't at a VW event?  To my pleasant surprise I found that a 13/16,
12 point, spark plug socket is a good fit on the generator pulley nut.
A 6 point socket may work too but I can't say for sure as I haven't
tried one on there yet.  With the belt adjusted I was able to relax
and enjoy the rest of the evening.
