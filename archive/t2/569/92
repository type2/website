Subject: Re: [T2] windsheild installation

I last night spent a couple of hours not getting anywhere with after using
the much advocated string and washing up liquid

I've done this more times than I care to think about. I've never used soap,
but have always used powder to help the seal slide in place. It helps to do it
on a warm day when the seal is soft from sitting in the sun. My wife is
(reluctantly) my helper for doing windshields/glass. She is on the inside of
the bus pulling the cord while I'm on the outside pushing on the glass. As you
get the windshield about 3/4 way seated it does get pretty hard pulling the
cord out-this is when we switch,and I start pulling the cord and she pushes on
the glass. Every time I drag a "new" bus home, her first question is "Are we
going to have to do the glass again?".  Good luck,   Jeff
