Subject: Re: [T2] Weber carb Vac line placement....

I have a SVDA (the ACN one) hooked up to my Weber via the port in the
back (RIR). I don't have the documentation stack relevant to the Weber
of the dizzy with me. Based on how it performs (compared to the 009 the
dizzy replaced) I figure that I used the right port. I thought retard
came from the manifold, not the carb. Regardless, I don't have a retard
on my dizzy, so I shouldn't be trusted for gospel on that.
Good luck,
