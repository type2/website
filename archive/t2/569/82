Subject: Leak!, The Exhaust Blew and the PO Knew! GEX Warranty Pics

OKay pull the weber off to put on FI. Traded weber for complete setup. Still 
need more pieces for the FI though. Have to move soon. Bus must drive away. 
Borrow a weber to put back on and get it movin. Notice fan shrouds have no 
flaps. Pull the engine. Pull the AC too. Sort the tins shrouds various 
pieces I am going to put back on. Tear down to long block clean it up to 
reassemble.

Look at this exhaust manifold I unbolted

The flange piece is sepparated from the pipe. But hey talk about warranty 
this GEX is still good.

Well that is if it was ever any good. No gaskets or shims between the 
Cyllinders and Case. Shims were between the cyllinders and heads. Nuts 
holding the heads on were mostly hand tight. The pistons look okay, the 
cyllinders look great though. I will be putting all back together again...as 
soon as all the King's Horses and all the King's Men arrive.

Thanks,
