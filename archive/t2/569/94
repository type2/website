the truth, how do you "really" feel about the stuff.....<g>

what about using it as a really tough underbody coating where you don't
care about appearences and "tough" is the real goal

but the question is, how well does it stop rust, keep an eye on that part
too if you can. may not look good but you used it on a tough beast and
could be a good test of the rust prevention part of it.... (hey it is a
lot cheaper than the vari prime etc, and for underbody work it could have
a low cost use....
