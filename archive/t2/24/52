Subject: Voltage regulator?

I am trying to reconnect the engine electricals following rebuild.  There is
a blue metal box with cooling fins and 3 terminals screwed to the firewall.
Is this the voltage regulator?  The three terminals are all the same size,
no markings, and positioned in a triangular pattern with 2 at the top and 1
at the bottom.  Which wires go where?  I guess I didn't make good enough
notes (shame on me!) when I disconnected it, but I believe all the
connections were on the top right terminal.  Can someone help?
