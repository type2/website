there're out there but few and far between...78-79 in the shape you are
looking for might be closer to $4,000,   at $2000 unless you are lucky it
is likely to need some engine or body work.

but don't let me stop you, they do exist just not the norm.

pick up Dr Tim's tips on buying a bus and check the archives for the price
lists that a few folks post each week
