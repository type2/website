Subject: Ignition switch removal

Hi list!

I have been attempting to remove an ignition switch from a 71 bus in 
order to use it on a 68.  They appear to be identical - does anybody 
know for sure?

I successfully removed the steering wheel and pulled the entire 
steering column sleeve that has the ignition switch housing, but I 
still can't get the switch itself out.

Does anybody know the trick?

TIA
