Subject: JRMC III

Hello everyone!!!!!!

Only 2 more days until the Josh Rodgers Memorial Campout (JRMC III) begins!

For those who are interested, a group of us will be leaving OKC about 1:00
PM on Friday, e-mail if you want to carabus with us!!

For those who don't know, the campout is at the Turner Falls Campground,
Davis, Oklahoma.  I was misquoted by the park personnel, it is $7 per
person, per vehicle, per night, not the $5 they told me a month ago.

YOU MUST tell them that you are with the Josh Rodgers Group to get the group
discount!!!!

Directions: OKC and points north--I-35 south to exit 51, turn right onto US
77, entrance on your right 1 1/2 miles.

From Dallas and points south--I-35 North to exit 47, left onto US 77,
entrance on your left 3 miles.

Hope to see everyone there!!
