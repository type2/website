Yes, a lot of play is normal. I fixed mine by putting in a Gene Berg shifter
(very easy job). Pricey, but considering the quality, well worth it. If you
have problems finding gears, you may have to laterally shift the base of the
shifter until you hit the sweet spot where all the gears are easy to find.

I replaced the bushings and the shift coupler in my '71 Westy without
removing the engine and tranny.  I can't remember exactly how I did it, but
I think I took apart the shift rod and slid the pieces past each other to
get the room to work with the parts. YMMV.
