The kit we sell for $99 (minus 5% listmember discount if you request it) is
indeed complete (everything behind the heat exchangers), and fits all
1500/1600 engined VW busses (thru '71).  These are the correct
single-tailpipe systems, not Beetle mufflers, and yes, they are both quieter
and heavier duty than the extractor systems.  Normally all of the parts are
from one of the two OEM German suppliers, Leistritz or Ernst.  In rare cases
where a particular German part goes on backorder (i.e. a tailpipe or
hardware; not the muffler itself), we may substitute a Danish part or two,
or even (extremely rarely) Brazilian, but this is by far the exception, not
the rule, and is only done as a last resort.

Right now I have about a month's supply of complete Ernst kits in stock,
imported straight from Germany, so that's what you'll get.
