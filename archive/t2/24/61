Subject: Re: [T2] Luggage Rack

Hey

The luggage rack on the rear (63-73 Westy) is held on by 6 phillips head
screws. 3 (through rubber bushings) in the rear and 3 smaller ones towards
the front. They just go through holes in the sheet metal. They do collect
rust (I found on mine) but would have to be pretty rusted to move the rack.
For what its worth the pop top is held on by six screws on the front through
the hinges and these hinges have slots in them, so you can move the pop top
some after loosening the screws. How big is the gap?

The luggage bars are pop riveted on the fiberglass and can be drilled
through, removed and then you just use new pop rivets. You can get a pop
rivet tool and rivets for about 15 bucks.


Hope this helps,
Rob Henley
