Subject: 80 Vanagon for sale...reduced price

This is the last time I will mention my 1980 Westy before I list it in the
paper and possibly sell it to a 16 year old who will total it in the next 2
years.  I have dropped the price to $2500.  It goes in the paper next
Monday.  Email for pics, description. Located in central Florida.
