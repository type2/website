Subject: Wiring Short

Thank you Jim Hood (and Behemoth) Al and Dan from somewhere near Seattle.  I
have fixed my dilemma (I think) and simply wanted to express my gratitude
for your replies.
Fuse panel was not properly resting in holder, fuse #12 was shorting out and
frying the ignition wire.
Thanx again to all listees.
