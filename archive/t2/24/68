Subject: Follow up to the sloppy shifter

Thanks for all your replies regarding the fact that I can locate reverse
without having to depress the shift lever.

I think I can assume for now that it is going to be something to do with the
lockout plate.  I say assume, because it is too dark outside here (UK) for
me to go and have a look.

I have checked in the archives and although I am not too confident when
dealing with the mechanics of my van, I'm sure I will be able to at least
check if it is in the wrong way around.

One other thing that concerns me though is the mention of adjusting the
plate.  I don't have the Bentley manual (and I can't afford it at present
either) but there seems to be a bit of confusion in the archives relating to
the info given anyway.

So, is there anyone out there who would be willing to explain it in plain
english so that I can give it a go?

Thanks again
Tammy
