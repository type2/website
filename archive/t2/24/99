Subject: Coleman propane adapter info

Recently someone (Meredith?) asked me about the parts I used to change my 
built-in stove over from the under-bus mounted tank to disposable 
bottles.  I bought the adapter at a Coleman outlet store, of which I'm sure 
there aren't very many.  Tonight though, I found the same adapter at an 
Academy sporting goods store.  It's the first time I've been in one of 
those and I must add that I was impressed.  Great selection of everything 
and they had a lot of good camping equipment like sleeping bags, stoves, 
lanterns, flashlights, etc..  In any case, the part in question is in a 
small grey box about 3"x3"x1" and costs about 20 bucks.  I noticed it said 
that it regulates to a constant 15psi which I guess is why it will blow out 
the stove flame if the adjustable valve is opened all the way.  Still works 
okay though.  You have to cut the hose on the adapter and throw one end away.
