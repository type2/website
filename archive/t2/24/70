Kip,

i've gotta agree with Bob on this one.  from what you described,

>>camper in good shape (minimal/no rust, no rot, mechanically sound,
reasonably non-dented, heater works, etc<<

you're really looking in the $4000 range.

but please dont be discouraged.  my advice would be to find one with
minimal body rust/rot/dents in your price range & go from there. you can
add or repair the features you want as time goes by.

good luck on your search!
