I think what you may be seeing is the end of thestrap and snap for securing
the childs hammock above the closet cabinet.

I looked at the Westy manuals on your site. 68 also has the net:

70 pop tops have the shelf:

But NONE of the manuals mention non-pop top Westies. I know they were
made but I don't know why they don't talk about them.

I am VERY confused about the pics on this page:

The left one seems to show a hook for the cargo net above and forward of
the side cabinet door. But the right pic shows the upper shelf, that SHOULD
have been in the left pic.
