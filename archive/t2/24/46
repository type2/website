Subject: Short in Wiring

Hello All,
I will try again.  This time, any ideas on how to find a short?  My main
black wire on the ignition harness gets very hot and has melted (once big
time, had to replace) and somewhat since.
Each time I try to put all the wires back up under the dash, and the fuse
box back in its place, I have problems.
Only the one wire though???
Again, I will appreciate any response.
