Hey ya Travis,


>>Is it normal for my shifter to have a lot of free play while in gear?

I don't think a little play is a big deal but when knuckles start hitting 
the E-Brake like mine did, I did do something about it!

I have read stuff here over time about the "shift coupler"
>and associated "bushings" down there (I'm working from memory here, so

Terminology sounds spot on ;>)  And yes it was the Shift Coupler that was my 
culprit.  I crawled up under her where it connects to the trans and man was 
it mangled (must have bounced off a few roots or stumps).
I have a '71 and I did go ahead and do the bushings but that means taking 
the engine and trans completely out where to do the "shift coupler" edging 
those back an inch or so is all that has to be done.
