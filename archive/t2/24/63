I can accurately claim to provide the best rubber you can get for '68-79,
and at lower prices. The majority of my rubber is either genuine VW, or high
quality European made aftermarket, not aftermarket Brazilian as sold by most
vendors. I import the seals myself so I am sure of the source and quality.
I am forced, however, to substitute some Brazilian seals when other sources
are not available. Which particular seals that is can vary based on
availability at that particular time, but typically it averages about 10% of
the overall mix, with the balance either European or OEM.  By comparison,
most vendors' mixes are about opposite, mostly aftermarket with a genuine
seal here or there.
