--Bob,

I will do as you say, but I must say that the problem occurs only right as I get underway and my gut feel is that it is from the power train. The vibration is much faster than the speed the wheels are rotating.It also lessens if I use more gas and get off the clutch more slowly. Could I be choking the engine in some way?
