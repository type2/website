I had this happen to me. It took me a good hour to figure it out.

This happened on my 411. I was driving along, all of a sudden it sounds
like I dropped the exhaust. I pulled over, couldn't find anything wrong
(it was dark out) and got it home.

I sat there the next day going over the entire exhaust system. No holes
and everything looked ok. I get ready to do the compression test when I
found the (very obvious) problem. It turns out that a spark plug had
worked its way out. *doh*
