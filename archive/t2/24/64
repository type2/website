Subject: Bus Trailer Hitch For Sale

I've got a hitch assembly that I removed from a 78 Bus I had.  I'm not sure
what other years it will fit.  It's in good condition.  I'll take some
pictures and post them later in the day or email me and I'll send them to
you directly.  I'd like to get $50.00 for it.  Email me your zip code and
I'll check shipping to your location.   John
