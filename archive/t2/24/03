Subject: Re: Steering Wheel Removal / Ignition Switch

You really need a puller on early bay buses. I've done it without but had to
sacrifice the steering wheel.

I got a cheapie wheel puller kit from Harbor Tools for 7.99 (on sale).

If you don't mind spending 10 buck more go for the 3-jaw set. It's less
likely to bust the wheel.

Spray some Liquid Wrench around the splines a couple times a day for a few
days in advance too.

>Any ideas on how to get the wheel off, without the proper tools?
