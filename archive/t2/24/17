sounds like maybe a head leak...

hmmmmmm. easy way to check... I guess a compression test should do it real
quick.

what happens is a head is not pulled down tight or some other non seal
issue and the exhaust wears away the metal and soon you have a
"Leak" almost like a little channel carved in the head that allows the
exhaust gas to escape...usually means a new head, possibly a cyl or piston
