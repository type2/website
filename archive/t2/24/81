This could be a very dangerous problem.

Please check your wheels and tyres as soon as possible. Check for bulges or
other irregularities in the tyres which could indicate an immanent blow out.

Then jack up each wheel in turn and see if its loose - you must jack the van
up as the weight of the vehicle will make a loose wheel appear to be tight.

Both of the above will cause thumping at low speed which will disappear at
higher speeds.

On a less alarmist note - it could simply be that you have lost a balancing
weight off of the wheel, if you cannot see where then swapping the wheels in
sequence using the spare would show which tyre is the duff one. Running for
a prolonged length of time with unbalanced wheels will cause problems to the
other mechanical parts.

Certainly the first two possibilities above should be checked before driving
the van again; and I'm sure other listees will come up with other ideas

Good luck

anybody know why I might have a thumping noise accompanied by serious
vibration when I'm getting going in first? Seems like the clutch might be
slipping but my bug driving friend was telling me that that sound is a high
pitched squeal. thoughts?
