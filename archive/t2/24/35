Subject: 72 rear bumper, anyone?

I need a rear bumper for my 72 Rivi.  My original has one end pointing at a
30 degree angle.  I could heat, bang and twist it back, but my neighbors
would hate me and I'd probably set the house on fire again, so I thought I'd
see if someone has one or knows of one reasonably transportable to Los
Angeles.  Doesn't have to be perfect, as I get a strange joy out of wielding
my sledge hammer.

Thanks, Grant
