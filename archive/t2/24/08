Dean,
This doesn't sound like a generator problem to me.  It sounds more like a starter.  Wise ones correct me if I am wrong, but if you have got lights and fans, your battery still has a charge, which would in turn mean that your gen is doing its job.  Here's an easy test for your generator.  Get your bus running (jump it if you need) and while it is running, disconnect your battery.  If the engine continues to run, your gen is fine.  If the engine dies when you unhook the battery, then you have a gen problem.  If you find your gen is fine, start troubleshooting your starter.  It is really common for a VW starter solenoid to get rusted and gunked up on the inside and to fail (I have owned 3 running buses, and this has heppened on EVERY one.)  Also the next time it fails to start and you have lights, crawl under an give your starter solenoid a couple of good whacks with a wrench or small hammer and then try to start it again.  If it starts right up, you KNOW this was the problem.  I!

f it doesn't, refer to Muirs Idiots Guide in the "VW won't start" section for easy to follow troubleshooting directions.  Hope this helps!
