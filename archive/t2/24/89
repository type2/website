Subject: bus for sale for parts or project 69 in S. Calif

I've got a 69 bus that I bought to use for parts for another bus I had.
It's a sunroof bus, has front seats and a rear seat, no middle seat.  The
body is decent on it.  The glass is complete, doors are good, hatch and
engine decklid is good, has dash and steering column, front end, no engine
or trans.  I'm asking $300.00 but am open to offers.  I'm in Hesperia,
California.  I could deliver it within a 100 miles or so for expenses.  I
can email pictures, email me if you are interested in seeing them or have
any questions.

John
