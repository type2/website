Subject: Cargo Floor

Hi all,

I recently lifted the old wooden floor out of my '75 van. Underneith, rather
than finding a nice (if not dirty) cargo floor, I found a load of old engine
oil a previous owner had obviously put down under the floor to help keep
rust at bay (the oil is evenly spread across the cargo floor). However this
has not helped stop some surface rust appear.

Does anyone know the best way of removing oil from the cargo area?  I've
scrubbed it with a floor brush + soapy water and then a wire brush which
does work, but it's going to take a while and require a lot of effort. If
anyone has any products or sugguestions for easliy removing large areas of
old and highly sticky oil + dirt, I (and my back) would be most greatful.
