Subject: Re: [T2] Loose Shifter

I just purchased all the shift rod bushings for my 70 Single Cab from
Wolfsburg West................ and I mean all even the one that is usually
NLA................


I was experiencing a lot of slop in the shifter, so since the motor is out
for rebuild, I am going to do the shifter at this time.
