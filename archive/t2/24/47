Hi,
    Check out:

 For some collected stats on the topic.

 The executive summary is that 16 isn't unusual for city 
driving but that you should be able to do better than
that on the open road.

This is particularly true if you have an early
(smaller/lighter) camper and a smaller engine, since
the uprights force you to drive slower than the 
pancakes... It's not that the later engines are less
efficient, it's that they give you the ability to
use more fuel. They are heavier, too, though which
does have its own implications.

Cheers,
        W.
