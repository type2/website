Subject: green oil?

Here's a question. I recently changed oil on my 71
camper. Instead of putting in the usual 20-50 Castrol
half synthetic oil, I used a 20-50 Havoline non-synth.
I drove it about 300 miles. In that time the oil
managed to change to a very bizarre greenish color —
so odd that when I spotted an oil leak I didn't think
that this stuff could possibly be engine oil. Yet it
was. Anybody know what's going on here? Thanks.
