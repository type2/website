Subject: RE: [T2] Ignition switch removal

Dave,

The '68 is not the same as the '71. To remove the 68 is easy. Remove the
shear pine from the slit and push a pin in wiggle and slide the lock
cylinder out. If my memory serves me correctly the 71 is a whole different
ball game in that the pin is not accessible. here is what we do. remove the
hidden screws in the housing ( deep inside the wholes for mounting the
housing to the body) Then the trick is to grind or shave the face of the
lock cylinder off and then the cylinder housing will slid off exposing the
pin. Remove the now trashed lock cylinder and replace it. ($30-$35). I hope
this helps. FYI we sell used housings and cylinders for $75.00 (you just
slide it onto the column and that's that. We also have all the parts
individually.

Hi list!

I have been attempting to remove an ignition switch from a 71 bus in
order to use it on a 68.  They appear to be identical - does anybody
know for sure?

I successfully removed the steering wheel and pulled the entire
steering column sleeve that has the ignition switch housing, but I
still can't get the switch itself out.

Does anybody know the trick?

TIA
