Subject: Bus Trailer Hitch?

I have some photos of one, so I know it can be made.  I have a friend who
owns one, but the idiot welders around here refuse to duplicate it for me.

Does anyone have one to sell, or know of a place that will make one?

Here are some examples of what I'm talking about:

I'm soon relocating to Northeast Georgia, if location matters (which I'm
sure it does with something this heavy)

I'm really starting to consider the whole "Learn to weld" idea.  Welding is
not cheap.
