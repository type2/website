Subject: Any resource like this for Type 1s?

Is there a list/message board/classified web site similar to this one for 
Type 1s out there on the web somewhere?
My wife has talked me into dragging the old Cal Look bug out from the garage 
and doing a little work on it for next year.  I'll be needing some parts for 
it, and I need to try to pick up some other stuff for some old sunroofs that 
I have secreted away, too.
If anyone can point me in the direction of a good Beetle source here on the 
net I'd be much obliged.
Thanks,
