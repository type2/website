>I have advertised this van before, but I didn't know enough about it to
>describe it beyond a one-line ad. Following is a write-up by the woman who
>owns it:
>
>1977 Volkswagen Westphalia vanagan.
>Hello, thankyou for your interest in my "bus" as they are fondly called by
>longterm owners.  I bought this bus three years ago when it's one and only
>owner, an elderly woman from Storm Lake, Iowa was retiring to a nursing
>home.  This bus had a nice story; a grandma & grandpa had bought it new
>when grandpa retired (grandma of course didn't work outside of home and
>community)  They bought it to take trips in, and they did, 70,000 miles
>they put on this bright sunshine-coloured bus before grandpa died rather
>suddenly leaving grandma without a partner to travel with.  She put the bus
>in the garage, and it stayed there for the next 10 years; immaculate but
>unused, unfunned.  So, that's the story.
>When I bought her it was truely an immaculate vehicle,and wonderful except
>for all the seals had dried out over time and needed to be replaced.  The
>engine seals,transmission, brake system,heating system,etc.  I had it
>thoroughly gone over  by a very competent shop in Minneapolis  called The
>Volkswagon Man, a vw repair place located on Hennepin Ave.  All in all it
>cost me about 2000.00 to upgrade the systems, including a good musical
>sound system.
>  I'd like five thousand for the machine.  It is a very surprising vehicle
>because it has virtually no rust.  Ideally I would like to see it sold to
>someone who loves vw's, because that's what it deserves, to be cared for.
>It would make a great vehicle for family camping.  I initially bought it
>for just such a purpose; we were moving from Minneapolis to a farm in
>northeast Iowa.  Well, I still have the farm but I am no longer able to
>support this vehicle, and am offering it for sale to the highest bidder
>over 3500.00.  I bought it for 5 and have about 7 into it so that seems
>real fair to me.  Also, if you take care of this machine it will not lose
>its' value, infact, it will increase and that's not something you can say
>about many vehicles. This vehicle will still be worth five thousand dollars
>next year, keep it five years and it will be worth more.
>  I am especially interested in solar applications for a bus of this type.
>It has a sink, a folding table, built-in cooler, kitchen cabinets, ample
>clothing storage, water storage,etc.  The top pops up to become a second
>story loft space,complete with screen window, greatly increasing one's
>comfort in moving around the vehicle to prepare a meal,etc. It sleeps four
>easily.
>  This vehicle can be viewed in Decorah, Iowa or LaCrosse,Wisconsin,
>whichever conveniences you.
>
>  Thankyou for your interest.
