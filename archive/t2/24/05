Subject: Exhaust Leak noise

Hello again,

Yesterday I was driving my 79 ASI VW and out of nowhere it started making a
loud "exhaust leak" like noise.  It seemed to lose some power too, and would
not stay running.  I have not driven it since because I do not want to cause
any damage.

Does anyone have a clue what the problem may be.. or where to start looking?
The noise does not seem to be coming from my muffler or exhaust system.


thanks in advance
