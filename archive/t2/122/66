Subject: VW paint colors

hi-

I am looking for pictures of examples of authentic VW
paint colors in shades of yellow, green and blue to
help me decide which to use on my Bus(tm).  My plan is
to use either Savannah Beige or something similar to
antique white above the beltline.

Particularly interested in seeing an example of
"Chrome Yellow (L20A)," but also "Sunshine (L11E),"
"Yosemite (L62H)," "Lemon (L15M)," and "Marina (L21M)"
yellows.

If you have pictures you can email or that I can link
to, I'd appreciate hearing from you.

I may even consider that hot, deep yellow that Porsche
uses on the Boxter.
