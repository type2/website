Possibly. But first you need to know what you're dealing with.

Does your present setup look like this?

If so, and only the muffler itself is bad, then you're looking at $75 for a
brand new European made replacement from us (to give you a basis of
comparison).

However, if your present system lacks all of the piping shown, then you
probably have an aftermarket extractor system on your bus now, not a stock
muffler. In that case, you'll need another extractor system (which we also
sell for $75 with listmember discount, our part number 352000).  I'm not
sure Midas would carry something like that.
