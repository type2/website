Subject: anyone dealt with Volkloco.com?

Hey.  
Has anyone dealt with Volkloco in New Orleans, or their website?  I'm 
just wondering if this is a good place to go.  This summer i'm planning 
to take the bus to New Orleans to "check out a school" and i figured i'd 
stop by there, and see what they could do to it.  I don't have any kind 
of dedicated aircooled VW shop near me, i thought it would be cool to go 
somewhere where i wouldn't have to explain the workings of the aircooled 
engine to the guy who would work on it (which i don't, by the way.  I do 
all my own work, for just that reason).

Thanks for any info you can give...
