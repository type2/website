My main objection to Midas (and most other "chain" systems) is the lack
of competence at the installer end. That (coupled with the fact that a 
bus probably hasn't been in your Midas shop in how long?), usually means
some guy is gonna be learning on your vehicle...I'd almost bet that some-
body on the list can recommend another VW-familiar mechanic in your
locale...
