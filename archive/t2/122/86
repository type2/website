I'm usually the first to bitch about poor service so it seems only fair =
that I also share a good experience.

A week ago or so I queried the list for a source for a fuel tank for my =
1970 westy.  I was referred to BustedBus.  It's been a great experience =
- got a better fuel tank than any I'd come across in the junk yards =
around here (SF bay area) for about half the price I was being quoted.  =
Tank arrived within 4 days and now I'm on to the next item on my endless =
punch-list of things to fix.

Thanks for the great service Joe,

Juan
