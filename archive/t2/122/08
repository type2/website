Hi Richard,

There are five factors involved here:

1. The condition of the bus. Three long days in a row will be likely to
bring any mechanical deficiency in the vehicle to your attention. The
condition of the drivers seat can have a big impact... see point #4. I would
only try this if the bus was in tip-top mechanical condition.

2. The condition/type of road to be driven. 500 miles of interstate driven
at 60-65mph is a lot easier than driving 500 miles of 50 mph 2-lane
secondary highways that snake through a town, city or village every 25
miles.

3. The type of country you're travelling through. This includes road grades
and surface and weather conditions. Hilly/snowy/headwinds/potholes = slower,
longer days.

4. Your personal endurance level, and that of any passengers. I can sit for
two twelve-hour days in a westy seat no problem, but on the morning of the
third day my back is not too pleased with me. If my three kids are in the
back then we start looking for a campsite after 6-8 hrs on the road. YMMV.
If you have a second driver and sympathetic passengers you can considerably
extend your range.

5. Personal motivation. If you want/need to get somewhere badly enough you
can overlook item number 4 and push yourself to superhuman efforts in most
cases. But don't forget that item number 1 is under no obligation to comply
with your personal wishes.

Weigh the above factors in your case and decide accordingly.


Happy trails,
