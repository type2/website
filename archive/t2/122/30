Subject: Re: [T2] Timing marks

Hi Rob,
the part you referred to is known as the igniton timing 
scale. The original one that you are missing was made of 
metal and had the numbers and lines painted on. The 
paint on my original one wore off. Plastic replacements 
with marks molded in are available from several vendors. 
I got mine from Bus Depot for $3 or so. I'm not sure if 
78 came with the mesh cover or not. Whenever vw started 
putting smog pumps on they left off the cover. Try the 
boneyard, Busted Bus or the Bus Boys.
