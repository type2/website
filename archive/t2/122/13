Subject: Timing marks

Happy Friday,

I'm missing the timing indicator chart (or whaterver it's called)
that's supposed to be bolted to the fan housing, as well as the
mesh screen pulley cover from my '78 2.0 FI engine.  Any idea
where to get these (and what they are commonly called?)  Also, is
there any way to set the timing without the chart thingie?

Thanks,

Rob
