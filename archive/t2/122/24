I have no idea what temp the VW engineers designed the oil to run at.
But water boils at 212F. At slightly lower temps does the moisture in
the oil start to change to a vapor state? (george?) Or will it need to
rise to water's sea level boiling point? I feel better knowing that
the oil is getting hot enough to burn off any moisture from
condensation.
