Subject: CV Joint Swap



Folks, I'm about to remove the CV Joints and axles on the '76 and swap them for some that are newer off the
parts bus.  It's a '77 and I'm just wondering if I might be getting myself into trouble with the swap.  Do
they fit, any alterations I need to know?
I know the PO of the '77 and he is a very good VW guy who cared alot about doing things right so I'm sure the
joints and axle's are good.

Any tips'd be appreciated...
