Subject: PPG vs. Glasurit Paint

Howdy all,

I am in the preplanning stages of major restoration
work on both my '71 Westy and my '59 Panel, and right
now I am considering paint choices.  For the sake of
competition, I have assembled the paint codes for my
years, with the corresponding PPG codes from Wolfsburg
West's site.  I contacted a local Glasurit dealer, and
got info about their codes, and availability.  I have
determined that the Glasurit is more expensive, and I
have so far not found a dealer of PPG in town (not
done trying yet)  

My questions are thus:

1.  About how much paint, on average, would be used to
paint a baywindow shell, inside and out?

2.  What are the advantages/disadvantages of either
brand?

3.  what experiences have listmembers had with either,
and is there a concensus about these brands, or
others?

Any info would be appreciated.

Thanks

Blake
