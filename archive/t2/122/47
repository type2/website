Look at the Napa #75598 coil-over shocks for the rear.  They fit perfectly 
(on my '72) with a top bolt about 1/2 inch longer than the factory 
bolt.  The ride is much improved and I am very pleased.

Every time this coil-over subject comes up, it provokes several responses 
so I will summarize the results of the last discussion: a half dozen or so 
list members responded that they had used the coil-over shocks and were 
very pleased, 8-10 list members with no first-hand experience whatsoever 
weighed in that they though using coil-overs was a bad idea, only one list 
member with real first-hand experience responded in the negative.
