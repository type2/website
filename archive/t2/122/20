Subject: Long Island Bus Owners Club

Hi Everyone,
    This being friday and all, I'd like to use up some band width on a
non-maitenenace topic.  If any of you live on or near Long Island, New York
I'd like to make you aware that there is a club for bus owners here on our
little island.
    The Long Island Bus Alliance has been in existance for about 11/2 years
now.  We meet monthly at a local diner on the second Monday of most months,
we sponsor a campout called LiMBO On Long Island with the second one planned
for June 7,8, + 9, and have taken trips together.
    We are open to anyone who has a bus, wants a bus or is just plain
interested in buses.  Our members are of all ages and live on or near  Long
Island.  If you'd like to join us go to
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/busalliance/  and subscribe.  Then you'll be
on the e-mail list and will find out about all of our activities.  Or feel
free to contact me.
