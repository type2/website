Howdy,

The distance calculation is pretty easy:
50 miles per hour (average) x 10 hours = 500 miles

The application of this is a little more tricky:  An average speed of 50mph 
means you have to travel faster than 50mph for every minute you travel less 
than 50mph.  In a Bus, this is a very real possibility, especially in the 
mountains.  As someone else mentioned, try to make time and distance on the 
flats, and go slower in the mountains.  Set overnight stopping points at 
500, 600, and 700 miles, and try to hit one of them when your endurance 
gives out.  If you can make 700 miles the first day, and 600 the second, you 
only have to go 200 on the third day in order to stay on schedule.

Of course, all this hinges on the idea that your Bus stays trouble-free and 
running...

Good luck!
