Subject: Broken Bus/ HELP

   JP from New Mexico is having engine problems on his way to TUCSON. He us
on Hwy 191 heading south some where by Safford??  He is limping along and
can get to speed on the flats but appears to have lost number 3 cylinder.
    I'm trying to give a heads up to anybody in that area that might be able
to help him. I am taking my truck and empty trailer to Tucson so if nobody
else can help him I will go get him.

and I will give you JP's cell number
