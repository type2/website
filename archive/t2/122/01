 A SECOND external oil cooler??
Does the engine really get that hot?
I live in Australia & it gets pretty hot here during summer but one cooler is enough here.
What sort of revs are you doing to need a second one?
Or is it the fact that your bus is only a 1600cc?
Even still, I'm not sure why a second one would be necessary unless you were running some sort of crazy turbo engine.
Maybe you need a bigger or more efficient cooler if the one isn't doing the job at the moment.
What does everyone else think?

I am seriously in need to install a Cyl. Head Temperature sensor & reading gauge since my '75 bus' engine gets hot easily, up to 165-170 F (oil sump heat sensor) on a hot sunny day in bumper-to-bumper traffic here in Jakarta, and I heard that a CHT is the most accurate temp. reading & highly recommended by the experts... Therefore I would appreciate it if anyone could describe to me a clear step-by-step instruction on how to install a CHT sensor & gauge.

To address that heat problem, I am also thinking about installing a second external oil cooler, would it be a good idea?

Thanks in advance and I'd love to hear any responses....
