Subject: More hubcaps

Hi group.

Just a quick question about hubcaps.  Every week I go to the junkyard and
there are any number of VWs with the familiar small moon "VW" hubcap, most
just need a quick polishing to be perfect.  Hubcaps at this particular place
are $3.83 each, and I was wondering if it would be worth it to horde all
these hubcaps instead of send them to the crusher.

I've always heard they are so rare, and the vendors have replacements that
don't look 100% correct, but I often see them everywhere.  I could end up
with quite a collection.  I already have a dozen or so.

So, save them for posterity?
