Here is the procedure I used:
First of all, 1) remove the old rivet with chisel and a BFH (big f-in hammer).  2) Then spend the next 2 hours with said BFH, and a concrete block under the wheel with the new rivet between the block and the wheel.  3)Smash fingers 10-12 times with BFH trying to flatten rivet enough to hold. 4)Tell your kids NEVER to repeat all the colorful words and expression they just heard Daddy using after smashing fingers. Lastly 5) Get a pop-rivet gun (hand squeeze type) and large-ish rivets and attach the clips with this.  For what it's worth, next time I will skip steps 1 thru 4!!
Peace, John Baker
