don't go near Midas for anything!

VW mufflers are bolt-up components, unlike the long tubular exhaust
systems on 'merican cars.  Get the components from bus suppliers, many of
whom are on the list.

A hint:  If you buy cheap components, you will pay more in the hassle of
getting ill-fitting components to fit than you save in money.
