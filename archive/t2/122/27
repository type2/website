Subject: Need Donor Pop Top

Hi All,

I'm looking for a pop top, cheap or better yet free.  Any year (68-79),
any
condition, only need the large piece.  Prefer damaged, dirty or both,
whatever, is fine, I'd just rather not use one in real nice shape.  I'm
working on a single cab project and am interested in the top horizontal
section with the molded in ribs, I have no need for the vertical sides
(well maybe the rear/front vertical piece).  I'd be cutting out the
portion I need and fiber glassing in some new pieces to make it fit a
single cab (as a bed cover).

Thanks,

Chad Sibert
