I was really surprised that the "electronic" ground in my Porsche 911 wasn't
optically isolated from the rest of the system. Opto-isolators aren't
expensive and I would think that with the noise in the engine compartment
you would get some cross-talk in the data lines to the DME (like the EXU on
the bus). But I guess Porsche was happy putting the DME under the driver's
seat (which, if you ever need to look, is where the puppy lives).

I have a habit of thinking 'little electric fuel pump' when I think of fuel
injectors - but they are actually little solenoids with the fuel pump
creating the pressure. A small solenoid takes MUCH less current than a pump
and thus would run off of line-level signals from the EXU.
