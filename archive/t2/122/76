Subject: 1981 Westy for sale

I’m vacationing in Illinois and came across this Westy 
for sale in Springfield.  Here’s what the “For Sale” 
sign says:
-----------------------------------------------
1981 VW CAMPER
New body work & paint job, rebuilt
engine and rebuilt transmission, new 
clutch cylinder & pressure plate, 
battery, starter, alternator & carb.

$7500 invested, make offer.

744-3905
------------------------------------------------

I assume the area code for the phone number is 217.

The vehicle looks pretty good and I’d say it also has 
new window rubber that isn’t mentioned in the for sale 
write-up.

Just thought I’d post this for anyone who’s interested.
