Subject: RE: [T2] 77 Muffler

I'll try to get the stock type. My bus used to have some cheap aftermarket 
muffler and
it did not fit right, leaving it without heat.... Changed the muffler to 
stock and now we
have heat (as much as you can get from stock heat ;-) ).

On another note, I didn't know BusDepot had a listmember discount. How one 
does get it?
