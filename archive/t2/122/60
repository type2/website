Also consider that the oil in the heads does reach a higher temperature than
what is reported in the sump by the gauge.

Figure that the water is burned off in the heads.

You do not have to run 212+F to get rid of the water from the oil.
Watercooled cars typically run 180F thermostats and evaporate the water
just fine.
