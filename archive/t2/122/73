<< Hello all. Can anyone out there point me in the correct direction concerning the above mentioned items? Would like to have a set for my new 2.0L. >>

Robert,

Make_sure_you really want to deal with them before you spend $$ on them.  My last bus came with a set and I was very underwhelmed by them.  They were more difficult to remove and reinstall than the stock ones; they leaked quite a bit; the "ribs" that are stamped into their outside surfaces catch oil, dirt and other debris and make them difficult to keep clean and decent looking.

I replaced them with a stock set that I got from a local VW shop and am much happier.  Stock covers are easier to remove, they don't leak as much and they are easier to keep clean.

If you_really_want a set, I'll give you a deal on my used ones if I can find them!
