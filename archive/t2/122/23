I defer to Adrian on the T1 vs. T4.  I like to get up to 210 because that
really reduces the "mayo" problem.  I have a T4, tho, and that may color
my perceptions.  I will be installing an oil temp gauge on the '67 when I
get it back, but I started putting gauges on engines after I moved from
T1 to T4 engines.  The T4 definitely forms mayo below 210  and it does not
go away until you reach 210 or drive it for 3+ hours at a lower temp.
This seems to be more of a problem with the T4 engine, tho.

Absolutely true!  In the southwest, I drive by the oil temp/pressure gauge
more than the speedo.

My gauge is from a diesel vanagon and does not have numbers, but that
sounds about right to me.  As I said, tho, the CHT is the bounciest of the
gauges and moves up or down far faster and to greater extremems than the
oil gauges.
