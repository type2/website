Subject: RE: [T2] '78 Bus FI troubleshooting - only runs on cold-start after engine swap

I just went through this myself (put a 78 engine in my 79.)  There
should be a wire from the + side of the coil (terminal 15) going to =
terminal
86c on the relay.  This wire provides power to the relay, and if
I remember correctly, controls the switching of power to 88b.  There =
should also
be a wire from the coil (terminal 15 again) to the fan relay, which
in turn gets juice from the ignition switch (I'm a little foggy on this
part as my PO had removed the fan ran the ign wire straight to the =
coil.)

So, to summarize, turn on the key, test power to terminal 15 of the
coil (+ side) and if that is good, check power to terminal 86c on the
double relay.  I'm willing to bet this is where the problem is.
