Subject: Re: [T2] 77 muffler

Who would you suggest if not Midas and the likes?
Here is my situation.
I'm looking to replace my muffler also, its a 79' engine with 79' Cal
exhaust
setup.  The California setup differs though in that the CAT is located
before the
drivers side heat exchanger. So it is not next to the muffler as in the '79
federal setup. The problem is that my muffler is welded to that heat
exchanger
with a pipe not any bolt up deal.  A diagram is show in the Bently manual -
page #15 of "Engine And Clutch" section, bottom diagram.
Going by the diagram it looks like this was the stock setup.

If I purchase a new muffler and take it to Midas. Wouldn't it be as simple
as them removing the rear bumper, cutting of the old one and welding
the new one on? Or is it not as simple as it appears?

TIA
Alex Wisniewski
