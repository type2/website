Subject: sliding door track cover

Hey everyone,

I'm finalizing the last pieces on my bus restoration. The covers for the
sliding door track are pretty rusty, and I'm thinking of using new or used
to replace them. I sent a note to Chris at Busted Bus, and checked out Ron's
stuff at Bus Depot. Ron, if you are reading, is this a factory piece or a
reproduction? Has anyone used the piece from Bus Depot? I've gotten many
quality parts from Ron, but I'd prefer to stick with NOS if possible, or
good used, before I go for anything repro. Here's Ron's link:

Thanks,

Ned
