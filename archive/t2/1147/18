Subject: Re: [T2] seafoam?

   Mr. Fixit: The SeaFoam website, which claims the stuff has been around
since the 1930s, says the gunk and dissolved carbon all flush into the oil,
which then has to be dumped and replaced. But it seems to me that this could
cause compression problems in a worn engine. Art

  remember if you knock off a bunch of crud, where does it go?
  Seafoam is loaded with detergents. i have used it. and had good luck. but I
am always skeptical of where all that gunk winds up . so it is possible to do
more harm than good..maybe..Joe
