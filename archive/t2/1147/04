Subject: Rear apron

Hi all,

Has anyone tried to repair the area behind the rear apron of a '78 bus? It
was hit (surprise, surprise) in the rear. The passenger side is rotted out
behind the apron in the  corner at the end of the chassis beam. I have made
most of the parts that are unavailable, but I don't know if I should take
out the whole thing and replace the cancer or do it in place. 

A while ago someone from the list suggested a restoration book that was
published in England. It's a great source of info with photos covering
everything except what would be the best course of action. Any ideas??

Thanks,

Bob
