Subject: Help with wires

We've got two mystery wires coming off of the control unit cables. We've
found the appropriate places for most all of the other wires, but these two
have us stumped:

The haynes manual claims that they go to the fuel injectors, but there
doesn't seem to be a male counterpart...

Can anyone help?
