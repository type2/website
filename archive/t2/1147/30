Subject: Re: [T2] AADCO new sway bar design - VOLUNTEER BUS NEEDED

I have been using and installing their #808 7/8" front sway bar for a few
years now and it is far superior to the Empi. The biggest issue is finding a
vendor. I use Shox.com The trick is their database only has Vanagon, but
once you get to the listings, it comes up under 68-79.

I spoke to John Wright last September about some replacement bushings for a
#808. He sent them out no charge. I also spoke to him about his vendors
mislabeling their product and their lack of using VW specialty vendors. It
is good to hear they are back on track and developing new products for our
bays!

Keep the list updated on the new product. I'd volunteer in a second if I
were in your area.
