  Whnere I live it's a steep uphill either way I go.  Warming up the 
engines make them sound and work better up the hill.  Being undriven for 
a few weeks especially must allow time for the lifters to pump up. I had 
the original 250,000 mi NO REBUILD 78 that still had over 100 
compression and 24 mpg at 50 mph (any faster and I used more oil, mostly 
from seals I believe). The rebuild was prompted by this and low oil 
pressure when hot and loss of power on hills- the teardown showed the 
cam bearings were worn out.  I rarely drove it floored (always 
downshifted) and used TUFOIL moly additive most of its life.

  Bob Hoover used to insist on giving your VW its warm-up time. I used
  to think this was a bit overboard, but after thinking about this
  thread, it makes me wonder if it is wisest.

  When I went through high school auto shop in the 70s, we were taught
  that idling is not good for an engine and that it is better to drive
  to warm up, just being easy on the gas until it is warmed up.
