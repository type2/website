Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pressure with Kadrons

Jack,

Electric fuel pump or manual?
Are you running a Fuel Pressure Regulator?

It sounds like you are indeed starving the carbs. Fuel pressure set too high
won't make the carbs run rich, it can overwhelm the float bowls, but once
they are full, they close the inlet valve and the fuel just sits and waits
to get in. You would have to really blast them with high psi to flood them
out.

I think you are on the right track with your thinking. If a manual pump runs
3-5 psi, I doubt the Kadron designers made them need less pressure. That
would mean every Kadron owner would need to install a fuel pressure
regulator to drop the psi, which would be really odd.

I do know I can't get dual Dellortos or Webers to run right on a manual fuel
pump. They just need a consistent amount of pressure from an electric pump,
at least at out altitude.
