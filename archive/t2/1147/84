Subject: Re: [T2] Help with wires

Those are definitely not fuel injector wires.  They're intended for connection
to a spade terminal.

I'm pretty sure those are ground wires.  The FI harness has two broken out.

If my memory serves me right one of those goes to the underside of the plenum
and the other one goes to a wire coming through the firewall near the fuel
pressure regulator.

Without a bus to consult,
Zack
