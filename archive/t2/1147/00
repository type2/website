Subject: Side Step

I went to an auto jumble yesterday and picked up an angle grinder and some 25mm 
x 25mm box-section steel.
The intent is to embark on my first, simple(hopefully) arc welding project with 
the aim of making a side step for our bus.
I have an old stick (MMA/SMAW) welder that I've played around with before and 
I'd like to break it out again.

The idea is to mount it in the jacking points similar to 
the aluminum (aluminium) ones that you can buy new.

Does anyone have one of these steps?  I'd like to know how they are fixed in the 
jacking points.  Is it just a friction fit or is there some
drilling involved for a bolt fitting?

Also, 25mm is just a bit too wide to fit in the jacking points.  That's sort of 
a pain as standard box-section steel comes as either 20mm or 25mm.
7/8 in. can also be found here (in the U.K) and that is slightly wider than 22mm 
so maybe that is my answer.
The other option is find find a couple of busted jacks and scavenge the jacking 
point bars off of them!

If anyone else has fabricated their own side step, then I'd like to hear how it 
went for them.

Thanks,

Josh
