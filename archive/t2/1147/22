I have one of these on my bus and it works great, and it looks like it was a
factory option on the dash too!

I got a pair of teflon wipers for my '79 bay
awhile ago.  They really go a great 
job of clearing the windscreen.  Only
problem is, unless I'm in a downpour I 
rarely need to use the slow and fast
settings on my wipers.  One swish every 
8-10 seconds works just fine. 
Tapping the lever up manually gets to be tedious.
