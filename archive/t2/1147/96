Subject: re: fuel pressure with Kadrons

The engine runs just fine now. Remember my previous post where I 
described how I had taken the advice on the sites of several vendors 
and installed a fuel pressure regulator to limit my pressure to 1.5 
psi - what one vendor said was an ideal value.

Today I reset the regulator to the stock value of 3 (easier than 
removing it entirely) and the engine idled and ran just great.

So if your engine sputters and lacks power, fuel pressure is a good 
place to start.
