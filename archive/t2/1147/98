Subject: streaking window seals and tin screws

we have an 83 Westy that has window seals that are old. when it rains they
leave little black "streaks" on the paint.
since I do not have the time/money to pull all the windows right now, is
there any way to rejuvenate these short of
Armorall or the like?  also I am looking for the original Type IV screws
that hold the engine tin on this old bird. thanks all!
