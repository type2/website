I got ya Larry
but on the list.. there are many folks ,, all different backgrounds....   I
have had many ideas open my mind.. and some that scare me tooo....  lol
I have always wanted to write a book... how to [roadside] fix your vw  with
3 tools

or something like that.........   there are a TON of ideas that I am
impressed with that are sooooo simple ..

I had a guy beat me to a camp out once... story goes...we were halfway there
,he broke his steering components off the beam...  he got a tow to a weld
shop.. fabbed up a bracket,, welded the steering back together... and was
waiting at the camp when I arrive!  wowzer and it looked factory !!!   nice
job!  it will outlast the bus I am sure.

but that is another thread..   lol
