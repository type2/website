   Jon: I spent most the recent decades in San Francisco, no weather challenge
at all, but a bit of clatter at startup was fairly common on all three vans,
ranging from a '68 to an '82, more pronounced when the oil was a bit low.
Clearly these things are as cranky as I am when disturbed. It always bothered
me, and has bothered many, but there's a school of thought, or is it fallacy,
that this is not really an engine destroying itself but just clearing its
mechanical sinuses. I hope so. Art
