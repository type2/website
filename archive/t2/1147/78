Subject: Bosch AL108X

I found a rebuilt Bosch AL108X (70a alternator).  The thing arrived 
today.  It didn't have the biscuit that slips into the slot on the 
pulley shaft to keep the pulley from spinning.  It also didn't have a 
pullet nut.  Although the pulley I have fits the shaft, none of the 
several nuts I have does.  They are all considerably smaller.  Does 
anyone know what size nut this could be?  All the others I've 
encountered are 22m.

Is the biscuit thing necessary?  Should I be able to source one locally?

TIA,

dan
