Thanks 200 SF is the number I needed to answer the how much question.

Your project looks great in the pics!

I have several things that i wanted to improve on our bus.

-noise levels (same problem in our Honda)
-power enough to run 65 mph without 55 mph hill climbs on the interstate
-wobbling windy driving characteristics. The noise was the last batch of 
questions to answer.
-heat (found that the stock heat was missing some parts)
