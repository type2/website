Thanks for the links. Yes, Chrome translates in Windows too. I love
Chrome. It has really opened up the internet. Some languages translate
better than others.

Interesting that the initial offering price of the post-war production
of 5000 marks is considered 16,000 euros in today's money. Makes it
look like today's car prices aren't so bad after all. It's just that
after growing up with ads for $2000 VW's, cars of today seem hideously
expensive.
