That might be the key there. The main thing is to observe the needle
while you crank and see how much it pumps up on each stroke. All 4
cylinders should behave about the same, and don't stop cranking until
the needle tops out. Your 2 weak readings might have come up had you
cranked it another turn or 2.

 through there in the heat of summer for about 40 years, from Sacramento or
 San Francisco to the great Pacific Northwest, and wondered how human life
 was sustained in that pizza-oven heat, sometimes 110 degrees and even
 higher. I stopped for gas once in an '82 van and couldn't restart it --
 the pistons had seized up. I called Triple-A but by the time the tow truck
 arrived the pistons had unseized and the starting motor could crank the
 engine, and I was able to drive off. I never again, over the years,
 turned-off an engine in Redding. Art

Okay. I was born and raised in Sacramento. I couldn't understand why
Redding/Red Bluff temps were always 3 or 4 degrees higher than Sac
because I figured the farther you got from the equator, the lower the
temps. Interesting experience about your piston seizing. How lucky it
unseized on its own.
