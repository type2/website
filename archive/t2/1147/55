Thanks Kevin. I'm moving to 15" wheels as part of my plan. I have a set 
of BBS Mercedes rims i bought from that auction site. Looks nice, $150. 
May choose to add swaybars but i don't want to give up the VW good 
manners on dirt and gravel roads. My CR-V AWD has pretty stiff swaybars 
which gives it good road manners but offroad (light duty roads) it rides 
pretty stiff. The old bus rides pretty smooth.

Will likely pick a tire size that fills the wheelwells just a little 
better. I have a friend with a Rivera who went to the tire store and let 
them pick the tires. They are better suited for a Corolla. Bus wobbles 
all over the place. Looks too small too. I want to put my CR-V tires 
under the bus just a for a look. I think at 205/65-R15 they'll be too 
big though. I expect I'll need something more like 185/65R15 or 
195/65R15 to make it fit.
