Jamie,
Just not something that I would ever do.  I was trained by the largest
fleet operator in the World.
The U.S. Army.  I know they have the money, but they also have EVERYTHING
at stake when something
breaks.  In Vietnam we did a lot of stuff when we had to with "field
expediency"  but as soon as possible
a tweaked part was REPLACED rather than trusted.
I was a Jeeper for over 25 years.  Saw LOT's of shadetree stuff, and a
lot of it broke.  Always at the 
worst time, and under the worst conditions.  I did pit crew at the Mint
400 back in the 80's and rebent
a lot of parts.......... but NEVER with heat.

Just sayin'

Larry
