Thanks for the info.  Now that I know it's a woodruff key I can 
certainly locate one.  As for the nut Ratwell's 70a alternator page says 
"The pulley thrust washer is 14mm ID and 2mm thick. The pulley nut is 
M14 (22mm WAF). The keyed shaft on the later units requires a M16 nut 
(24mm WAF)."  It seems he is correct.  It's too bad I have to track 
these parts down.  Seems like they should be included in my $200 rebuilt 
unit!
