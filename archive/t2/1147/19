Subject: Intermittent Wipers for Bay

  I got a pair of teflon wipers for my '79 bay awhile ago.  They really 
go a great job of clearing the windscreen.  Only problem is, unless I'm 
in a downpour I rarely need to use the slow and fast settings on my 
wipers.  One swish every 8-10 seconds works just fine.  Tapping the 
lever up manually gets to be tedious.

Came across a nice link on the web:

Seems pretty straightforward.  Volkswagen Canada wants $128 (!) for the 
relay but you can find it on ebay for much less.  Anyone tried 
installing the JC Whitney variable speed add-on?  It looks a little 
clunky but if it does the job, why not?
