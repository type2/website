Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pressure with Kadrons

Jack, I've always used the stock fuel pump with dual Kads on my bugs; it 
would be no diff with a bus engine. They're great carbs. You need to check 
what the main jets are and compare it with AJ Simms site on the net. He goes 
by the name of Mr. Kadron, just do a searchl. There is a wealth of knowledge 
on that site, and he answers questions readily. Hope that helps.

I read where fuel pressure should be set at 2 psi for Kadrons and PDSITs.
 Why is this? What are the symptoms of fuel pressure set too high?

If the part is the same, and the function of this part is to maintain
 a certain level of fuel in the float bowl, why would it not maintain
for a Kadron the same as for a 34 PICT-3 with 3 - 5 psi?
