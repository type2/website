Subject: RE:Side  Step

Hi Josh,

 

I have a side step on my '65. It is not one of those fancy aluminum ones, it
is basically a hollow square tube, that has to s-shaped solid bars bolted to
it. These s-shaped bars have holes drilled through them. 

 

I take the three pieces of metal(side step and two s-shaped bars) and the
thing slides into the jack points. The jack points also have holes drilled
in them. I then run a clevis pin through the holes and hold in place with a
cotter pin type thing.

 

This makes it easy to put on and off. And when you are working on your bus,
you will most likely want to take it off, as that allows for easier access
to the underside.

 

If this doesn't make sense, and you need pictures, let me know and I'll take
some and post them on the samba.
