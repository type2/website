Subject: fuel pressure with Kadrons

1776 with dual Kadrons
The engine will idle and rev in the garage, but I have to feather the 
accelerator pedal drastically to make the engine move the vehicle on 
the road.


I read where fuel pressure should be set at 2 psi for Kadrons and PDSITs.

Why is this? What are the symptoms of fuel pressure set too high?


For my Kadrons, the brass valve that regulates the flow of fuel into 
the float bowl seems to be identical to the ones I used for my 34 
PICT-3 carbs before I made the conversion.  Bentley quotes values 
between 3 and 5 psi for that carb.

If the part is the same, and the function of this part is to maintain 
a certain level of fuel in the float bowl, why would it not maintain 
for a Kadron the same as for a 34 PICT-3 with 3 - 5 psi?
