Subject: Re: [T2] Ball joint replacement in MD

Hey Larry.... don't get toooo wound up about doing ball joints with a little
heat, and a tack weld to hold the new ones in... it is done allllll the
time........   seen it with my own hands......    got my license in 81 , so
not as long as you.

any way,,,  I was going to tell you about the mack truck parts .... when you
shorten or lengthen a chassis,, you have to rearrange the steering
geometry.. so  a little heat, a well placed bend.. and she steers perfect
again..

then.. I was going to mention nascar.. or lets go a little more home grown,,
and show you how that right front is tweaked to take all that pressure going
into the corners...

and,, off road racers with mucho welded front axles......   that take super
huge punishment in the baja..

Jeeps that are lifted.......  the arms that are bent,, lengthened,, etc
etc...

it is done alllll the time..........

Jamie
