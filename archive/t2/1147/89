reacting to over-enthusiastic gushings like that below.

	I tried to send pix with this bull but got only 'reject 
reject  -  you are in VIOLATION of our 30,000K limit' and have 
therefore had to purge all pix.  I assume they are not fake images

	Makes you wonder what a modern economy-oriented 2-wheeler could do.
	John Dale, the Matchless agent of Auckland, set a 
FIM-inspected world record one Sunday morning c.1959 riding back & 
forth on the Auckland waterfront on a Matchless 350cc single 
extremely leaned-out (and the tyres blown up very hard).  From memory 
he scored >350 mpg.
