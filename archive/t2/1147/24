Subject: RE: [T2] Ball joint replacement in MD

Not that hard, I've got some early and late bay trailing arms if you want me
to do a set of balljoints, check for a 'safety' tack weld, it would probably
be easier to heat the part of the arm around the ball joint to a dull red with
an oxy/acetelyne torch and whack it with a hammer a few good times, remember
the lower ball joint has the ecentric on it and you will need to chase it down
and get it off of the ball joint when it has cooled.   I'll cut the shaft off
of the ball joint with the eccentric and then I can bench it in the vise to
whack the shaft out of the eccentric.

I charge 220 plus shipping plus core (50).
