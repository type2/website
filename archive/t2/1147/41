Subject: Re: [T2] "clear burn"

    Robert: A '53 (Ford) Meteor! Boy, does that bring tears of nostalgia to 
the eyes! Haven't seen one of those around here, about 50 miles below the 
Canadian border in the Pacific Northwest, since Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B 
Riders. I found some data that indicate about 32 oz. (a Yank quart) burning 
every 460 miles was not considered excessive by the VW factory itself, at 
least in the past. Add a little leakage here and there and I'm almost in the 
crosshairs of "normal." Not a usual thing. Cheers, Art, Spokane, Wash.
