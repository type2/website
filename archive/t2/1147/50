Reminds me of the sounds of an air cooled engine that was near and dear
to my heart.

See, I was a tank mechanic in the Army, and as a Motor Sergeant with the
Second Armored Division at Ft Hood 
Texas, my vehicle commander position was in an M88VTR (Vehicle, Tracked
Recovery).  That 55 ton Monster
had a 1790 CI Air Cooled, FI, V12 Supercharged  (not turbo) running on
gasoline and producing right at 1000 HP.

During the starting procedure, the engine was cranked (after fully
charging the batteries with an onbord generator)
until sufficient RPM's were reached, at which time the magnetos were
switched on.  Very loud rattles, belches
and other indescribable noises would start until all cylinders were
firing and the engine came to life.  There was always 
a lot of drama during this time as the engine would sound very much like
it was coming apart.

Not to brag, but on more than one occasion we had the machine topped out
at well over the 40 mph mark, at one
point on a long downhill, saw the speedo bounce to 60!  What a ride. 
Looked something like a bay with tracks.

My buses are similar.  Since I have built strictly hydraulic motors for
the last 20 years for my Bays, I am very 
used to listening to the clatter of the lifters, the waft of smoke and
the eventual settling down and smoothing out
after the first few blocks.  

It is all part of the bus mystique for me!

Just as an aside, I will be taking a trip to Vietnam (after 41 years
since my last trip) to distribute wheelchairs in
June.  There are still spaces available on the team, if anyone is
interested.
