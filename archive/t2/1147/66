I've got 195R14C on my '69 and my '65. They fit and look pretty good.
Although the spare does not quite fit right in the '65 (behind the front
bench seat).

Thanks Kevin. I'm moving to 15" wheels as part of my plan. I have a set 
of BBS Mercedes rims i bought from that auction site. Looks nice, $150. 
May choose to add swaybars but i don't want to give up the VW good 
manners on dirt and gravel roads. My CR-V AWD has pretty stiff swaybars 
which gives it good road manners but offroad (light duty roads) it rides 
pretty stiff. The old bus rides pretty smooth.

Will likely pick a tire size that fills the wheelwells just a little 
better. I have a friend with a Rivera who went to the tire store and let 
them pick the tires. They are better suited for a Corolla. Bus wobbles 
all over the place. Looks too small too. I want to put my CR-V tires 
under the bus just a for a look. I think at 205/65-R15 they'll be too 
big though. I expect I'll need something more like 185/65R15 or 
195/65R15 to make it fit.
