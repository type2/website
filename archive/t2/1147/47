We've already seen a nod towards a more scientific explanation in this
thread.

Air-cooled engines run so much hotter than water-cooled engines that
the initial machine tolerances have to be looser to allow for the
greater expansion of metal at the higher air-cooled temperatures.

Bob Hoover used to insist on giving your VW its warm-up time. I used
to think this was a bit overboard, but after thinking about this
thread, it makes me wonder if it is wisest.

When I went through high school auto shop in the 70s, we were taught
that idling is not good for an engine and that it is better to drive
to warm up, just being easy on the gas until it is warmed up.
