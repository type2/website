I did a tune-up yesterday.  The only anomalies were a slightly tight
#1 exhaust valve and a slightly less effect when pulling #2 and #4
wires on engine idle than for #1 and #3.  Compression was normal.
Timing was normal.  The engine started and idled normally from a cold
start.  I let it run for a good while and it idled fine though a bit
slow.  I opened the air screw a half turn to get a better idle.  What
I don't yet know is what will happen after the engine gets really
warm, as after freeway driving for an hour or more.  I'm heading back
home in a couple of days and will find out.  I'll update the list.
But as yet I don't have a conclusive outcome.

Best,
Jerry
