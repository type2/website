And then there was the guy in the early 80s at a hotrod show that i 
attended...

He was backing into a parking spot at the show when his steering broke. 
He was frustrated.

Apparently he needed a U-joint for the steering column to snake around 
the header pipes and he used a - - - -

1/2" Sears Craftsman socket set u-joint. I actually heard him say that 
he even bought a good one - with that famous warranty!

The failure? The rollpin had backed out.

Still gives me shivers... GRIN!
