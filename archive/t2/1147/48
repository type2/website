It's about the parts per million (ppm) before it becomes visible to
the naked eye. As other in the thread have noted, all engines burn
oil. The question is how much before it becomes a nuisance visually,
in consumption, and on the spark plugs (affecting your running).

 oil can burn without a trace of blue smoke. I never heard of that either, so
 it sounds like the guy was, ah, blowing smoke. Art
