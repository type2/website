Kevin is absolutely right. If your Bus is unstable in winds or corners, your
first step should always be to read your tires' sidewalls. They must be load
range C or D, or else your Bus will not only wobble but also be potentially
unsafe.  Other improvements may further improve handling, but you have to
start with the tires. (And if you're using underrated tires now, you may be
surprised at how much of a difference that alone makes.)  Unfortunately,
while there are some relatively inexpensive 14" tires that fit the bill
(such as our popular Hankooks), sufficiently rated 15" tires can be rather
pricy. But they are still a must. Do NOT let any tire dealer tell you that
if you use 15" tires you do not need the extra load capacity. You cannot
compensate for insufficient sidewall load capacity by using larger tires,
wider tires, or anything else. Volkswagen has always specified
sidewall-reinforced tires on all of their Buses and Vans - from early Buses
with 15" rims, all the way to Eurovans with 16" rims.
