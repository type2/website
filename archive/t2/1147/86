I would guess with Jamie.
 
Microswitch is mounted on the throttle body which is on the intake plenum,
front right hand side above #1, at the bottom of the S hose.  But as Jamie
alludes, depending on the combination of parts here, throttle body, harness,
etc you may or may not have the microswitch present.
