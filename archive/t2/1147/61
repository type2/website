   John: Having blown a few engines on my '68 (No. 3 piston, pushing too 
hard with a heavy load), I'm amazed that my '82 Westy runs so cool. You you 
can pop the hatch after a long drive and it's just warm, not hot (except 
outside of Redding, Calif., in July). This was the last full year of the 
Porche-designed air-cooled engine for the Vanagon and that basic engine, 
according to its many fans, had been proven a winner for 50 years in every 
climate from desert to arctic, and I think of that when I pop that hatch to 
confirm it hasn't melted on me....and despite its wheezing compression ratio 
in two cylinders. Interestingly, it runs so much better than those 
compression numbers indicate. I am suspect the numbers. Art
