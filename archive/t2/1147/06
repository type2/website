Hey Bob,

When I did mine, I had a metal jobber bend me a piece that we welded in
there. We used really beefy 1/8" stock, and bent it into a J shape. You
might be able to have someone locally do the same and weld it in.

My project is coming along. The whole shell has been painted, and the doors
all just came back from the stripper and will be painted next. Then I start
putting things back together.

How is yours?

Ned
