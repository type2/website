    Larry: That's most reassuring. This characteristic rattle is evidently the
lifters before they get that first drink of 10-30 proof Oleo De Luxe. My
calculator tells me you were last in Vietnam in 1970, not a good year for
that, from what I've heard. Good luck on your trip, and saluds for all of
that. Cheers, Art

  Reminds me of the sounds of an air cooled engine that was near and dear to
my heart... a 55-ton Army (tank) with
  a 1790 CI Air Cooled, FI, V12 Supercharged  (not turbo) running on gasoline
and producing right at 1000 HP....Very loud rattles, belches
  and other indescribable noises would start until all cylinders were firing
and the engine came to life.  There was always
  a lot of drama during this time as the engine would sound very much like it
was coming apart...
