Subject: Sheered hub to crankshaft bolt (2.0L)

Ugh. Driving down the road and the alternator light came on, then a  
scorching smell. The bolt that fastens the hub to the crankshaft  
sheered. Luckily I was within seven miles of home and not on the way  
to the Grand Canyon, as I would be next week.

So what would do that? To much or not enough backlash? Am I going to  
have to tear this motor down?

Would I have felt any vibration from wrong backlash? The motor was  
running smooth and quiet.
