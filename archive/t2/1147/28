Subject: RE: [T2] Ball joint replacement in MD

 Any time you have to heat a part that is pressed together, there is some
possibilityof removing some of the strength of the part as well.  Remember
that by heating thearm, you are also expanding and relaxing the metal, which
could have a profoundeffect on the ability of the arm to hold the new ball
joint and support the weight of the vehicle. I have been a professional
mechanic for well over 40 years, and I have NEVER heated, weldedor tried to
straighten a bent suspension part...... not worth the liability.  I have also
NEVER seenthat technique advised by anyone in print. My advice.. do not do it
this way.  Larry ............... back at the barn
