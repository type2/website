. small exhaust leak, fixed
. fuel pump runs when ignition is on, might use a little extra at starting 
but not the cause of terrible fuel.   have spare double relay should solve 
that.


.  ?? when I remove the hose from the Aux air regulator to the S intake 
engine does not stall and at high RPM seems to run better.  remove any 
other hose engine stalls.  ???   checked hoses they are ok and tight.
could the regulator failing cause that kind of problem???  seems it would 
run leaner not richer.??  don't think I have spare Bus Depot doesn't list 
em so gotta search around.

everything else seemed to be right on, but pulled plugs definately rich 
and carboned...

so far,  that's all I can find....
