Subject: Re: [T2] Side Step

on my '73 bus back in '74, I bought an original aluminum side step from the
dealership.  It had off-white mounting points on the ends which slipped into
the jack brackets.  there was also a brace type contraption on each end with a
"peg" that stuck through an existing hole on the jackbracket.  That brace
thingy was then held to the side step with a nut and bolt. In essence, the
metal bottom part of the jack braqcket was sandwiched between the side
step projectile which slipped into the jack bracket, then the flat metal
bracket thingy with the peg was placed underneath the bottom metal of the
jackbracket thingy.. the "peg" on it slipped into the existing hole in the
jackpoint.  The nut and bolt were just outboard of where the step "projectile"
part slipped into the jack point.   It also came with a long spring which
attached to the body.  I always assumed the spring was there to keep it from
rattling.

I have seen the steps held on with a single large spring in the center of the
step to a loop on the frame of the bus.  bungie cord would probably work as
well
