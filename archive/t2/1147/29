Geez, VW really wants their pound of flesh for this relay in Canada,
compared to the USA.  Dealer two blocks away gets $62.00 and I can get
the same relay (Kostal in Europe) and sell them for $15.00 or if
you're ambitious about $5 to $10 at a boneyard near you.

FYI, the old 321 955 531 A is superseded to 1HM 955 531, so either
number will work.

Or you could go the big time and get 3B0 955 531, the programmable
version for $40.

Lotsa options there.  I usually sell these to Vanagon owners at most
shows I sell at (these are standard on 83-91, optional on 80-82).
