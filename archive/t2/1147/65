   John: The compression test was done on a cold engine -- sitting for a
 week in just-above-freezing weather -- running the starter engine with
 nothing disconnected and each hole getting only about a two-second check,
 barely enough for a compression cycle. I later read this is not the way to
 do it but probably not uncommon at many shops. As for Redding, drove
 through there in the heat of summer for about 40 years, from Sacramento or
 San Francisco to the great Pacific Northwest, and wondered how human life
 was sustained in that pizza-oven heat, sometimes 110 degrees and even
 higher. I stopped for gas once in an '82 van and couldn't restart it --
 the pistons had seized up. I called Triple-A but by the time the tow truck
 arrived the pistons had unseized and the starting motor could crank the
 engine, and I was able to drive off. I never again, over the years,
 turned-off an engine in Redding. Art
