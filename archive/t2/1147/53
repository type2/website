I've got that relay in my '97 Cabrio. Really slick. Worthwhile upgrade 
to any car.

Turn it to intermittent when the rain starts. Turn it off after the 
swipe. Turn it back on when the next swipe is needed and your interval 
is set. If the rain increases or decreases, turn it off, wait the right 
amount of time and turn it back on. New interval set.
