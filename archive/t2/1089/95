Most of the genuine VW/Brazil parts I carry are intended for current
production Brazilian T2's but also fit German Buses. This includes, for
example, a lot of Bus window/door seals and sheet metal, as well as the
aforementioned sliding window (which I no longer carry).  However it is very
difficult to obtain genuine VW/Brazil items, as VW do Brasil will not sell
to U.S. accounts. As a result, those parts I can get often have to be
obtained sideways via other countries. Also prices are all over the place.
Sometimes an item is reasonably priced one day and prohibitively expensive
the next (i.e. $500+ for a sliding window that used to be $150).  Also, VW
has been cracking down on parts going to markets outside of the intended
one. So far this hasn't affected smaller/lighter items, but for example new
1600 cc engines (which are intended for distribution only within South
America) have become very hard to obtain.
