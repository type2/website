Subject: New Hubcap?

Hi,
Just spitballin' here...

I'm only a minor player in this community (ya'lls knowledge well outweighs
mine), however I'd be happy to help in any new hubcap effort, particularly
one that allows more open communication and interaction amongst folks
involved. I bounce around a fair amount in the FL/ GA area, have 1-3 trips a
year up and down the East Coast (FL to CT/MA) and have more ambitious plans
when I get the interior back in the Rivi.

Webwise I'm no great guru, but have some design experience and I could
likely provide some space and construction for a site detailing travel, pics
and contact info etc of the Cap II, and maybe some comment-able content, or
help someone else keep a site updated/ managed.

Mike
