Just to clarify, there is no diode between terminal 50 on the starter and
terminal 86a on the double relay.  If you apply power to 86a on the double
relay, you will energize the starter solenoid if the wire between terminal
50 on the starter and terminal 86a on the double relay is good, as Bob found
out.  As an aside, there will also be power at the ignition switch on the
terminal that normally only has power when the key is in the "start"
position.
