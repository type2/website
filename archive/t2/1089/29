Subject: Haunted horn

I had the steering box replaced in this 74 transporter. Should have done it
myself because the horn now goes off when the wheel is turned to the left.
The circuit for the horn is simple but I'm not sure how the wire runs down
the steering wheel shaft or where the thing is shorting out. Have any of you
had experience with this? The mechanic messed up this job so badly we are
not on speaking terms so I am not sure exactly what they did.


Thanks!

Jeff
