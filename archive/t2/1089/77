Subject: Re: [T2] New Hubcap?

I think everyone's thinking is moving in the right direction. With web
tracking it not only provides more accountability, but also let's
everyone track its travels. Plus I like the suggestion that on the web
we can post pictures of it and whatever trinkets it attracts along the
way.

 I'm still on the fence here.  Most of me agrees with Jamie, in that we
 should really try and get the hubcap back.  But, there is also the reality
 that we may not be (have not been) greeted with cooperation on that front.
  Starting fresh, with a new perspective and maybe some simple rules, would
 allow us to move on.  That's probably easier for me to say than for some, as
 Leah and I never did have the chance to carry it or bond with it.

 Regarding web space, if we are going to do this with relation to the type2
 mailing community (not that other enthusiasts wouldn't be welcomed,) then
 space on type2.com seems appropriate.  Development of a more modern site is
 in the works at this time, and blogging/cataloging it's adventures would be
 simple.

 Peace, Troy
