Alas, this is not an option for U.S. residents.  Any vehicle that you import
must meet modern-day U.S. EPA and D.O.T. standards, unless it is at least 25
years old.  The Brazilian Type 2's do not. South African made "Vanagons" do
not.  Even a brand new 2009 Volkswagen T5 (successor to the Eurovan) does
not, as it was not built for the U.S. market. There is no viable way to make
a Brazilian Bus meet those standards.
