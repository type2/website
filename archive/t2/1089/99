Sounds like we need to take a shopping trip to Brazil to buy a load of
stuff as if it were for local use, and then fill up a container and
send it home....

 difficult to obtain genuine VW/Brazil items, as VW do Brasil will not sell
 to U.S. accounts. As a result, those parts I can get often have to be
 obtained sideways via other countries.
  Also, VW
 has been cracking down on parts going to markets outside of the intended
 one. So far this hasn't affected smaller/lighter items, but for example new
 1600 cc engines (which are intended for distribution only within South
 America) have become very hard to obtain.
