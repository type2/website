I just voted. I like the idea of it being replaced, but NOT being a
hubcap. I think at this point if the original hubcap is recovered, it
should somehow be museumed. Whether it goes to VW to display or
somewhere else I don't know. But it *does* have history (and a lot of
trinkets) associated with it.

Whatever we do, if the original is recovered it needs to be thoroughly
documented with detailed photos and such.
