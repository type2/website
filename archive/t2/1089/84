Subject: Re: [T2] New Hubcap?

I was fortunate to be one of the first few people to see the hubcap back
years ago when it came through NC. I think I caught up to it again down in
Georgia a year or two later as well...
While a new hubcap might be a nice, fresh start, I think we need to make
every effort possible to find the original one, and I do mean every effort.
It has a lot of history attached to it, and all that needs to be preserved.
If we can't get it back, then what's to stop the next hubcap from
disappearing the next time someone is either lazy, or else deliberately
decides they want a nice piece of memorabilia?
I think some folks have tracked down the current holder - that's a great
first step. We now need to establish why that person still has it. Have they
not had a chance to move it along? Then let's organize a friendly rescue
party. That's really the best case scenario - someone got it, and for some
honorable reason or another just hasn't been able to pass it along.
However, if for some reason that person is unwilling to make efforts to move
it along, or even to allow it to be picked up, then we have another, much
worse situation. Quite honestly at that point that person has stolen an item
from our community. At that time, we could decide what steps to take, but I
don't think we should allow our hubcap to be held hostage, or just stolen
away.
So, again, it seems that someone here has contacted the current holder. (I
forget those names) Perhaps we can get some updates along those lines as to
what that person is proposing to help the Happy Hubcap get back on the road,
and then take it from there. I really hate to see us just abandon the
original one and all its history & memories...
