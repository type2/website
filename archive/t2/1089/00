When I was looking for the other version, I found this shirt which is
original artwork of the seller:

I was thinking of the memorial painting to Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin,
and Jim Morrision showing the three of them together in a surrealistic
place, and wondered if we could get him to do a memorial T-shirt to
Karl, Uncle Jerry, and Boston Bob.
