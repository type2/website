To parrot John below, even IF you get a motor from a supposedly "reliable" builder, there is no guarantee that it will not fall apart if it was built bad.  My 71 type 1 had a new motor (the only addition was an 1835 upgrade), and it came apart in about 500 miles (5000 would have been a blessing).  SERIOUSLY came apart.  Could never find out why - I do know they had the component lumps (there were very few parts not ruined) spread out on 2 workbenches, trying to figure out the point of collapse...  They made good, but I was without a car for a few days over that.

I would say - one, talk to people who have dealt with the rebuilders you are considering, to find out *their* impressions and comments, and two, talk in DEPTH with the rebuilders themselves.  KNOW they know what they're doing.

Finally on that - CHECK your anciliary un-changed parts CLOSELY before you put it on your new block.  Nothing worse than taking a new motor, slapping on, say, a wornout distributor, and having the wonky timing ruin your investment the hard way!

Also to the cable issues - hard to remember that a lot of the parts we get are sometimes as old as our machines...  not only may they have been faulty, but they've likely been sitting on a shelf, getting dusty and surface-rusty for, maybe, 40+ years.  Even if I get something "NOS" I look it over like a hawk...

About 5 years ago I installed a rebuilt engine from a reputable rebuilder. 
It ran like cr*p and failed after less than 5000 miles...

So, if you do not want to build your engine yourself find someone you trust 
to do it for you.  It will cost more but you will have what you want.

Cheers,

John R.
