Subject: Re: Haunted Horn

The important thing to remember is your horn is HOT at all times...  but yeah,
ususally it's the wire inside the column shorting out where (somehow) it got
pinched, or is just worn.  Mine blew everytime I hit RR tracks, and if I hit a
speed bump too hard - something about that certain bounce.  Eventually it
wouldn't shut up (in a safeway parking lot), so I unhooked the horn until I
pulled out the wire (with broken insulation).  To me - it sounds like it's
pinching right there.  

Ya know - I also remember a friends '68 that had
problems up in the horn button area as well, which led to symptoms like you
mentioned, but that bus had *other* issues as well (tweaker boyfriend with a
soldering iron had to "superfix" everything)...

NOTE - when I pulled the
wire, I tied a string to the end - made running the new wire easier.  I also
encased the entire new lead in shrink-wrap - kinda anal a bit, but I figured
the double insulation wouldn't hurt.
