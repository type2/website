Yeah, that's the weird part - unless it's ground somewhere else?  I'm 
wondering if the act of cranking the engine is vibrating the 50-86a (at 
the starter or at the double relay) such that it's not working.  That, 
or he has some other connectors connected onto either of those lines and 
that's mucking things up.

Another idea would be to hold the AFM flap slightly open while cranking 
and see if it starts.
