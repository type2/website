Subject: Speedo

A couple of months ago I was whining about my speedo.  I'd replaced the cable,
but the speedo needle was still jumping like a guy goosed by the devil's own
pitchfork.  I posted a question here about what else to check.  I finally
resolved the problem.  And let me tell you, if your speedo needle jumps, it
really is the cable, not the speedo itself.  When I pulled out the new cable,
I discovered that the housing at the speedo end was slightly out of round, as
if it had been crushed in shipping.  So when the cable turned, the end snagged
on the housing until the torque broke the friction; then it took a sudden
leap.  I took the cable back to the dealer and got a replacement, checking
that it turned freely and smoothly, installed it, and all is well.  (Why am I
always fooled into thinking that new parts actually work as they should?)

See you on the road,
Jerry
