What I did say was that he was bypassing the purpose of the diode.  So, 
to do that test, he needs to apply +12v to 86b and see if the pump runs, 
but he might as well just deflect the AFM as that will also apply +12v 
to the pump and test that circuit.

As I was typing the above, I just realized that by kicking over the 
starter, he had essentially tested the connection between 86a and 50 - 
and then I read what you wrote ;)


I'm still wondering if the pump is working when the AFM is deflected. 
If it is, then the pump should run while cranking.
