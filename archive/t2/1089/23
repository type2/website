Subject: Re: [T2] 71 to  rebuild  or replace?  dilemma

About 5 years ago I installed a rebuilt engine from a reputable rebuilder. 
It ran like cr*p and failed after less than 5000 miles.  I took it apart. 
The heads were in bad shape.  There was a burr in the timing gear that 
caused the engine to shake itself to death, destroying the bearing saddles 
with fore and aft motion.  Methinks this is pretty much what you may get 
from a low cost rebuild when the builder has to cut so many corners to make 
a profit.

So, if you do not want to build your engine yourself find someone you trust 
to do it for you.  It will cost more but you will have what you want.

Cheers,

John R.
