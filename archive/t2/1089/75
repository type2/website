Subject: RE: [T2] 2010 VW Baywindow Camper Vans for Sale!

Hello Ron, and anyone else in the know.  Years ago, the Bus Depot carried NEW
sliding window assemblies for the baywindow sliding door and D/S body
centerwindow.  Are these unobtanium now?  Can they be imported from VW
Brazil?




Thanks guys(and gals)



Eron
