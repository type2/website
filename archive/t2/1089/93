Subject: Re: [T2] New Hubcap?

hey Guys  I think we should all go together and put a Wanted dead or  alive 
add out for the OE Hubcap in some of the VW mags. maybe if we can make the  
person who is holding ti see that it is really wanted then they might come 
to  their senses, Assuming that they have any.  It also might bring it to  
somebody elses attention(maybe a bug person instead of a bus person) that  
aren't aware of what it is and have seen it at a friends place not knowing 
what  it was about  later  mark d
