Subject: Accelerator cable

Hi all,
I'm almost done converting my '79 bus back to fuel injection.  WOOT.

One thing I purchased was a new accelerator cable as old one had been  
mangled in the conversion to the carb.

My question is this:  What keeps the cable attached to the accelerator  
pedal?  The curved steel part (like an S hook) at the pedal end of the  
cable looks like it might be able to hold itself in once the cable is  
under tension, but it's really wobbly with the cable slack.

The old accel cable had a clamp (like the sort used to attach the  
heater cables to the heater flap boxes) on the tip of the s hook.   
This didn't look right at all to me.

I think that the s-hook should hold itself in once the cable is  
tensioned.  Is this how it's supposed to be installed?

Thanks a lot,
Zack
