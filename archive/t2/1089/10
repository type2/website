Westy Bus for Sale - Rochester NY

All,

My neighbor down the street is forced
to sell his cherry 78 Westy. I
have worked on this van and it is in great
shape.
Below is the Samba Listing
as well as the link to some pictures on the
Empire site.
  
1978 Volkswagen
Westfalia Camper Price: $8995.00 This a very
nice nearly original Bay-Window
Westy. Updates include new Radio, Push-rod
tube seals, Acellerator Cable, Gas
Shocks, Fuel injector fuel line replacement
and new tires. Floors and sheet
metal are solid and it has been professionally
re-painted to match it's
original color. 

Stored winters and cared for
Impeccably - needs nearly
nothing ! 

This Westy is originally from California
I was told and made its
way back east to Buffalo and finally to my home here
in Rochester, New York.
It's ready for that cross country camping trip and a
good home. 

Things to
consider doing in the future 

A. Replace rubber window
mouldings 
B. Drips
oil (they All Do) 
C. Replace shifter bushings in the
shift tube 
D. Fix the
refrigerator
