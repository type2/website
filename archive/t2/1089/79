Do we know why VW chose not to issue the T5 in the US?

 Alas, this is not an option for U.S. residents.  Any vehicle that you import
 must meet modern-day U.S. EPA and D.O.T. standards, unless it is at least 25
 years old.  The Brazilian Type 2's do not. South African made "Vanagons" do
 not.  Even a brand new 2009 Volkswagen T5 (successor to the Eurovan) does
 not, as it was not built for the U.S. market. There is no viable way to make
 a Brazilian Bus meet those standards.
