Nope.  If the diode were bad, deflecting the AFM would also crank the 
engine ;)

What else is connected there?  The wiring diagram shows two wires - one 
from you ignition switch, and the other from your double relay.  This 
could be your problem.

Ok, even though we kinda know the wiring is good from the double relay 
to the starter (because the starter is kicking over when you apply +12v 
to the other end), we are still having a problem where the ignition 
switch current supposedly isn't making it all the way to the double 
relay.  I'm wondering if we're having a situation similar to a hot-start 
problem, where there isn't enough current to trigger the double relay. 
Odd, but we should test it.

So, you need to figure out how to isolate the wire that goes to terminal 
50 on the starter (isn't it a push-on connector?) and then turn on the 
key and apply +12v to that wire.  It should then start the pump.  If it 
doesn't, then you know where the problem lies.  If it does, then we 
missed something or the problem is further up-stream (which would be 
very odd).

In the event that your ignition wire is tied to the wire that goes to 
the double relay, just remove them both from the starter and hit the 
ignition switch to the crank position and it should run the pump.

Right now, your unknown is +12v not getting to the double relay over a 
wire, so test for something you know should work.  In other words, +12v 
on the terminal 50 side of that wire at the starter should kick over the 
pump.
