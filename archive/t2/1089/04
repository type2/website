Hi Guys,

Let's focus and see if Dan can locate the hubcap.
Maybe Dan could give us a regular heads up on his progress so we all feel 
like we are still in the loop.

So, once we have "The Hubcap" we will need a plan, a loose one, but a plan. 
If "The Hubcap" can't be located, shall we go with a new one?

Chris
