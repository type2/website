it runs so the pump and double relay work.

ok makes sense, forgot about the diode

runs with AFM deflected  but does not run while cranking?

put a double conector on the pump terminals and put long wires to test
light so can check safely.... no light on crank

I'm missing something here not to mention the wires at terminal 50
have been connected together for some reason who knows when, probably
because not enough plugs on the terminal4

intermittent is the cause of insanity
