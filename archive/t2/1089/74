I'm still on the fence here.  Most of me agrees with Jamie, in that we  
should really try and get the hubcap back.  But, there is also the  
reality that we may not be (have not been) greeted with cooperation on  
that front.  Starting fresh, with a new perspective and maybe some  
simple rules, would allow us to move on.  That's probably easier for  
me to say than for some, as Leah and I never did have the chance to  
carry it or bond with it.

Regarding web space, if we are going to do this with relation to the  
type2 mailing community (not that other enthusiasts wouldn't be  
welcomed,) then space on type2.com seems appropriate.  Development of  
a more modern site is in the works at this time, and blogging/ 
cataloging it's adventures would be simple.

Peace, Troy
