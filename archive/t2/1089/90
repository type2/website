 Although I'm just a newcomer, I also vote on trying to get the original
back. If we ever get it back we should put some sort of logbook in with the
rest of the memorabilia, then post the handoff on line. That will give it a
paper/electronic trail and make it easier to track.

Thanks for letting me put my 2 cents in,

Bob
