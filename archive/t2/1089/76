It would also be interesting to find out if the rear hatch is unchanged. 
Will it fit all the way back to say 1968?

If the glass in unchanged, maybe new glass with defogger tracings is 
available.

Hello Ron, and anyone else in the know.  Years ago, the Bus Depot carried 
NEW
sliding window assemblies for the baywindow sliding door and D/S body
centerwindow.  Are these unobtanium now?  Can they be imported from VW
Brazil?

Thanks guys(and gals)
