hmm, wonder if the cold start relay could be having an effect, forgot
about it....

hmm, there are three wires there on #50 however it has been like
that for many years will need to chase it down I guess, dang problem
with 33 year old cars do not always have consistancy in the wiring
color code.

Oh I just remembered the extra wire is my rear start switch wire..

hmmm, but why would it work from the AFM but not the starter???

I guess if I just pulled it off the rear start switch would apply the
12v since they are wired together

already dark here so will be first thing I test next time I get to

my bus is the very definition of "odd"

hmmm have to figure out what that could be, guess I could just hook up
the test light to it.

thanks for the help
