Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump/double relay issue

Mike, as you mentioned before, a bad ground could also cause this problem -
the relay needs both 12V at terminal 86a and ground at terminal 85 to
energize - the same goes for the test light.  On the other hand, if the AFM
flap energizes the relay (and causes the fuel pump to run), then the ground
should be good.

Bob, it would be interesting to see what happens when your test light rig is
connected between 86a and 85 and you use your jumper to apply power to 86a.
The test light should light and the starter should turn the engine over.  If
the starter turns the engine over but the test light doesn't light, the
ground at terminal 85 is bad.
