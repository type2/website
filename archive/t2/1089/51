Hmmm.  Terminal 85 is ground.  I assume that when you say "got no power when
connecting 85 and 86a", that you connected your test light between 85 and
86a, turned the ignition switch to the start position (or used a starter
switch that shorts terminals 50 and 30 on the starter), the engine started
cranking but your test light did not light up.  Your test light should light
up when the ignition switch is in the "start" position if the test light is
connected between terminals 85 and 86a on the double relay.

What happens if you connect your test light between terminals 85 and 88y?
The test light should light, even without turning the ignition switch to
"start".
