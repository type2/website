Subject: 71 dilemma - Thanks

Thanks for all the very very useful information and insight into my 
smoking engine dilemma from Type2, Wetwesties and p-mails. You are all 
very generous with help.

It will take a bit of time to absorb, but I will be much more 
knowledgable and feel more comfortable making a decision.

It will probably take even longer to thank you all individually, but I 
sure will try.

the decision - which of course I haven't reached!  Replace, rebuild, 
and now even thinking about NEW!

John and O
