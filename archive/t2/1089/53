Ok, 85 is a ground and 86a is +12v when starting the car.  So what do 
you mean by connecting those?  If you put a test light from one to the 
other and crank the engine, the light should turn on - if it doesn't, 
then you have a problem between the starter and 86a.... orrrr.. your 
ground wire is bad (CHECK YOUR GROUNDS!).  If it does light, then you 
have a problem between 88z and 88y, or the double relay and the fuel pump.

88z is where the main +12v comes into the double relay, and then there 
is a jumper wire that takes +12v over to 88y.  88y supplies +12v to the 
pump (88d) and also tells the ECU when the pump is running.

So, essentially what's happening is that +12v gets applied to 86a from 
the starter (cranking), that trips one of the relays and allows current 
to flow from 88y to 88d and should get the fuel flowing.  The AFM 
deflects due to air moving and applies +12v to 86b (*also* providing 
current to the same relay).  The engine then starts and you let go of 
the ignition and +12v is no longer supplied to 86a, but the current from 
86b is taking over to keep the fuel pump relay closed and the connection 
from 88y to 88d alive.  The diode does not allow the current to run from 
86b to 86a.  Take a look at the wiring diagram as that should help show 
the flow of stuff...

Intermittent connection?

btw, how are you testing this?  are you poking a probe up into the 
bottom of the plug?  Are you removing the plug?  To keep things simple, 
I would test things with the plug plugged in and verify that you have 
+12v where it's supposed to be.

still curious if deflecting the AFM gets the pump running.
