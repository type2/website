Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump/double relay issue

Been there- my daughter had rare "hesitation" driving down the highway 
that I finally figured out while lying on the rear bed and looking 
through the engine access door at the relay- carefully wiggled each wire 
until I found the one where I could duplicate the hesitation- the 
connector was loose; I crimped it and tied the multi-spade connector up 
tight against the relay and it has worked fine since.

I had an intermittent mini spade connector in my double relay plug and 
it was driving me bonkers.  I finally noticed it when I was in the 
engine compartment and had the ignition on and brushed against some 
wires.  I heard some fast clicks (injectors firing because the 
megasquirt fires the injectors when you first power on the unit).  I 
played with the wires for an hour before I found the culprit, and I had 
to move each wire individually until I found one bad wire... and it had 
to be moved in just the right way to make it fail - but it was so 
difficult because it only took a very slight pressure for it to fail and 
in just the right direction.  I eventually had to cut the wire and crimp 
on a new connector.
