Yeah, and it really shouldn't matter what they are, just make sure none 
of them are connected to the starter.

That's an odd one, but I would confirm that it's not working.  There are 
too many pieces to the puzzle right now, so you need to isolate things 
down so you can pinpoint the issue.

You could also do a continuity test from end to end of that particular 
wire, but I think it'd be a lot easier to just pull off the connectors 
at the starter and apply +12v.
