There are plenty of white/yellow page websites out there with loads of info
on peoples locale and contact info.

Not if their address and number are restricted, like mine.  I pay extra to
not have my info in the phone book or on their web listings.  Personally,
I'd be ticked if someone posted my info on a forum without my permission.
Greg's or your mileage may vary on that, but I tend to keep my stuff private
as much as I can.

(I'm in maintenance and service work.  If my neighbors had access to my
information, the phone would never stop ringing.  It's happened once before,
and I swore if possible that I would never let it happen again.)
