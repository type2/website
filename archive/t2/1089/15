Subject: 71 to  rebuild  or replace?  dilemma

Time to fix this engine!  71 . 1600.  Smokes like a dragon, yet runs 
very well.  Have tried Lucas Oil additive - no better.

I dont do my own mechanics like this, just the small stuff. Also, daily 
driver, only vehicle, but can do without it for a week or 2.

so I need some input into how to go.  Thanks.

Los Angeles -  can anyone recommend a good local rebuilder who wont 
tell me
to buy a Toyota!

Is there an improvement over the basic engine? if so  what should I
try for?

for instance, can my engine be replaced with a diesel?
Is there such a thing as a Suburu switcheroo for a 1600?

what is that crank (cotterless, off center, countersunk - what is it 
called?)

is it worth having  the outside oil cooler installed?

other ideas , or should I just go asis.

send your ideas :-)
thanks
- John  in So Cal
