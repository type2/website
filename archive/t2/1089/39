Subject: Re: [T2] Canvas hole repair

For tiny holes a blob of duco cerment works fine.  For bigger holes, we 
use a urethane sealer worked in in a circular pattern on both sides.  It 
stays flexible.  I think "SealAll" is one brand. This works also on dry 
rot areas to reinforce them. For really big #%*+~^$ mouse chew holes, 
cut a piece of cloth of similar color into a patch  at least 1/4" larger 
than the hole, apply urethane sealer to the edges and cover the hole. To 
waterproof the cloth, rub in more sealer after it has dried.  On our VW 
tent which had a hole ripped into the roof, A sewed the edges together 
first, then used a layer of urethane sealer over that- still good 15 
years later.
