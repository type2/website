I, like many of you, only had interactions with Karl via email.  It wasn't until I learned of his passing that I realized he was a fellow Oregonian.  My family and I have camped the Oregon coast in my bus many times; I wish I'd known he was around the corner.  I will pay closer attention to signatures from now on so I don't make that mistake again.  I think I'll plan a trip to Coos Bay (Sunset Bay SP) next September though.  Maybe some of you will be there too, it might be a way to remember him in a place where he chose to be known.  The Oregon Coast is a beautiful place almost any time of year, but the windsease up and the days are warm and sunny in September.  If Karl was home, then he passed in one of the most naturally spectacular places I've ever seen.

Thanks for all of your energy, Karl.
