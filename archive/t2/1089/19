Subject: Re: [T2] 71 to rebuild or replace? dilemma

Hi,
It really all depends on how much you are willing to spend. And on
your objectives: do you really want more power? How badly do you want
better fuel economy? If you don't drive that much, I would simply stay
stock and replace it with a similar type1 engine.

Counterweighted crankshafts only make sense if you plan to build a
fast-revving engine.
And no need for ugly outside coolers for a stock engine. I would add
an external oil filter, though.
