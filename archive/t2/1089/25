I guess I was mistaken at the cutoff date between the two types of 
senders.  My experience with the two types of senders is documented near 
the bottom of this page:

Note that the baffles inside the two tanks are different as well AND I 
have not documented this yet but my FI tank is leaking when I put more 
than 11 gallons in it.  I think the sender is not sealing against the 
tank but I won't know for sure until I pull the engine over the winter.

Anyway, I would still encourage anyone swapping tanks to make sure they 
have the proper sender for the tank they end up with and not assume that 
their old one will work.
