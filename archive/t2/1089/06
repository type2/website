Subject: Re: [T2] Karl...

Karl's death has made me leaky - and I'm a purty tough old bird these 
days, I rarely give moisture to the dead, figuring they are in a better 
place.

Our tears, I think, are for ourselves.

But my first thought on waking this am was of Karl, and that it was 
necessary to mourn his passing.

I hope this isn't out of line...  I've created a blog page for memories 
of Karl at:

And if you'd like, you can add posts and pics here:

Seems to me Karl was a pretty private fella, and a call to the funeral 
home yields up the info that per Karl's wishes there will be no memorial 
and his ashes will be shipped back east for internment in a family plot.

Thanks again, Karl.

Teri
