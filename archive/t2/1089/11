Subject: Turn signal not moving

Hello again to the list, it has been a while, but my single cab has been
sitting at a friends in CA for a while I just got it back.

I am having a couple issues after not having driven it for a while-this is
probably a simple one, but I've got to start somewhere.

The turn signal moves ok when I want to turn left, but it is a little stiff.
When I want to turn right, the Turn Signal lever does not want to move, or
it moves very grudgingly. I am a little nervous about forcing it, as it
feels  like I could break it. Is this  a simple case of "take it off and
lubricate it".

Suggestion on repair, and where to begin.

Thanks,

-Kevin
