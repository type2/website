Subject: fuel pump/double relay issue

basics is a 78 auto tranny bus, mostly stock.

has been having intermittent stalling issues.

fuel presure drops during stalling

but intermittent has been a real pain to try and find,
finally Fri it wouldn't start. no fuel pump run

started thru the step by step fuel injection troubleshooting guide
from VW.

the floww chart says break in wire from term 50 on starter to terminal
86a on double relay.

so far so good. but I hooked a wire up to 86a to see if it would run
if pump was turned on "Manually"
but instead the engine cranks??? still doesn't start but it cranks??

shouldn't a wire work both ways if no electric comes from starter no
electric should go to starter??????

now am really scratching my head. any ideas why that should work. and
still not start....

thanks
Bob
