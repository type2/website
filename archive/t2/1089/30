That's right. The horn circuit is funny compared to other circuits.
Power runs to the horn, and then the horn button grounds the circuit
to let the horn work. So if the wire from the horn to the horn button
loses insulation and touches ground anywhere along the line, you will
hear the horn! So follow the wire, but horn going on while turning the
steering wheel means it is probably inside the steering column. Not
that hard to take apart, but a headache.

 I had the steering box replaced in this 74 transporter. Should have done it

 The circuit for the horn is simple but I'm not sure how the wire runs down
 the steering wheel shaft or where the thing is shorting out. Have any of you
 had experience with this? The mechanic messed up this job so badly we are
 not on speaking terms so I am not sure exactly what they did.
