Hi Patrick,

We just had a discussion about this on the type2.com mailing list very  
recently.  Brand new tanks are not widely available, and they aren't  
cheap either.

Any year from 1968-79 will fit. If your 78 is fuel injected then you  
would be better off with a 1975-79 tank as that particular model has  
two fuel outlets, one is used for supply and the other for return.

If you find a single-outlet 1968-74 tank it is possible to use it with  
FI; one only needs to add a T connection upstream of the fuel pump and  
connect the return line to it. My own bus has run just fine with that  
setup for over five years now.

Good luck with the search,

Greg
