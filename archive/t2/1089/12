Subject: ADMIN: Re: [T2] Hubcap, Greg

Ok volks, this is getting a little off topic: let's not have any more posts
on how to find addresses and whether they should be posted to the 
internet...Let's stick to buses, hubcaps, and VWs!

Woot!

Obligatory bus content....things that broke on my 3,000 mile jouney:
  - vacuum can on dizzy
  - hi-beams relay (I believe)
  - muffler-to-tailpipe flange
  - vacuum cap on carb port
  - valve cover bail

Other things fixed
  - shock absorber bolt (lost...must not have been tight enough)
  - fuel-shutoff solenoid in carb (was coming loose)
  - tightened clamp on tranny to axle tube boot, slowing tranny leak
  - accelerator cable to pedal spring (came loose a few times)
  - accelerator cable/throttle position (still had a smidge of slack in the line)
  - brake pedal wouldn't return (lubed pivot point)

Things that didn't break (*sighorelief*)
  - tranny
  - brake drum (driver's side failed before I left on the trip)
