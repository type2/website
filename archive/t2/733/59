       Why don't you pull the return line and try to purge the crap from 
that side. No filter screen over there. you might want to jack up the bus at 
the drivers front tire to slop the tank to the inlet.

    That's an interesting approach...
Since you have a 77 I presume you are familiar with the tank to be so 
specific in your suggestion.


    It begs the question: I've inspected the tank I had removed by looking 
into the sender opening. Nothing much to see because of the baffle (s). Are 
you positive the normal "outlet" has a screen over it? (It would make 
perfect sense. And explain the crud settling over the screen and NOT getting 
to the filter) On the other hand, I repeat the question, based on the fact 
that Richard Atwell indicated that all post-72 tanks had dispensed with the 
removable strainer: is your suggestion based on a verified fact: screen over 
the welded outlet?
Your statement that the return would not have a screen is illuminatingly 
obvious...I was just about to go out to where the bus is stored, put it up 
on the lift and muse over the next move...
I did do the following: (out of desparation!) put in a can of "fuel system 
cleaner" in the hope that it may "soften up" the crud...I then added more 
fuel to slosh it around properly. Took the bus out for 20-odd miles. Hard to 
steer with all fingers of both hands crossed!



Honestly Mitch, I can't remember if there was a screen in mine when I pulled 
the tank to clean it out. But i do know there is not one on the return side. 
Good luck either way to you.
