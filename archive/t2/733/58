Mark,

You failed to mention that those are number from a "good" engine.<grin>

My wife's tired 67(1500 engine) will go less than 4psi after a good 65 
mile per hour run on a hot day on the interstate....after it cools a 
little, then the oil light will turn back off.

Gail, I have seen as much as 60 psi(or more) on a new engine at start up, 
otherwise Marks numbers shown below are representative of an engine that 
is not too hot and is in good(not brand new) shape.

I have a 1776 with a hi volume oil pump/filter combo that gets 45 psi at 
70 and close to 20 psi at idle....with 25,000 hard miles on it....this is 
my weirdo engine that I can't get the oil over 186F after a 30 minute run 
on the interstate at 4,000 rpm....almost an embarasement in a community 
that seems to always be running too hot!

Once again, this is a relative number...hot hot is oil, how are bearings 
in the engine, and what is the rpm.

Cheers, dave
