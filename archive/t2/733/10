What year bus are you describing? My 80 Vanagon only has one adjuster per 
wheel. Sounds like this info could be valuable on my 75 though.

I have a GIF image showing how the
rear brake adjusters work....

They are both standard thread bolts.

Left tire.  Front adjuster:  You want
to move this one UP to tighten brakes.
rear adjuster: Move this one DOWN
to tighten brakes.

right tire: front adjuster goes DOWN
to tighten.  Rear adjuster goes UP
to tighten.

To pull the drum:  remove cotter
pin.  get a BIG WRENCH with
5 foot metal pipe to go over the
handle for leverage.  Spray
the nut with wd40 and let it
sit for 10 minutes.  Remove
the nut.  This is all with the
parking brake OFF, wheels
blocked.  The drum pulls
off without a problem.  Unless
you have rust, in which
case you spray it down
with lube, give it some time,
and use a large screwdriver
to pry around the edges.

Make sure your brake is OFF
and wheels are blocked.

email me if you'd like the drawing
I made when I had my brakes
apart 2 weeks ago.
