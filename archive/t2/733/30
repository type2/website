Subject: Re: [T2] Steering wheels

Thanks for the detailed reply.  I will check.  And yes, I do plan to
sell all three.  I have just about finished my 73 panel, and in the
process of doing that resto, I decided to graft in the later bay
steering column.  Of the three steering wheels I have, two are in
pretty good shape - some minor cracks - and the third will need a total
redo.
