I'd be willing to bet that that's because few if any
drivers wore seat belts back then.  I'm sure they're
not the safest vehicles on the road (air-cooled VW's
were never considered very safe by the Naders of the
world), but seat belts make a huge difference in any
vehicle.  But bus drivers get lazy, including me.  So,
buckle up!  Thanks...KR
