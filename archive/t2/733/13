Subject: RE: [T2] can't remove my old heater cables!

     Maybe get some PB blaster or Aero Kroil (SP?). Those work allot better 
at eating rust than WD.  WD is only really great at displacing water, as far 
as lubrication and penetration it's just decent.  If you have the patience, 
spray it in really heavily every day for a week and eventually it should 
free up.  If you are not (like me), try some mechanics wire chucked up into 
a hand drill.  Bend the one end you are shoving into the cable tube slightly 
so it hits the wall of the tube and run it up in there with the cable.  That 
might break up the rust between the cable and the tube, or just %^&(# 
everything up.  It works pretty good on T1's when they do this, though.

     Maybe elementary, but have you checked to make sure the end of the 
cable is not snagging on the tube as you try to pull it through?  My cables 
have fatter rod at the end that is where the clamp holds on.  Just make sure 
that gets into the tube if you are trying to pull them through.  Even 
better, cut them off.

Those are my ideas, good luck!
