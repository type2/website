Hi Paul,

I traded a pair of solex setups complete for a set of FI components 
last winter. The install was definitely a learning experience. Working 
with the single-outlet fuel tank will be the least of your problems.

First off, the 87 Golf has a completely different FI setup, IIRC it's 
probably digijet. Our aircooled Buses used L-Jetronic. I doubt that the 
golf FI could be made to work, as the temp sensors are geared to 
coolant temps (approx ~200F) rather than head temps (~300F+). In 
addition you will have to fabricate your own intake runners and air 
filter system. Not a simple task by any means. I have seen a 2L engine 
converted to rabbit CIS injection, but that too was a major project.

If you're going to go FI you are better off staying with L-jetronic so 
that you don't have to reinvent everything. It will also be a lot 
easier to get advice about. Get the injection from a 1975 federal bus 
or a 1974 California model, as they had 1.8L engines as well and this 
is closest available match to your engine's 1.7L dislplacement. If 
possible, get the fuel tank firewall panel and the air cleaner bracket 
from an FI donor bus. This will give you the bracket to hang the decel 
valve from.

If you are inclined to do some fabricating then you should take a look 
at megasquirt. That system allows you to keep the stock L-Jet fuel rail 
but do away with elements like the double relay, AFM, cold start 
injector, aux air valve, ballast resistors and  decel valve. It's a 
very modern and programmable system, and there are a couple buses 
already running it. Not mine though... at least not yet. I have decided 
to learn FI with L-Jet, and try megasquirt a few years down the road.

Happy trails,
