Gotta love this list. Thanks Mark, Karl and Greg for their nearly
identical responses of "no" in very short time. You're either all very
bright, or you're reading off each others papers :)  For the archives,
the on and offline responses were (edited):

The 87 golf is a CIS system and not electronic. This is a mechanical
injection system they quit this system in 1990. I personally would not 
do this changeover. I think the late bay or vanagon fuel injection
system would work better. There are some parts for the CIS systems that
are NLA.

I doubt that the golf FI could be made to work, as the temp sensors are
geared to coolant temps (approx ~200F) rather than head temps (~300F+).
In addition you will have to fabricate your own intake runners and air
filter system. Not a simple task by any means. I have seen a 2L engine
converted to rabbit CIS injection, but that too was a major project.

2 TOTALLY different FI systems. The bus is L-Jetronic. The Golf is
right on the bubble of either being CIS (early) or Digifant (late). In
either variety, NO, you cannot use that ECU. Save your money.

Ahh... money in pocket. Useless parts in someone elses garage. Thanks
friends.
