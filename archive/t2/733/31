Subject: Re: [T2] can't remove my old heater cables!

Hi Mike,

I have the same problem with the westfakia. Bill Monk had a good 
suggestion: Simply attach the new cables on the outside of the tubes 
using cable ties. They don't HAVE to run through the tubes, it just 
looks neater that way.

Happy trails,
