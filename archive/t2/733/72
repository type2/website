Subject: RE:  battery light glowing...

Margaret, you said:

"My battery/alternator light was slightly glowing and would pulse stronger
with the turn signal."

Margaret, what does the idiot light do when you put on your emergency 
flashers??  Does it stay steady, or does it pulse brighter like when you 
turn on your turn signal??
