Denny,

> I've tried to do my homework,

What did you do ?

Did you start with :

0) adjust wheel bearings
1) tighten swing lever pin nut (tighten hard)

I did these two easy things yesterday and the handling improved quite a bit.

2) check alignment (per Muir)

When you are there you should consider the more involved/expensive things

> A steering rebuild is in her future.
 From what I've learned here, I intend to replace:
     Ball joint Torsion arms (fm Bus Boys)
     Swing lever shaft, etc
     Damper
     Tie rod ends (rods look OK)
     Drag link ends (Drag link looks OK, Drag link ends look like tie
rod ends, but not sure?)
     Shocks

  Alignment
  Steering coupler seems OK
  Will consider steering box after above is done.
  Tires when all above A-OK.
