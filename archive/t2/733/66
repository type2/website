Here is a data point for you:

That is a '68 hardtop westy that my dad was driving in late 1975 when
a big 'merican car hit him head on (drunk driver).  Combined speed was
around 45 MPH (he was going 15 MPH).  His most serious injury was a
badly fractured left leg.  He walked with a limp the rest of his life.
 Needless to say my mom was NOT thrilled when I got my first bus!
