Subject: Free 68-71 rear cargo door (hatch)

Here is a freebie for anyone who can pick it up (located in College Park, MD
20740):

Rear hatch off a 71 camper. It should fit 68-71 buses. Not perfect, but very
usable. Has glas with defrost.

This came off Brian Eney's '71 Sportsmobile which Jay Ollom picked up last
weekend. I pulled the hatch for my girlfriend's '72 but found out (the hard
way ...) last night that there was a change in the location of the hinge
bolts between 71 and 72.

If anyone around DC has a good extra 72-79 cargo hatch, please let me know.

I am also looking for a 74-79 spare tire cabinet to complete the interior of
this camper.

Marcus
