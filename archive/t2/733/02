Hi James,

A "Dead computer" is a pretty common complaint from mechanics who are 
not familiar with L-Jetronic FI systems. The computer is the LAST thing 
to replace when having trouble with your FI system. If your mechanic 
has not already set the valves, verified vacuum at over 15" and 
confirmed the fuel pressure specs then you should get busy looking for 
another mechanic. The prices they are quoting are excessive.

If it IS the computer, www.busdepot.com can sell you a remanufactured 
ECU for your bus for $79.

The more common part to wear out on the FI system is the airflow meter 
(AFM). That one is available remanufactured for $149.

MegaSquirt (MS) takes a LOT of custom fabrication to make it work:

OTOH, keeping the L-Jetronic FI running is easy by comparison. The 
stock configuration has plenty of professional mechanics familiar with 
it, whereas MS has but a handful. I looked at MS as an alternative to 
carbs a year ago and decided that L-Jet was a better option for me 
until I became more comfortable troubleshooting FI. If you aren't ready 
to maintain your own L-Jet system then MS is going to put you at the 
mercy of the same mechanic that isn't competent with factory FI.

The best resource for FI troubleshooting manuals is 
http://www.ratwell.com. Links to the factory and dealer manuals are 
there, and by following them by the letter you can resolve ANY problem 
with FI. But you have to follow the symptom charts religiously if you 
want to be cost effective with your time and $$$$. Swapping parts by 
instinct is not the way to go.

Happy trails,
