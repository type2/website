Subject: Parting out another 83 AC Vanagon

I am getting ready to part out another 1983 aircooled
Vanagon.  Any one need anything before I send the
balance to the recycler?

Engine parts, EFI parts, tranny core, Gas heater,
doors and hatches, brakes, rotors, axles, seats,
Glass,etc.  Cheap prices plus freight.
