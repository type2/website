I dont know what they use for snow removal in Canada,but here in the Salt
Belt of the midwest,150 buses is a huge turnout.BNNTA has had maybe 70 or 80
busses the last couple years.I think in 2000 a bunch of DBG people came
down.Id love to get to Busses of the Corn someday.But I couldnt even make it
to a campout this weekend that was only 60 miles away.Had to help my brother
move.Man does he have a lot of stuff.Its amazing how much shit you can pile
in a bus though.
