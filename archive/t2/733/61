Subject: Re: [T2] How to stop an oil galley plug leak?

I don't think you can just jbweld it because it's under pressure.  Also, 
you're going to have problems with varying expansion rates as the metal 
heats up and it'll probably pop out again.

I had a plug pop out behind the flywheel and I needed a quick fix so we 
just put it back in and peened the metal around it.  That held up for 
another 10k miles until I swapped in my new engine.

This paticular leak is the plug behind the fan on the left.  So I can pull the fan out with the engine in place and get to the plug to apply some sort of epoxy goop.
