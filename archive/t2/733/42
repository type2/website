Chapter 8 section 13.2 Caution note  " Not all bias ply or radial ply
tires are the same. When you buy replacement tires, select only
bias-ply tires that have an 8 ply rating: select radial ply tires
designated "reinforced" or  for delivery vans and stations wagons-
with the suffix "C". Other tires of identical size may have inadequate
load carrying capability.

185R 14 C. (Note says : correct replacement tire must bear the letter
"C" immediately after the number 14 in the size designation-and not

Yes nobody knows what kind of tires a bus needs
- my current tires are 195/75R14 passenger tire 1400lbs load 35psi
sidewall 1 ply polyester tread 3 plies (1 polyester). P.O. paid 35$
per tire. Bus handles like an old sponge.

happy tire shopping (bus depot has the 195 hankook at the price of the 185 :)
