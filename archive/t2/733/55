Subject: I`m selling my Bus ,why

I am recently divorced, it is the only vehicle I have at the moment ( for the last year really). That is why it is a daily driver. I`m am ready to buy a simple pickup truck now. I have gone camping lots of times in it, and I have entered it into shows. I need the money, Life happens. It is a very clean Bus. I just have to move on. If you want to see it I posted it in the classifieds at  
          THE SAMBA.COM
