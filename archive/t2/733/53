Probably the closest I've ever come to burning myself
up was when I had the crud (since had it fixed) and
was in a hurry, broke down, and tried to fix it myself
with a hot engine and no plug.  Thought I could hold
it myself and change it quick.  Gas poured on the hot
engine and was steaming up!  I dropped it quick and
grabbed the fire extinguisher.  But by then I was
covered in gas.  Hooked it back up and waited until it
cooled.  But I dodged 3rd degree burns there!  Scary
as heck.  Don't ever do what I did.  Thanks...KR
