Subject: Re: [T2] Brake trouble-progress but still need help

From Tom Shinn:

Ok folks, I figured it out. The adjustment at least. when looking in the
adjustment hole, the cogs on the star adjustment wheel should be moving up
to tighten the brakes and down to loosen them.

Vanagon rear brakes are self-adjusting. The star has fine teeth on it. You can only turn them
as they ratchet past the self-adjuster arm. You cannot turn the wheel back unless you move the
arm away from the teeth. If you can turn them in both directions, then you have something fubar big time in
there!

You need to remove the drums to fix this. WD 40 ain't gonna get it! You need a REAL penetrant like Liquid
Wrench or Rost-off or Kroil and a BFH. After spraying and soaking the drum where it meets the round hub, take
the hammer and hit straight and flush to the drum between the wheel bolt holes. You have 5 places to hit. The
drum should pop off. Don't try hitting the edge or you will have to buy a new drum and a backing plate.
