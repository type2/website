Subject: VW bus crash statistics?

Sorry, Rich,
              I don't have statistics, but I can tell you that back around 1965-
7 I was working through an insurance friend to buy a (any) Type II from 
salvage.  All the totalled examples I saw were quite horrible.  Other insurance 
contacts at that time said the killed/maimed figures for the Type II in serious 
collision were frightening.  And that was before adipose SUVs dominated our 
roads.  Sorry for the pessimistic news!

Compared to other vehicles,
does a VW bus have a high
injury rate in crashes?

Has anyone come across
this information?
