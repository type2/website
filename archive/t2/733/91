Subject: re:EFI compatibility

An 87 golf has a CIS EFI system.  Doubt it would
easily adapt to a 73 bus.

I have an Ljet EFI system off a 83 vanagon that would
fit a 73 bus.  Air handler, input manifold, AFM,
injectors, ECM, etc....$350

But I'd recommend updating to a  2liter engine.
Completely rebuilt long block...$1250 no core
Turn Key with bus skins, heater boxes etc....$1550
