2 TOTALLY different FI systems.
The bus is L-Jetronic.
The Golf is right on the bubble of either being CIS
(early) or Digifant (late).
In either variety, NO, you cannot use that ECU. Save
your money.

 These types of questions pop up with some

 in advance if this annoys the regulars. I may
 already know the answer,
 but I'm asking for certainty. I found an EFI on
 craigslist from an '87
 Golf for $75. Would this be compatible with a '72
 (1700)? I know I have
 the old single-outlet tank, so that will pose a
 difficulty, but
 everyone's success stories about upgrading to EFI
 has me thinking of
 vending the Weber 32/36 and the 2 pairs of dual
 Solex in exchange for
 EFI. If complete, $75 sounds like a fair deal,
 especially if I can get
 anything for the 3 carburation systems I have now.
 Any advise is welcome.
