Subject: Time-Serts, what size is needed for a 1700 exhaust stud?

Greetings,
     The subject says it all.  I believe I need an 8mm x 1.25 but I am
not sure, also, they have 11.7 and 16.2 mm length inserts.  What do I
need to use to fix my stripped exhaust studs?  Also, were is the best
place to buy new exhaust studs to use with these inserts?

Thanks,
Stuart
