Hiya Dave,

Did you check the VW parts number?  On the steering wheels for the early 
(68-71) Baywindow you'll find the number embossed on the topside of the wheel, in 
the metal hub, in one of the depressions.  All three wheels, if they are the 
same, should have the same number and suffix letter as in 211 415 651D.

However, I found something interesting about the early Baywindow steering 
wheel a little while back.  It seems that VW made a production run of steering 
wheels to fit the early Baywindow quite some time after actual production of 
these vehicles.  The wheel that I found (with the requisite VW parts number) also 
had the five ring Audi logo as well as the VW roundel.  This wheel was 
ordered out of a dealership in Missouri (IIRC) and had been on the shelf for some 
time according the parts counter folks.

It was different than the actual production run steering wheels in that the 
base was noticeably larger in diameter than the original.  It was also a little 
deeper (as you describe yours.  Same diameter wheel though and same material. 
 Looked a little odd when it was mounted on the steering column (which it fit 
perfectly).

So......I'd check the number and look it over carefully for any other 
tell-tale marks which might give you a clue as to why it might be just a little 
different as mine was.
