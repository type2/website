It can be done, and I've done it, to make a replacement odo match the
orignal.  I had to remove the shaft on which the odometer rollers pivot.
This shaft is crimped into position, so I ground away the crimp to allow
the shaft to slip out.  After I put things back together, I put a drop of
super glue on the end of the shaft to stop it from slipping back through
the hole.  Note that the glue went on the shaft _only_, not into the hole
through which the shaft passes.
