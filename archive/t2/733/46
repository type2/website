Subject: Vent wing glass installation, 71 type II

Have a 71 Type 2. I am now ready to install the new rubber and glass in my
nice new powder coated frames. I tried about two months ago and gave up as I
dammed near broke my hand doing it!

Does anyone out there have a clever way that they would like to share on how
to press that glass into the vent wing frame? Any technical links or know
how?

Help would be appreciated.

Greg
