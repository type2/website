Subject: 77 Charcoal Canister and Decel Valve - installing fuel

I am on  the search now for a charcoal canister and a decel  valve.  Any one 
have one to spare?
 
I am taking the dual Weber 40's off of the 78 bus and putting on the FI  
system from a 77.  I have all the parts I need (I think) with the exception  of 
the 2 above.
 
I understand that I do not NEED them for the engine to run, but I am trying  
to get it back to being as complete as possible with regards to the vacuum and 
 breather tubes.
 
Has anyone here done this, removing carbs and installing the fuel  injection? 
 The only problem I can see right now is figuring out how to  wire the fuel 
pump to the double relay.  I have not gotten under there to  see what is going 
on, but any advice or assistance would be greatly  appreciated.  
 
Have a great day!
 
~Jeremy
