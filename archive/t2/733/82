Subject: EFI compatibility

These types of questions pop up with some regularity, and I apologize
in advance if this annoys the regulars. I may already know the answer,
but I'm asking for certainty. I found an EFI on craigslist from an '87
Golf for $75. Would this be compatible with a '72 (1700)? I know I have
the old single-outlet tank, so that will pose a difficulty, but
everyone's success stories about upgrading to EFI has me thinking of
vending the Weber 32/36 and the 2 pairs of dual Solex in exchange for
EFI. If complete, $75 sounds like a fair deal, especially if I can get
anything for the 3 carburation systems I have now.
Any advise is welcome.
