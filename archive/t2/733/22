If it's a bay, don't forget to remove the keepers under the rubber boots.

      Maybe elementary, but have you checked to make sure the end of the
 cable is not snagging on the tube as you try to pull it through?  My cables
 have fatter rod at the end that is where the clamp holds on.  Just make sure
 that gets into the tube if you are trying to pull them through.  Even
 better, cut them off.
