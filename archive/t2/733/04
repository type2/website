Subject: can't remove my old heater cables!

I am trying to get my old heater cables out but they just 
won't budge.  I've been underneath the front of the bus 
pulling on the cables with vice-grips and they just won't 
move!

I'm guessing that these cables haven't been changed since 
the bus was first made, so there is probably a bit of rust 
in there.  I've sprayed a bunch of wd40 but no movement 
yet.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get those old 
cables out of the metal tubes?

thanks,
Mike

p.s. and yes, they are disconnected from the heater boxes 
;)
