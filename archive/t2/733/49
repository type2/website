Subject: Re: No power at injectors ...

Hi Zoltan,

Sounds like a problem with the double relay or your wiring harness. It 
could also be the ignition switch... do you lose ALL power when you 
turn the key, or just power at the injectors? If you lose ALL power, 
then the problem is at the ignition. Otherwise it's more likely to be 
an issue with the double relay.

There are FI manuals available from www.ratwell.com that will help you 
ltroubleshoot the double relay and locate the problem.

Happy trails,
