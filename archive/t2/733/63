Subject: battery light glowing...

Hi,

I was wondering what others would check in this situation.....My
battery/alternator light was slightly glowing and would pulse stronger
with the turn signal. It was when I had a medium load in it. Canoe on
top fair amount of gear and snacks as well as the dog and two people,
headlights on, radio on and heat blower fan on but I never noticed this
before. Well the next day checked the charging with a volt meter. I do
have a battery isolator but would that be a problem? Anyway it showed it
was charging the battery fine from alternator at the isolator to the
battery. So I thought well okay. Then yesterday same thing we went
canoeing and by the time we were getting home the battery/alternator
light was slightly glowing again. We had the headlights on and the
radio... Any thoughts on what to do or check? My bus is a 1977 FI
Westy.
