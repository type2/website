Subject: Re: [T2] What kind of hightop is this? 

i have no idea about this top and i have a big personal archive of tops
:(.  i can see where the windows were filled in on the side but the rest
looks alot like a boat hull :).  beyond that it looks like it was to short
front to back so a section was added to the original top in the front.
