True. The clamp I linked to is a factory tool that is designed to be gentle to the hose. I've left it clamped to a hose leading from the gas tank for 30 days with no apparent damage to the outside of the hose and not a drop of fuel leaked.

The biggest advantage to it is that you can cut off the flow of fuel before you open up the fuel line. This really minimizes the fuel leaks and mess.

In the days when I had a rusty gas tank I would have killed for this tool.
