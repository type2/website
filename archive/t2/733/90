Hi Paul,

More work to do... You'll also need the 3-4 side and front engine tin, 
and you'll have to drill and tap your 3-4 side cylinder head for the 
head temp sensor. You will also need the throttle cable housing and 
tranny hanger from the FI bus, as the throttle cable location is 
different and the cable housing is longer. And you'll need that FI 
throttle cable as well. The good news is that if you go with the 74-75 
FI you get to keep your current dual-vac distributor.

Scared yet? Don't be. Just make sure you take it slow and easy. It took 
me about 3 weekends to get the whole business done, and the bus runs 
much more reliably than it did with carbs.

Happy trails,
