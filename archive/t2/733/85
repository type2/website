The megasquirt system is pretty good if you are an electronics tinkerer
and are willing to troubleshoot a relatively complex system.  It isn't
as easy as the old Heathkits!  I'd be a lot more comfortable if there were
more _working_ megasquirts out there.

There are a number of aftermarket EFI systems out there that are popular
with the dune buggy and racing crowds.  The bad news here is the cost,
which can run over $1000 for a working system.
