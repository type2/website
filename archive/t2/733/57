Subject: How to stop an oil galley plug leak?

I am not ready to pull my engine, split the case, tap and plug all the seals yet.  So I am looking for a JB Weld type product that will stop a leak.  This paticular leak is the plug behind the fan on the left.  So I can pull the fan out with the engine in place and get to the plug to apply some sort of epoxy goop.  
 
Any ideas on product that has worked?
 
Thanks,
 
Paul
