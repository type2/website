Subject: Steering wheels

Howdy!

Haven't posted in a while.  I have a question about steering wheels.  
While in the process of cleaning out my garage I found three steering 
wheels that I was saving for future use.  I was under the impression 
that all were for the early bay bus.  Upon closer examination, one of 
the steering wheels is more deeply dished than the others - but 
otherwise looks exactly the same.  Anybody have any idea what the 
difference is all about - or if it is for a different vehicle?

TIA,
