Neal asked:


 Do any of you fellows have a broken set of motor gaskets?,I need the spacers
 that go under the barrels and the one that go between the barrels and the head.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Not real sure what you are asking for. If you want to use head gaskets [NOT sure why!!]
then you are wanting the paper gaskets that go between the case and barrels and head gaskets.
If you want the spacers that go under the barrels then you don't want head gaskets. There are no 'spacers'
that go between the head and barrels. Using an aluminum spacer there would create a very weak point to hold
together with compression. The head gaskets are 3 layers of steel.
