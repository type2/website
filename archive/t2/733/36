Hi Tom,
Rear brakes adjustment was the first thing my bus asked for.

I think you owe to yourself to remove the drum and see what is going
on in there. Only by seeing it was I able to understand how it works
and be able to figure which way to turn to tighten. If you have > 1971
bus you do not need to remove the 36mm (or is it 46mm whatever) big
nut like was mentioned. To remove the drum, remove the wheel, then the
two small bolts and do like Karl said to pop the drum out.
Alternatively you can try this : aim the drum with a chisel from the
back through the hole in the baking plate. Hit at several places after
you rotate the drum. I would not advise the loosen and drive around
method.

I realize now I should have put new cylinders and shoes in there while
I was working at unblocking the adjusters. (maybe 60$ in parts). I had
only worked on the adjusters wile the cylinders looked really old and
a bit soaked.
