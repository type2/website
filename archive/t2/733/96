Subject: steering rebuild

I've tried to do my homework, but would appreciate any criticism/suggestion from the list.
My trusty '71 has at least 250 K on her, 125 by me.
A steering rebuild is in her future.
From what I've learned here, I intend to replace:
    Ball joint Torsion arms (fm Bus Boys)
    Swing lever shaft, etc
    Damper
    Tie rod ends (rods look OK)
    Drag link ends (Drag link looks OK, Drag link ends look like tie rod ends, but not sure?)
    Shocks
 
Alignment
Steering coupler seems OK
Will consider steering box after above is done.
Tires when all above A-OK.
Thanks
