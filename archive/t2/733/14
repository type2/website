Subject: Re: [T2] Brake trouble-progress but still need help

Once I figured out the right direction to turn the adjusters they seem to be 
able to turn in either direction. Because the shoes were so loose I think 
you are right about the self adjusters being FUBAR.

Been using PB Blaster. Seems to work well on rusty nuts and bolts. Should 
the BFH have a steel face? The hammer I've been using is one of those 
plastic dead blow hammers with the lead shot inside the head. No success, 
probably needs to be a heavier hammer?
