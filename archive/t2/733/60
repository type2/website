Subject: VDO oil pressure gauge orientation

hi,  I have a "T" connector threaded into
the "idiot light" sensor.  Dual port 1600.

0##/\##>

O= female, threaded for oil plug (also, oil
temp sensor)

> = male, threaded for idiot sender sensor.

^ = female, threaded same as crankcase
is, for idiot sensor.

The added lines indicate the direction
that things screw together.

The oil pressure sender isn't working
after about 60 miles of working fine.

I have the oil pressure in an "upside down"
configuration.  With the T screwed all
the way into the crankcase, the female
threads for the oil pressure sensor point
DOWN towards ground.

is this causing problems?  I was thinking
maybe oil drained into the pressure sensor
and is causing the diaphram in the sensor
to not move.

Any ideas, suggestions, or "no, you're not
supposed to have it upside down"'s ?
