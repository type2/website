Subject: RE: [T2] 70 bus front end sits higher than back end...what can 

Blake, Phil, and the List:

The rear height can be adjusted via the spring plate on the torsion bar. The
Bentley manual chapter 6, 10.3 and 10.2 outlines the procedure. It's not
really that difficult. I pegged it on the first try by following the
instructions to the letter. Get the bubble protractor at sears or harbor
freight, and don't believe that the brake lines have to be disconnected; I
found that there was a slot cut out in the spring plate that allowed its
removal without opening the hydraulic system. Buy new bushings to install,
they're cheap. Be sure to use talc and not petroleum based lubricants.
Unless it is a broken spring, it can be adjusted out.
