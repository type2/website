Subject: ?dumb? rpm/trans question

Ok,

Maybe I am wondering exactly what the final drive gear ratio
in my bus actually is...3.88, 4.12, 4.25 ?

So, I jack the bus up, put it in 4th gear, mark a tire, chock the other 
one so that it can't move and prepare turn turn my engine over exactly 
*one* rpm in order to see how many revolutions the tire turned at 1 rpm
so I can apply the math and know what the final drive ratio is..

*what* is one rpm for the purpose of this test?????

One complete cylinder cycle? intake,compression,power, exhaust

One 360 degree rotation of the flywheel?



Sorta Confused, dave
