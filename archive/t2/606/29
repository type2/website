Subject: Re: [T2] Serious Oil Leak from the filler tube???

Hi Jason,

The dipstick gasket is in excellent condition... I now think the leak 
is coming from either the filler tube joint or from where the filler 
tube bolts to the engine.

Tonight I will replace the filler tube and take it for a highway run, 
and we'll see what happens.

Happy trails,
