Subject: Re: [T2] The ramifications of high crankcase pressure

Hi Michael,

There isn't a problem with the oil pressure. The gauge reads about 4-5 
bars of pressure (60-70 PSI) when then engine is cold, eventually 
dropping to about 1.5 bar during extended highway runs.  But it doesn't 
hardly leak at all when it's cold, even though the pressure is a lot 
higher.

Tonight I plan to set the valves and do a compression test and closely 
inspect the dipstick tube gasket for good measure.

Happy trails,
