Mike,

I used to tow bug's in my 67 bus with a 1641 type 1 engine in it many 
years ago....no problems whatsoever....just more stopping 
distance....ummm.but this was in west Texas where hills are few and far 
between.

I don't see that you would have a problem unless the bus is packed to 
the gills and you are going over the continental divide.

It really doesn't take much to tow a bug...might be good to have 
some gauges on the bus if you are going long distances.

My wife has a 67 bus and a 72 KG...although the bus is for sale on 
thesamba....isn't it nice when the spouse gets the "bug"....LOL!!!

Cheers, dave
