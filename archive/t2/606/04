There were a few no answers in there...but I agree and I was confused about 
the difference.

Whoah now I am not going to mix and match parts if the are not the same or 
interchangable without modification(that would not be interchangable, just 
changable). I am going to upgrade and I guess what I should have asked is 
what is not interchangable between them.

I was just looking for general information and that is why I asked the list. 
If someone sends me a reply that is unclear I usually post my acceptance of 
it as true or reply to it to the list for a second chance at confirmation. 
Look it worked again. "They are not the same." Thanks for your help.
