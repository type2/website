Subject: clutch weirdness

The story so far:

I have access to a '71 bus sitting in a field that needs to be moved asap.  
As always, the story is that it was driven up until the point that the 
engine was pulled and it was towed to that field.  So, all I have to do is 
add an engine, drive it down the street to somewhere it can be towed from 
by AAA, and I'm good to go.

Last Night (early this morning):
So, after various unexpected tribulations, the engine is finally in, 
although it's flooded and won't run.  I try the clutch and find it badly 
in need of adjustment (catches about 2 inches off the floor, so 4-6" of 
free play).  I didn't have a set of vice grips with me and turning the 
wingnut resulted in the whole cable turning, so I figured I'd bag it for 
the night and come back the next day.  I do manage to get the engine 
started and running for 2-3 minutes, but it's pretty loud and pretty late, 
so I just bag it for the evening.

This afternoon:

I climb under the bus with the vice grips and try to adjust the clutch: no 
go.  The damn nut won't turn at all now.  Check the freeplay at the 
clutch:  get this: NONE!  The clutch has gone from all freeplay to none.  
I start her up and see if she'll move, but no go:  she's slipping (moves 
a wee bit but wheels aren't spinning).

What gives?  

I think the solution is that I'm just gonna tow her off the lot, but i'm 
really curiuos how I went from gobs of freeplay to none.   Maybe something 
happened when I ran the engine for the first time?

Any thoughts are appreciated.
