Subject: RE: [T2] New dual carbs. Linkage binding.

Paul,

How about installing a thicker intake manifold gasket? This should provide a
little more distance between the carbs. You could stack two gaskets to make
them thicker. Use care in tightening the intake manifold studs if you do
this; there's a chance of deforming or breaking the ears off the manifold
when there's a lot of squishy gasket material underneath.  I had this exact
same problem with some dual Dellorto's I installed on an 1800, and this was
my solution. The original thin steel gaskets were WAY too thin, and using a
thicker composition gasket solved the problem.

Is your hex crossbar aluminum or steel?
