The starter was rebuilt? Or the whole motor?

Hmmm, hot start solenoid is a much more common problem (see all the archive discussions) than a jamming starter.

See above.

Seems more likely to be the slack being taken up in the transmission between rocking forwards to backwards, and the clunking is just the rest of slack in places like CV joints, etc.

I like the hot start possiblity most.  Besides, the hot start relay fix is cheaper, easier and less time consuming than a starter change.  Why not try it first?  See the article in the library, and the many archive discussions on this topic.
