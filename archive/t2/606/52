Dear Clark:

2 years ago I !(-at-)#$ed up my bus stripping out a plug during my first
tuneup.  The folks on this list talk me through buying the
specialized tool to re-thread the plug hole and how to fix it the
right or wrong way.  Though I felt I needed to bring in the local VW
mechanic, the job was mostly done when he got the bus, thanks to this
list.

I was going to sell mine too or roll it into the Sacramento River.
Give the List members a chance to help you fix it you might be
surprised....  I was!

BEN
