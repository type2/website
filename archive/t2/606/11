This is semi-related. It's probably the same as for a manual tranny that
requires SAE 90 GL-4 Hypoid Gear Oil. Yes, multi-vis is OK. I'm not sure
about the auto but for a manual you must find GL-4 -- NOT GL-5. If it says
GL-5 on it anywhere avoid it.

GL-5 oils contain higher sulphur(?) levels and eat brass synchros for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

I've been using Sta-Lube brand GL-4 85W90 because it's the ONLY GL-4 I've
been able to find at a FLAPS. I've been buying it at O'Reilly Auto Parts.
Well, they've stopped carrying Sta-Lube products and now only have what's
left on hand so if you have an O'Reilly near you ask for them to check the
back for it.

The other that I've seen mentioned on the lists, if you can find it, is
Redline MT-90. You'll probably have to check speed shops for Redline
products and maybe have it ordered in.
