Subject: Bus is running hot

I have a 74 Bus that is running very hot (275, so I'm not driving it
except for short distances).  I stuck my hand under pistons 1 and 2
(between the pistons and the sheet metal above the heater boxes) and I
could feel air circulating.  I did this on the other side (pistons 3 and
4) and did not feel any air circulating.  I then pulled the rubber
grommet up and away from around spark plug number 2 and felt air coming
through the hole.  I tried this on spark plug 4 and felt no to very very
little air.

Seems pretty obvious that air is not being blown over pistons 3 and 4
but just wanted to ask this question anyway.  Should the air circulation
be the same for both sides of the engine?  With the oil cooler on the
side of 3 and 4 I didn't know if that would block some of the air flow?
I'm going to look into the fan housing and the flaps more but thought I
would ask the group.  Thanks for any and all responses.
Kevin
