Subject: Electromagnetic cut-off valve

Hi,

I accidently uncoupled the wire going to the electromagnetic cut-off valve on
the carburettor of my 468 bus (1600 engine). Now I don4t remember where it
shoule be connected. Can somebody tell me where to plug the other site of this
wire, I mean, where does it come from on the other side?

Thanks,

Bart
