Yes it can. We have done this tow several times over the TN hills but you need to watch your engine temps - heads and oil. 

You engine will not last as long is my guess. LOTS of strain. Brakes heat up quickly so don't rely on them too often. (Drive slower). 

It will be SLOW going up the hills. 

Glad you wife has that Beetle addiction started...
