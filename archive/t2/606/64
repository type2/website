hello Greg    Glad to see guys made it home OK  It was fun at Dixiebus  My 
old panel did real well except it developed an oil leak that I think is coming 
from the push tubes for some reason still too tired from driving that damn West 
Va turnpike .  On your bus check the breather on top of the motor and make 
sure it is clear, where do you have the breather hose running to . you might 
want to run it to an old oil bottle and take it out of the suction  you should be 
able to nurse it thur this season regardless .   Again it was good to see you 
guys and will see you at John Browns   later and have fun  Mark Dearing
