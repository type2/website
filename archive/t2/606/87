Subject: 71 Blown Engine?!?!?

Heading uphill, hauling a lot of weight on a hot summer day.  Oil temp
no hotter than on other occasions.  All of a sudden the oil light comes
on.  I pull over to the shoulder as I experience a gradual loss of
power.  Oil is quickly dripping from the bottom of the engine.  I shut
the engine off and get a tow back to my house.



Given that the engine never seized, I'm hoping that the fix isn't going
to kill me financially.  I'm 30,000 miles and 8 years following a total
rebuild.



Am I screwed?
