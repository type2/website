Subject: Re: [T2] New dual carbs. Linkage binding.

I can't move the linkage from side to side. The end springs are completely compressed. The flange at the end of the ball on the drivers side is completely flush with the nylon bushing in the socket. I think I know what caused this binding. Looking at the carbs from above, the hexbar does not go perpindicular to the fusilage of the vehicle, it goes frontwards diagonally from the left to the right side carb. This causes there to be pressure on one side of the lip of the nylon bushing on the driver's side that would not normally be there. I'm really thinking that if I ground off just a smidgeon, a fingernail-clipping's worth of nylon bushing, it would do the trick... Also... What about saturday morning? We aren't going to move until the afternoon... Just a thought. Thanks.

Do this - can you move the linkage side to side any at all - compressing those end springs any? 
Does it bind without the links that bolt on to the carbs? That is does it bind with just the crossbar alone?
