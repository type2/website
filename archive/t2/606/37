That is EXACTLY the scenario I had back in 2000. My 73 westy was coming 
apart at the seams when a "free to a good home" 79 shell was offered up 
to the list.

see http://www.pottsfamily.ca/westfakia/Gallery for images.

I used the 73's driveline for two years. Last summer I put a 2L in the 
westfakia, and this spring I converted it to FI. I am still using the 
73 tranny.

SINCE YOU PLAN TO USE THE 72 TRANNY: The "6-rib" tranny in the 77 is 
about 5/8" longer than the 1975-and-earlier models. VW compensated with 
a proportionally shorter shift linnkage. The 72 transmission will fit 
perfectly in the 77 bus, but when you hook up the shift linkage, 
getting into 1st gear will find the shifter knob smacking into the 
dashboard. If you unscrew the knob you will be able to engage first by 
pushing the lever *under* the dash, but third will still be impossible 
to engage because the shift lever will collide with the emergency 
brake.

Driving like this REALLY makes you appreciate third gear.

My solution to this was to bend the shift lever back about 15 degrees 
as close to the floor as possible. We heated up the shift lever with a 
torch, braced the lever with a 2x4 at the base and put a 3' iron pipe 
on in to torque it backwards with brute strength. Since I did that 
everything works fine. Your other options are to either extend the 
linkage by welding a 5/8" extension collar onto the linkage coupling at 
the front of the transmission, or swap the 228mm flywheel and clutch 
from the 77 onto the 1.7L engine and see what condition the 77 tranny 
is in. Do you know how many miles there are on the tranny?

You can leave the FI fuel pump in place. Just cap off the lines, and 
plug off the fuel return line. Why bother removing it and rewiring 
things if you're going to put it back again some day. It'll be just 
fine under there, and it won't get misplaced or damaged. With the 
double relay disconnected it won't get power.

There's also the reverse light wire, the alternator warning light, and 
the wiring to the heater's booster fan to mention a few more.

SWEET!!! When I got the westfakia it was a rolling shell with chalky 
paint and no interior. But that made it a blank canvas, and gave me a 
lot of options to explore. And the 73 donor had a nice interior. It 
cost about a $600 $cdn to make it drivable, and I put another $100cdn 
into the westification.

UGH. The AC will get in the way of the 1.7L engine tin unless you can 
move the compressor away from the engine bay and tuck it up on the left 
away from the engine. These things are always a PITA. But they're great 
if/when they work.

You're welcome. Enjoy the project, and keep us informed as to how it 
goes.

Happy trails,
