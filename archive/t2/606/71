Subject: Re: [T2] New dual carbs. Linkage binding.

   Just get a hacksaw or cut off wheel and cut equal amounts off of each sode of the hex bar. I like to have at least 
2mm of thread showing on the ball bolt? It is not un common to have to do this on a set of webers using hex bar or 
tyco linkage.  Remember "rarely will an aftermarket part just fit with ease".  Be very careful when setting up the 
linkage also. Make sure that both carbs open evenly and stop at the same time. This is done by moving the arms on 
the hex bar in or out

>Ok, I'm in the process of setting up some dual weber ICT's on my 1700. I got the kit from aircooled.net. The hexbar 
linkage appears to be just a smidgeon too long. It fits, but ever so barely. There is one bracket on each carb which is 
the socket for the ball on each end of the linkage. Each socket has a nylon bushing. With the hexbar in its shortest 
position, there is so much pressure against the nylon bushing that it's causing the throttle to stick really bad. It won't 
close all the way without me pushing it shut with a bit of pressure. Yes, I am using the thinner space-saving jam-nuts.
