Subject: RE: [T2] The ramifications of high crankcase pressure

When you say "....not had one hit 70 lbs, ever" what weight oil are you
using?? I will regularly see 80 PSI (max for my gauge) when I first start up
my motor this ALWAS goes down after about 5 minutes to me this makes sense
for a COLD motor with COLD THICK oil....

Am I wrong??? Should my oil pressure be less than 70 PSI even when I'm using
20W50 on a 65 degree F. morning?????

I test my motors on the stand for oil pressure, and with all the bells and
whistles have not had one hit 70 lbs, ever.
