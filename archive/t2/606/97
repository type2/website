Subject: REALLY stupid Dipstick/Heat Question. 

I've been searching the Archives about how to tell if your engines
getting too hot, and found lots of stuff saying to grab the dipstick,
and if you can hold it, it's fine, and if you can't hold it, it's too
hot.  Here's my question. Where are you supposed to be holding it? Just
the handle? Down at the end? Where oh where. 
 
I'm asking because of course my handle is ALWAYS nice and cool, and up
on the top where it kinda has the double dipstick to make sure it fits
snug, is usually not too hot. Not hot enough to burn you anyway, but hot
enough to be really hot at times. And down on the very tip of the
dipstick it gets hot enough to either burn you or come dang close too
it. It's enough I say OUCH! If I try to hold it after a half second.
 
It runs just fine though. No power loss or anything even after I drive
way faster than I should on the freeway. Or going up massive hills.
