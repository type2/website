Subject: size of thread?

Hi all.....I've got the fuel tank out of the 74 I'm restoring, and have 
discovered the threads on the bottom outlet are badly gummed with 
aluminum. (not stripped as I had feared at first).  I need to run a die 
over it to restore the threads but will need the exact size before my 
friend will lend it to me.  I think it's 17 or 18 mm  by 1.0 mm 
(spacing).  Can anyone confirm this for me?
