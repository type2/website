Subject: Blaupunkt code?

Anybody have a Blaupunkt Nashville or similar radio
(ca. 1995) that has a 4 digit code?  I need to know
what to do after punching in the code.  I know the code.

on my Mitsubishi radio in the other bus, I pressed the
TAPE button but haven't figured out this one yet.

if you know, please give me a buzz at 678-517-6578, I
will be on the road. 

hungry for tunes,
Will
