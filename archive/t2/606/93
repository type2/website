Ed,

There has pretty much got to be some sort of catastrophic failure there
unless you were just really low on oil.

You oil light shouldn't come on it less than about 4 lbs of oil pressure.

Given just the facts as you have stated, it would be difficult to 
say...maybe you blew a seal on your oil cooler or something like that...if 
you got it turned off pretty quickly you might be ok...not great, just ok.

Given the price of Type 1 engine parts, maybe not too bad if it really 
needs new bearings.

Cheers, dave
