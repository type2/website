have the hex bar machined shorter. there should be a very slight amount
(like 1/16" or so) of side-to-side movement possible (against the pressure
of the springs) with everything tightened. you don't want the pre-loading
springs to be completely compressed - almost, but not quite. after you
shorten the one side of the hex bar you drill the hole on that side deeper
by the same amount as you shorten the bar, you can measure the hole depth of
the other side also and make them the same. grinding for length and drilling
with a hand drill might work, but you should really do it on a lathe. the
linkage is critical to having the carbs run properly, it's got to be perfect
or the carbs will never run right.
