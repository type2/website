Subject: 70 bus front end sits higher than back end...what can it be

Hi all,

Im looking at a 70 bus, it looks pretty good, engine rebuilt not too 
long ago except the front end sits higher than the back end (looks like 
its going to pop a wheelie-not that bad but you get the idea). Is this 
a major problem, what might this be? And is it expensive to fix? This 
is going to be my first bus, I had a bug 10 years ago and I loved it, 
I'm feeling the fever for another VW.

Thanks,

Blake
