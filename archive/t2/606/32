No just plug the line you don't use for the fuel pump. The '77 has the 
supply and return line. I would plug the supply line that runs to the 
driver's side and use the return line to connect to your fuel pump. The 
placement of the fuel pump on the 1700 is a good spot to connect to the 
return line.

There are a few more connections at the starter terminals that come from the 
bus and not the engine. The rest should be normal.

Couldn't you just swap the flywheels and clutches and just use the 1700 
engine with the '77 Trans.?

Good Luck?
