Subject: 1700 fi going in tomorrow

Well... after two months of patience and being the shop gopher and parts 
cleaner my motor is dressed up on the stand and will be going into my 74 
westie tomorrow. I'm not sure how much money I saved being patient but I 
will suck it up with the experience I gained.  I'm not as intimidated now to 
do some of the things I know I can do..

It took a while and I learned a fair bit.. not just about busses but beetles 
too.  I've dropped about 5 beetles (from fire husks to norm) engines and 
stripped'em down etc etc.  It's amazing how much tin difference there is 
between the bugs and busses.

Anyway tomorrow we pop the 2liter out, and put the 1700 914 motor in.  I 
know that people were saying maybe redo the 2 liter but I decided to stay 
with the 1700 (from the rusty 78). It was such a nice sweet motor and great 
on fuel that I wanted it in this bus as well.  I think I will slowly take 
the 2 liter apart and see if I can find a donor 'husk' around and see what 
shakes.  My rusty 78 is serving as storage at the moment.  Anyone have a 78 
or so shell needing a motor and tranny? (located in Saskatoon Sk Canada)

Wish me luck tomorrow and hope all goes well!

James
