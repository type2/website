Hi Clark,

GIVE US SYMPTOMS!!!! For crying out loud man, it might be as simple as 
a bad set of points.

Sorry you had to walk home, but that's where AAA coverage pays off.

Even a burned piston can be overcome, but if the problem turns out to 
be a wire off or a blocked fuel line you are throwing away good $$$.

You've been on this list long enough to know that we aren't gonna let 
you off that easily.


Happy trails,
