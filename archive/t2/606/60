Subject: Back on type2/Britt G.?

Gang,

I sold my '65 daily driver and now have no bus save the -79 sunroof project, so I'm hopping back on Type2.  Been missing some of you volk.
Will probably be lurking mostly as I am again a new dad and now a full time student as well.

Also, Britt, can you email me, or can somebody hook me up with Britt's email?

Thanks,

Billy
