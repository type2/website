the problem here, of course, is cost.

More problems:  

1:  Most of the 5 speeds here came off diesels
and you won't like that gear ratios much.  1st is
basically mule gear.  I think the Weddle
Engineering had the 5 speeds new at one time and
can put the right ratios in for you, at a price
of course.  

2:  The vanagon is a sideshifter, though I've
heard that you can switch nose cones.  Don't know
for sure.
