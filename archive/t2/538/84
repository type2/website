Subject: Ring Removal Tool

From the archives - April 2003

"Actual measures and inspection can confirm good rings/pistons/cylinders.
Put each ring by itself in it's cylinder and hold it up to the light. If
you can see light between the ring and cylinder, you aren't spec no matter
how you measure it. Requires only ring removal tool and source of light to
verify."

So, what's a 'ring remover tool,' and can I use that to install rings, too??
