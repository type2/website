Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Seating Question

I have a homemade jumpseat behind my drivers seat with seat belt installed.
Very similar to original.  I even installed my propane heater in the base of
it (had to cut a hole in side of bus for exhaust but at least it IS SAFE)

The way I installed the seat belt was to use the exact same top mount as the
front seat for the male end.  And the same mount for the female end as front
seat also.  I did not install a lap belt as I only use it as a travel
carrier.  But on a late bay you could also use the front seat lap mount for
this one.  One an early bay you would have to either fab this mount or cut a
hole in the wall between the seats to use the original front seat mount.  2
attachments mounted easily on this setup.  And yes it will hold, I
personally have crash tested it twice (neither my fault) and there was no
problems.  Yes, I did (and everyone should) replace the belts after the
accident as seat belts were designed for one crash and to stretch a little
to help cushion you.

I did the same thing for the passenger side with no jump seat.  Again I use
it for travel and holding things on the way.

Hope this helps.
