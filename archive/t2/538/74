Thanks,
I would love to know how you put seatbelts on the Jumpseat.
And I would love to know how the seatbelts fasten in the back of a your
69.
I am looking at a 69 right now which has seatbelts for the front two
only.

I had my eye on an Awesome 71 with a cool paint job, but was too slow on
the Cash!

Thanks,
Matt

i have to agree with with greg, because that's what i have. in my 75
westfalia i removed the sink cabinetry. i found its storage space
cramped my life given the volume of that space, no factory spare tire to
put in there, and the sink is just a plain stupit horse piss stream with
a basin large enough to wash a mug at a time. i installed a rear facing
seat in its place which has nice storage and allows me to carry five
other people. it has a seatbelt i installed, and if anyone wants detals
on how i did that, ask, i have photos. with three children that's a
bonus. it'll hold a mother-in-law too, but that's a different nida
bonus. this set up outweighs the problems of any one-year only stuff,
for me. one improvement i can think of to increase storage would be to
add the shelf over the engine which attaches to the rear closet. i've
lived without one, but am now considering the need. so if you can do
without the sink, think about the options; a rear facing seat is a good
one.

on my 69 sunroof i have a full length pull out too. behind the cab seats
i am going with two rear facing seats for a while. hopefully i can get a
spare tire into the construction of one of those seats. that's gonna
take a shoehorn.
