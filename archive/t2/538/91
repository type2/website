<Yah, do what all the "camper" folks do these days,, take you satellite
dish receiver along with you.>

Well OK Jamie--what's the answer?
 
Is the egg first or the chicken?

Buy a deluxe boob tube--and use the rabbit ears that's on it--
Or have an Ok TV and get a better antenna?

I vote for a 10ft' round early satellite dish mounted to the roof
myself--
