Subject: Re: [T2] knuckle slammer shifter

thanks tim - i'm on it right now. so far this morning i changed the
coupler, and found the shifting much much harder to find gears, and still
hitting the dash and e-brake. just removed the mat, and am cleaning out the
years of dirt before undoing the 13 mm bolts.

>Little bit of wear at the coupler is a lot of movement at the shifter. New
shifter plates are cheap. If yours shows wear replace it. For initial
adjustment, engage 2nd gear, adjust plate so shifter lower shaft is
perpendicular to the floor. Now test shifting. If you still hit the e-brake
handle, shift the plate rearward bit by bit. Just a small movement at that
plate is 2" or more of knob movement.

>>rod coupler
shows it is mildly wollowed out and worn, so i'll change it now. but is
there more to be done to avoid hitting the e-brake and such when shiting
into third?
