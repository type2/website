Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Seating Question

My 1973:
Driver, passenger, jumpseat, two in the bench seat. 5 total. All have seat
belts in mine.

I'm adding another jump seat behind the front passenger seat where the
sink/fridge was. A fold up one like in the extended cab S-10 pickups.
That'll make 6 for me.
