Subject: Wondering what's a good mobile tv

Hi Y'all,
I was wondering if anybody knows if there is actually a good portable tv that
gets better reception than others. I am getting ready to go on a long solo
road trip across the west for a month and am considering splurging on a tv,
but I am reluctant about whether or not a tv would actually receive a decent
reception. Anybody have any good experience with any particular model over
another. I would really appreciate your advice. Thanks in advance.
