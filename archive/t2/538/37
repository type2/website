Subject: Installing rings 2.0 liter

I have a new set of iron rings.  I don't know the manufacturer.  They come 
in an unmarked white box, with a date stamp of APR 15 1981.  I expect these 
are NOS. Emphasis on the 'O'

The box has a printed 029-198-175 stickon tab, with a hand written 
Beck/Arnley number 013-3749.  I just pulled off the dried up stickon tab and 
I see a Grant Rings part number actually printed on the box - A 1449 STD.  
so I expect these are Grant rings

There is an instruction sheet that tells how to install the oil 
rings/spacer.  [Nothing on the sheet indicates manufacturer.]

However, the #1 compression rings and the #2 compression rings have two 
distinct sides to them, and I don't know which way is up and which way is 
down on the compression rings. [they are NOT marked 'top' as you would 
expect]

The #1 rings have one BEVEL edge on the INSIDE .  One side [top or bottom, 
that is the question] of the ring has a bevel.

The #2 rings have a NOTCH edging on the OUTSIDE.  One side [top or bottom, 
that is the question] is notched.

I can see these bevels and notches quite clearly with a 10x loupe.
