I have a set of 6 bumper bolt cover cap masters that I'm machining up for
production, thanks to Richard (I think!?)  I'll have them in just about any
color that you could want, but due to business concerns (as in slooooow
business), I'm unable to set up the production molds for now.

Just how large a market do we have for these little darlings?
