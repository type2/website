Subject: spring restart and loud engine noise

I have an 82 2.0L AC vanagon it's new to me in Oct. but i've had it stored
thru the winter.
I have started it a few times over the winter, on nicer days and such..
now i start it and I get a LOUD clatter.. I've heard hydraulic lifter clatter
before (my 76 baja has 76 2.0L TIV motor)
typicaly it subsides quickly and quiets right down in my baja, but I let the
engine Idle for 15+ minutes with an occassional rev and was still LOUD
clatter.

would popping off the valve cover and checking lash help reassure me it's a
collapsed lifter and not a bad rod?

if it's a bad lifter, is there anything I could do that would "prime" it back
up?

thanks for the help and time..

BTW I'm a new list member, I've been on the vanagon list for years, but with
my new to me AC vanagon.
