Subject: Rear Shift coupler questions

Had the engine out of the bus so I decided to chage the rear shift coupler. I
was able to change it without removing the transmission. Loosened up the
carrier bolts and got the tranny moved back enoughto get the job done.

Seemed to have madea huge mistake by that I mean when I got in the bus to
check the siftting , first gear goes into the dash, not good .. seems like the
whole linkage is off some. (moved foward)

I did ahve the wife move the gearshift to get the set screw on the coupler  to
mate when reinstalling the new coupler.

I must have takend off the old coupler in one gear (1st I thought)  and put
the new copuler in another. (Maybe 2nd?)

Anyway ideas how to go about getting this right.
