According to my engine builder (Kummetat in Germany who does a lot of custom
and racing trannies and engines), those Vanagon trannies will not work with
a type 4 engine, because they are too long. Or put it differently, the bus
is too short ... They had 5-speeds for the water-leaker boxers as well so
gearing should not be much of a problem. A friend runs such a 5-speed on a
TDI in ist bay and it is good for 100+ mph, but that installation involved
major re-engineering.
