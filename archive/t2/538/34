I don't have a picture, but they're a round button, about 1.25" in diameter
and 0.375" high that snap over the 4 bolt heads on the bumper.

I've got a few test casts on the bumper of my own bus, both out of a hard
resin and a softer, more flexible resin to test how well they work and wear.

I'm not exactly in a great business period, funds are low, so I'm unable to
pour the production mold for the buttons at this time.
