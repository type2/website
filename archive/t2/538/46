Subject: still hesitating/bucking

ok, this is an ongoing saga that i have been battling with for about a
month. i'm nearly at my wits end here & don't want this to affect my
attendance at EveryBus.

the truck still starts & idles fine.  after driving for about 20-30 minutes,
it begins hesitating/bucking/spitting. it will also cut off at stoplights,
but always does restart.

what i've done so far:
-new points & condensor
-dist. cap & rotor are about 3 months old
-new bosch coil
-changed fuel filter
-plugged suspected vacuum leak

what could be causing this?  thanks in advance!
