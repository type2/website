Subject: Re: [T2] Installing rings 2.0 liter

From: Sage Green:

 The #1 rings have one BEVEL edge on the INSIDE .  One side [top or bottom,
 that is the question] of the ring has a bevel.

 The #2 rings have a NOTCH edging on the OUTSIDE.  One side [top or bottom,
 that is the question] is notched.

 I can see these bevels and notches quite clearly with a 10x loupe.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Normally, notches and bevels are visable plainly without optical aids.....

When this is the case AND there are no dots or dimples to denote TOP, inside bevels always go up and outside
notches always down.
