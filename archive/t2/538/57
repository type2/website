It's a great layout for two, or 4 people with a side tent.  Everyone 
has an opinion; my preference is for the "weekender" model with a 
double-bed pop-top and table but no kitchen equipment or cabinetry. VW 
never built a bus in this configuration but they eventually produced a 
Vanagon in this configuration.

I have a 1973  rear-facing seat in my westfakia and it is highly sought 
after by my three kids. Motion sickness has never been an issue and we 
take a lot of long trips. Remember that passenger trains and transit 
buses have been facing passengers backwards for generations. The seat 
is made of VERY strong plywood and firmly bolted to the floor. I know 
for certain that the rear-facing seat has had factory seatbelts at 
least since 1972. It's very well constructed, so I can't see how it 
would be any less safe than the Z-bed.

The 74 and 75 bus have a full width rear seat, but have extra camping 
equipment that limits total seating capacity to 5. I decided we could 
do our cooking outside the bus and built the westfakia with a 74-75 
style full-width bed and a 68-73 rear facing seat. I have seatbelts for 
6 and a very wide bed when the Z-bed is folded down.

It's a bit of a mix-and match, but it can still be completely creating 
using original Westfalia components.

Happy trails,
