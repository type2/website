You'll almost never get that bolt un frozen even with an oxy / acetylene
torch--the sleeve will just continue spinning--

Cut it out---both sides--with an air cut off tool---It'll fall out--

Later,

i attempted to put my new front shocks on today. the drivers side went
on fine. the passenger side came off, but the metal sleeve on the lower
mounting bolt for the old shock is rusted onto the mounting bolt.
is it going to take some heat to get this thing off?
any suggestions?
thanks,
