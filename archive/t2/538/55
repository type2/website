76-79 have seat belts for 4, and I doubt a 5th person could sit 
comfortably (if at all) on the rear bench, since it's only 3/4 width 
(fridge/closet are on the left side of the Bus).

That said, I personally think the 76-79 Westy interior layout is the 
best of all of them because the room isn't broken up, and you have that 
groovy captain's chair on the passenger's side.

Regarding seating a passenger in the jump seat -- I'm not sure that's 
such a good idea.  Even if it was safe (which I'm not sure it would 
be), that's serious car-sick material facing backward in a moving car 
:-)  I'm pretty sure there is not a seat belt there in the stock 
configuration.

Personally, I would get a '76-79.  They have the best interior layout 
(IMHO :-), the large pop-top that can sleep two adults (even a one 6'4" 
like me!), and the 2.0L fuel injected engine.  I would avoid a '75 ... 
lots of 1-year-only parts on that year, IIRC.  I think the best years 
are 76-78 ... many of the parts for those years are interchangeable (of 
course, the exception is the "early 76", like mine, which seems to have 
some stuff in common with '75).  '79 is another 1-year-only parts year 
... well, it shares some with the Vanagon, like the cylinder heads and 
the electronic ignition (California model).
