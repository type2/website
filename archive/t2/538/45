Subject: distributer installed wrong?

All,
     I seem to vaguely remember a description of this somewhere.  I removed 
my distributor last night and am attempting to re-install it today.  I lined 
up the crank pulley to TDC, and the distributor shaft is not at the 12 
degree angle shown in the Bentley.  If I install the distributor as I recall 
it being in the bus, it is pointing with the rear of the rotor button facing 
#1, not the front.  If I turn the crank pulley around to the exact opposite, 
so the timing mark is facing directly away from TDC, the gear slot is at the 
12 degree angle and it looks ready to fire #1.
     More to the point, I can just install the distributor as it was, right? 
  If I am correct it will all work out if I install the distributor with the 
rear of the rotor facing the #1 cylinder mark on the distributor while the 
crank pulley is set to fire #1 (after all, it was apparently running like 
that before I pulled the distributor).  Is there anything else I should do 
for this while timing the engine?  Is that going to hurt anything?  Any 
thoughts or comments appreciated.
     If all goes well somebody will be dropping by this afternoon to lend a 
hand anyway, so hopefully I won't be on my own to get this all back in order 
:-)
