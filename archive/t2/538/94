Subject: Points- Sluggish start when eng warm

I readjusted my points a couple days ago - got them dead on at 50 as per Mr.
Rivers - bus ran great idled very steady - no problem - today I was out for
a ride and I began to have starting troubles - the bus seemed to turn over
very slowly and then it would catch and everything was fine - ran great
idled great - I checked the dwell on my points and noticed that it had
dropped back to 47 degrees - checked the timing and it was 7.5btdc - the
battery had 12 volts and was charging at 13.48 - the wires all seemed
secure - the only change was the points dwell - could the dwell change acct
for the sluggish start - I would have to assume that they are on their way
out if they changed in a couple days - does it sound like I am looking in
the right place - I will crawl under and have look at the starter wiring
tomorrow . Now I find that when the eng has cooled for a half an hour it
starts up fine - any thoughts ?
