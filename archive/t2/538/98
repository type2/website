You'll see nothing major; rear corner has a ding and replacement cover 
of the taillight.

The assembly is still there, it's just the lens that is broken.
btw- it needs a motor rebuild.


Any who, it's currently located between San Francisco and San Jose in 
California. Looking to find it a good home.
