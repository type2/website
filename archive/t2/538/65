Subject: Re: [T2] removing rusty shock sleeve from mounting bolt

http://www.aircooled.net/gnrlsite/resource/articles/mods.htm

" If you are trying to install your new front shocks onto the lower shock
mount and the shock doesn't fit, the steel sleeve from your old shock is
seized on the mount and must be removed. A grinder, heat, and penetrating
oil. "

Hope that helps.
