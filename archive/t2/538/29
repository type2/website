Subject: oil light - break in - friday rambler

well wouldn't you know the 69 has a compleat idiot AND an oil light
afterall. i tested the switch off the battery, made a 12 foot jumper wire
to the pod, and ultimately the pod wanted a 69 bulb housing. is that
unreal? three different copper clean bulb housings from a 76 pod, and the
oil light was only willing to give if it had a 69 vintage bulb housing.
part-icular. better not be this way from now on. i was surprised it didn't
want just new bulbs. housings. anyway... did 50 miles of break in this
morning on the lane county country roads. wish you could have all been
there.  sunny, warm, not a cloud.

a sunroof bus is sublime. that it's not leaking up there is bonus. would
not have happened w/o the list. THANKSall
