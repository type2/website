Subject: Re: [T2] Ring Removal Tool

Forget the ring expander---

I filed rings for years to get proper end gap--and here I'm reading that
if ya can see light through the end gaps--while they're in the bore's
that isn't acceptable.

Hog wash---

Any ring has a measurable end gap--I don't care what engine it may be in
---

And if that end gap isn't correct--you have problems.

I would disregard this information you dug up-- it ain't right.

" Put each ring by itself in it's cylinder and hold it up to the light.
If you can see light between the ring and cylinder, you aren't spec no
matter how you measure it."
