More info on shift couplers. All currently available I've seen have the 
frame clamped to the collar, but not being OEM steel can work loose just 
too soon. NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Find a friendly local welder and spot weld the 
frame and coupler at 2 opposite points. If your existing coupler is good 
except for this loose joint, have it spot welded and drive on.
