Subject: bumper over riders

A few weeks ago a photo of a set of large bumper over-riders was posted 
by a type2 list member. The question came up to how the over-riders were 
secured to the bumper, etc. I had my rear bumper off so I took some 
photos of the over-riders, along with the front over-riders.
