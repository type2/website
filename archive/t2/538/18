Highs winds can make for a lot of work in a Hi-Top, but if you
steering/ball-joints are up to snuff I think this would be minimized.  I
normally cruise at 60 mph in calm conditions, and slow to 50 - 55 depending
on the winds.

You get a ton of extra space in a Hi-Top for storing light weight stuff and
you can stand up anytime.  It's handy for transporting odd-sized items and
gives a convenient spot to attach a retractable awning above the slider
door.  You can also add upper windows/roof vents for extra light and
ventilation.    My wife loves it.

My Hi-Top was a Get-Away conversion and has a humungous roof cut-out, larger
than a Westy.  We don't have a bed up top, just storage.  We also have a
unique removable wardrobe/stove/cupboard unit (stove/cupboard detaches for
more flexibility) which sits behind the driver's seat which take a lot of
gear while still leaving a lot of space.  The only items not put in a
cupboard on our last trip was the water jug and the Kool-Tron 12V cooler,
which sat behind the wardrobe.
