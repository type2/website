Thank you Karl!  Now I *FINALLY* know what all that crabgrass stuff that I found on my '65 Bug (titled
as '66, stupid CA DMV) was for.  Tossed it all when I rebuilt the 40-horse the week after I bought it, nasty
dropped valve.

It'd always kind bugged me, just wondering what that crap was for.  Looked awful "shadetree" by the time I
got it.  Mystery solved..
