Subject: Re: [T2] Egg on my bus

This reminds me of a conversation I had a couple weeks ago walking out
of a Lamar's Donuts:

Him: Is that your Great White Bus?
Me: Yep!
Him: I'll bet you're one of those jerks who voted for Bush.
Me: Yep!
Him: Whew. I was afraid you were a liberal with that bus. I voted for  Bush
too.

WTF?
