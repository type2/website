Shortly after Mobil lost their lawsuit, most oil

Delvac-1, AMSOil, Redline, and Motul 5100 are the
only oils made from pure traditional synthetics.

My understanding is that Mobile 1 remains PAO
also.  Is that correct?  I cannot really tell
from any of the marketing hype on the websites,
except that Amsoil claims that Mobil 1 is similar
to stuff they used to make 30 years ago.  


Happy bussin'
