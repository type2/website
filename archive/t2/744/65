Subject: '74 clock wires

Seems like really recently I saw some post here pertaining to how to wire up an original Westy clock in the third hole of the instrument pod, but I simply cannot find the post (I thought I saved it). Can anyone help me out, Bentley doesn't show a clock in the wiring diagrams. TIA.
