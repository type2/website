Subject: Timing light

Hi Folks,

After 10 years of adjusting my 009 statically, I've finally succumbed 
to peer pressure from the list and switched to an SVDA distributor.  
I'm understanding that I'll have to time this with a light.  The last 
time I used one of these contraptions was during the Reagan 
administration, and although the two I'm seeing online (at HF) look 
more or less like I remember mine before I threw it over the back 
fence, there seems to be an option of either with or without advance.  
Anyone care to comment on whether the "advance" feature is 1) 
indispensible, and 2) if not, whether it's worth paying twice the 
price.

Thanks for your tolerance.

Best regards,
