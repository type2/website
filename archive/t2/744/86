If this is the same guy and I think it is.

This kid showed up at our shop over two years ago. The thing has a 1500 or 
1600 engine in it. I didn't think he had a bus though. Charley actually did 
some work on it for him. He is a nice guy and it sure is a cool rig but it 
is NOT a bus.

I do remember getting a call from him late last summer so I think he still 
has it. It was parked around 19th and Balsam in Boulder but knowing the city 
it was probably forced to parked in Erie.
