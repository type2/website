I found this at Btlmex for $16:

It's an advance only unit from Bosch Mexico and the part number is
BAA905271. I asked my friend at the local dealer about the part number and
he said it looks like stock that Bosch sells through the back door to anyone
wanting to sell it down there.

I tested it out on the engine at got this advance:

5" = 0.5 deg.
6" = 1 deg.
7" = 3 deg.
8" = 4 deg.
9" = 5 deg.
10" = 5.5 deg.
11" = 7 deg.

7 of 8 Type 4 distributors in Bentley in this compatibility range show this
range to be on the low side but acceptible. I can look in Jim Thompson's
excellent distributor database and guess which beetle it came from.

Better than nothing at this price, wouldn't you agree? Bus Depot still sells
a few of the other genuine bus vacuum cans...
