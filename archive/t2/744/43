>>Bottom left corner:

So they VW factory engineers recommended straight
weight SAE30 or SAE40 for summer and 15W40 for
winter.  

>>For whatever it's worth, most piston-engine
airplanes (think hot-running aircooled engines)
burn
single-weight oil, SAE 40 or 50, and *all*
multigrade oils sold for aircraft use are at
least semisynthetic.

And the aircooled airplane engineers and
mechanics use straight weight SAE40 or SAE50.  

>>So, they add these very special very long
molecules, the VIIs...there are two catches:
first, these molecules are not lubricants, so
the more of them that you add the less oil you
have sitting around lubricating things. Secondly,
these VII
molecules can be broken into pieces by various
pressures and forces...

And the petroleum engineers think that VII's in
the multigrades don't provide lubrication and
breakdown in hot engines.  

HOWEVER, why should we think that these guys with
their so-called degrees know nearly as much as we
shadetree VW hobbyists and the guys selling oil
at Cheapozone Autoparts?  I'm using 5W30 or 10W30
in my bus.  (Sarcasm folks.)

I've even heard some of da boyz thinking that the
new super thin 0W20 stuff must be good for their
aircooled VW because Honda or whoever now
recommends it for their new zoomzoom cars.  


Happy bussin'
