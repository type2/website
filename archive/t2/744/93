>>Joe,
>>You back??

Body, Mind, or Spirit?

No seriously, I had to return to Seattle for some 2 weeks. I am so under the 
gun here it is going to be really hard to catch up. It was just bad timing 
all together. But I am back and getting parts out the door.

I will once again cram 2.5 weeks into one and catch up. Please keep the 
parts orders rolling (phone call is the best) and thank you to everyone for 
your continued support.

Did anyone see us on the highway 20 foot Penski with a green '78 westy on a 
car carrier (about 55' long total length)? (May 15th-18th traveling on I-90, 
I-84, I-80, I-25) The total weight was 21,000 lbs. the bus on the trailer 
was 5300, we did have some stuff in the bus.
