<One possible good thing about using plywood is that although moisture
threatens the glue, temperature and humidity aren't going to warp it as much
and it'll be a bit stronger since the wood grains aren't all the same
direction.  Sealing the bolt holes would possibly resolve the problem of
direct moisture.>

Good points! Enjoying the read folks!
