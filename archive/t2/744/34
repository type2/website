Subject: Re: [T2] Poptop Wood Frame Repairs

we have noticed the same thing going wrong with our sportsmobile top as well in the front right hand corner the wood has rotted enough that when we pop it now it has a opening up there...
i have thought of replaceing it with slats of wood maybe cut (strips)from treated wood of some sort havent figured that one out yet... plywood maybe? but would think it would rot rather fast as well but trying to keep in mind lightness of wood as well for the strips... ..
what about some sort of aluminum strips of some sort as well?????????
 
and if the underneath surface is rotted what would one do?the surface that the actual strips connect to............?screw into~!~
my thoughts working on the same problem...
i have thought of just ripping all my canvas down and starting over using just some sort of fabric in its place...
what about tnet supply places also wonder if one can purchase tent material and just make the pop top canvas out of tent material..?

When I had the poptop off on my bus it looked to me like that frame was used
as part of the mold for the fiberglass making it an integral part.
