Hmm. Finding this mighty confusing -  grey brown plugs suggest good 
news. As Haynes puts is "Grey brown deposits. Plugs ideally suited to 
engine, and engine in good condition". Black dry plugs mean too rich 
fuel mixture, black wet means worn engine. Assuming your 1,3 and 4 plugs 
are black and wet, that suggests wear requiring a top end rebuild 
(piston rings at the very least). What is confusing is that cylinder 2 
seems OK. Can't think of a logical reason why, unless a PO has done a 
partial rebuild (maybe just replacing valves on number 2? - can't 
imagine why).

On the other hand if 1,3 and 4 are black and dry, your carburettor/FI 
needs attention. Perhaps the leak on number 2 was letting in air and 
making the mixture weaker, and actually bringing it to something about 
normal giving a normal looking plug.
