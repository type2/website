Subject: 2 short heater cables for a 78 westy

I'm looking to see if anyone knows a source for the two shorter heater 
cables that attach to the left heater lever.  One goes to the flapper 
box in the verticle tube for defrost/foot warmer, and the other goes to 
the flapper box for front heat or back heat.

If not, I'm thinking I'll just buy two more of the standard heater 
cables and cut them accordingly and press on some fittings at the 
flapper side if that will work...

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Mike
