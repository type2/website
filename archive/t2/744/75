Subject: Intermittent oil light

Hello all, I've got a '72 van with a 1700 dual-carb
engine with 58000 original miles.  It seems like the
previous owner was a little hard on the van but it
drives and idles really well.  I've had it for a
couple months and put on approx 2000 commuting miles
with no problems.  

Lately, and the weather has been getting warmer by the
way, the red oil light has begun to come on
periodically when I drive.  As soon as it comes on I
turn off the engine and coast to the shoulder but I
cannot find anything wrong with the van.  I'll start
the engine again and after five seconds the red oil
light goes off.  Any thoughts on what to check?  The
dip stick says the oil level is okay.  The only
strange thing I found was that the oil breather hose
is gone and the hole for it has been plugged up. 
Could this be an issue?  I removed the two bottom
pieces of tin and saw that there is no thermostat
installed and the oil cooler looks a pretty dirty but
I haven't had the time to remove it and take a better
look.

Thanks,
--Mitchell
