Subject: Re: [T2] Poptop Wood Frame Repairs

. Ron Dunn mentioned that he thought
it was where water has seeped down the bolt holes, and I think that's on
target. I'll probably use some silicone sealant or something there. Also
having a good poptop seal should also help minimize this.

this is what i did was used clear silicone around the bolt holes on top and as far as a good seal mine is shot but someone form type2 mentioned using 1/2 inch pipe insulation for a seal and thats what i been using for a outside seal for over a year now works great. i put a little duct tape on the inside to make sure the pipe insulation doesnt ever slip off but you can see the duct tape from the backside of the insulation.

 



Peace and Love
