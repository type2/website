Mea Culpa !
Stock dizzy should be timed at 5 deg ATDC, not 5deg BTDC o n1971 bus.
Jim pointed this it out a while back but I was too confident to go
back and check.
Bottom line, the bus is overheating when timed with 10 degrees of
extra advance ( !!!)
One thing that bothers me now is that I cannot get it to idle over 800
rpm with idle jet 55 and timing 5d ATDC. Will try bigger idle jet  /
check vacuum leaks again
