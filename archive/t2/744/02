Constant RPM, yes -- frequent inspections, yes -- but, if an aircraft engine's
rated time between overhauls is 2000 hours at 75% power -- which is typical --
that's the equivalent of driving a Bus about 130,000 miles on the freeway.  At
that point, the engine normally would be rebuilt whether it needs it or not,
although exceptions are possible if the aircraft is not in commercial
service.

Mike Benthin's example aside, I don't think it's necessarily reasonable to
stake my life on expecting 130,000 miles from my Bus engine.

Obviously, there are lots of other factors at play, and the comparisons only
go so far, but.. seeing as I'm responsible for the care and maintenance of
both an airplane and a Bus, it's hard for me not to make them.

Cheers,

Miles
