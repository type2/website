Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel oil

This is truly shocking news. What a difference between theoretical
knowledge and what is available on the store shelves! The court ruling
reminds me of the legislature wanting to redefine pi. The whole idea
of calling synthetic a marketing term instead of a scientific term is
indicative of the entire decay of our society. I remember in my
childhood ads that would explain why their product was better. Today
they have decided we are all idiots and won't buy anything unless it
is promoted with sex.

Any idea of where to buy these brands you recommmended? I always
avoided Amsoil in the past because of the multi level marketing
scheme.

 Shortly after Mobil lost their lawsuit, most oil companies started
reformulating their synthetic oils.... To the best of my knowledge,
Delvac-1, AMSOil, Redline, and Motul 5100 are the only oils made from
pure traditional synthetics.
