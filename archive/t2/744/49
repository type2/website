Hey all-

Even though my schedule seems to get crazier and
crazier as time goes, I'm still sure I will be able to
make the Lawrence show over Memorial Day weekend.

I still have the hubcap and trunk, waiting to be
passed on.  Unfortunately, it didn't make it all the
way to Alaska like we were hoping, though it did make
it to Three Forks, Montana and back with us!

Is there anyone who will be there who would like to
take over Tour duties from me?  (Or anyone who can
carabus it to someone who wants it?)

I'll plan on having it there that weekend barring any
unforseen circumstances.

Someone who also participates on the Type 2 list
should forward this note.

Thanks,

David
