Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel oil

This discussion reminds me of the discussion of dino oils in an oil
engineering article that was posted a few months ago. I believe the
situation is different for synthetics. I use Castrol Syntec.

In my organic chemistry class our professor told us that these
molecules are based on free radicals that excite at higher
temperatures, causing the short molecules to combine and create longer
molecules that have higher viscosity. It is my understanding from the
above referenced article that synthetic oils do not require the
viscosity enhancers and that synthetics have greater sheer strength.

 OUCH! The ratio of polymers to oil in 5-50 would not give you much oil!!
 That is a long way from 5 to 50.....
 From here: http://motorcycleinfo.calsci.com/Oils1.html

 [VII means Viscosity Index Improvers or polymers]

 To make a 10w-40 oil, the manufacturer would start out with a 10
weight oil as the base stock. All by itself,
 this oil would thin out so much at normal operating temperatures that
the oil film would be useless. So, they
 add these very special very long molecules, the VIIs. The VII
molecules are as much as 1000 times as long as
 an oil molecule.....
