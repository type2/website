Subject: RE: [T2] Deep sump systems?

Hi Volks- my experience with a deep sump happened in about 1970. I was
fighting with the Xwife and hit a set of uneven railroad tracks at about
50mph in a bug. The impact tore the bottom of the engine case out. Not a
pretty sight at all. Ted

Don't take life to seriously -- you'll never live throught it....
