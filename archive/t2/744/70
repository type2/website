"So I'm a pretty new owner of a 72 bus. I fear pretty serious "tank crud"
issues; I should have known when I bought the bus and it had two fuel
filters next to each other!"


Josh, 
	Here's what I did when tank crud gave me a problem in our 71.
1.  First I drained the gas tank.
2.  Then I disconnected the fuel line and screwed the strainer out of the
bottom of the tank.  I believe your 72 has the same set up.
3.  Using a couple of buckets I poured a gallon of alcohol into the tank and
then let it drain out of the strainer hole into a second bucket.  I then
poured it back into the first bucket through a piece of cloth to remove the
crud from the alcohol.
4.  Repeat step 3 until no more crud comes out of the strainer hole.  Set
the bucket aside and let the alcohol evaporate.
5.  Next I put the garden hose into the tank filler and let it run for quite
a while as the water drained out the strainer hole.
6.  Then I let the tank dry by pumping air into it using the exhaust from my
shop vac.
7.  Again I did the alcohol routine with fresh clean alcohol.
8.  Then I installed a new strainer and seals and replaced my fuel lines.

It may sound like a lot but it really isn't.
