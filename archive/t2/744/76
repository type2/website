Subject: Seattle area... local forum

Franklin's Motorwerks website supports a local forum
for all air cooled vee dubs.
http://www.franklinsvwwerks.com/
While the type 2 resource is great.. having a local net can be
very helpfull. I would encourage anyone in the puget sound region to
get on and help populate a local list too. :-)

I am not affiliated with Franklin's.. but think it would be great to
see this
local list grow.

The person who says it cannot be done.... 
should not interrupt the person doing it.
