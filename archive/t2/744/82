Subject: the search for Mr. Bubblehead

Attention, please! I am having trouble with a VDO-Kienzle analog clock and have read an article in the tech section of type2.com written (in part) by the one who goes as Mr. Bubblehead. If anyone (or the man hisself) can get me in touch with him, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!
