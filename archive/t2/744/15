Which really makes me wonder what worth it has at all.

I've driven a 72 bus with and without it connected and the engine was dog
slow with it connected. I've read the description of it is in Bentley on
page 73 of Engine and Clutch and I can't think of a reason to disable the
vacuum advance for the lower 3 gears.

Looking back over the receipts for that bus that the PO was so careful to
keep, they purchased the bus on 10/30/72 and had to be taken in for service
7/1/74 (only 20 months later) at 8,633 miles when the owner complained that
the engine ran poorly when hot. I'd like to draw the conclusion that the a/c
unit intallation butchery to the engine seal and vacuum advance cutoff were
to blame but who knows...

What engine doesn't need a little extra advance at partial throttle? It
would seem to do more harm than good to leave it connected.
