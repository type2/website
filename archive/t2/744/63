Subject: Re: [T2] Deep sump systems?

Chris,

Deep sump doesn't really help much on heat....just takes longer for the 
oil to get warmer.

These are really about people with hi perf engines that can run all the 
oil out of the sump before it has time to flow back down from the heads 
and such....especially folks to hard curves at hi rpm's.

This is the deep sump systems like for a T1 engine...you didn't state your 
year.  :-((

I am not *aware* of anyone making one for T4 engines.

Cheers, dave
