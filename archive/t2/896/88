List,

Just a few general notes to people doing PR tube seals on a 73-79 bus. There
are a few things you can do to make the job easier and also better. One
thing is to back the valve adjusting screws all the way out before you
remove the rocker arms. This relieves the tension on the rocker assembly and
makes removing the valve gear easier and less stressful on the studs. The
other thing I always do is replace both the adjuster screws and 7mm nuts and
washers. It adds about 40 bucks to the job, but it makes the project more
thorough. The adjusters are always always bad. I have yet to do PR seals on
a bus that didn't also have at least 3 or 4 adjuster screws that were pitted
beyond usefulness. Doing the nuts just makes good sense. They are very small
threads. They have been re and re many times in the life of the vehicle and
such an important fastener deserves to be replaced when you can do so.
