Subject: Maintenance Logs

I am starting a maintenance log.
Got a nice leatherbound travel journal that is the perfect size.

What I want to know is pen or pencil?
Pencil doesn't smear or bleed when wet.  Pen lasts longer I think.
Pencil can be erased though and never runs out of ink....

How many of you keep logs?
How detailed do you get?

Right now  I am looking at
Date Location Odo as my entry headings with details below.
