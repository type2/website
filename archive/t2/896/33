Subject: Re: [T2] Friday - your next camper?

I spent a couple of weeks in a nice place in Brooklyn a while back with  a great jazz drummer friend of mine.  He has a car that he parks  on the street.  He doesn't drive it much, only when he needs to go  to a gig that is nowhere near a subway or a train.  Or when he's  in a big hurry.  But he has to move the danged thing twice a week  so they can clean the streets.  
  
  We got out of it one night and he said not to lock it.  I'm like,  'Whoa, this is New York, man!'   He said that he never locks  the car.  If he does, somebody will smash a window trying to break  in.  He said he doesn't keep anything in the car that he wouldn't  mind having stolen.  Said one night he got in and it smelled like  crack and pu###.  I'm sure it did.  So if I ever move to New  York, you'll know I can afford a driver.  But ya gotta love the  place!  Cheers....KR



RX-2  thieves? You might have a vagrant break in and sleep in your car  especially if you left your bong on the seat but no one is going to  steal that car. :-)
