Subject: Re: [T2] Rocker arm studs and me :-(

I should add that it is a 2L FI T4....oh hell.  I just looked at
bently again.  18ftlbs is for single carb.

On dual and EFI its 10....crappola.   weird thing is the other nuts
were 18ftlbs on the other rockers and the wrench clicked on those just
fine.

one other thing that I remember, the nut never got tight against the
rocker arm assy.  Could I have just been driving the stud deeper
without stripping the threads?  Are they installed by  "bottoming out"
or to a specific torque would be my next set of questions.
