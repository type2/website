Subject: Steering Wheel Cover

I posted this on the Samba, but IMHO it's important enough to get out
there...

I found a molded steering wheel cover for $10 to fit our busses at a truck
stop in CO. 18" (they have 20" ones too that were only $8) and fits the 78
perfectly!

I've nearly bought that one online (what was it, $30? $40?) several times.
But I couldn't justify the money. But this one I found is way comfortable.
Made by "Ultimate Automotive".
