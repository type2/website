Nothing much to report. We didn't go to the Grand Canyon after discovering
they want $25 just to pull in. WTF?

Bus ran great, pulled 80mph on the flats easily. I know it's hard on it, but
I wanted time to see the Grand Canyon before dark. Sigh.

This was pretty funny though. A dragonfly tried to attack my windshield
wiper.
