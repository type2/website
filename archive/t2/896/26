Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust manifold nut questions answered, many thanks

Thanks for the very helpful replies and for the benefit of you fine  
folks and the archives, I submit what I learned.

Okay,

The exhaust manifold nuts are M8 1.25mm pitch, copper plated steel.   
These are one use only high temp lock nuts, used on exhaust systems  
frequently.

These were the type nuts originally on my muffler also.

Stainless steel should not be used in this application.  Stainless  
steel is not stable at high temps.  Monel or inconel may be okay, but  
the optimal choice is the copper plated steel nuts.

I will say that my heat exchangers came off really easy, I think due  
to the fact that these proper nuts were used.  I know that for sure  
they had not been removed in 6 years, maybe 35 years, who knows.  I  
have had nightmares thinking about what is involved to fix a broken  
exhaust stud, but that did not happen.  I think that one should  
always use these type nuts and avoid problems.

Here is a place where one can order these:  http://eagleday.com/

Many Thanks,

Bob H.
