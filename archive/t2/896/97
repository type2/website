That picture and one of the front of the bus is all over the place . Its  sad 
what is going on there not only to the poor defenseless VW's but mostly the  
innocent people. 
 I cringe every time I see a air cooled VW wasted. I even have a local  
salvage yard promised not to crush any of the VW's they have,( about 30 or more)  
until I can find room behind my shop for the ones that have lots of good parts. 
 there is a 59 bus that has had the nose skin removed but is very  restorable.
