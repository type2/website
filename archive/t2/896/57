Subject: Alt Belt Tension

Group,

 

I've got a '79 bus and just threw the alt fan belt.  As I'm putting on the
new belt, I'm trying to move the alt to tighten up the belt and can't figure
where to get some leverage.  I looked in Bentley and it just says to set
tension so there is 5/8" movement.  I'm having trouble moving the alt to get
it that tight.  What am I missing?

 

TIA
