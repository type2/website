Click type torque wrenches are notoriously inaccurate for the first 20% of their scale (0-20 ft lbs. on yours).

It's from the stud twisting. There should be no shavings. Have you cleaned out the hole to check out the threads as best you can see?

The M7 nuts have a 0.7mm thread pitch so they maybe hard to find. I bought some from Scott at Germany Supply a while back.

The torque on those rocker nuts is only 10-11 ft. lbs. The stud shouldn't move until much more torque (maybe 40 ft. lbs for that step stud size). If you got the stud to move at 18 ft. lbs (or there about) I think the hole could have been damaged from an earlier time. Or, your torque wrench may have put more into it.

The parts manual shows a threaded insert (311 101 167C) used on later models.

If the thread damage is mild you might have luck with blue loctite but I'd wait until other people weigh in with their opinions.

Since you probably don't have a tool for this you can trying using two nuts next to each other so they both turn with the stud. Removing the nuts and leaving the stud secure can be tricky.

Since the threads are damaged you can't torque it back to spec (whatever that is). Shoot for an 1/8th of a turn tight with the loctite. If you can't do that without stripping the hole more, you need to repair it properly.
