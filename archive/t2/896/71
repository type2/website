Just responding to the wet part of this thread.  Xerox makes a Never Tear
Paper - 3R3118 that you can write on, erase (if using pencil), print on
through printer.  It's very cool, somewhat expensive.  But if you have
something that you do not want to get wet, then this is it.  I suspect it
would also double as a good patch material to something that does not heat
up since it melts if heated.

Since I never intend for them to get wet, I use whatever is handy at the 
time to write with.

If you are worried about getting it wet, then use a real "old style" ball 
point pen...or one of the new fangled ones that they claim can't be 
"washed" off of checks when you write them.
