Bob,  you're a sorry son of a gun.  Nah, I've had vehicles that make me  sick to think about.  But a '60 23 window??  I'd be  suicidal.  Cheers...KR
    
  

my first bus a 60, 23window sunroof model I bought for $125 and drove for
several years, then sold it for $125  (if I had it today what would it be
worth???)
