Subject: Re: [T2] help with starter relay? (odd, see pics)

thanks, I went this morning to my local FLAPS and picked up a basic 30A 
lighting relay, but also ordered a Hella 40A for a backup just in case.

it looks like this may have been my starter problem, and nothing to do 
with the starter itself.

now to see if I can cancel my starter order in time.
