Subject: Trip away

> Dear Listees
>
> Have just returned from 3 1/2 weeks away in our 76 Poptop (wife, 12  
> yo son & me).
> We live in Hobart Tasmania so all long trips involve heading to the  
> Big Island (mainland Australia).
>
> We got the overnight ferry from Tasmania to Melbourne, Victoria,  
> disembarking at 07:15.  We traveled up thru Victoria into New South  
> Wales as far as Gilgandra before blowing a rear tire (cheap Chinese  
> "Woosung" brand that was on the bus when we brought it -- had too  
> much tread to throw away),  Wheel nuts so tight I split the socket  
> of the wheel brace (not original) so for the first time in my life  
> had to call for roadside assistance to change a tire.
> Still we managed over 900 kms for the day by 21;00.
>
> Picked up 2 x new tires in Coonabarabran (no-one had Hankooks so  
> had to settle for Sava [apparently made by Dunlop??] 185R/75's &  
> kept going.  At top of NSW is Moree where they have artesian bores  
> with naturally heated swimming pools, one is 38C, the other 42C.   
> Skin felt great when we got out & muscles relaxed.
>
> Left Moree & headed into Queensland via Goondiwindi finally  
> arriving at my wife's parents place at 23;30, a total of almost  
> 1900 kms in 2 days.
>
> Spent few days with 'outlaws' then down to Brisbane to catch up  
> with friends for a few days, down to Mount Tamborine behind the  
> Gold Coast, onto a 4 star resort at Yamba on the NSW coast for 3  
> days with our daughter, son-in-law & grandson.
>
> On to Coffs Harbour till end on the week, back over the Great  
> Dividing range to Tamworth, to Coonabarabran, back down the Newell  
> highway to Victorian border to Cobram where I grew up as a kid.   
> Caught up with a mate I have not seen for 35 years (scary how he's  
> aged!!!), over to Echuca to see the paddle steamers on the Murray  
> River, down to Melbourne to catch the ferry, then home to Hobart.
>
> Total trip 5,400 kms.  Av fuel consumption 25.5 mpg (imperial) at  
> mostly 100-105 kph.
> Bus did not miss a beat despite running at 3400 rpm for hours on  
> end on the open flat roads of NSW.
>
> Av fuel price was $1.45 per litre for 627 litres, total of  
> $910.00.  That plus the $730.00 ferry fare & only one night in a  
> caravan park ($20.00) made for a pretty reasonable vacation cost.
>
> Only problems from trip is a loud squeak from the front end which I  
> will have to investigate this weekend and the lack of other  
> busses.  Only saw 10 buses in all with only 2 of those actually  
> being driven.
