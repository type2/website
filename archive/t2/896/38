Subject: Re: [T2] Maintenance Logs

Zack,

I keep logs in all of my cars...one of those 3x5 sprial bound notebooks.

Since I never intend for them to get wet, I use whatever is handy at the 
time to write with.

If you are worried about getting it wet, then use a real "old style" ball 
point pen...or one of the new fangled ones that they claim can't be 
"washed" off of checks when you write them.

Very detailed...gas fill-ups, maintainence, new parts put on and 
occasionally, references to changes I make to try to get things running, 
better, cooler, etc.

Cheers, dave
