Hi Scott,

I like the quad-bike "lifeboat" concealed in the rear of the box. It  
kinda reminds me of the old "Thunderbirds" TV series.

For something so distinctive and different I am very surprised to see  
such a plain-vanilla paint scheme on it. Something in zebra stripes  
or screaming bright yellow would make more sense to me. YMMV.

If you hit the main page at http://www.unicat.net you will see that  
they offer a wide range of monster-RV truck products, but I think the  
unimog is one of the better offroad designs.

I bet they could be really popular with the film industry when  
shooting in remote areas.


Happy trails,
