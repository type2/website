Subject: Wedco CARB can/Super Siphon

Just ran across this looking for a spout for my old can...  Looks like
it's a helluva lot better than anything else "legally" available in CA.

There's some detail available further down the page on the spout.  Still
poor, but looks as if it MIGHT be a tad better than the cheepies.

They've got a combo deal...  I live in Oregon, they'll ship to me...
Anyone want to go in on a group buy?  All I really need is a new spout,
but those shiny new cans are looking mighty good...

And then combine 'em with the super siphon.  They've got a deal here...

Unbeatable combo!

I'll be at Burning Man - could deliver there.
