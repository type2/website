Subject: Re: [T2] Spare Coil - Good to have or don't leave home without

Hi Zach,

The coil used in the bus is one of the easiest parts possible to  
acquire at a local FLAPS. My experience with a failed coil has been  
that they tend to give a warning rather than fail outright.... it  
shouldn't be hard to source a replacement just about ANYPLACE if you  
need one.

Keeping $30 in your wallet in case of emergency makes more sense to  
me than carrying a spare coil.


Happy trails,
