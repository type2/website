Subject: Car Show this Saturday!

Howdy All,

If any of you listees are located in Colorado, there is a small car show
happening on Saturday. No entry fee, just show up an hour early and fill
out a form. It is to support my kid's school and is evidentially getting to
be a popular show since it is one of the "first" of the year.

I'll be bringing the shop's '68 Double Cab. Lets show some classic VWs to
the kids!!!

Woodrow Wilson Academy
8300 West 94th Ave.
Westminster, CO 80021

Saturday, March 17
10am - 2pm (car entries should arrive and register at least an hour early)
Coffee and Donuts served at 9:30am, Lunch at 11:30am
No Entry Fee but no awards either. A very laid back show.

Send me a p-mail and I'll email you an entry form. Entry forms need to be
in by Friday. I am more than willing to hand them in for anyone interested.

Hope to meet and see some Colorado folks!

Jon Stiles
