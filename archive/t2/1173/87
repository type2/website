Subject: re:Front Door panels late bay

I just made door panels for my '65 last year. It is tricky on a '65, I think
only one of the edges was straight, and if you want to hit the old holes on
the door with your new clips-it is quite difficult. 

 

I ended up using wellnuts, with nice looking screws, and finish washers. I
think this looks nice, and better than the clip style (for older VW's). The
older clips were always a pain in the ass for me, they never grabbed that
well, and if you ever had to open the door-a large percentage of the clips
would get bent, and not too easy to re-use. That is one of the reasons I
went with the screws and well-nuts.

 

If you do make your own, make sure you get the back very water proof! The PO
of my bus installed panels from WW, and didn't waterproof the back, they
didn't last long. I used Baltic birch for my panels, polyurethaned them, and
also attached some plastic sheeting. 

 

Was writ - "I was thinking about that ,, but trying to figure out how to
mount them to the door..."
