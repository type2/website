I have one of the Honda ES2000s and I absolutely love it.  It's expensive but
it's worth it.  You can literally stand right next to it and have a
conversation without raising your voice.  And it's solid as hell.  It's been
to Burning Man three times, and also has gotten me through a few other
festivals and camping trips and has never given me a problem.  If you treat it
well it's the last small generator you'll ever need to buy.

New, they cost 10 times the price of this one, but they put out twice the
power and are just head and shoulders above cheaper generators such as this
one.  A cheap generator is such an obnoxious whiny impact on a camp area that
you just won't want to use it, whereas a quiet one you can get away with
running without annoying yourself and all your neighbors.
