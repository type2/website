Subject: Re: [T2] top post mount vs side post mount battery 

Sure seems like side mount terminals would be better for the 2nd battery that
I have installed over on the driver's side cavity. I use battery boxes for
both, and those boxes would still need to have their covers on, or the boxes
fill up with rainwater.

It's just a geometry problem, not an electrical issue, except as it applies to
a possible ground short.
