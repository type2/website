the marker lights are connected to the tail light circuit... see answer 1

the brake light is a separate circuit..  see answer 2

both filaments are in the same lamp

assuming ALL grounds are good..

answer 1
-because the right tail and license lamp is working,, then the connections
at the right tail lamp to the marker lamp should be bad
-or at the marker lamp
or,, see the assumption above.... that all grounds are working!

answer 2

IF your LEFT brake lamp is working,, then the problem is:
-at the right brake light lampholder ..
probe test point 12 on the multipin test plug for brake light power

the physical wiring comes from the brake light switches ,, to the right
brake lamp , then to the left brake lamp... so if the left is working,, and
right is not... the problem has to be at the right connection to
lampholder..

again... see assumption above.. that all grounds are working!

hope that helps
Jamie
