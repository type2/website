Subject: Missing alternator cover

That's cheap money to keep as much dirt and grease out of areas where it
isn't suppose to be. It would be nice if someone would reproduce the cover
that fits over the generator/alternator. I have one, but the tab that fits
over a bolt broke off. It wasn't in the best shape to begin with.
