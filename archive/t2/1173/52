We're doing Boy Scouts too. Fun bunch. We do have some parents who can't 
get with the program. I walked out of the woods to get something from 
the car once and found two Dads and 1 mom all sitting in their SUVs with 
the engine running, a/c on talking on the phone and listening to 
whatever game or NASCAR race was playing that day... My eyes rolled... LOL!

Am anxious to get the bus to a campout just to show it off. Will still 
tent camp b/c that is the rule our troop lives by. No RVs. I have slept 
in my Brenderup 1205S. Cozy accommodations for two kids or one adult 
with room to rollover. I typically haul the troop's gear in that trailer.
