In my case, the steering gearbox replacement was my primary purpose
for the job. It was leaking fluid all over the place, and was worn to
the point where there was much steering slop.

Wish I had known you could work in there from the top. I tried, but I
never could figure out how to remove the circular piece at the base of
the steering column to get in there from the top. I had the steering
wheel off, and the steering column pulled up loose, but even after
removing the screws, I couldn't get that base piece off!
