Subject: Front Door panels late bay

I am going to need the front door panels for my camper... I had been
thinking of doing something custom with vinyl ... like plaid.

so.. either I need a pair of green stock door panels.. or something else.

I was thinking of cutting out some wood ones..

Then I noticed Busdepot has some... can anyone give me a report on what
these fit , look, wear like?
