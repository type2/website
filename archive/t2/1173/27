Subject: RE: [T2] right brake light troubleshooting 78 Westy

Start from the light and go backwards. Check to make sure there are no
broken wires as the wiring sometimes break or the connectors disintegrate
and fall off and sure the connections are clean and mechanically sound. Some
contact cleaner sprayed on the copper connection won't hurt either.

Owned by a '78 Champagne Edition Westy and a '73 SB Sunny
work great.  Thanks for any advice!
