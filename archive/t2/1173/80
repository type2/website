Subject: re: Battery Disconnect/jumper cable

snip>
for those who would like a DIY jumper cable arrangement, find yourself an
older UPS supply. they have a
very similar heavy duty DC disconnect (2 piece). hard wire one end to your
battery and the other end to
a set of jumper cables. no polarity issues on the battery end. FWIW

Hi Tom,
          Actually the battery disconnect in a UPS is usually made by the same
folks.  I have several scavenged from UPS on my shelf right now.  They are not
the 350 amp size, typically the 50 or sometimes the 120 amp size.  Good enough
in real life.

At ~ $30 for a 350 amp set including contacts I think it is good value.  As
you say always the correct polarity at your battery end.  The plugs are made
by Anderson, no, not that one. ;)

The MOST important thing when jumping is to not be in a rush.  Let the "dead"
battery in the disabled vehicle take a skin charge and the rig will start, and
continue to run, much easier. 5 or 10 min makes a huge difference. Call your
bro, roll another one, do your mascara, get the girl's number,.... whatever. 
Really hard to force hundreds of amps through the tiny contact areas on jumper
cable clamps, no matter how beefy the actual cables are.   Way easier to put a
quick "skin charge" on the "dead" battery and use the good connections from
there to the starter.  If it is just getting dusk, and the zombies are out,...
hood up, clip, start, unclip, slam, zoom.
