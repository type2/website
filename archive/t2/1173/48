I'll second or third or fourth the Honda inverter generators. I have a 
1000W version and it is really quiet. I especially like the automatic 
throttle back off at low loads.

I attend university engineering races several times per year and it's a 
whole weekend of Briggs&Stratton powered SAE Baja buggies and B&S 
powered generators. Sometimes you'll find that the guys are running a 
6000W generator to recharge their phones and cordless drills. I take 
this generator for the lights and the battery chargers and keep the big 
ginny off except when they want to run power tools.

My favorite solution was already mentioned - another battery and an 
inverter.

Last year when we took the kids to Cades Cove in the Smokies  we sat 
around the fire in the tent camping area and listened to the distant hum 
of the generators for the big RVs. No thanks... LOL! I'll do anything to 
camp without a noisy ginny. The best generators are the ones that run at 
the other end of a 50ft+ extension cord behind a building or other noise 
blocker.
