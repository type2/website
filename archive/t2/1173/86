Subject: Question about the heat riser elbows

So, I'm going to be switching over to the 72-74 heat exchangers sometime 
this millennium, and I wanted to know if the 72-74 heat risers that run 
from the heat exchanger to the heater control box are different than the 
risers on a 75-78 bus.  I just noticed that bus depot has them here:

but they're specific to the 72-74,79 models, so I just wanted to confirm 
the difference.  Do they attach to the engine differently because my 
75-78 risers mounts are sandwiched in and held in place by the tin 
screws that hold the upper tin to the lower tin - I'm wondering if this 
mounting is different.

thanks,
Mike
