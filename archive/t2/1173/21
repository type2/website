Subject: headlight assembly

Of which screws do you speak?

I have a couple of headlight buckets.  The adjusting screws are just fine.

Those little screws that hold the headlight bulb ring onto the bucket are a
PITA.  I think half of mine are stripped out (the phillips head part).

I also have some extra chrome trim rings.

I will be sending you the replacement vacuum booster hose once I get some
replacement clamps from Busted Bus.  One of my clamps underneath the bus was
rotten and broke.  You'll prolly have the same problem.
