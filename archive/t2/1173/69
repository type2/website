Subject: Re: [T2] 1971 steering box

I'm getting ready to ship some stuff to you.  I'll toss the spare steering
coupler I have in with it.  I would recommend getting the OEM coupler as any
of the aftermarket stuff is crap (in my opinion).  The one I'll send you is
aftermarket, so caveat emptor.  Included in the shipment is some brake booster
hose (not OEM, but it seems to work - I've only got about 50 miles on it, but
the new brake servo made a world of difference - both in engine performance
and braking power).  Also, there are a couple of clamps for the brake booster
hose.  When I was taking the old one off, one of the metal clamps broke.  I'll
send this out today.
