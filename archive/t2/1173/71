Subject: RE: [T2] battery disconnect

I used the Flaming River "Little Battery" disconnect. I got it via Amazon,
all the ones at my FLAPS seemed too flimsy.  I got the battery extension
cable from my FLAPS, and then wrapped the connection in that stretchy
silicone tape, so I don't accidentally hit it with a wrench.

What is the brand and what flaps did you get it at?
