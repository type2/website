Subject: Re: [T2] top post mount vs side post mount battery 

I think just to be stupid purists Kevin really.  Then the fact that I believe
(but certainly won't swear) that most sideposts have the terminals reversed
compared to a 41/42.  At least the common GM sidepost does.   That doesn't
stop me from having one in my '69 SC though.  Works just fine.  Personally
though as I've done a lot of jumping this year (when it gets below 0F I have
to jump my Bobcat to plow my drive) using one of two GM's to do so, I don't
like jumpers as much on sideposts.  Even with good cables that have the little
notch to grab the sidepost lug I find that they like to pop off.  I'm not sure
access would be much improved either as the cable ends have to be on real
square and vertical to hold on and there is less room to do that as compared
to a top post IMHO.
 
Still like I said, didn't keep me from using a spare
sidepost in the SC as it's factory cables were long gone, and I had the good
battery.  The main thing I like about sideposts is that over time I think the
terminal ends hold up much better as a gros generality.  And of course for
someone installing a real cool shutoff switch, would have been easier to wire
to.

Is there any reason we use top post battery mounts in our
VW's? Having had
to jump my bus and truck more than a couple times, from
either leaving it
sitting for a while, or leaving the radio on.or it just
being damn cold.I
think a side post battery mount would be much easier to
access. If/When I
have to replace my battery in the future, I was thinking I
might switch to
this style, but was wondering if there was a reason to not do
this.
