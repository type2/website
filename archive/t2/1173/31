Subject: re:Westie Bay "dummie" window

I think the window in my '65 kombi has a similar situation. The window is in
a closet. I made a curtain like the other windows on the bus. The problem
with this solution-the fabric is clearly showings the effects of UV
radiation.

 

Not sure of a better solution-maybe film on the glass to block uv?
