How about painting it.  I use to run a aquarium service company.  We would
paint the back of the aquariums for the background. It lasted very well,
even
with saltwater.  I had a customer once paint a design(backwards) first.  I
then came back a sprayed that whole side black.  Looked great.  We painted
all
the high end aquariums we installed black or blue.  You could do anything to
match your bus.

Just a thought.
