The rubber thing is called the steering coupler. I just replaced mine,
as well as the whole steering box.
I thought also that I saw a big crack in the steering coupler, but it
turned out that what I thought was a crack was a seam which is a valid
part of the coupler mounting assembly.
It wasn't too terrible of a job replacing the steering box and
coupler. If you loosen the steering box from the main chassis you may
be able to replace the coupler without having to remove the steering
gearbox, which means disconnecting the Pitman Arm on the front.

Hardest part was getting the horn spade connector back in to its
connection point WAY up in there. Ended out just cutting a small
access hole in the top and plugging it with a rubber plug afterward.
