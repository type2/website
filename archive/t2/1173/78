DO NOT DO THAT!!!  You will hurt your charging system if you run your 
engine without the battery connected.

Now, if you're jumping someone else's car without running your engine, 
you could do that, but why?  Having your engine running helps provide 
extra current and raises the voltage to help charge the other car's battery.
