Subject: Westie Bay "dummie" window

I am looking for ideas on what to do with the treatment for the window that
is behind the cabinet on the rear passenger side of our vehicles.  I know
the factory solution was to use the same fabric as the curtains but I am
looking to do something a little more creative and the UV light breaks down
that exposed panel pretty quickly.

 

Thanks for any ideas.
