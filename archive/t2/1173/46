Yamaha EF1000is is very quiet and light-we have one-bought for business 
power failure backup for computers. It is an inverter generator that 
runs at lower rpms when load is light, as I believe does the Honda. They 
are ~$800  I would check if the cheapie Harbor Freight puts out a full 
sine wave to run all electronics.
