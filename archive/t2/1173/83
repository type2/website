Though I
think you could find something beige/brown if you like in plastic "christmas
tree" style.  I've had a friend do this before in an early bay with all the
birch ply anyway, and it looked quite nice.  But defintely a lot of wood,
nautical looking.  And cutting out the fronts and cleanly drilling all the
mount holes was not easy he said.  I'm not knocking getting the blanks from
Ron, but the birch could end up being a finished product.
