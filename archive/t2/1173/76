Subject: Battery Disconnect/jumper cable

for those who would like a DIY jumper cable arrangement, find yourself an
older UPS supply. they have a
very similar heavy duty DC disconnect (2 piece). hard wire one end to your
battery and the other end to
a set of jumper cables. no polarity issues on the battery end. FWIW
