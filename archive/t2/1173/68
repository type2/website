A bit scary that Airhead lists this as OE German "reproduction."  If it is OE
German why the "repro" bit?  I get they ain't NOS German, but if it is OE
quality I'd like to know as these have notoriously been crap for a long time,
and the word reproduction seems uneccesary and perhaps worrisome.  I have just
one NOS German from the dealer left out of a group of 4 that  I bought 15
years ago now and am in need of two but have been loathe to buy from
stories of failure.
 
Perhaps Jim , Ron, or somebody will know the source and
quality and can comment.  The price should certainly indicate a OE quality
part.
