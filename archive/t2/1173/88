Mike -

Yes, the 72-74/79 are different from 75-78 models

75-78
021 256 051 C  Left
021 256 052 C  Right

72-74 & 1979
071 256 051  Left
071 256 052  Right

(Source: ETKA 5.6 - no longer shown in ETKA 7 now.  That's why I keep
the earlier version [shows more older numbers] installed on my machine
along with the latest.)

I've checked thru the expanded used inventory at Airhead and
unfortunately they do not have any right now.  Time to hit a boneyard,
Maybe Russ' Recycling up in Duarte/Irwindale area (Area Code 626).
Sorry, don't have their number handy :(
