Subject: Re: [T2] headlight assembly-self tapping Roberts head

The original size of the metric threaded ring assembly screws is probably 4mm,
but I replace them with self tapping machine screws, (pardon to all the
purists; I know I'm going to VW hell )  :-) I'm going to make an educated
guesstimate and say it's a #4 self tapping screw of the appropriate length,
because it uses a 3/32" pilot hole, which is just under an 1/8". Not that easy
to find in roberts head config. Check it out at Home Depot and get a visual.
It MIGHT be as big as a #6, but doubt it.
HTH,
Courtney
