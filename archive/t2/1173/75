Try the Blue Sea one.  Better protection for the terminals IMHO.

or this one if you run two batteries and want to keep a manual, instead of
electronic,  switch in the system.

The tiny wires used in the typical second battery charging add-on kits (from
the usual vendors) will neither charge the house battery properly, nor allow
use of the house battery to help start the rig.

Side terminal batteries seem to be as reliable as top post.  No reason in a
bay not to do it. Not so much fun in a vanagon.

I'm going to put something like this in my van to make jumping other vehicles
easier.  Be a good addition if one went to side terminals, which I find are
harder to get a good grip on using clamps.  You can build your own (using
exactly the same components) for substantially less than the retail price.

For some rec-time reading on batteries, charging voltages, and wire size.
