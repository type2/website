Subject: Re: [T2] buy generator for my bus

I think this is a very important point.  Generators can be pretty annoying,
and a cheap 2-cylce is going to make for some unhappy neighbors, even if
you run it for only and hour or two a day. This would appear to go against
the ethos of camping in general and VW camping specifically.

My friend has a Honda 2000 and it is amazingly quiet.  You probably will
not make many enemies with one at a campsite if used judiciously,
specifically outside of sleeping and meal times.

But, they are not cheap.
