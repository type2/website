There is a plastic "gasket" at the base of the column that snaps together so
the column doesn't ground out where it goes through the floor and make the
horn be on all the time. It's right in your Bentley manual. I understand why
you were changing it the way you were, since you were replacing the steering
box anyway, but if you aren't replacing the box there's no reason to touch it.
Much easier from the top.

In my case, the steering
gearbox replacement was my primary purpose
for the job. It was leaking fluid
all over the place, and was worn to
the point where there was much steering
slop.

Wish I had known you could work in there from the top. I tried, but I
never could figure out how to remove the circular piece at the base of
the
steering column to get in there from the top. I had the steering
wheel off,
and the steering column pulled up loose, but even after
removing the screws, I
couldn't get that base piece off!
