Subject: Re: [T2] buy generator for my bus

well,, a 2 stroke at 3600 rpm is going to be like a weed eater wipper
snipper annoying!
lol

but for $89 !!!   not even worth tuning mine up!

If I was a camper beside you,, I 'd hate you with that generator!
see if you can find a deal on a whisper quiet invertor generator,, like
honda or yamaha.
