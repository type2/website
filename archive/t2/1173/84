over 200 trees over 8inch in diameter came down within the Camporee 
campsite area.
   a lot of really strange things happened some snippets
. remember seeing my SPL snag a flying tenderfoot miniscout right out of 
the air
. my canoe which was behind the tent was found in a tree, undamaged.
. a pie sitting in my tent survived untouched even though the tent was 
trashed
. a fully assembled trail chef about 4 inches high. hit perfectly square 
on by a tree.

looking back on some photos of our campsite I took the next day it is an 
act of god that all of my troop escaped unharmed. in fact except for the 
one scout who was pulling the pole on his tent that got killed no one got 
more than some scratches and bruises, and this we were told later was a 
rather small tornado.  I don't want to ever experience a large one.

there was absolutely no warning I was in my tent changing for the 
campfire that evening when all hell broke loose so I was actually in my 
full class A uniform when it hit.  kids were changing and cleaning up from 
evening meal.

talk about luck in my case, the campfire was going to be held on the beach 
and I was going to paddle my canoe from around the point with a scout 
bringing a torch with the fire.  we had just come in off the river 
practicing the timing etc when it  hit and some thought we were still out 
there since couldn't see us.

many many great experiences over the years but some you would pass on if 
you could.

happy scouting

Bob
