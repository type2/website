Subject: Re: [T2] buy generator for my bus-use of coach batteries

It's heresy, but we bought a Roadtrek van camper with only 65K miles for 
$10k, to go for more reliable/faster distance and mountanous travel. Our 
readtrek has a Onan 2800 watt generator, very compact (16 x20 x12"), not 
too noisy, byt thet cost over 2 grand.  We still will go to local VW 
events in the Westphalia.  I'm on the Roadtrek yahoo  discussion group; 
for non-hookup camping it is very common to use a double "coach battery" 
of 2 6v golf cart batteries in series- these things are very sturdy 
deep discharge batteries.  Seeing how it takes very thick wiring to 
charge these quickly enough, I though about the relay and thin wiring 
Bus Depot sells for isolating a deep discharge battery- yes it works, 
but it will take a long time to recharge, so if you only drive a few 
hours, it may go below the 12.2v 50% discharged one should not go below 
when you park and use it again.  Battery isolators used in Roadtreks 
take like 100 amps.

A very good site discussing solar and charging of batteries.  Good 
discussion of inverter/chargers- if you use an inverter, remember to 
keep it as close to the battery as possible and then run an extension 
off the outlet.  Voltage drop is significant if you don't.
