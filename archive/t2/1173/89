John -

I maintain the inventory database at Airhead.  The reason why I
designated it as Repro with an additional description of "OE German"
is this:  VW has long since obsoleted and sold the ownership rights of
the tooling.  They are manufactured by Lemforder (sp?) for the person
I get them from in Germany (who now owns the tooling).  Even though
they are the same German made piece (without the VW logo of course,
don't wanna get involved with trademark issues), they are the same
robust coupler that VW dealers supplied, but Airhead can't really call
them "Genuine VW" or "OE German" on it's own.  When list members
posted about their disappointment with the aftermarket repro, I made a
concerted effort to locate the original and now Airhead (and I believe
Bus Depot as well) carries them.

Chris Slaymaker was kind enough to send me one of the aftermarket
couplers and it was indeed pretty soft and flexible....a lot more than
it should be.  I forwarded it (and a Lemforder) to the guy who makes
them and he agreed somewhere along the way his manufacturer changed
the compound of the coupler without his knowledge.  He has since
changed manufacturers and I have had his latest repro on a friend's 71
Panel for about 5 or 6 months now without any of the "twisting"
issues.

But Airhead will continue to carry the German one for those
discriminating customers :)
