oh buses are the troop trucks, the number of backpacks that a bus can hold 
is legendary.

one trip some years ago at a camporee we got hit by a toranado, was one 
of the worst experiences of my life, one kid was killed in a friends 
troop, the kid was in the right place, doing the right thing, but the 
treee was there too.

but the bus part, the kids never went back into the campground from the 
safe shelter of a concrete basement under a beach house. was a waterfront 
camporee beautiful location. but I digress.

I took my bus and opened the sun roof and put an entire troops (about 
35kids) gear into that bus... tents' presonal gear the whole thing.. and 
took it back to the church the next day.  pulled up and water is running 
out of the door. they opened the side door and dang near got buried in the 
avalance.

we all went to the scouts funeral a couple days later he was laid out in 
his uniform, with his freshly earned but not yet awarded 2nd class emblem 
sewn on.  every troop there was given a black ribbon with gold script for 
their troop flags and as far as I know it is still there.

took my bus to the Jamboree two years ago, was on staff, had a great time.

be prepared 
Bob
