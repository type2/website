Did you try PB Blaster?  That stuff is golden for getting stuck fasteners
loose and I've spent a lot of time in Ohio junkyards tearing apart rusted
Rabbits.  Once it even got some rusted brackets bolts loose on the
undercarriage of a rotted out Mk3 Jetta.  

I've tried Silikroil and Aerokroil and all the rest, and nothing beats good
old PB Blaster. If that doesn't do it, I don't have a Plan B.

Trying to reconstruct the 71 camper. All the little screws in the assembly
are rusted and frozen ( and I have 2 sets). They look too small to drill
without destroying them . Anyone have ideas or have some rust free
available?
