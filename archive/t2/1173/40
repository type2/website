Subject: RE: [T2] heat exchanger to cylinder head stud

Thanks to all, I now have some studs in hand.  I used plural because I have
discovered one other stud was not threaded far enough to allow the nut to
bottom out on the manifold so it jammed on the stud.  When I loosened the
nut, it backed the stud out of the head.  No biggie, the threads are good,
but I needed two and got two.

My question is about using Loctite to keep the studs in the head.  I have
bottles of blue and red, I never use the red unless...well, I can't remember
ever using it.  So the heat of this application is high enough that Loctite
will not have any effect?  Just double nut the stud's outer threads and
thread the stud in there dry?

TIA for the input!

Joe

Joe,

I can probably scare up a used one to mail.  I think they had gotten scarce
actually a bit ago, they used to be just $3-4 each or so.  They are M8/M9,
so I doubt actually that your "screw is loose" just more likely you are
putting an M8 in there and it is loose because it is in an M9 hole, locktite
wouldn't last in the heat of this application,
