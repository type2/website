Subject: Testing switches out of Bus?

Can someone give a run down, or point to a site, om how to test switches
not installed using a voltmeter?  For the life of me I can't remember. I
tried searching using test AND switches and get nothing.  Have a few Split
Bus headlight and wiper switches I want to check out.
