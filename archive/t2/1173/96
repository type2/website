Thanks Chris,

The battery on the beetle has been going dead the last day or so. This is
after I replaced the wiper motor and speedometer. I've had hints that the
voltage regulator had been going as the idiot light flickers when the engine
is at idle. I'll have to put the battery on a battery charger and fire up
the engine to check the voltage coming from the regulator.

I was trying to check the amperage but could not remember how to do that.
The meter pegs out to the right no matter what setting I use. I'm using a
rat shack multimeter.

Should mean 45 volts on that scale.
Is the needle near the right hand side of the dial? Or the left hand 
side. Right side is high, left side is low.
