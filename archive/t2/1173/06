If all you're looking for is bushings, go to their companion site:

http://prothane.com/

You can download or order a catalog from the site and they have a
dealer list/links as well.

Dee Engineering hasn't really kept their regular website updated, so
their links their (and BugPack's) are essentially useless.  Looks like
they are making their money on the bushing business and treating the
VW biz as an after thought these days.
