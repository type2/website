Subject: right brake light troubleshooting 78 Westy

This is my first question to the group and I've looked through the archives
in hopes of not bothering anyone.  I recently acquired a 78 Westfalia and
all lights appear to work fine except for the right brake bulb.  The marker
and brake light (both on the same dual filament bulb) will not come on and
I've verified that no voltage is coming with a multimeter.  I'm doing ok
with the wiring diagrams in Bently but could use some advice on where to
start for troubleshooting.  This far, I've only verified that the fuses age
good and that there is no voltage at the spade connector to ground for
either of the leads.  Ground is good as the reverse and turn signal lights
work great.  Thanks for any advice!
