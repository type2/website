Jamie, I'd say for very near that money, you might be able (depening where you
are) to find 2, 5x5 sheets of 3mm baltic birch for about that.  I think there
is even exterior grade glue 4x8' sheets now, but I'm not sure if that comes in
3mm.  That way you could make em, varnish them, keep em as is if you like the
look, cover em if not and the varnish will only help you (I'd reverse the
varnish to the outside then if you cover them.)
 
I of course couldn't find it
in AK, unless one of the aircraft places carries it, but I'd hate to know the
price up here.  Online shows $30 a sheet or so in more enlightened locations.
