Subject: Re: [T2] 15" Wheels in front, 14" in Rear

Bear in mind, I have to drive 70 miles from Charleston to Myrtle Beach 
to take advantage of this...but well worth it!

Actually...it took him physically inspecting the wheels and me noticing 
the tire size to put two and two together regarding the difference in 
size.

Whacky. It was really hard to tell, save for the fact the fronts are 
painted black, and the rears are painted cream. Looks can be deceiving.

As for his lift...he is a car collector, and the former (retired now) 
owner of Myrtle Beach Harley Davidson. He earned his lift the old 
fashioned way. Sure made our lives easier today, though.
