volks,

ive got a 74 westy that is back on the road for about a week with a brand
new rebuilt engine. since its been rolling  again i have noticed its been
leaking a tad bit of tranny fluid in the center in front of the drain
plug. starting yesterday it became difficult to get the bus in second or
third gear. when the engine is off it shifts through all the gears just
fine. however, once i start it up shifting becomes difficult. there is
about an inch of free play with the clutch pedal (the clutch is brand
new). i think it is possible that the clutch is not fully disengaging the
engine from the tranny. anyone have any ideas about whats going on or how
to fix it. any help is appreciated.
thanks,

74 westy in OR
