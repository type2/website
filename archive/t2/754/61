Subject: Re: [T2] Valve adjustment Q

----- Original Message ----- 
From Charles Lucas:

So, I'm performing my first valve adjustment ('76 Westy, FI, 2.0L),
 running off Muir and double-checking against Bentley.  Got through the
 cylinder #1, intake and exhaust were almost right on, maybe a hair
 loose, so I tightened them up a tad.

 Turned the engine and checked the distributor position for #2.  When I
 pushed down on the rockers for #2 though, the valves were *way* loose.
 I bet I could've fit my screwdriver tip through there if I could get the
 right angle.  Went back and checked my engine/distributor setup again,
 and again, checked against a couple web sites, all good.

 I tightened the #2 valves way down to .006, but in order to get there
 the adjustment screw on the exhaust valve is now basically flush with
 the lock nut.  Technically I guess that's within reason, but it makes me
 nervous having the screw tightened down that much.  Just wanted to check
 with everyone and see if there's anything else I should check or be
 worried about before putting the valve cover back on.  What do you do if
 the adjuster screw sinks below the lock nut?  Replace the rocker?

 Is it possible to push down on the bottom of the rocker too hard, so
 that the clearance is greater than it would be during normal operation?

 Also, what's up with this page
 (http://www.vwtrendsweb.com/tech/0106vwt_valve/)?  It says that the
 intake valve for cylinder 2 should match up with the valves from
 cylinder 1 (in a 3/1 pattern), which contradicts everything else I've read.

I can see why you are confused..... so am I!!!
Maybe this is why VWTrends is kaput?

Here is what it says [3rd paragraph down, left side]:
" Turn the crankshaft 360 degrees and you will again be at TDC with the distributor rotor pointing the other 
way (toward the number one plug wire). When the motor is at TDC for cylinder one, the right three valves on 
the right side of the engine (see arrows) will be ready to adjust."

That would be #1 I and E and #2 I........

Now the next pic says [4th paragraph down left side]:
"At TDC for cylinder one, the single rightmost valve on the left side of the engine (see the arrows) will be 
ready to adjust."

That would be #4 E.

Wait a minute, the paragraph above this one says you will be at TDC #1 and the 2nd paragraph says you will be 
at TDC #1....... huh?!?

This is why I always say to use a remote starter button and adjust each pair of rockers as they open and 
close.

Turn the engine in the direction of rotation and watch any pair of rockers. When the exhaust JUST starts to 
move open, STOP, and adjust the intake.
Rotate engine, exhaust opens and closes, intake opens and closes. When the intake JUST closes, STOP, and 
adjust the exhaust. Simple as that.
Exhaust just starts to open, adjust that cylinders intake.
Intake just closes, adjust that cylinders exhaust.

You don't need to climb up and down trying to figure where you got the rotor pointed [which may be in wrong 
anyway].
