Subject: 78 Bay Drum Brake Q?

Ok ..

I did my 78 Transporter Rear brakes mostly because the e-brake was
not working.  from CIP I purchased the hardware kit, shoes and new
e-brake cables.

got everything apart and the existing shoes are fine.  plenty of life
left so being Mr. Frugal I put them back in.  I put in the new
e-brake cables, and cleaned and oiled all of the moving parts,
adjusters and all.

Now, the e-brake works great but the rear brakes dont seem to be
stopping.  I've done the shoe adjustment snug into the drum to the
point where I cant turn the wheels by hand while on a jack.

The problem is however that I dont have much pedal and the rear
brakes dont seem to be working well at all.  If I put the e-brake on
a few clicks I get tons of pedal and I can really feel the rear
brakes well.

Suggestions and a photo of the assembled product would be greatly
appreciated.  I'll be doing them again (the 4th time) this week.

Thanks to all,

David.
