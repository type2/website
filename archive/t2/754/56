Subject: 79 pop top canvas -free

*****just trying to give back ot the list*****

I have a used original Westy PopTop Canvas that I just
took off my 79 Westy that is in good condition except
for broken zippers that I will send to a needy listee
in need for actual shipping cost.
You could repair the zippers without much trouble now
that it is off the bus.

Contact me off list if you could use it.
