I can't improve on the archive explanation, but I would expect brand-new
CV joints to be very tight, since they are treated with moly.

Just keep at it and you'll get it together.  If all else fails, give
it to a 12-year-old and tell him/her it's a puzzle!

One caution:  There are two ways to assemble the joints, one correct where
the central hub swivels and one incorrect where the hub does not swivel.
If you get the latter, take the CV apart, rotate the hub 180 degrees, and
reassemble.
