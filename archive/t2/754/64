Kill the rust or it will come back. You can remove it by sand blasting it, wire brushing it, naval jellying it, and then top coat it with a rust converter. I have used the water based converters (brush on only as the spray versions are JUNK in my experience), and friends have recommended POR-15. Then and only then would I top coat it with paint. I generally do not use undercoating as I have seen large rust problems hidden by a think layer of that stuff. 

I would also consider Rhino-liner type paint as well. 

Just Nickel's worth.
