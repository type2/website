Subject: RE: Silly lock question

Be aware that most of the replacement handles offered now use the AN/AH 
keyway that is used on most of the Mexican and Brazillian cars.  It is not 
compatible with the correct L keyway that the rest of your bus uses.  They 
could be keyed to match each other, however.  The rest of the information 
you've been given is substantially correct.  We do stock the correct wafers 
to rekey the locks with either the L or AN/AH keyways.
