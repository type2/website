Subject: Cooling a Type 1 (1641cc) Engine in a '73 Westy

Hey,
I have '73 Westy with a Dual Port 1641cc engine with header exhaust
without heater boxes and no main engine bay cover tin. I noticed last
weekend that after 1 hour the engine would not start unless I let the
engine cool for 10 minutes. I any looking for cheap or free ways to
correct the overheating problem. Thanks.
