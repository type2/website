What I was asking is do I disassemble the rear portions of the vehicle in order to get to the rusty surfaces of do I spraysomething in there to rust prevent and leave the rear panels on the vehicle.  If I need to disassemble the rear panels how do I do this?

There's no way of disassembling that area without something like a sawzall or a metal cutting disc.  Please, don't do that!

If you've got long skinny arms, I'd imagine that you could reach up there from underneath with a sanding block, but it would take
quite a bit of contortionism to pull off.  Failing that, I'd look into soda-blasting or media-blasting (but not SAND-blasting!)
