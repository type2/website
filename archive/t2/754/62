Did you rotate the engine counterclockwise? 

Are you adjusting based on the direction the rotor is pointing or based on the crank pulley? 

Use the crank pulley. 

In theory someone could have installed the distributor drive in the wrong orientation and then rotated the distributor beynd what the books show to make it work right.
