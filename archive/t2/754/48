does this engine have the late bay tin? or is it simply a std 1641
that has been bolted up to a 73? If you don't have the correct tin,
I'm surprised you can really drive it for an hour without any other
major problems other than hard start. You can try to get some sheet
metal ducting from a local how-to place, and screw them to the engine
bay and tin to try and make up the space. Getting the engine bay area
and outside area seperated goes a long way towards cooling things
down.
