I agree sounds like you might have knocked something loose,  I would check
the AFM plug, it is on the back of the air intake just to the left of the
air cleaner.  if that plug comes loose or out it can act just like you
mention.   other things that can have that effect are

bad or unplugged temp sensor II  (screwed into head by cyl #3)

also any leak in the vacuum hose system will FUBAR the operation of the
the engine....so check those hoses....

good luck
Bob
