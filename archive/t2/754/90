Good to know I got the right stuff the first time by chance! <grin!> 

<Specifically Yamabond-4 #908-90051-43-00

Regular Yamabond IIRC is simply 3M's 3Bond which is a superglue.>

On a side note those female terminals worked perfectly Richard! Now if only the BD ignition switch was worth a damn... <grin!> 

I'll figure something out.
