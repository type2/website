Hi Don,

You just had your carb out. I had a similar experience this winter
that knocked one of the plugs off the back of the left carb. It spat
onto the foam compartment seal and there it stayed. When I found it, I
put it back in with carb sealer (permatex motorcycle type) and it ran
great afterwards.
