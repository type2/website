Chris,

Agreed

This is exactly how i adjusted them.

>Also did you open the hydraulic system? Have you bled the brakes?

yes, and yes.  I did rebuild the cylinders as well, and bled the
entire system completely.

It's a different set up than Im used to seeing.  There are several of
the "usual" components missing.  Well, maybe not missing, but not
there.  Like the pins that come thru the backing plate and then thru
the brake shoe with the round clip/washer and spring.  There is also
no ebrake adjuster on the stars.

Im pretty good with brake systems, this one is just boggleing me a
bit.  I'm a bit afraid that it may not have been assembled properly
at some point, and I just put it back the way that it was.  Hence the
picture of one installed correctly.

Thanks again,

David.
