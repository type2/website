Bart,

You can train with the old CV. It will have more slack than the new
one and be easier to put back together. Bentley shows how to do it.

If the new one came apart, there is a way to reassemble it, clean it
real well and play with it in front of TV, or in bed :-)

There are 6 balls, and each may need to go in it's own grove. That is
6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720 combinations. Out of these, I'm sure there is more
than one that works.

I have used duct tape to avoid loosing the stuff while greasing. Good luck
