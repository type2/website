Take your new locks and your other key to locksmith and tell them you
want the new locks rekeyed to fit the other key. My locksmith charges
me $20.

 I just received 2 new handles and locks for the 70, and much to my dismay
 they require 2 different keys.  If I was to put them on I would need 3
 different keys just for the doors.  Seems there is a black hole when it
 comes to locks for a 70.  How do I get just one key to work on all 3?
