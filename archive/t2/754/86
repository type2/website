Cool stuff - I found a good motivation for air-cooled engine in there

7.70   Cooling System Expedients

IF THERE IS NO WATER available, almost any thin liquid can be used in the
radiator in an emergency. Probably the most common substitute is urine,
although flat beer or soft drinks are also useful. No gasoline or oil
should ever
be put in the radiator. The entire cooling system, including the engine blo=
ck,
should be well flushed as soon as possible.
