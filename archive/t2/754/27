Thanks for all the comments......

I think it is best to go for the Eberspacher heater? It seems to me
that it will work simply and doesn't have all the hastle of the
exchangers, fans, ducting etc.

I would love to get the stock heating working, it would be a challenge
to get it all insulated etc but I think that I would have to check any
gaps/leaks after every engine drop.

Can anyone advise on any general maintenance required for the heater?

I have seen an ad on the Samba.com, has anyone had any dealings with
this person/company?

Lowered heater box output temps significantly and thus the interior temps.
