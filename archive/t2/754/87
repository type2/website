Hello  Bart

As Arnaud said to you, the best way  is to play a liitle with them before 
the final assembly.
Yes there is a pattern in both the outer and the inner race, take your time 
to observed them and figure how they work, when you assabled them, the 
widest sepparation in the outer race must be alingned with the thiniest part 
of the  inner one, and yes they are very very thigth when new, but if you 
can move them at least a little after assembled you are in the rigth path.

Good look


Roberto
