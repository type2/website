Subject: Rust in rear vent wells

Hi All,

I am new to the list and have a question.  I have a 77 bus that I am restoring.  How do I handle the surface rust that is in the vent wells that lead to the engine compartment on the left and right rear of the vehicle?  Is it best to remove them?  If that is the case how do I do this?  One person I talked to said to just spray the paint in with a long extension on the paint gun.  Something about that sounds bad.  The rust has to be taken care of or it will raise its head up to the surface one way or the other, right?  Any information that any one has would be greatly appreciated.

James
