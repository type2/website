In my garage I have my project bus, the body work ie: dog legs, sills, door tracks, front jack points, rear quarter panels, corner panels and and that piece that runs between the corner panels were all replaced with new panels. There is a beautiful pumpkin orange paint job on the outside. The pop top was painted gloss white as well. I had the axle beam replaced  a few years ago and it hasn't seen much mileage since. A new pop-top canvas is included but not installed.  I am looking to get $3,000.00 for him. any one interested, the vehicle is located in the Augusta, Maine area
