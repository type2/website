Hi,

Thanks for the diagram links. I will be using that resource again !

I think I have many bits missing  .......... On diagram :

I have 5(10A) but everything else is missing !

Could anyone advise on where to get such bits.......Also could someone
give me a knee bone connected to thigh bone list for the right hand
side of the diagram bar the air filter (possibly the use of the parts
aswell)? I know I am asking a lot .......

yours

Charles
