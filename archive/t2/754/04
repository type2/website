Subject: Re: [T2] Silly lock question

From Nik Wiman:

I just received 2 new handles and locks for the 70, and much to my dismay
they require 2 different keys.  If I was to put them on I would need 3
different keys just for the doors.  Seems there is a black hole when it
comes to locks for a 70.  How do I get just one key to work on all 3?

NOT a silly lock question.

1) Different as in the key goes in one handle and turns the lock but goes in the other handle and does not 
turn the lock?
The key words in this question are "goes in the other handle".

2) Different as in the key goes in one handle and turns the lock but DOES NOT go in the other handle?
The key words in this question are "DOES NOT go in the other handle".

3) Does your ignition key GO INTO either handle?

The reason for these questions:  Your 1970 bus uses L code tumblers, same as 67 to 70 buses. BUT only the 69 
and 70 bus used L code lever action door handle tumblers. 71 to 79 buses used R code tumblers. You cannot 
insert a L code blank into a R code tumbler. If you have 2 R code door tumblers, then yes, you can get a 
locksmith to recode them both to one R key. But he cannot code them to your L code ignition key. To do this, 
you need 2 L code door tumblers to replace the R code tumblers. But keep in mind, these are 2 year-only 
tumblers. Good luck. I have not been saving 69/70 handles..... sorry, I did not forsee this coming up. What 
happened to your original handles?
