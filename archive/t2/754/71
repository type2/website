<yes, and yes.  I did rebuild the cylinders as well, and bled the
entire system completely.>

Okay, I'd re-bleed the system soon. I always seem to get a bubble more after a drive or two. 

<It's a different set up than Im used to seeing.  There are several of
the "usual" components missing.  Well, maybe not missing, but not
there.  Like the pins that come thru the backing plate and then thru
the brake shoe with the round clip/washer and spring.  There is also
no ebrake adjuster on the stars.>

Okay things are missing that you've seen on other cars or things missing from your reference picture in your Bentley manual? As I recall there are supposed to be pins but it has been a while since I've seen rear brakes on a VW bus (mine hasn't racked up many miles in the past few years. Actually it hasn't racked up ANY miles in the past few years.... <grin!>). True that there are not any automatic adjusters on the rear brakes so if you are used to seeing the rear brakes of say a Mustang, then yeah, it'll be different. Check out the book and then tell me if anything is missing. 

Re-adjust those rear brakes with the e-brake slack and then adjust the e-brake too afterwards. I'm jealous, I've got to re-build my whole system yet and you're almost done... <grin!>
