Subject: Remove rear wells clarification

I guess I was not clear on my last posting.  The hints you have given me thus far seem very good.  What I was asking is do I disassemble the rear portions of the vehicle in order to get to the rusty surfaces of do I spray something in there to rust prevent and leave the rear panels on the vehicle.  If I need to disassemble the rear panels how do I do this?
