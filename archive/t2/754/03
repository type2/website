Subject: Broken Dipstick Shenanigans

Greetings-

I went to check my oil the other day and when I pulled the dipstick out 
I was left standing with only the handle. I think I stared at the other 
piece on the concrete for about twenty minutes and contemplated if this 
has ever happened to another human before. Cars began to pile up behind 
me at the gas station and honk. So far, dipstick failure is on the top 
of my list of stupid, stupid breakdowns.

Anyway, it broke right below the rubber grommet. I thought at first 
that it broke clean, like if you take a piece of metal and bend it back 
and forth until it breaks. Now I'm thinking that the dipstick was 
actually two pieces of metal with a weld or something holding them 
together. I'm assuming that this part is NLA, 'cause that's what every 
shop has told me. And I'll be darned, I never took the time to get to 
know my dipstick before she broke. I always thought she would just be 
there. Not having a dipstick is not fun.

If anyone has an aircooled vanagon, I would appreciate it if you would 
eyeball it for me and tell me if it is one piece of metal or two with 
an overlap. A measurement in centimeters from the sealing end of the 
grommet (the spot where it hits the metal tube on the motor) down to 
the tip would be huge, too.

Also, I want to make sure this can be repaired without the risk of 
having a piece of weld fall into the motor, or something else 
catastrophic, etc, etc...

I hope everyone has enjoyed their weekend.

Herb.
