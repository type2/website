Subject: RE: [T2] Rust in rear vent wells

If it truly is surface rust hit it with POR-15 metal prep.  You'll see a lot
of it dissolve and you can wipe it off.  Then hit it with POR-15 rust
preventative paint.  However if there are bubbles it may go deeper than
surface in which case POR-15 cannot kill it.  It will rust through
eventually.  Search the type 2 archives for POR-15/rust, there is a TON of
stuff on its merits, problems etc. If you wish to paint over the POR-15 you
can but I think you need a special primer also from POR before you can
paint.  
Good luck, Nik
