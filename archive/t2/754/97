Hi

After reading your last post, I realized the same thing happen to me last
year. The problem was cause by the park brake adjustment being to tight.
Make sure that the park brake is completely release, and that the park break
adjustment are completely loosened before you adjust the rear break lining.
( Take the drum of and make sure the park break lever is releasing
completely ).
