Peen (sp?) it in - i.e. put it in and take a punch or a nail to the aluminum
around it. This is a good idea to do on all brass fitting on the carbs -
especially the fuel line connections. I have also used some kind of loctite
with good results. I am not sure that silicone will do the job in thelong
run.

BTW, I lost a '65 Sundial once to an engine fire most likely caused by the
brass fuel line fitting coming lose.
