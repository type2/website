Subject: Valve adjustment Q

Hey all,

So, I'm performing my first valve adjustment ('76 Westy, FI, 2.0L), 
running off Muir and double-checking against Bentley.  Got through the 
cylinder #1, intake and exhaust were almost right on, maybe a hair 
loose, so I tightened them up a tad.

Turned the engine and checked the distributor position for #2.  When I 
pushed down on the rockers for #2 though, the valves were *way* loose. 
I bet I could've fit my screwdriver tip through there if I could get the 
right angle.  Went back and checked my engine/distributor setup again, 
and again, checked against a couple web sites, all good.

I tightened the #2 valves way down to .006, but in order to get there 
the adjustment screw on the exhaust valve is now basically flush with 
the lock nut.  Technically I guess that's within reason, but it makes me 
nervous having the screw tightened down that much.  Just wanted to check 
with everyone and see if there's anything else I should check or be 
worried about before putting the valve cover back on.  What do you do if 
the adjuster screw sinks below the lock nut?  Replace the rocker?

Is it possible to push down on the bottom of the rocker too hard, so 
that the clearance is greater than it would be during normal operation?

Also, what's up with this page 
(http://www.vwtrendsweb.com/tech/0106vwt_valve/)?  It says that the 
intake valve for cylinder 2 should match up with the valves from 
cylinder 1 (in a 3/1 pattern), which contradicts everything else I've read.

Thanks!
