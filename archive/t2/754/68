Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Bay Drum Brake Q?

Your situation sounds like the brakes are not adjusted right - the shoes. Need to be tighter.

I'd lift the wheels and adjust the shoes until the wheel won't spin and then back off the adjusters until the shoes don't rub when you spin the wheel or they touch slightly if the drum is out of round slightly. 

Also did you open the hydraulic system? Have you bled the brakes?
