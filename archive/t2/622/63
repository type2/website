Subject: Bus Adventure (of the diminutive nature)

Hey Volks,

I had my first bus adventure this weekend. I drove from Portland to
Multonomah Falls using the scenic highway. I know....not much of a
drive....but it was my first time taking the bus on the
expressway.....and really the first time I drove it past 82nd. This is
my first aircooled VW, so I'm trying to pick and choose my adventures
until I'm more confident that I can fix a breakdown if it occurs. With
that in mind, does anyone in the Portland area know of any cool little
adventure drives I could take my bus on to keep breaking it in? I'm
kind of nervous about excessive hills (I was scared to death heading
back to the highway using the exit closest to the falls....foot on the
brake most of the way down).....and the closer I can stay to Always
VDub (in case towing becomes necessary) the better.

I know...not very daredevil. I just want to drive somewhere other than
work and not stress out about it too much. Let me know off-list if you
guys have any suggestions, I'm fairly new to Oregon.

Thanks,
Scott
