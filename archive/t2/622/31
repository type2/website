that's a really neat idea Mark. I thought I would add one additional
idea I have not done, but seen on several camping trips. The late bay
westys have that really big table for the rear that pivots on a wall
mounted bracket. If you round up another table and bracket, you can
mount it to the the rear side of the wheel well on the passenger side.
The table can be moved outside to make a huge table.
