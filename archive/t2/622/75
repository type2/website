Subject: Engine Rebuild problems

HEY GUYS i need some help..........i did my first
engine rebuild and everything seemed to go together
great...it all went together good and fit good and
turned over on the stand great.............then but it
in the car and tried to turn it over........it was
pretty tight so  i pulled it around in third and got
it started........ran pretty good for just a few
minutes.....but kept dying....the timing is probably
not set right but while doing so it just all the
sudden wont turn over anymore.?
like it siezed  up.......it has plenty of
oil................what in the world could i
have done to it? would it have gotten hot and just
with all the new parts expanded and now just wont turn
 over til cooled?
HELLLLLPPP
