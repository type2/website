Subject: valve adjustmen question

Hi everyone,
I'm trying to adjust the valves on my 79. (hydraulic)
My question is, how do I know when the valves are at the proper height so I 
can then adjust the screw on the rocker arm?
I know I point the rotor to no 1 and then rotate 90 deg. counter clockwise.  
Do I line up the middle of the rotor with the mark in the dist rim? or the 
edge of it?.  Many have said that I will be able to feel it while I'm 
turning the engine by hand.  Are they talking about the point where it feels 
really loose, or where it feels really hard to turn?
Thanks,
Kyle
