Wie Geht's,
Tried replacing Temperature Sensor II with test light -no go. Resistance 
measures 22k Ohms. Bentley says it should be 2500. Replace? Tried removing 
harness from AFM - no go. Tried spraying carb cleaner -no go. Will test 
injectors tomorrow. Thanx for all the suggestions. Will keep you posted on 
progress. Thanks again,
Oliver
