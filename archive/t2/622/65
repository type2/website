Subject: How does one aquire H20 in gastank?

I just made a 1,400 mile voyage in the 80 Vanagon with only one minor
problem.  When its pouring rain I get water in my gas.  The engine hatch is
dry so its likely not condensation in the dist cap or brain.  Its getting in
the tank.  I know this because it completely clogged one of my fuel filters.
I9ve never had the tank out but from what I understand its completely
sealed.  I suspected the gas cap itself but I can9t be sure.  I thought
there looked like a bit of water on the inside of the seal which is a bit
cracked.  I packed a rag in there and it seemed moist but also smelled like
gas, so I dunno.  There is a gap in the filler hose behind the passenger
wheel, and I thought maybe that was a suspect.  Anyone else had a similar
problem?  Its frustrating, but not debilitating yet.  The sudden chugga chug
the water causes is dangerous! Especially in traffic!  Thanks so much, Nik
