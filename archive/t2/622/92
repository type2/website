Subject: Re: [T2] busloops

My fiancee is completely sick of my constant attention to the Bus. I'm still
in the first year of ownership (Bus, not fiancee!), so I've had:
1. A trip to NYC and back;
2. A trip to D.C. and back;
3. A trip to Every Bus and back;
And problems that I've had to wrap my brain around, like:
A) New generator, or go with an alternator(went the alt route)?
B) Tinker with heat, or just bring blankets?
C) Have flywheel-crank mating re-machined (loose fit), or eventually buy a
sweet new 1600?
I am constantly tinkering with this and that to get the original stuff just
a little better. The stuff Michael Knight does is much more creative, and it
personalizes a Bus. I hope to get another Bus to get busloopy on with all
kinds of stuff, including a toilet!! Go ahead, laugh, it's ok. :-D
