Subject: And the best design for an icebox is ...

... under a jumpseat behind the front passenger seat. That is, if you 
need the seating.

That gives you an extra four inches of insulation above the icebox, 
where it's most needed (less when it's compressed because somebody is 
sitting there). The trick is to construct an insulated drawer with a 
waterproof tub inside and a drain spigot. The drawer should hang on 
heavy-duty rollers that roll both ways -- you should be able to open 
the icebox drawer from outside the sliding door, and also from inside, 
into the passageway. Getting it to seal on both sides is tricky, but 
not impossible.
