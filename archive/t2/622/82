It wouldn't idle b/c it was partially stuck. 

Go out and rotate any known good engine by hand. You new engine should not have been much tighter than that... 

While assembling the engine, always rotate the crank as you tighten and assemble the case. If at any point it won't rotate, start tearing it down and find out why. 

Whatever was dragging on the crank or cam prob seized. Tear it down and inspect and remeasure everything. My guess is that you don't have enough clearance on the crank bearings or rod bearings and thus the did not get enough lube. 

Let us know what you find out.
