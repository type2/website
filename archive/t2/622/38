<About 1995 I bought some stuff called "MarHyde One Coat"> 

I used it in 1997 or so on my Swiss-Cheese battery trays. Wire brushed it to death with my DeWalt angle grinder, painted it with the Mar-Hyde (white stuff, water based, brush on), coated them with metal-to-metal filler (epoxy filler with aluminum), and the primed them with lacquer based primer, top coated them with acrylic-enamel. Checked them yesterday. Still perfect. Been outside since then.
