Timo...and everyone else...

I had a spark plug connector fail on the way home one day...the inner
part that has the resistor in it just came apart.

Symptoms were that it would idle good, but when you needed power, it 
didn't run well.

It literally came apart when I pulled it off of the spark plug...*and*
it was almost brand new.

Go figure.

Cheers, dave
