Subject: re: Seeking testimonials: longblock from Boston Bob

I bought a 1600cc DP long block from Boston Bob a few years ago.  I 
don't put very many miles on 1000-2000 a year, but haven't had any 
problems.  Bob's very helpful & real nice.  I had a bunch of questions 
& he took the time to answer them all.

Hope this helps,
Keri
