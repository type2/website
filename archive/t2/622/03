Subject: Zero compression # 1, replace head?

Craig,
        What Phil suggests is quite correct, but there could be other factors.  
I parked an aircooled engine [in this case in a garden tractor] in a friend's 
barn over a winter.  In the springtime, at first it ran OK; then suffered your 
symptoms.  Pulling off the shrouding, I found that mama mouse had built a nest 
in the fins near one exhaust valve, where she gave birth to her litter.  
Without cooling air, the valve burned, became stuck in its valveguide.  Result: 
zero compression in that cylinder.

Other guys on this List may comment on valvetrain factors.  I'm thinking, for 
example, of the stud holding the rocker arm shaft.  If one stud pulls out, you 
may lose valve motion on one cylinder, yet have "enough" valve motion on the 
other cylinder to have some compression.

All the same, it is tear-down time.  Good opportunity to put the engine in 
first class condition...... Glenn

Sweaty Betty finally got some relief from the Phoenix temps last night
after the cooling rains, but I wouldn't let up on her. Instead I took her
on a 65 mph hiway run and on my return leg she was getting sluggish.

This morning I do a compression test ( cold engine ) and get these results:
               #1   Zero    black dry plug
               #2   97        good plug
               #3   100      good plug
               #4    85        good plug

Bentley, Muir, Haynes, archives and web articles have, together got  me
confused.  Should I pull the valve cover and inspect?

Could the cause of this poor cylinder lie deeper than the head itself?

Thanks in advance, Craig
