Subject: RE: [T2] Tire watch -- good prices

Just consider cost to ship, and local cost to have tires mounted and balanced. I was looking at a set of Michelin Harmonys for my Cabrio and was pleased to find that the local Mom and Pop that I favor was cheaper to buy the tires from, mount and balance, than it was to just buy and ship the Tire Rack tires.

Understand I have bought about 3-4 sets of tires from the 'rack and consider myself a happy customer but I must shop price...

P.S. FINALLY worked on our Bus yesterday a bit. And yes the 15" wheels I bought (Mercedes) fit. Unfortunately the hub centers will have to be machines out to fit the front hub. Looks NICE...
