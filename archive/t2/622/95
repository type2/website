Subject: Re: [T2] I'm getting the busloops

Don't blame me for your busloops! You contracted that when you bought
your bus. :-^

My mind wanders all over the landscape. I never know just what stupid
idea is going to pop into my head and I have to follow it through to
the end. Though I rarely do anything with the ideas, it's a great
mental exercise.

What's funny is all my considering and thinking and wandering, and I'm
going to end up with a bus that's similar to stock. heh

Mostly for the reason Chris mentioned: $$$
