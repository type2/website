William,

Just went thru this yesterday as I was mounting my air conditioner 
compressor mount.

Sure, I have a 9mm x 1.25 tap, but I'll be derned if I could find a
bolt like that anywhere.

Called a VW buddy and he brought me his helicoil kit with an 8x1.25
replacement.

Personally, on t1 heads, I would put an oversized stud in that is 10mm on 
one side and 8x1.25 on the other...*never* had one of those come out.
Don't know if there is enough room for that in a t4 head.

Cheers, dave
