Subject: I just stripped the interior of my 73 Westy...

I've thought of this arrangement. I've got a bay with an upright motor I'll 
be playing with soon. The bed and cabinent are out and in pieces, and I 
thought of flipping it L to R by assemebling the woodwork that way. It would 
mean the unfinished sides of the wood would face out instead of the finished 
sides, but I thought I could wallpaper it with wood grain. The only thing I 
don't know if I want to hassle is the seat mounts being in the wrong place. 
Plus wanting to keep it original...

> As the layout goes, I would prefer that my entire SO-42 interior
be mirrored L to R.
