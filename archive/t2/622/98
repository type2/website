Subject: electronic spark for gas heater

I've been working on making my stewart-warner heater a bit smaller
than the current size. The actual heater is just fine, but that fresh
air fan/pump/points are the kicker. I moved to a rotary pump that is
much quieter so that has been taken care of. However the SW uses a
spark plug type thing to ignite the flame. I found a circuit using a
555 timer IC that I was hoping would basically perform the same
function as the points that operate the plug, but have not as of yet
gotten it to actually create spark. Does anyone know of anything That
could be used to replace some points on a heater? It runs at a
constant speed so some sort of timer is really all I need.
