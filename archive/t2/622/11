Hi Oliver,

Your compression numbers are not great, but the engine should still 
run. Heck, I've driven hundreds of miles on engines with one cylinder 
at ZERO.

A couple of quick ideas....

Make sure there is power at the coil, then look for spark at the plugs.

How many wires are attached to the coil? There should be a black wire 
running over to the double relay and a white wire in a grey sheath that 
runs to the wiring harness attached to the ECU. Either wire off will 
make the engine inoperative.

The next suggestion would be to put a vacuum gauge on it and test it. 
If you're not pulling at least 14" or more then the FI won't be able to 
do its job. At that point it just becomes a search for the leak.

Happy trails,
