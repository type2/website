On that note... I decided to pull the sink/icebox from my '72 when my 6
year old was unable to open the slider from the inside because he
couldn't reach the handle. I saw this as a major safety issue. I have
since acquired a deluxe interior from a '79 that I plan to install this
Winter. I admit that living in a rainforest and having the ability to
make morning tea without having to get soaking wet played into that
decision. If possible, I'd like to reconstruct the rear-facing seat and
place it behind the passenger seat. Once I get to that portion on the
effort, I'll probably be soliciting advice. Regardless, the fact that a
child is unable to open the slidier door because of the sink/icbox
location makes the early westy interior unsafe for those travelling
with small kids, IMHO. The big ol' blind spot doesn't help either.
