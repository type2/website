Subject: sliding door pops open but doesn't slide

Hi,
Finishing up an AIRS rescue and there is a minor problem before they get
back on the road.
Sliding door pops open only about 6 inches but doesn't slide further.
previously They'd get it closed and it would stop about midway down the
track and then they'd have to work it ....it's wearing a bit. Are there any
adjustments that can be made without removing the door? Bus is a 1972.

thanks,
Chris
