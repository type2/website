Subject: Seeking testimonials: longblock from Boston Bob

Hello,
    I just got the second engine from Bob .The first went 100,000 before I
pulled it for a rear seal (I may have put in back then.) I said what the heck
and went for a new block and all. He is excellent and when your out in the
boonies you'll be glad you don't have those crazy thoughts in your head about
the rings  facing the right way and is that bolt torque to the right lbs. I"LL
get the next one from him
