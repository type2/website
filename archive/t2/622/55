Subject: Throttle Positioner sought

Okay, here's something neither bustedbus.com nor Bus Depot have listed. 
Throttle Positioner for 1971 bus. It's part of the original emissions 
control and I want the Wonderbus to pollute as little as it did when 
sold new.

If it makes a difference, the carb is a 34 PICT-3
