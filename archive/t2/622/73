Subject: Re: [T2] How to move the stove outside ...

Been there-on our 71 I made a shelf out of plexiglass that hinged flush
to the side of the door and had one of those "knee" hinges that locked
in place when you lifted the shelf.  To make it lay flush, I had to cut
a slot in the shelf so the knee hinge could poke through it when folded.
Used it to hold the gas stove.

 fastening points (like the ones that clip the front table in later
Westys to the dashboard) on the outside of the slider, with a heavy and
 secure backing plate inside. That, and some additional tinkering for a
 lower bracket, makes it possible to hang a shelf from the outside of>
the open door, suitable for holding a Coleman two- or even three-burner
 stove.
