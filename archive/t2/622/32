I agree w/ phil I would look into a choke issue first. Especially with
both #2 & #4 both showing rich and 1 & 3 showing a decent burn color.
Also when did you take these plugs out? Was it after the engine had
run up to temp for a while, or close after a new start? It could have
just been the choke on one carb was not open yet (although i'd check
that out)

BTW I have the same carbs but on a type 1 engine and this morning the
air temp was around 55F. My single carb at this temp never worked
really well. Choke wouldn't give me enough time to get the runner
heated good so it would usually stall on cool moist mornings like
this. Chokes kicked in well. and engine never acted like it would die
at all. Very happy :)
