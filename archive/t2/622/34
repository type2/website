Subject: AIRS site update

Hi All,

Ok, I'm hoping to have a test site up by the end of the week. I've 
decided to go from a database backend to a LDAP backend so that people 
can use their favorite email clients (as well as a web browser) to 
access the AIRS information. If you're not technically-minded 
(computer-wise that is) don't worry... This just means you will have 
more options with which to access the information.

Is there anyway to get a dump of the current data in the AIRS site?

Cheers,
Harry
