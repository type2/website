Subject: Re: [T2] I'm getting the busloops

Cripes, I didn't even mention the dash. That's why I wrote this post in 
the first place. I keep thinking about modernizing the ergonomics of 
driving. But how to do it without rendering the bus undriveable until 
done? Answer: go to a junkyard, hack out the front of a bus (one with 
rust holes under the windshield, so that I am not hacking a useable 
front), bring it home, mock up the rest of the cab out of plywood, then 
have at it.

This is nuts.
