put the bus in neutral. and put a wrench on the little nut on the
alternator and see if you can turn rotate the engine by using the
alternator as a pully with the fan belt connected. if that doesn't,
try putting a socket on the small bolt in the center of the fan. But
don't crank too hard, it's kinda a small bolt.

and yes, unless the switch malfunctions, driving any vehicle w/ low
oil pressure is BAD
