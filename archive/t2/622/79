I really don't know what happens if other than #1 spark plug connector
fails. I'm also not sure, why it did interfere with the timing, since sparks
were good while idling.

When thoroughly checking the connector, I noticed two things:

First, the resistance seemed to go up, when revving higher. That means good
sparks while idling and sparks getting worse when increasing RPM to almost
no spark when revving around 3000 RPM. (Tested whith spark plug in the
connector, grounded to engine, engine running on three cylinders).

Second, the resistance went way up, when the connector got warmer.
(disconnected connector with cold and hot engine and checked with ohm-meter)
