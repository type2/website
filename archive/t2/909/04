 My 1973 camper is currently at the previous owners
 house, a couple hundred
 miles from me.  A friend of mine is offering a space
 in his barn for me to
 keep it closer/work on it/etc..
 However, he needs to know the approximate height in
 order to figure out
 which "bay" of the barn to put it in.  Since I'm not
 near my camper, and I
 don't have my bentley, or any other manuals with
 me..could someone give me
 an approxmate measure of how tall a 73 camper is
 (with the top closed)?
