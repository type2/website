So today I went out of town, checked my 78 and decided
what the heck. In 20 minutes I removed the whole steering
wheel / column assembly. Another 10 minutes and I took
the whole wiring harness too. Didn't have to cut anything.
Brought the fuse box and all.

Anyone done this? I know it should bolt in no problem.
Guess im wondering about the wiring.
