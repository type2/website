Hi Joel -

No, only the VW Karmann Ghia and the 411/412 were equipped with a horn relay
because two horns (a high and low tone) were used on these models.  Two
horns were to have such a high amperage draw, that VW felt a relay was
required on these models, but not on those with one, such as the Beetle,
Type 2 and Type 3.  Doesn't mean one couldn't be used on a single horn
set-up insuring full voltage to the unit though.

Haven't seen the movie yet.
