Sure!!! If you are one of those people whose brains are adjusted so that 
a modern mini-van seems at all "mini" then the VW Westy/Bus/Transporter 
is going to look small!!! <griN!>

Of course if your daily driver is a Fiat 500, then even a fat guy on a 
mountain bike is going to look big and dangerous... <griN!>

Looking to buy some of your extra time for cheap.
Please send some of your time to me COD...
Slightly used time is still welcome.
