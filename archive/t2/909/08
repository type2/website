maybe Autozone's discontinued them from their line (prolly  "cost-cutting
measure"), 


hey Jim   What I have seen is autozone and advance only carrying  the plat. 
plugs .I have seen a quality drop in bosch products over the last  couple of 
years as it seems that they are being made all over the world now.  There for a 
while they had some 011 points that were really bad with the rubbing  blocks 
breaking. I have never had any problems with NGK products and I use a lot  of 
them mostly on jap cars. I still use a lot of bosch also.  Later   Mark Dearing
