Subject: RE: [T2] Interview with "Little Miss Sunshine" filmakers

I just got in from seeing Little Miss Sunshine.  I'd have to say it was a
pretty good movie.  It was my wife's "turn" to pick the movie and I was a
little skeptical about going to see this one.  There are a few downright
hilarious, tears streaming down my face, moments.

I'm not a Bus guy.  I'm a Corvair guy that's been lurking 'cause I signed up
to promote out up coming Hot Air Affair, Air Cooled Car Show in Victoria
B.C.  Perhaps you've heard about it<G>

Anyway, here's one of my 'vairs

I'll bet you've never seen one of these before.

W/O the camper:

But I have to know.... Does the VW Bus have a relay for the horn?

Go see the movie and you'll know why I'm asking.
