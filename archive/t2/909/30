Subject: New shocks for a '78

The two (2) of the four (4) KYB gas-A-just failed me.  Simply dangerous to
drive. I have to install new shocks all around.

Please give me the horror stories on why I don't want to buy any of the
following: (sets of four)  No KTB of course!!

$ 48  Monroe Gas Heavy Duty (gas) - Advance Auto - when available??
$ 60 Gabriel Gardian (gas)  Auto Zone - when available??
$100 MonroMatic Plus (gas)  Pep Boys - 3-5 days

$126 Kofap OEM (oil) - from Small Car Parts FLAPS - I can have them tomorrow
$160 Alko (oil) - from Bus Depot, so you can imagine

Here is a picture of the KYBs rear shocks that I took off last night.
Lifetime guarrantee??  Right ! ! !
