Why? Do  most of them insist that you use resistor type wires(which I  
detest).  If I have an electrical charge going down a "conductor" why  
would I want to atenuate it by using resistor type wires?  If I have  a n 
ignition wire, I want it to be a real "wire".

Hey Dave    I haven't had any problems with resistor wires  even when using a 
Crane system. I have seen real wires cause a bad miss in a  waterboxer 
lately. guy who works for me was dolling his 84 westy up putting cool  intake and 
all kinds of gages and such and added real wires and damn if it  didn't cause a 
miss in running. Put the old bosch wires on without the metal  ends and it 
went away.    BOSCH  Back Ordered Shit you Can't  Have   :)  Dave you noticed 
that Karl said stock components and  Mercedes  so if it isn't stock then it 
doesn't really apply  and  I can't help but think that old buses tend to run hotter 
than any Mercedes  Later  Mark dearing
