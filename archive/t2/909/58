Subject: WTB:Thermostat bracket and by any chance newer thermostat

I'm looking for the thermostat bracket for a 2.0 type iv. The engine  
I'm working on didn't have any of the thermostat parts. I see a few  
vendors have them, but if I could pick up a used bracket that would  
help($$) with some other parts. If you by any chance have a new/newer  
thermostat I would be into that also!

Thanks
-Chris
