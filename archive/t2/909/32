Subject: Re: [T2] steering wheel/column transplant - done!

Taking Tony's words to heart I went out and turned the key part way,
lights worked, window wipers worked, bright lights worked, all
the dash lights came on like they should.
Turned it over and presto.
It worked and started up.
I'm going to like this better.

So, it can be done!
