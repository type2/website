No, not a 124 motor. Early 124's were pushrod engines.
74 only [last year in the US] was the TC. It used the
same 1600 twin cam as the Sport Coupe and Spider. [the
124 was replaced by the 131 in the US for 1975 and
used a 1800 twin cam engine]

The Yugo used the transverse single overhead cam
engine that came in the early 128 sedan. All the
hardtop Yugos used the 1100 cc version. The very
limited production Yugo convertible used the 1300 cc
engine that came in the 128 station wagon and 128 SL
and the X1/9 and the 3P.
[79 and up X1/9 used the 1500 cc engine, never came in
a Yugo. The 1500 had its pluses- the valves did not
bend when the timing belt broke, but it also had its
minuses- lower compression ratio because the
combustion chamber was taller so the valves did not
bend! and water controlled EGR. The EGR valve bolted
to the block and was in the water jacket!!!]
