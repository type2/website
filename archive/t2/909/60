Subject: Re: [T2] receiver hitch?

i ended up buying the small light truck /suv hitch from wally world.... i figured heck if i couldnt make it work then i could at least take it back being wal mart....

i ended up getting it to work...
it came with a million pieces to set it up anyway you had possible...

i mounted mine where the bumper usually goes.. but my bumper sucked and heck this thing is as good if not better for a bumper....

i did flip it upside down to get it to be right also but .. lots of folks comment on the hitch and say how much they like it and talk crazy stuff like i could pull a truck down the road with that one on there...

just my .02 cents worth...

it is a reciever btw.. i had to buy the ball and tounge seperate....

i have also thought of buying one of the bike racks to use when we dont pull our trailer...

good luck with whatever you decide...

I bought a '75 Westy and would like to install a receiver hitch to use for our
bike rack. Anyone done this? Care to share some tips?
Thanks!
