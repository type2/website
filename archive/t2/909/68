Chris,

518 is not good for the case halves. It is very good for many other uses,
for example excellent on the oil pump. But it is far too thick and gooey for
case halves. The best product I have used for case halves is Loctite 574.
Ask 10 people and you'll get 10 different products as "the best" for case
halves, but I've used lots of different ones there and 574 is the best for a
few reason. #1 it seals perfectly and flows just right for the application.
#2 is because it is anaerobic, all the excess just wipes away. It is also
easy to clean off if you have to open the case later, and sometimes on an
engine build you make a mistake and need to re-open the case. Many of the
sealants used for case halves are a real bear to clean off the parting line
compared to 574 which just scrapes off.
