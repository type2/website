Thanks, Don...

No KYBs for me anymore, thanks for the offer though.  Seriously.

I don't have the info on when I got these four KYBs from Bus Depot, so I
don't have any guarrantee to fall back on..  I was hoping to hear why the
Cofap (see, I can't even spell the name right!!) was as good, or if they are
really inferior to the Alko from bus Depot, the only other oil filled shocks
I could find.

My '78 is up in the air right now, and I need to get out of the wife's side
of the garage!  I don't relish (gosh, is it that close to lunch time!!)
putting the KYBs back on and then taking them off next week, but if the
Alko's are worth the extra wait and price, or if the cheapo Monroe are
acceptable (right..), just looking for opnions before I order the Cofaps
locally.
