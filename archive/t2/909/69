Hi Tony,

Jalousies are not just for show buses.

It gets cold here, but only for about 6 months of the year. During  
the warmer months, I like to go camping. A lot. And I don't always  
wait for dry weather. The jalousies keep the rain out and allow for a  
crosswind in weather that would flood a bus with sliders.

If Mike is going to use the bus for camping, I'd say to go with  
jalousies.


Happy trails,
