Subject: weber rebuild instructions

Greetings All,

I was wondering if there exists detailed instructions on rebuilding the 
Weber 32/36DFEV.  The one in my bus stopped working and I put in a new 
acceleration pump diaphragm, float, needle and seat.  It now runs but 
the mixture screw has no effect.   I may have to take another look at 
the float measurements., but I think they were pretty close.  Thanks.
