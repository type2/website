Yes, it's that time of year again when we start thinking of the leaves
beginning to change. what better place to watch the fall foliage than in the
mountains near West Virginia. This year JBB will be held the Oct. 6-8 in
Brunswick Md. to coincide with Railroad Days.

I wanted to get a count of how many people wanted to pre order JBB t-shirts.
they will be $15 for short sleeve and $20 for long sleeve. Same price as last
year. I need to have your order by Wednesday Sept. 20. I will order extras in
long sleeve only, no short sleeve, to sell at the campground.

Please email me directly at toby.gun(-at-)verizon.net for t-shirts.

Thanks,
Sharon
