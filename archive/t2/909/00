 I know Karl recommends  against using them.
 
 
 
 OK For what reason?? 
 
------------------------------------------------

VW uses the same basic Kettering ignition system as
pre-electronic Mercedes. Both use Bosch parts. Same
Bosch coil, same style points cap rotor. Same solid
wires with resistor ends. The resistance of the
ignition system is added up by the rotor resistance
and the resistor ends. That is all that is needed. On
Mercedes, when resistor plugs are added to the
equation, a miss under load always developes. Too much
resistance for the Bosch coil to overcome. Install
standard plugs and the car runs fine again.

This gets thrown out the window when non-stock parts
are used.....
