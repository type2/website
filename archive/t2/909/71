	We are compiling a complex list - handy I suppose in case one 
can't find a particular goo.
	In Brit jurisdictions one tends also to come across a blue 
goo called Hylomar.  This firm likes to flash the name Rolls Royce 
(no huge recommendation in my opinion).  It is quite widely used for 
vertically-split crankcases in motorcycles (perhaps harder to keep 
oiltight than horiz-split).  Any opinions about Hylomar?
