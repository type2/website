The HD Boges are the second best shocks you can put on your Bus. They're $59
each and well worth it. (The best are the $100+ each Koni's, when available,
which is not often.) These Boges are a higher-end German market upgrade to
the stock Boge shocks that came on your Bus, and are not sold by Boge in the
U.S. I have to import them myself.

It's worth noting that all of my Boge Bus shocks (except for '68-69 front)
are generally German made, whereas the Boges sold everywhere else in the
U.S. are Mexican made. Sachs/Boge still makes Bus shocks in Germany, but
they don't send them to the U.S., instead selling Mexican ones here under
the same part number. So I import the German ones myself.

As for AlKo, they were a great value but the deal is almost over. I have one
last set coming in about a week or so, at the original $39 each price.  Once
they're sold, they're going off the website, at least for now.  At $39 I
highly recommended them, but the cost has now gone up to around the price of
the HD Boges. At that price I just can't see recommending them over the
Boges, so I have no plans to reorder once my last set at the old price
arrives.

The Cofap's are Brazilian shocks which we consider relatively low-end.
Generally we only list them when we can sell them for the $20 each range.
I'm not sure how they would compare to other lower-end brands sold by FLAPS
etc. Cofap does have a lot of experience in the VW business (they are a
major supplier to Volkwagen of Brazil). Their shocks are not garbage, but
compared to the Boges (or Alko's) they're certainly built to a price.
