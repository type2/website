Subject: starter terminal confusion

hello volks
 i need to know which of the spade terminals are which in my starter.   i
have looked at the wiring diagram over and over but my question is"  does
the Skinny red and white wire to the double relay belong on number 50 or
30?  now i need to know which spade is which?  any pics of how things should
look?
