Subject: Another Hitch Q - Front or Back?

The hitch for the rack on my '79 is mounted on the front. The biggest
advantage I see for this is that if you're traveling any distance with
bikes aboard, you can still access the engine compartment to add oil,
etc. Also, your licence plate remains clearly visible. The Performance
Bike rack I use suspends the bikes out a fair bit from the front of
the bus, but I don't think I've ever had bikes on after dark, so I'm
not sure how it affects the headlights. Anyway, FWIW-
