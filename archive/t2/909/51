I would guess that you developed a very small hailine crack in the plastic
on the cold start valve.  I've seen a few with little "craze" marks in the
moulding.  I think the leak was small since not much burned but at 20 psi it
can't help but spray out getting the distributor area.  If a fuel line had
ruptured i think that you would have a had a couple of litres spilled before
you could do anything and the engine would be slag now.

How to fix?  Time to pull the mill out and tear it down to see what got 
fried.  You'll probably find some seals gone and I would worry about the 
thin allow that make up the distributor.  From the pics it doesn't look too 
bad but the tin covers alot of stuff that could be crumbly toast now.
