Subject: 1972 1700cc motor for sale

Hello I have a 1700cc motor out of a 72. it ran,
before I just pulled it, but the number 3 rod was a
bit noisy. It would be a good one to rebuild or use as
a core motor. I am keeping the carbs, dist, and
possably the heater boxes. Other wise it is complete,
also has a working manual fuel pump. First $100obo and
someone to come pick it up in Pocatello, Idaho gets
it.
Thanks,
