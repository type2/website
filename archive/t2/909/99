Subject: Re: [T2] questions about sliding windows on a late bay

I have noticed that on worn windows, one can open them up half way and 
then go out and lift the slats up considerably- this is due to them 
being driven open- the wind vibrates them and the gear or window rivets 
or connecting rod rivets wear.  You notice this when you close them- if 
you must turn and turn AFTER they hit their seals to make them really 
tight, you are taking up the wear slack.
