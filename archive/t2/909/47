Subject: engine height in inches

hello all,

checked bently and counldn't find it anywhere.  does anyone know the height
in inches of a 1800 75 ED engine w/ the FI removed.  i need to drop the
engine and am trying to find a way to get her high enough since i stupidly
did not drive her up on ramps before i took all the FI off and misc. other
parts.


TIA,
jeremiah
