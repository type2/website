Subject: [T2] Another Hitch Q - Front or Back?

I wouldn't worry about warping rims. The air resistance isn't that
big of a deal on a bike. Only problem I could see is that your bikes
would be covered in bugs. Bad enough having them on the roof
and picking bugs off the front of the bike. I put one of the kids
bikes on the luggage rack of the 74 westie sideways and it was
pretty disgusting when we took it down.
Not really a huge problem.. but still a consideration.

p.s. Chai, I would love to see a full picture of your bus!

  i would worry about my bike being on the front though pushing against the  
wind...???
  i dont know maybe wrong thinking but thinking that this could warp  
rims?>? i dont know how much resistance those rims can take at a side  
angle??
  i have seen them on Rv' though in the front so this is my wonder...
