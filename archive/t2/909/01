As I was reading this email I happened to be on the phone with my Bosch
contact, told him what the email said, and his reaction was WTF?  He said
maybe Autozone's discontinued them from their line (prolly "cost-cutting
measure"), Bosch has NO plans to ever discontinue the W8CC.  Fits so many
European & Japanese makes.

NGK B5ES is the equivalent (you can use BPR5ES [Bosch W8DC]) and either one
works fine, but out of habit I just prefer the Bosch.

My 2 cents worth.....
