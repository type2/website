Hi John,
Sorry  about  the  delay. 
I only got the magazine back last night.
The  guys you want to contact  are a firm in Essex
called Paris Beetles.
Contact Ricky at Paris Beetles on 01277 823365.
This is  a  English number so  you guys will probably
have a 4 or 5 digit international code to go with it.
They not only make custom watertight fabric sunroofs,
but provide one of the few non-factory watertight
cabrio conversions for Beetles according to UK mag,
VolksWorld.
They probably have a website but it's not listed in
the magazine article so try  searching under "Paris
Beetles,Essex,UK" for possible solutions.
Happy hunting!
:-)
Cheers 
Andrew Wood
