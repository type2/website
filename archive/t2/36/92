so i've rebuilt my engine from the bottom up... new cam, pistons, =
cylinders etc...

putting the rocker arms on, i'm not quite sure i put them onthe exact =
way they came off (i cleaned them and may have goofed on putting the =
individual rockers back on the stems in order)...

anyway, they all line their tappets up fine with the valve stems (so i =
figured if i had gotten the order of wrong, as above, they'd not line up =
in the first place right?)... so i went around to set the valves and in =
adjusting the number 3 intake valve i noticed that no matter how much i =
backed off the tappet it still didn't come free of the valve so i =
couldn't get any lash (in fact as i backed it off the arm moved toward =
the valve... the valve wasn't closing anymore)... so i push on the =
bottom of the arm and sure enough with force (not too much) it will back =
off to give me a huge lash...

looked at the pushrod and it looks like it is seating fine... i also =
noticed that as i push on the bottom of the arm (push it into the rod) =
the spring around the rocker arm stems compresses a bit and the arm =
moves in a bit (in order to seat the pushrod end properly?)...

i'm baffled... why would this be happening and does anyone have any =
suggestions for solving this problem?

thanks!
