Subject: Re:Big Oil leak....not push rods, then what??

Pete,
   First of all, it was good advice that someone else sent saying to wash 
the engine down.  I have a small power washer that I've used, works good if 
you are careful.  Let the engine, and ground underneath dry. Now, start it 
up. Use a bright light and an inspection mirror and look for leaks.  Don't 
forget to check the oil preasure sender, the sender itself can leak.  Also a 
possability is that an oil gallery plug might be leaking. Good luck to you.
