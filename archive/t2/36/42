Subject: Re: 79 California FI acting up

Chuck,

Sounds like a vacuum leak. The FI air plumbing has about a billion places
for vacuum leaks to occur. That's where I would start looking. At idle (or
with someone else keeping it 'idling') spray carb cleaner at each hose
connection/etc where a vacuum leak could occur. You are looking for the
engine speed to pick up when you spray near a leak. If someone is having to
work the throttle to keep it idling, then it will be difficult or impossible
so sense this. Don't forget to check/disable the EGR plumbing - it too is a
possible source of a vacuum leak.

If you have a vacuum leak bad enough to keep it from idling, then you are
going to be running lean - and may burn your valves. I wouldn't drive it in
this state until you resolve the problem (ask me how I know).
