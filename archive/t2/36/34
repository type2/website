Subject: Re: [T2] bolt sizes

25mm is too short, 30mm is too long. 28mm is right. I buy them by the
hundred cause they fit at many VW exhaust fittings. Not every hardware line
carries them. You may have to grind down some 30's. 

I like the self locking copper nuts, 12mm ATF, for all exhaust fittings.
These are stock on most BMW.

catalytic converter to the crossover at the "J"?  I think they are M8 x
1.25 but not sure or of the length.  I do not have the bus today so I am
not able to measure them.  I am replacing the muffler & tailpipe this
afternoon.  I am also going to remove the converter & make sure it is OK.
I would like to get the hardware on the way home.  Thanks.
