Subject: Lost Reverse

Hello everyone,

I just took my 78 Westy out for her first run around
the block.  Aside from running out of gas everything
ran well.  However, after gassing up and returning
home, I went to place it in reverse and nothing.  It
will shift into position but when I let the clutch out
nothing.  All other gears engage okay.  I did try
adjusting the shift plate and I can't seem to find the
right spot (I have tried pushing the plate all the way
forward).  Also, while playing with the plate I found
reverse once but then lost it so I know its most
likely a question of proper adjustment.  I'm thinking
there is a better way than messing with the plate and
any advise is appreciated.

Also, noticed speedo was not working.  I pulled front
left hub and pulled cable out, it was about 18" long. 
How long should it be?

Thanks again,
Rick
