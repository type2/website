Subject: 75-78 heater boxes

Listees:

I have in my possession a pair of heater boxes for the 75-78 bus engine. Having a 79 in my bus, I can't use them. They are the triangular flange type.

They have mild surface rust but no structural as I can tell. No cracks, holes, dents or other non-wear and tear damage.

Asking $200 plus shipping to you. I'm in central california. Please be sure to p-mail only.

Thanks,

Billy
