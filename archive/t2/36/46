Subject: Window scrapers.

I'm ready to install new window scrapers on the two front doors.  I hope
the term is right.  The rubber seals/scrapers that keep water and grime
out of the inside of the door.  The inside is more of a long brush.  The
problem is,  I don't know if I need to remove the window to drill out
the old ones, (they're riveted in).  Any suggestions?

Shawn
