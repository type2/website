Hi all,

     Can anyone tell me the size & length of the bolts that bolt the =
catalytic converter to the crossover at the "J"?  I think they are M8 x =
1.25 but not sure or of the length.  I do not have the bus today so I am =
not able to measure them.  I am replacing the muffler & tailpipe this =
afternoon.  I am also going to remove the converter & make sure it is =
OK.  I would like to get the hardware on the way home.  Thanks.
