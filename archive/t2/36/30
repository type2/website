Dave - Dan,

    Do yourselves a big favor, pull the tanks. Clean them with muriatic
(Wal-Mart)  acid, flush with large amount of water, followed by acetone to
displace the water, seal with butyl (automotive paint store) paint,  replace
the filter,  install your new injectors and then hit the road.
    In the long run you will save your self a lot of grief.
