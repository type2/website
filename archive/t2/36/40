Subject: Fan oil seal

68 Kombi

     Is there an oil seal behind the crankshaft pulley on a single carb 68 
bus?  the Bently manual says there is only one at the flywheel end.  My 
engine seems to be leaking behind the main pulley and the belt is always oil 
coated.  If there isn't a seal there, what is the procedure for stopping the 
leak?
