Subject: Re: [T2] setting valves on rebuild problem

it's definitely not the cam... if i'm able to push the arm onto the pushrod
and get it free then it's something with the arm or maybe my pushrod is
bent?... i figure that if the cam was up, and the follower was pushed out
and thus the pushrod then i shouldn't be able to push on the bottom of the
rocker arm at all and get it open more at the tappet...

hmmm
