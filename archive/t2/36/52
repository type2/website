Make sure your brakes are adjusted to spec, including the 
emergency brake.  A loose emergency brake can result in a low 
brake pedal as you describe.

Try the following:  While driving, pull your emergency brake out 
until it starts to drag, then release it just enough so that it 
doesn't drag (Is it still way out?).  Now step on the brake 
pedal.  If your bus is like mine, the pedal will no longer go 
halfway to the floor - it will stop almost immediately and be hard 
as a rock.  Now you can be sure that adjusting (specifically, 
tightening) your emergency brake will solve your problem.
