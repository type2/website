Subject: Proceedure for replacing dipstick bellows?

Hi all,
thanks to the folks who reponded to my earlier mail ("Big Oil Leak...").  I got a couple of suggestions, and after leveraging the archive, I think there's a good chance it is the dipstick bellow that may be shot.  

I could not locate a proceedure for this, though, and I do not (and can't afford this month) a Bentley manuel....I read that the Bentley describes it in Chapter 5, page 25, fig. 9-1, part #12.

Does anyone have any idea how I'd go about replacing this?  Tomorrow is Saturday, so I will make time =)
Thanks again and enjoy your weekends!
