Subject: re-winter storage in barns

Tom asked about storing his bus in a barn.

I store my buses in a pole shed with a dirt floor, and
although it has been years (decades really, if ever)
since there may have been cattle in there, I roll out
some 8ft wide plastic (4mil like you use for vapor
barrier in house construction) on the ground, then
drive the bus on that.  I am a little concerned about
moisture in the ground affecting the bottom of the
vehicles, and this makes me feel much better about it.
 Someday I'll have enough concrete floor to park all
the cars and trucks on, but for now I think the
plastic helps.

Jim (in WI)
65 double cab
75 bus
lots of parts vehicles and future projects in the 
shed and in the yard
