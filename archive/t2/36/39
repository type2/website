If you can take four full turns on the screw without getting some results
then suspect the FI. If the four turns make a difference in idle speed
and smoothness then the FI AFM is probably ok.
Take a can of Ether or Berrymsns B-12 and spray it around the locations
that draw vaccum and if the engine speeds up then you've found your leak.
