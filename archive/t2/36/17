M.R.:
Perhaps many have not heard of Fram's poor reputation. They used to be
highly thought of, but no longer.
In the last two years, I've taken to dissecting my oil filters,
particularly on new rebuilders, just to look for metal particles.
I've sure noticed a wide difference in construction and quality. Some
(German) filters have over twice as much paper in them as others. Fram is
one of the worst!
Mann is the best in my book.
