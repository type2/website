That would imply that someone who had your email address in their address
book (if my memory recalls) is infected with the Snow White virus.

Fortunetly this has absolutely nothing to do with this list...the list
strips any and all attachments from emails bound for the list (or, in some
cases, refuses to accept the mail.) plus there are many spam and virus
filters (of which the snow white filter was the second in place on the new
server) that prevent as much of this as possible from even making it into
the server in the first place.


You can, sometimes, examine the header of the suspect email and figure out
who sent it...sometimes not.  If you can, you can contact them privately
and let them know they are sending them.

Viri, in all their forms, are an unwelcome part of life on the
internet...you just have to take precautions on your own end to prevent
infection.

Now, before this generates any more off topic messages...lets drop it.
Right? Right.  Feel free to drop in on the type2 irc server at
irc.type2.com 6667 #buslist and discuss this at length.

Now, if you can present proof that you've a late baywindow or early
vanagon with a fuel injection system that has been infected with a common
email virus...Lets talk! heh.
