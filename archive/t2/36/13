Hi Dan,

you have a classic case of CITS.

What the heck is CITS, you ask?

"Crud In Tank Syndrome", says I.

Check the fuel filter, it probably needs to be changed. It's possible you
will also need to remove the fuel tank and flush out the crud, but check the
filter first, and if you do need to replace it buy two, as you will likely
be doing it again soon.

Happy trails,
