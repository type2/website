Only once? A lot of folks like to put the heads on, put on the head nuts,
then torque in stages. Take it to 10 lb-ft, let it sit for 20 minutes or so,
go to 15 lb-ft, let sit for 20 minutes, go to final torque, let sit for 20
minutes, then check the torque on the head nuts one final time and leave it.
This gives the engine time to accept the fact that it's going to have heads
on it whether it likes them or not.
