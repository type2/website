Subject: Morey's Oil Stabilizer

I did a search on the archives and found only one post
mentioning this. I was wondering if other listees had
used Morey's Oil Stabilizer, and if so, what did you
think? Helpful? Hurtful? I know there are many on this
list that are V-dub experts, or at least very
knowledgeable on such things. I used it to quiet the
noisy lifters in my old 82 vanagon. I just recently
had my 78 westy 2.0 rebuilt from the bottom up, and
wanted to know if this would help add to the life of
the engine. I am not one who so quickly falls for all
of the promises that additives give, but having used
this one in the past and being pleased with the
results, I may give it a try again. 
Anyone?

Thanks.
