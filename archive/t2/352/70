Subject: Rear Break adjuster

I was ajusting the rear breaks today and found the adjusters still and 
almost frozen.  A quick spirt of screw loosener set them free.  Took em 
out and cleaned them.   However, they were still a bit stiff when I went 
to adjust them again.

What is the proper grease,if any, to use in this location?
