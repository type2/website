Subject: weird running (not running) bus

Ok, i just got my van out for the summer.  It sat outside all winter, 
uncovered, in buffalo.  I know that's not good, but it happened.  
77 Westy 2.0 FI
So, here's what it does.

I start it, it runs ok.  I push the pedal down, it runs slower and 
doggier... there's a lot of gas smell, and it fouls plugs pretty well. 
 So i think it's flooding, after it starts.  I checked the injectors, 
they aren't grounded to the case, and everything seems to be ok there. 
 My double relay was brand new last year.  

So, my question is, where should i be looking?  ECU?  

Thanks in advance,
