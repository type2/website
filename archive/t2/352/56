Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temps/A Long Rant

I agree with Mike. I use VDO oil temp and pressure gauges. I watch 
the temp but keep a closer watch on oil pressure.  As the temp goes 
up the pressure drops. This summer I plan to switch to straight 50w 
oil and see how the holds up to previous data with 20/50.

Thanks
