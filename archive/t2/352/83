Subject: Rear wheel bearings

Well I finally decided to replace my wheel bearings ('77 2L bus).

I've read through the archives and got all the good pointers, even bought a
new circlip pliers just in case!

I decided to do a test run on my spare parts bus ('74 1.8L). All was going
fine, the big nut came off with the expected grunting, CV out of the way
brakes off and out of the way, drove the shaft out without too much hassle
with a soft mallet. The inner seal is a pain to get out and was ruined in
the process, but no big deal. A few sharp wacks with a hammer to loosen the
circlip and it also came out with any drama.

That's when the fun began. I already knew the spacer wouldn't come out with
the bearing in place, but assumed you could move it far enough to be able to
drive it out from the other side with a pin. I have done the bearings in my
'73 beetle this way a few times with ease!

Not so in the bus. So a re-think and I tried a sliding hammer type bearing
puller but they still wouldn't budge.

In the end I prised the roller cage out and removed all the rollers to get
the spacer out so I could drive the bearings out from the opposite side.



The problem is, what do you do if you just want to re-grease the bearings??
How do you remove them without ruining the bearings??



I think I'll look into adding a grease nipple and a few bleed points to
avoid having to re-grease them by removing them!



Thanks for your help
