No.  The ECU is the last thing you should be looking at, after you have 
tested and verified that all other systems are working correctly.

You may want to check and make sure that the cold start injector is not 
leaking.  Theoretically it should not be possible for it to be actually 
firing after the starter has stopped (unless yours is miswired) but it 
is possible for it to leak, since it is always under pressure.  This 
would result in a lot of extra fuel getting into the cylinders.

Another thing to look for when you get a way rich mixture is the 
cylinder head temp sensor.  Make sure it's screwed securely into the 
head, make sure the wiring is good and make sure it tests out properly 
with a multimeter.

It's always good to verify proper fuel pressure too.
