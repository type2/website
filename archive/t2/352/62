Subject: Free to someone who welds: almost-new German muffler

Cleaning out garage.  Have stock Ernst Bus muffler from Germany that a
mechanic had brazed onto my Bus's heater boxes not long before the old
engine failed.  Seems the fellow thought this was a better idea than
using clamps.  Unfortunately, it had to be cut off during the engine
transplant procedure, so the pipes from the muffler to the heater boxes
would need to be replaced somehow.  I replaced it with yet another new
muffler, and it's time to pass it on or turn it in for recycling.  Since
so many folks on the list talk so casually about welding, I wonder
whether anyone might be able to make use of it?  It seems to be
otherwise in fine shape, and it's free.
 
Going once?

p.s. - yes, I've learned my lesson.  now, for better or for worse, I'm
the mechanic.
