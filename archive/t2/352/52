Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temps/A Long Rant

Well I have been of the opinion that over 250 is way to hot.
BUT
My friend who had driven his bus everywhere possible always said to me:
"The WORST thing you have ever done to your bus is intall that damn oil temp 
guage.
You watch it like a hawk and then you worry. I never put one in mine and I 
never
will".

Maybe he was right.

Dont flame, just think about it. He took his bus and drove it whereever he 
wanted
to and it just worked, Sure he watched for a thrown fan belt, signaled by 
the
gen light comming on, and watched for low oil but he drove and he was happy.
I worried all the time, and I still do.
