Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temps/A Long Rant

I agree- we did not install the temp gauge and later, oil pressure gauge
until around 200K of driving everywhere, sometimes at a constant 65
mph.  My concern is not so much the temp as the oil pressure- which of
course is a function of the thinner hot oil.  Thus to keep the tired
240,000mi engine oil pressure when hot at 25psi, we'd have to driv at
50-55 on hot days which is around 240 max temp.  Fully floored pulls are
a no no, I gear down! Hill climbs even then can get it to 260.

 Well I have been of the opinion that over 250 is way to hot.
