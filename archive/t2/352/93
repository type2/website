And then there were the Cow Poop Edition busses in the late 70's. We 
thought that a Champagne Edition bus would be a Champagne color like two of 
our Hondas. Doesn't matter - it's VW Tornado red now. When Cow Poop 
Editions are valuable based on their colors, we'll paint it again.

Ah the colorful 70's. I'm not responsible - - I was too young...
