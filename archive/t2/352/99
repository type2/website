Subject: mudflaps

 Thanks to everyone helping me to locate some VW logo mudflaps. It seems the main source was RMMW and probably Bus Depot. RMMW claims to have obtained them from VW. RMMW ran out 3 months ago and won't be stocking them anymore and the VW dealer doesn't show 211898205BK or 271821805BK in their depots including the one in Canada.

Seems samba and eBay are the only online places left and they are bidding over $100 for $25 mudflaps w/o mounting hardware. sigh.
