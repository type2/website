Subject: Oil Leak

Listees,
    For some time now, I have had an oil leak. Normally I see just a few
quarter sized drops under the engine after I stop. Today, I had a puddle
about 3" across. I am not 100% sure it was from my bus or if it was a
previous vehicle. I checked the oil and it was about a half quart low, which
is what I expected.
    My question: Once I clean the engine with degreaser, will I really be
able to tell where the leak is from. I am thinking its the oil cooler
because the oil is on the left side of the motor.
    2nd question: Is there anyone in the Hampstead, Jacksonville or
Wilmington area that might be able to help me with this. It's always easier
with a 2nd person.
Later,
Jim
