Subject: Jerks and lurches fix?

My 2 litre accelerates in a tolerable but annoying "jerky" manner, but only 
for the first 5 or 10 minutes after starting from cold, or near cold. After 
that, it runs smooth and strong.

This is particularly noticeable in first and second gears. However, the 
idle seems fairly even and starting is flawless.

I suspect a fuel problem, since tappets and timing have just been done, 
vacuum advance checked, and points and condenser replaced (the problem was 
there before this). Where should I start looking?

On another topic, is there a way to eliminate the "lurch" that often occurs 
when the accelerator is fully released at medium to high revs?
