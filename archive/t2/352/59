Subject: Help....can't shift into second gear

Hello All,

    I wonder if anyone can tell me why The Grasshopper won't shift into second
gear. I know this:


1. It will only shift into second when I go there directly from first with no
delay
2. It seems to go into other gears fairly easily
3. Revving the motor slightly does not seem to help it into gear
4. The clutch has about 5k miles on it without adjustment

Any suggestions or ideas would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks,

Kenny
