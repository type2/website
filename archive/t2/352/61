Wilmington area that might be able to help me with this. It's always easier

You might have to call around to the FLAPS but one of them should stock
phlorescent dye. Add some (follow directions on package) and get a black
light (Wow, man). Then, at night (unless you've got access to a dark ga-
rage), let the engine idle until you start to see the glow. Some oil leaks
are tough to pinpoint on VW engines because the fan keeps a constant
flow of air blowing the oil around...
