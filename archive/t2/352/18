Subject: Update to suddenly noisy exhaust on 75 bus

I posted here about the suddenly noisy exhaust in our 75; the engine
rebuilder over the phone assumed it was a pulled manifold stud. 
However, someone posted that generic rebuilt heads may have plugs where
some smog pump was located for each cylinder, (used in a year like 74?)
and apparently the bolt he had placed in the #2 hole had worked loose-I
hand tightened it and the noise went away.  Builder suggested muffler
cement on the bolt; would JB weld work on it?
