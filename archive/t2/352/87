Rae -

Probably just the engine getting older.  With less compression, it's
easier to turn, and there's a certain point where it no longer can hold
the vehicle against a steep hill.

My Bus has a brand-new, tight engine, which does a much better job of
holding it than the parking brake.  My '82 Subie suffers from the same
condition as your Bus: At 200,000 miles on the original engine, it
wouldn't budge one bit in gear.  Now, at 260,000 miles, if I put it in
gear without the e-brake on a steep hill, it will creep *very* slowly as
the engine turns over.  It even hesitates at the top of each compression
stroke!  Great entertainment. :-)

equivalent to 65,000 miles on a Bus engine)
