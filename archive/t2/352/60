First verify the oil pressure switch. It's right in front of the dizzy, a 
single wire through a grommet through the cooling tin. Pull the wire and 
grommet. Use a hemostat or similar with a crumpled paper towel to go in 
there and mop up any oil. Then stuff a clean paper towel in there. Fire it 
up and run for several minutes. Pull the towel and see how much oil you 
got. These pressure switches are a common leaker, far more common than the 
coolers, more especially the aftermarket (cheap) brands. Try to fine the 
genuine VDO or VW switch as they tend to last 20 years.
