Subject: Seattle: room & 1BR suite in VW-friendly house, available in

Want to live with another Bus owner-maintainer in a great co-op house
with a garage for your repair/maintenance jobs?  I have one room
upstairs ($500) and a complete, dog-friendly, one-bedroom mother-in-law
apartment ($700), both becoming available in May.  I know it can be hard
to find an affordable Bus-friendly rental in the city, because.. well,
I've been there!  If you're interested, E-mail me off-list for details.

p.s.: if you don't need housing but do need to borrow a garage and a
novice helper to work on your Bus, that's always a possibility too.  no
charge for that!
