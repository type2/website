Dr Tim, I put a new VW dealer oil pressure switch in my bus last summer. I
still get oil all over the left side of the engine. Should the switch be
installed with teflon tape(I don't think so) and how tight do you crank them
in there? I know a guy who broke a big chunk of his engine off
overtightening one of those puppies...
