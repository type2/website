Subject: Welder Questions?

Hi Everyone,
Well just 2 weeks away till I move into my new rental house which may  make 
not want to use the westy only 200 yards from the lake but I have a 3 car 
garage so I'm going to go through the westifaction process turning my 1981 
vanagon into a westy.  My dad is a welding rep so I can have any welder I 
want to use.  So to the people who have do this what is the best and easiest 
to use.  The person who will do the welding has been welding for like 10 
years and my dad said SHE is one of the best welders in the area but she just 
go laid off so she has no equipment but that can be easily solved. So what 
should I have him get me? He has his recommended ones but I thought some of 
you may know better with this bus stuff even though metal is metal.  Can't 
wait to start even the new land lord is going to help :)
Thanks
Kevin
