So where did the color diagrams come from?

And Richard asked:
Is it a supplement to the green bentley or just covers the same information for those years?
 ------------------------------

I have the orange book, First Edition, published 6/76, that covers 74, 75, and 76 buses. It has colored wiring
diagrams in it.
It is not a Bentley supplement. It is the factory VW manual that Bentley copied. But Bentley left out some of
it!
