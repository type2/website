Subject: vanagon table project

well, i was wandering the grounds of my local auto
recycler and i happen upon a vanagon with the cover
for the engine still in it, darn my luck, i forgot my
sawzall.

good news though, it had the table in it so i bought
that instead and i took it home, modified it and the
bracket that holds it some and put her in my bus.  i
have pics of the project if you want, just pmail me
and i'll zip em off when i'm at work and have the fast
server handy.  i really like the vanagon table as i
don't have to worry about putting the leg down anymore
so it makes it much more convenient to pop up and
down.
