I suspect the air flow meter is dropping out, even more so if it's got lots 
of age. Check the Bentley. Hook up ohm meter to pins called for and push 
the flap very slowly while watching for the signal to drop to 0. Normally 
it should swing back and forth from 50 ohms to hundreds of ohms, up and 
down randomly as the flap is moved in and out but it should never drop to 
0. This test is like so many in that a cheapy multimeter can be 
inconclusive where a quality meter will be definitive.

You can pull the top to inspect the sweep circuit for visible signs of 
contamination and/or wear for further confirmation. You can try cleaning 
with a common eraser, but know that even in those cases where this resolves 
the issue, it will come back to haunt you rather quickly.
