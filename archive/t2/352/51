Subject: Color Wiring Diagrams [final word]

With everyone's feedback and some searching at the Library of Congress I
summarized what I've learned about the Bentley and the VW Repair Manual
(yellow book):

http://homepage.mac.com/ratwell/RepairManuals.html

The most interesting fact I discovered is that there are four editions of
the Bentley, not three and all of them have color wiring diagrams except for
the last edition which is currently sold by RB.

The most valuable edition in my opinion is the 3rd because it contains color
wiring diagrams up to 1978.

Thanks to everyone who contributed.
