Subject: Grinding Noise in 75 tranny (revised)

Thanks to everyone for responding to my last post.  I went and drove the westy
today.  The grinding noise occurs as the clutch is let out.  When the pedal is
all of the way up and the bus is in gear, the grinding noise goes away and
acceleration is fine.  This is mainly heard in reverse, starting out in first,
and shifting to second.  I thought this may be a pilot bearing but wouldn't
that make noise all of the time?  Am I right in thinking this is clutch
related and not tranny since the noise stops and everything performs fine when
the clutch is released?  Any ideas are appreciated.

Thanks,
Erich Elmer
