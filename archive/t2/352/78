Subject: Breaks again.

I got some TruStop reman shoes from napa and they are not the correct 
shoes.  When to their web site any they appear to have three types.  
My break shoes have a little nob or hole instead of the notch as shoe on 
the TruStop.

Are Napa # BA 0811471 the correct shoes for a 73 bus.  Are there other 
parts is should be getting?

Thanks
