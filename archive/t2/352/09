It's a bargain. Last time VW had them (over 10 years ago??) they were $132.

I've seen many of the electrical types give up the ghost in 2 months to 5 
years. They are noisy. They are not stock. On the other hand, the stock 
mechanical will last you at least the life of the engine, if not two engine 
lives. You can get replacement diaphrams from the Porsche 
suppliers/dealers. The ones for the late 356 and early 912 pumps will work, 
like 64 to 69 era.
