Hi Richard and other folks that responded,

Thanks for the info on the fuel pump numbers and the rubber filler neck.  I
did call 3 of the closest VW dealers and they did not have, nor could order
the parts for a mechanical fuel pump.  It was worth a try...  They would
rather me to come in and test drive a new beetle or something.  I guess I
will have to buy a new mechanical pump for the type IV (which Bus Depot has
in stock for 99 bucks) or go to the electric fuel pump setup for about the
same price.  I know there has been a lot of discussion about this, and a lot
of folks go to the electric set up.  Anyone still use mechanical?  I would
love to hear some reasons for/against.

I do have the "paint can lid" type cover in the front right of my engine
compartment.  So I just remove this and I have access to the "filler neck"?
Is it easy to access from here?  Just remove the clamps and replace??  I
searched the archives but I could not find any step by step instructions.
Sorry, a little non-mechanically inclined, but learning!

Thanks again and happy bussing!

Ed
