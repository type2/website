Subject: Re: [T2] Color Wiring Diagram for 71 Westy?

I scored a Bently at a swap meet that has color wiring diagrams for the
1968 - 1974 model years. It's a real Bentley, copyright by VWoA 1974, ISBN
0-8376-0056-1. Prior to finding this one I had been told the wiring diagrams
were all in B&W after 72 or 73.

Use the ISBN number to search for a copy on the used/rare/out-of-print web
dealers.

Regards,
Dave
