We pick and choose among the various sources for the best panels.  This way
we can provide better overall quality than from any single supplier, and we
can shop for better pricing as well.

Veng is the most popular brand for '68-79 body panels, so you'll find it at
most VW parts vendors. However the name has changed, as they were bought out
and now carry the Klockerholm (sp?) name.  Same product but it's primered in
red now.   Many of our body panels are from this supplier, for much less
than Wolfsburg West's price.  These are Danish made and generally of good
quality.

We also sell a lot of genuine VW body panels, which nobody else carries.
Most of our outer rockers, full rear corners, battery trays, and more are
genuine VW.  These are the best fit and finish available so we get them
whenever we can.  Too bad more panels are not available.  We sell these
genuine ones for the same price that others charge for aftermarket.

Finally, we import some sheet metal from the UK (some of it from the same
supplier as Schofield), including our front floor sections, center rocker
panels, and other parts.

Our print catalog has several pages of diagrams and prices of all of our
sheet metal.  It is available for $1 if added to an order. If purchased
separately it's $3 but includes a $5 off coupon toward your next order.  You
can order it toll-free at the number below, or just add it to any website
order just by clicking the option on the check-out page of the shopping
cart. Our website lists all of the sheet metal pricing but does not have
diagrams yet (it's next on my to-do list).
