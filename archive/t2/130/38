Subject: Re: Body Panels

Hello,

I have ordered body panels from a few sources.  I have found that it depends 
on what you need.  In the States, I have ordered a lot of stuff from 
Wolfsburg West, including a sliding door rail, rocker panels, outriggers and 
jack points.  I have been for the most part pleased with the quality and fit 
of their products.  Many of their parts seem to come from Veng, a Danish 
company, but they probably have other sources.  I have also ordered from 
Alan Schofield in England.  I have found their parts to be the best for fit 
and quality, but shipping is expensive.  They make some parts themselves and 
others they get from outside suppliers.   Their inner rocker panels are the 
best I've seen, being of original guage and excellent fit.  They make a 
driver's side rocker panel which is also the best I have found.  They also 
have parts that I haven't been able to find here, like the inner sill 
between the inner and outer rocker panels.  I have received parts from them 
five days after ordering.  Once, they called me back in Canada after I 
placed the order and paid to tell me that the postage was going to be really 
expensive and asked if I still wanted to order.  They ended up cutting the 
end off the part (an inner rocker panel)so that it could be sent a much, 
much cheaper class of postage. It still arrived in about 5 days from the UK. 
  For these kinds of parts, I think they are worth the expense.  I have also 
ordered some things from JC Whitney, which I was not at all happy with, 
mostly because of poor fit.  Hope this helps,

-James.
