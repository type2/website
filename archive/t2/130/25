Andrew,
I spoke with Gary (his answering machine) yesterday and got two emails from him shortly afterward.
Both came from the gmiller(-at-)pacifier.com address
Here's his signature from the emails:
----------------
Gary Miller
gmiller(-at-)pacifier.com
http://www.sandrail.com/millerfi
Miller Fuel Injection
10706 NE 215 Ct
Vancouver Wa
98682
360-944-4422
---------------------
I have also cc'd Gary on this email and if it goes through to him, he most likely will contact you directly.

Hope that helps

Scott
