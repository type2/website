ingene van een 1978 t2b 2liter duble 
caburator had manual or hydralic valve adjustment
, and what are the right 
clearences for this valves , are they sodium

US spec vans came w/ hydraulic and FI.  Perhaps
you have a different spec van, or add on carbs. 
European spec vans had double solexes into the
80's.  Do you know what market you van was made
for?
