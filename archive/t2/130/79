Subject: Friday sighting...

Unfortunately my wife threw her back out yesterday, so I will not be 
making it down to BYOB or Kelly Park this weekend, as I have decided to 
stay home and help her out. I am jelous of all who are attending. :(

So we decided to watch a movie tonight instead. We watched "Little Man 
Tate" with Jodie foster, and there is a scene in there with a 21 Window 
Barndoor, Grey and White. It is a gorgeous one, check it out some time.
