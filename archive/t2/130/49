Subject: Re: [T2] wheel/tire size question...success stories?

Understood,

I understand where you're coming from here, and my intention is to keep as 
much stability in the ride as possible, while also giving a new generation 
aesthetic appeal. While making the wheel/tire swap, I plan to take into 
account the load capacity of the wheels and tires as well. I will keep the 
original wheels in case I or anyone else ever wants to return it to stock. 
Rest assured, I will not do anything to my bus that is in bad taste, but I 
guess that's all relative.
I do respect and appreciate the opinions of everyone who has a belief on 
this and all issues. Thank you for your input!

Respectfully,

Dylan Baxter
