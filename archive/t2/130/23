Hi,

I looked up the website of Miller Fuel Injection & was very impressed with their products & interested as to how well they'd suit my applications.

But when I tried to contact Gary Miller his email address on the site kept rebounding on Mailer Daemon & I haven't been able to get through.

Does any know of another address other than gmiller(-at-)pacifier.com for Miller FI?

I wanted to ask Gary some stuff about his products.

Cheers
