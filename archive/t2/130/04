Subject: Catalytic Converter

Hi Folks,

Here's a question from the "can't fight city hall" department.  I took Sweet 
Pea (1979 Westy, Federal 2.0 FI) for an emissions test, and she passed the 
smog test but failed the equipment test.  Specifically, the inspector 
wouldn't pass me because I had no catalytic converter.  When I installed the 
new engine, I put on a free-flow exhaust, figuring my new engine would pass 
smog.  However, I didn't realize they would be such sticklers for original 
equipment.  Aargh!  Stupid smog controls!  It's times like this that make me 
want to sell my Bus and buy a Honda.

So, my question is this:  Will a 1979 Federal Cat bolt onto a 72-74 Muffler? 
  If not, can it be welded on?  My original muffler didn't have a Cat 
either, so I'm not really sure what should go on there.  Looking at the 
specs, however, it looks like the stock crossover pipe/Cat/muffler setup is 
the way to go, but it's VERY expensive.

Thanks for any help or suggestions.
