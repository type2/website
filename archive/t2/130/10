Subject: timing a 82 Vanagon without timing scale

How does one time an aircooled 82 Vanagon (2.0 Liter type IV engine)
without a timing mark on the pulley and a timing scale? It seems that I
am missing the scale and there is nothing on the fan pulley indicating
TDC. I have heard that I can get the scales at busdepot or its like, but
what about the pulley mark?

Any ideas?
