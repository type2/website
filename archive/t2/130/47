Not sure.  I certainly think that panels can approach that temperature in 
direct sunlight.  There also might be some room for interpretation in the 
definition of "melting".  What I experienced might be closer to say, 
"substantial softening" which was enough to cause it to no longer hold its 
shape and to emit nasty tar smells.  It wasn't melted in the sense that I 
could suck it up with a siphon.  That place used to send out samples for a 
few bucks - if they still do, that would be a good way to safely find out 
if it will work for you.  I will continue to discourage the use of this 
product as long as people will listen.  Again, I am only refering to the 
adhesive product with the blue plastic backing with the weave pattern on it 
that they refer to as "blue" (but I would want to try the other too before 
buying).
