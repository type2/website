Subject: Re: [T2] How much material for Westy curtains?

I am actually in the process of making curtains for my
73 bus and rather than using fabric, I bought some
cloth tablecloths at Target. The material is ALOT
thicker than conventional fabric, plus it has a "water
seal" on the print side, which is going to help me
since my seals on the windows aren't in the best
shape.

The size I got was 60in x 84in which easily can be cut
into three panels, enough for one side. Finally, if
you are not too handy with a sewing machine, you can
pick up some seam tape which actually works well for
the hems. Hope that helps!
