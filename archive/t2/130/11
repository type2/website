Subject: Gas Heater Parts

Hey List,

I just spoke with someone who has a '79 hardtop bus that they are selling/
parting out in Annpolis, MD. The bus is in pretty rough shape with a lot of
banged up exterior parts, the interior is pretty trashed too, but it
apparently has a gas heater which I am told works but needs a fuel pump.
She is selling me the heater for $50.00. I think its a deal..

Questions:

1. What type of heater would come stock in a '79?  BN6, BN4 etc.

2. When I go to remove the heater from the bus exactly what parts do I need
to make sure I get? Controls etc..

3. Is anyone interested in a 79' project/parts bus? Blown motor, but still
has a number of good parts.

This girl is nice but she has a lot issues.... She was an old customer of
mine when I fixed cars for a living and never was willing to fix things
right or have preventive maintenance done so this bus is basically ragged
out, but Im sure it could be bought for basically any price. She just needs
it to go away. P-mail me if interested. I'm going to get the heater
saturday or sunday.


Thanks for all the help,
