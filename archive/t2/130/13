I meant the way he said to assemble them, not the way he says to
adjust them.

Well let's see Bob builds 40 a year, VW built like 4000?  I don't know,
never seen the problem.  My personal experience.  I do recall Stephens
and others alluding to this problem when using aftermarket lifters with
smaller bleed holes in the side.  But like I said, till I see the problem I'm
not apt to run the hydraulics at zero lash.  The 2 I built last year had 120
psi all round, cold, warm, whatever.  Nope it isn't 40, but it is my
experience
with the last 15-20 hydraulic lifter Type 1, 4, and Vanagon engines I've
touched.

YMMV.
