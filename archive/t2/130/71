Subject: 1973 Westy Pop-Top.

Hi everyone,

I'm looking into buying a 73 westy for around $1200. One of the heater-boxes
is leaking, and it wont shift into reverse. Other then that its a little
rough around the edges but seems completely restorable.. Thoughts? How much
can I get the heater boxes for? Shifter out of alignment? Advice on anything
I should check before I purchase?


Thanks

Tyler.
