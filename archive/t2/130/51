Subject: re: 79' Westy Auxillary Battery Hookup

I think every VW i have ever owned has had a few wires without homes. i 
credit PITA PO's for improper repair of gradual problems. i swear some 
mechanics will just unplug or cut wires to systems that they think are not 
necessarry. my 77 bus has no thermostat, no metal flap vent, no pulley or 
wire, but i guess the last owner decided it didnt need one! anyway, get a 
westy wiring diagram and play investigator. it should be fun!
