Subject: Am I sitting on a bulkhead bomb?


When redoing my engine I noticed that my bus (1970) did  not have a 
"bulkhead" between the engine compartment and the gas tank compartment like 
is shown in the manuals.

Should I put a bulkhead in?

Also, a friend told me that his T2 engine once sucked up a rag from the 
engine compartment.

Should I install a screen over the fan intake hole on the engine shroud?

Thanks.
