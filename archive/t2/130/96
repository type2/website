I've been receiving emails now for several months.  This really is a great
service you  provide and I believe I, my bank account and my bus are better
off for it.

Is there a way to charge a contribution to a credit card or should I snail
mail a check?

Please provide detail for the ignorant but appreciative,

Juan
