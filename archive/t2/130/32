On a $200 76 Bug I got for my wife, I put a quart of oil in the engine
compartment for easy access at oil changes. So she's driving it home from
work and she hears this screeching noise and smoke is billowing out of the
back of the bug. She pulls over and oil is dripping from the engine. An
Ex-VW person stops, hears the story and says "threw a rod" whichs makes
sense since it had a little rod knock. So AAA tows it home and I crank it
and hear the screeching noise, I reach into the fan intake and pull out
half a plastic oil bottle. Screech is gone, but the bug smokes when it gets
warm for a few days :-)
