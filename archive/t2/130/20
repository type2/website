I went to look at this guys '87 syncro and had a look at his '81 at
that time in a sort of cursory way.  I don't know him, etc.  But the
guy is a good family sort of guy.  The van is pretty nice for a WV
area bus, some minor seam rust and small defects here and there,
I don't recall specifically.  He thinks it is exceptional for the area, I
wouldn't go that far my '82 is nicer, but as a point some may know
from seeing Steve Dolan's '80 (which Steve was tickled to pay $1000
for with a blown engine) this Vanagon is nicer.  The engine was rebuilt
5-10k ago, using from a cursory outside look new P&C, nicely cleaned
case, new AMC heads.  The last plus the unfortunate fact (for WV) that
it is an AUTOMATIC probably lead to the fact it is 0 psi on #3, and also
he stripped the #4 plug.  I'd guess that on the cheap one might be able
to slap one head on it, maybe one P&C (I'll give you a nice used rings
not disturbed 25k mile set) and run it for another 40-50k miles or so.
Or put in an engine, do as you will.  The way he describes driving it
on grades I know in the area he probably unfortunately took this thing
to 280-300F oil temps pretty regularly though so I wouldn't strictly
count on more than the bottom end of the engine.  Anyway I'm saying
it is a pretty fair Van for what it is and where it is (within 2.5 hours of
DC volks, the guys is a nice guy, and I'll bet his "best offer" is a pretty
darn reasonable offer, he needs em out of the drive.  I'm sorely tempted
to make an offer myself and just resell it after a cheapy redo or to beat
but I know the story of an air cooled automatic around here.  My best
friend has my '82 auto over around DC right now, just fine over there,
anywhere up and down the coast as long as you don't want to cross the
mountains.

For anyone noticing he has the syncro as well, it is a bit rough body
wise, and a MAJOR project in my opinion to put back together.  I was
going to swap him a head, and re assembly on the '81 for the '87 but
decided it is too much of a project, HOWEVER he has two brand new
AMC heads for it (AMC water cooled heads are superior to VW because
of a redesign) worth about $700 list, and a Mahle P&C set that has sat in
the damp fairly ruining one barrel but the other 3 are likely useable.
Other new parts as well.  The syncro tranny is pulled for no particular
reason and the bell housing removed, this and the general dissasembly
of cooling system, etc leads it to be a BIG project but IDEAL for parts
for any syncro owner.  And I'd bet he'll take less than what the heads
are worth for the entire van.

Like I said I know nothing more than he was a good guy I met for about
2 hours one Saturday afternoon for a road trip.
