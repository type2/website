Subject: Re: [T2] valves adjustment 1978/2liter westy

78 came with Hydrolic's...however, make sure thats whats in them...the way 
you can tell is by the rods...unbolt the tappet mechanism and pull a rod out 
( of course this means youll probably have to adjust them anyway)...if the 
rods are solid stainless steel, they are hydrolics, if they are stainless 
overlayed with aluminum, they are not.  For Hydrolics the adjustment is get 
both valves closed (TDC) for that cylinder and back them out 11/2 turns and 
dont touch them again...if they are solids, do the above but set the lash at 
.006 and ajust them stone cold every 3000 miles.
