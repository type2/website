I drive (or hope to soon) a '68 westy.
Original 1600sp. It has no firewall and it hasn't blown up yet (knock on
corporate supplied fake wood surface).
I would make sure that all of your connections are sealed well, which you
should do anyways, and that's all folks.

As for the pancake eating rags...don't leave any rags in your engine bay!
Actually a clean engine bay is a beautiful place to work in. While I had my
motor out, I went in and vacuumed, and washed mine out. Makes working a lot
nicer, and the less flammable stuff you have around (grease, oily rags,
leaves) the better. I'd also put a screen on your fan, I thought that was a
stock item, but I don't have a pancake.

When redoing my engine I noticed that my bus (1970) did  not have a
"bulkhead" between the engine compartment and the gas tank compartment like
is shown in the manuals.

Should I put a bulkhead in?

Also, a friend told me that his T2 engine once sucked up a rag from the
engine compartment.

Should I install a screen over the fan intake hole on the engine shroud?

Thanks.
