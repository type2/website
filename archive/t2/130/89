Subject: Re curtains & who set up my G-cities web site?

My curtains are tri-layered, using my Hunter green on the outside, and
white with green flower pattern facing inside.  I included a sliding
curtain behind the front seats for quick naps/potty use without messing
with the front curtain.  In the Middle was the cheapest dense linen I
could find.  Guarteed not to let in glaring rest area lights.  My next
curtains I'd like to se mylar metal "space blanket" material in the
center to reflect heat.  Your measurements will be influenced by the
width of your purchase- some are 54", some are 42", and you gotta figure
your windows and allow for gathers (if desired) and hems.  You can see
my nifty curtains and zillion other mods at
the goeocities site a listee set up for me (are you out there? I need
the password!)  The site got shut down for overuse the last time I
mentioned it, so like go there on an even day if you have even letters
in your last name, or whatever.......
