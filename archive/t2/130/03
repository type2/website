--Corbett,

I have my '79 deluxe sunroof stripped down and am planning to go the same route. I'm familiar with the Bulley website as well.

I started with the foam last week right in front of the rear seat where an "x" cross member lays in front of the exterior sheet metal. The "x" member has comblike fingers that are attached to the exterior sheet metal with a bead of adhesive of somekind. Mine was dried up so I removed, sanded and reattached it with "liquid nail". 

As for the foam (great stuff by name):

1. It does not "adhere" to the sheet metal, so you need to do the job in layers/stages so the foam can "stack up".

2. Stay out of the sun. My first mistake. It keeps the foam liquid and makes it run. I did both sides at once (one in the sun) and the cool side looks professional, the hot ran on me and looks like hell.

I plan to find the kool patch and q-pads as well. Please keep me posted on your methods as well

Billy
