Hello people,
I have a 75 westy that is stripped pretty good but still has allot of =
good parts such as front beam, dashboard (nice), gas tank, steering box, =
CV's, any thing left on this van is free to who ever wants it. Most of =
this stuff is already removed and ready to go. Please don't make me =
crush it. I can't fit any more stuff in my garage. This van will be GONE =
next week!=20

Also any Riviera owners need original curtains from a 75 Riviera they =
have the cool pockets for storage. They are faded but very cool and free =
to whoever comes and gets them.
