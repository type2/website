Subject: Re: [T2] Curtain Material

When I purchased my 74 West, the curtains were old, and rotiing, let
alone some white and black checked stuff---

I went over to Walmart, and checked out what they had--and lo and
behold, they had the right color orange material---

I bought the whole bolt of the stuff, and it wasn't expensive---about
$16.00.

Doubling it up was a peice of cake, and I just sewed in the ends for the
rods to slip through----super easy, super cheap looks good---and not
much light comes throught the material---


Later,

Terry

Hi List, 
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Two winters ago I made new curtains for our '71
westy. The material we chose wasn't heavy enough to keep out light and
we didn't double it up or put on another layer of white as a number of
people have. I figured I could always add that second layer if need be.
As it turned out we didn't need that extra layer at all. In the morning
the fabric dims and diffuses the daylight enough so that it doesn't wake
us up. Since virtually all VW campouts are family events I was a bit
concerned about what might be evident or visible through the curtains at
night with the lights on in the bus. As it turns out that fear was
unfounded. 
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0So when picking your fabric choose what you
like. While you are in the store hold it up and see how the light comes
through it or if you can see through it. That's what me and my wife,
Kathy, did. As for the amount of material needed, I have no idea.
Curtains make a great first fabic project as there isn't anything fancy
or unusual to do. Heck, you can do it without any sewing involved if you
want to, ask me how I know :-)
