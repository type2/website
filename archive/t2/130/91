I think that very first picture points out what I am missing, and I "think"
it is just that little
fabric 3 way connector thingy seen here :
http://www.wicals.com/troy/vw/enginebay/images/DSC00261.jpg

What I am not sure of is what that third thing connects to. The one coming
from the left meets up with the one coming in from the right, but then it
connects to something else going back towards the gas tank, or airbox, I
can't really tell.

Do you have a picture showing that specific connection, or more importantly
where that third thing connects to?

The url above shows that same picture as you have I think, just without
anything properly connected.
