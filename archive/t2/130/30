Subject: RE: [T2] Rust, noise and heat

I have not gotten to the foam stage yet, but thanks for the info. I have
ordered a sample of some sound deadening material from
http://www.mcmaster.com/. I am also getting ready to order the aluminum
covered sheets of insulation from JC Whitney. I am going to use kool-it
(from JC Whitney) instead of kool patch because I cannot find the kool patch
locally.

I still have a few things to get out of the bus before I start, but I have
the POR 15 ready to go. That is the first thing I am going to put down after
a good cleaning. This is a job I want to only do once.

Any more experience out their with sound deadening and insulating the bus? I
was hoping to hear that somebody else out their has actually done most of
this and see what they thought of the improvements a few years later.

I will keep the list posted on my progress and we will see how it goes.
