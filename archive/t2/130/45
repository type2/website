Subject: Re: [T2] wheel/tire size question...success stories?


This topic often brings out the flames so watch out. IMHO there is nothing
wrong with stock rims. The problem often is that a PO has put car tires on
the bus. They dont have the sidewall thickness/ load rating your bus needs,
so your bus gets swampy. If you put a good set of stock size tires on your
stock rims and all of your suspension and steering components are in good
order then you will pretty much max out the cornering and comfort abilities
of your VW Bus. Now aestheics are another story. If you are into low
profile tires, chrome, green neon fog under your bus and maybe some
piss-boy stickers than go for it. No offense intended, I tend to take this
subject too far...
When you start changing tire size and rims you may find that your speedo
may not read correctly, and your ride becomes bumpy. I guess these things
can be corrected but it always seemed like more work than it was worth. Im
of the belief that if you want a sports car buy a sports car, if you want a
bus buy a bus but dont try to put a fifty dollar saddle on a five dollar
horse as my father used to say. (not to say that a bus is a $5 horse)...

All of this is IMHO...

Good Luck,

Hello all,
I'm new to this list, so I'm not sure if this question will offend any
purists, but I'll test the waters...
I'd like to know of any success stories that people have had with putting
non-VW wheels on their Transporters, Vanagons, etc. I have a '78
Transporter, and have recently found that some Mercedes and Audi models
have
the same lug pattern as my bus. I'd like to put some larger wheels on there

with some low profile tires and would like to know what offsets/sizes have
been used successfully in the past by any of you.

Thanks!
Dylan Baxter
