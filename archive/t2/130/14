fellow listmembers......

I have been working on finding all of the "this isn't connected to anything"
type stuff
and putting it all back together regardless of how important it seems, and
still working
on these tubes that come out of the fuel system someplace, I believe to help
it breathe.

The top right hand side of my charcoal canister, there is a thin little tube
that goes noplace
currently, and I think that is part of this same system.

Here is a pic of what I do have now, I think I am definetly missing some of
those items.
Could you take a look at this and see what I'll need to get this put back
together correctly?

Just not sure what I need to order, or if I can get what I need at a
hardware store/flaps to fix this?

thanks for any tips, info, tomfoolery you can shed on the subject...
