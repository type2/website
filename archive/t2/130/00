When I did mine, I wasn=B9t sure about the fit either because the piece I cut
had no bend in the middle like the original.  When I put gas in for the
first time I really could smell it badly which made me worry about a leak
but I checked the connections again and figured that the gas going in for
the first time "blew" the gas smell out and simply wafted my way.

The phillips head clamps around the hose piece that were stock bothered me
so I bought new clamps that I could use a nut driver on to make sure I got
them tight.=20
