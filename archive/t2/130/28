Mike (and the list):

Take a look at:

Kudos to Mr. Bulley!  Thank you again. A great resource of ideas.  Even if
you don't follow his prescription to the letter, there's lots of suggestions
here to fit whatever your budget allows.

This list and the folks who contribute are great.  Another good reason to
send a few bucks off to the list fund!
