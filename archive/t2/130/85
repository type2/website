North America = fuel injection, hydraulic lifters
Rest of World = carbs, solid lifters

If it's a CJ engine they will be solid unless someone has replaced them with
hydraulic at some point.  Clearances are 0.006 (0.15mm) all round.  The
valves are not normally sodium filled, but I think you would have to look at
the heads to know for sure.
