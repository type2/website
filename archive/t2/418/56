Subject: Brazilian Buses

All of this talk about water cooled buses and better seats and such made 
me think of the buses I've ridden in in Brazil.  They may be no 
different than those produced in Mexico but since I speak Portuguese and 
not Spanish I decided to look for some Brazilian sites.  Interestingly I 
found one with an English translation (not very good though).  Its title 
is still in Portuguese so I doubt it has been clicked by many North 
American enthusiasts.  It shows some of the changes.  Take a look:

They drive these things like crazy.  Accelerate fast... brake hard... 
turn sharp... all the things you shouldn't do to a car... but they're 
still kick'n.  These are used as Postal vehicals and their chassis are 
used for a car company that makes fiberglass  cars called "gurgel". 
 When  I can find pictures of these I'll post them. FYI - they call the 
bus "Kombi" just in case you wanted to do searches or look at the vw 
site http://www.volkswagen.com.br/default.asp  (you can build your own, 
look at the school buses and other types, and it'll give you a total 
when you're done... if you get past the language barrier.)

Have fun.
