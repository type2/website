Hi Volks,

Just a reminder that BOTC3 is now only 4 weeks away, in Whitby, Ontario 
Canada, on August 8th-10th.

News for this week is that along with subsidizing the camping fees, 
www.GermanSupply.com has contributed a new VDO Cylinder Head Temp gauge 
to the door prize pile.

But if you aren't there you can't win.  So get your registration $$$ in 
soon, and save $2 over the gate price of $10 for the weekend.

For more info, please visit our website:

Happy trails,
