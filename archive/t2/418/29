Kristian,

Go talk with your insurance agent and explain what you have.
I just finished this talk last week with mine(Farmers) and they
were very helpfull.  You will probably need an certified appraisal
and they will take pictures.

Avoid the "antique" version of insurance as it restricts driving range.

Cheers, dave
