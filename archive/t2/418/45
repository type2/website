Mine will be considerably cheaper.

$150 for the engine and tranny - both known good. Gasket set (traded for 
this), ignition system rebuild (traded), exhaust ($100), NOS Transvair kit 
($150 vs. the $650 catalog price from Clark's Corvair), alternator 
conversion ($50 - but I was lucky), misc everything $150.

Yes I might have to rebuild it eventually but thanks to my local club the 
labor ought to be close to nil and the parts fairly cheap. Like everything 
else you can spend what you want to spend.

Join your local Corvair club. Will make used parts easier to find, 
expertise not matched anywhere, etc. Everything is available new or 
reproduced pretty much.

http://corvair_club.tripod.com/  is our local club.

Is our parts section. Notice the good 110HP engine that sold.

Better yet notice the top three ads. They're mine and I want you to buy 
that stuff. <grin>
