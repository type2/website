Subject: 75 FI Vac Lines

A couple questions about vac line routing on a 75 FI Bus

1. Where should the vac line(s) from the press relief valve go?
2. There is a small vac port on the manifold right beside the brake booster
line what should this be attached too?
3. There are two vac ports on the throttle body - one by the firewall and
one just under the idle screw - what should be going to these?

The diagrams available are slightly different from the 75 - want to confirm
as bus is running extremely rich -

Thanks
