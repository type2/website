Oooooohhh... Aaaaahhhh... I didn't realize you could use a powerglide with the
Corvair engine... Now I know what I'll do when my engine gives up the ghost
(probably not for another 50K-100K miles, knock on wood).

A big advantage to going to the Corvair engine for me is that my Father's
first new car was a Corvair. And since he helps me with major stuff like
engine rebuilds, keeping him happy is important!

Considering that the flat-six was used in the 911, you are dead-on there. A
much more spendy option, in fact, is to put the Porsche flat-six in the bus.
Of course, a solid 911 engine will set you back $3K-$5K minimum.
