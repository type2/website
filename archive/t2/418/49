Hmmm - time to get out the cutting torch and build a suspension based on 
unequal length arm's (ala my CR-V) for IRS at four corners...

This project is common for hot rodders.

4 wheel disc brakes with vented rotors upfront (Eurovan rotors and calipers 
or Vanagon parts?).

Add swaybars and I think it'd would be a different character all together 
on curvy roads... <grin>

As for the air conditioning, don't forget the system needs rear air as 
well. Add a thermostat controlled solenoid in the line going forward and 
add a second evaporator above the rear seats (or under it). Temp controlled 
by rear seat passengers.

While we're at it we might as well add some sort of power steering system. 
Either an electric assist (bigger alternator?) or the old style system that 
used a hydraulic ram as found on mid-sixties Moostangs for one. Maybe retro 
fit a power steering box from the Toyota or Mitsu forward control style vans.

All it takes is money (and a welder, and a machine shop and 149 trips to 
the junkyard and a lift and fancy air tools and....)

Oops - lost that recently discovered and improved HP to weigh ratio b/c of 
new creature comforts... <grin>

(I would like a more powerful Westy with a redesigned suspension and 
brakes). Looks normal but operates at modern speeds. A Sleeper babyyyy!

I love Sleepers...

See ya!
