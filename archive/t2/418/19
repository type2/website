Thermostado de Sao Paolo

Certificado  de Guarantia  HaHa
El returno  to  Rocky Mountain-o

Opera Man ( Bye Bye:)

The currently available engine thermostat for type 1 engines
listed in catalogs as 040 119 059 and delivered as 111 119 159A
does not fit on a VW engine, neither in the original bracket nor
on the flaps rod, as the length is wrong.
It is more easily identified as not stock-looking, but as a coiled
brass wire with an exposed inner brass plunger, 80-85 C
replacement for the stock 65-70C unit also listed as 111 119 159A.
This item has been in the catalogs for many years.
I forwarded my discovery to RMMW a few months ago and
they claimed to be removing it from sale at that time.
