Subject: misses on acceleration + water from the tailpipe

On my way back from NJ to NC my bus was missing. It was like it would 
sputter. It would only happen at high speeds and only when I was giving it 
gas. The more gas I was giving the more likely it was to happen. It wouldn't 
do it non stop, but every couple of seconds. It was not evenly spaced.
Also, I noticed that water keeps dripping from my tail pipe. I have seen 
this on other cars before and was not sure what the deal is. Does it have to 
do with humidity, or is it something to be concerned about?
Thanks,
Kyle
