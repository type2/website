Voltage Regulator..... remember that ?  

Your plug with the brown, black, red, and green plugs into the Voltage
regulator,, front right side of the firewall in the engine compartment.

The Black wire is "probably" not required,, I think I have been told it was for
Westfalia ..... IT IS LIVE all the time,, Tape it up and restrain it in a safe
location if you do not use it.

The small Red wire in the plug should have a blue wire tail,,, it plugs into a
single blue wire in the same area, for the dash light,, and IS required!

The large RED wire is B+ and can go to the starter as stock, or the Battery B+
terminal,, your choice.
