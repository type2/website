Subject: praise for vendor

Bus Depot gets more than their shake of bashing on this list,
so i thought i might take a minute to share a positive experience.

i have been seeking hardware for a muffler install.  i
called the customer service line for BD (since i pay
attention to the website & don't call the 800 number
with questions like it asks) and was met by a fellow named
Joe.  he did an outstanding job of giving me the information
that i asked for.  he was able to track down a hardware kit,
which was not mentioned on the web catalog so i didn't even
know one existed.  he also processed my order for that & for
a few other things.

he did explain that he did not have a computerized inventory
system & could not tell me from his desk if the items were
in stock. when i asked if he could go check while i waited,
he was happy to do so.

& on top of all that i got a 5% discount just for being part
of type2.com.

a couple of important points to remember:
-they have the best prices around

-don't order from BD if you are in a hurry or need
        something 'right away'

-don't call the 800 number if you have questions,
        spend the extra 2 bucks to make a phone call to
        avoid future headaches - its worth it!

-try to find out if the items are in stock before
        completing your order

i have used the above guidelines when ordering from BD &
it seems to make my ordering experience much more pleasant.

sorry to be long winded.

have a great weekend,
