Probably Fiat 500's. I have one myself. It was Italy's answer to the
Beetle, and stayed in production for something like 25 years. It looks
like a Beetle that got shrunk in the wash, with a big cloth sunroof.
The styling cues from the Beetle are obvious and everywhere.  Has a 2
cylinder 500 cc aircooled engine in the back.
