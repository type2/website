Ron emailed me today and let me know that the manufacturer changed the
status of them this week from backordered to unavailable.

Apparently the one that was sent to me to look over for repro'ing was lost
when I returned it to the owner. :O(

If we can borrow one from some kind soul, I now have the new black resin
from Alumilite, the 70A, that cures to a flexible state.  I'm not really
sure how it'll handle the heat from the engine, or if a stiffer
non-conducting resin will work in place of the 70A.

If another boot can be found and borrowed, I'll cast a few for testing.
