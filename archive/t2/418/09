Subject: Have thermostats changed on us?

After all these years without one, I decided to put in a thermostat on my '71.
However some of the parts I have don't match the pictures and description in
Bentley.

First, I bought a new thermostat from one of the standard VW suppliers. The
number marked on the box is 111.119.159A which matches the catalog for a '71
bus. The number marked on the unit is 040.119.159.1 (this number is also
marked in fine print elsewhere on the box). This thermostat does not have the
flat sided boss on the bottom so it can mate with the flat sided hole on the
bottom of the bracket. It has about an 8mm stud coming out the bottom and a
small bent down tab about 1/4 inch away from the stud. The supplied nut/washer
barely overlaps the flat sided hole making secure attachment virtually
impossible. Am I missing something here or do I have an incorrect thermostat?

Second, my bracket looks like the photo in Bentley except the very bottom of
the bracket folds under the case below the where the bracket mounts to the
case. The bracket mounting hole is not elongated so as to make adjustment
possible. I have maybe 1/16 inch at the most of up down movement on the
bracket. Does this sound right?

Sincere thanks,
Bill Moon
