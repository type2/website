Subject: Cincinnati Ohio VW Show Campout??

Hey Y'all,
Happy Friday. The Volkswagen & Porsche Family Reunion
show sponsored by the Cincinnati Volkswagen Club is
being held on September 21, 2003 just north of
Cincinnati.  Heres the show link:

Since Michele's BusnGruven campout does not correspond
with the date of the show this year, I was wondering
if anyone would be interested in having me organize a
campout close to the show site for this weekend? I'd
be glad to do it, since it is kind of in my
neighborhood, but I want to make sure that there is
interest first.  This could even be a good time of
year to change the VW Buses 'n Boats event to, you all
know the weather problems we have experienced during
May!
Anyway, if you would be at all interested in me
planning an OVT\FMBC campout for this VW Porsche show,
drop me a note and I'll pull it together!
