Yeah, if we're going to dream - let's dream BIG!

Oh and while we're at it, let's do something about the driver looking out 
the top of the windows. Lower the seat or raise the roof or just change the 
proportions as a whole. I'd say a 5% grow in every direction ought to do it 
- wider, longer, taller, and a bit heavier. Who cares though? Now it's made 
out of aluminum.... <grin>
