I know this has come up before but I thought I'd chime in anyway. In the
hunt to locate a local supplier for stainless steel staples for my poptop I
found they are readily available at a good price through Home Depot.

These are the garden variety Arrow brand staples with a 3/8" crown and 3/8"
leg length. You can get varying leg lengths but not in stainless. The
staples I removed from the poptop were stainless and had a 1/2" crown with
3/8" leg. I don't know what else to call them besides duo-fast staples.
Finding that kind in SS is much harder and the online source pointed out
many times is:

You can also get Monel staples from Home Depot in a 3/8" leg for $1 more per
box of 1250. Monel seems to be a step up from rust resistant to rust proof.
I don't really know anymore.

I suspect many folks just used a smaller staple instead of hunting down an
exact replacement since they are hard to find and you not only have to
locate the staples but also an appropriate stapler. Am I right?
