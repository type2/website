Or more!  I have been using my bus to haul loads of siding home from the 'Depot, and I can put 12-foot-long pieces in through the back hatch, close it and drive home with no red flags hanging out back.  Try that with any pickup, even a long bed - no workie.  They normally have to bring trailers to haul this stuff.

As long as we're talking about garages...
