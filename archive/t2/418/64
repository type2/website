Subject: setting point

hello everyone,
Ok, I'm back in NC from NJ, but I am leaving for Kansas City tonight.
I was doing a "quick" tune up and had a couple questions.
Does it matter if I set the timing or the point gap first?
When I set my points with a feeler gauge my dwell is way too low. When I set 
my points to the proper dwell the points are really, really, really close 
together. Should I go by the feeler gauge or the dwell, or is something else 
wrong?
Thanks,
Kyle
