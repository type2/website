> How you remove the head rests on a 73?

If they are the rare original one-year-only 73 headrests:  There is a release buttom on each post. It is on
the inside of each one, just under the material. It is black. Hold each one in and pull up.

If they are 74/75 soft vinyl or 76-79 hard plastic, they just pull out.
