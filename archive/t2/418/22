Paul, if you've got a tire carrier on there now, you might have bigger
problems.  On my 79 westy with the tire carrier, one of the mounting
holes for the emblem had been enlarged to accomodate one of the many
bolts of thee tire carrier.  If you still have 3 little holes in a
triangle pattern, you may be able to mount your emblem ok.  Bus Depot
sells the little mounting clips.  They are kinda "U" shaped on one end
and round on the other end.  The U shaped end fits over 3 little
embossed areas on the back of the emblem.  The round end pushes into the
3 holes on the front of the bus.  Mine is in the body shop now to get
the enlarged tire mount holes welded up (as well as the rest of the body
restored).  One of the emblem mount holes was used for the tire mount. 
The little holes should be in an upside down triangle pattern on the
front of the bus.  I hope this is not all too confusing.  Greg
