You know, I just remembered that both the local import-specialty FLAPS here in
Chattanooga and the one I deal with in Ocala, FL, have a big stack of books
they use to look up the right part numbers for vehicles. They both have
computerized inventory, but they have to know the part number. One thing that
amazes me is that the guys at the FLAPS can usually open the big stack of
books to within a few pages of the right part for the right vehicle. Sort of
like the pick-and-pull with the old guy in the back who knows where every car
is in the lot and exactly which parts have been taken off. He might not know
what parts work on different vehicles, but if you can give him the make and
model of a car he has...
