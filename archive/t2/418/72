Hi Volks,

The good news is that the 77 Sunroof's engine is finally running. 
Wednesday night I gave the battery a full and complete charge, grounded 
the ECU and cleaned the battery terminals, and after work yesterday I 
hit it with a short shot of quick-start and it lit right up. It was a 
really nice sound, the custom iron-pipe muffler has a very throaty 
rumble to it.

The bad news is that the tranny dipstick is dry, and the torque 
converter is rattling as if it's about to come apart. I poured the 
first 1.5 quarts of ATF I could lay hands on into it but it's still 
very loud. ( The fact that the P.O. had lots of empty ATF cans in the 
bus should not be ignored). I have already observed steady dripping 
from the torque converter when the engine is running.

I can't comment on the tranny performance yet as It's not safe to drive 
with a sticky throttle linkage and bad brakes. Can you say "Death 
Trap"???

Not having fully read the Bentley's auto tranny chapter yet, are there 
any  specific items I should be looking out for??  Frankly, the 
illustrations in that chapter scare the &^%$ out of me.

Happy trails,
