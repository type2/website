AP recently reported that a small company (Autodelta) has been 
charged with illegally importing Alfa Romeos into the USA...
While not on a scale of trying to sneak a re-vin'd Bus out of Mexico,
the Autodelta boys are facing five (5) years in the bob-wire-motel
and five million in fines...
Just so's you know...They take this very seriously...
