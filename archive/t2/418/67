Dwell is the correct way to set the Points, it should
be between 44 and 52. On the 8cyl scale, it will read
22 to 26 all you have to do, is to double it to get
4cyl readings. Allways set the dwell first then set
the timing. Timing does not effect dwell, but dwell
effects timing so dwell must be done first so the
timing can be set correctly. Phil
