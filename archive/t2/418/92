Subject: Barrel Shims for 2.0 litre

Have a buddy in town that is rebuilding a 2.0 litre and is having
problems finding barrel shims.

He says he is needing 96mm.

Any help would be appreciated...you can email him personally at
outofvally(-at-)yahoo.com.

He needs this pretty quickly.

Thanks,
Charlie
