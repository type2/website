Congratulations Dr. Dan! You must have worked hard for that. Good luck in
finding a Vanagon!

Dear Folks:
An hour ago I (successfully) defended my dissertation based on data from
this list.  After 7 years, it's now Dr. Henry, thank you.  I just wanted to
say a huge thank you to Ken Hooper, Ted Finesman, and the other admins who
gave me permission to use the archives and to those of you who helped by
completing the survey in March.  The study yielded some fascinating results,
chief of which is that the Type 2 List is not a "virtual" community, but a
real place with rules, daily business, and a discernable pattern of behavior
that can be studied.
