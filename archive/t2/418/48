Subject: Head temp question

Could some of you on the list give me some numbers.  I'm looking for the
following for a 78 westy:

- Normal operating head temps
- Hot running head temps

Also, is a bus running at ~160F (head temp) still considered to be in
the warming up stage?

If you're curious why I ask, I'm tuning a custom fuel injection and
trying to tune using my CHT.  I found that after driving around in 70
degree weather, not putting too much strain, the CHT registered around
68 ohms, which I calculated to be roughly 215 degrees.

Thanks!
Mike
