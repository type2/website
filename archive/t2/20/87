Subject: u.s. relay on vw?

I'm bout to go nuts getting my headlights working.
I'm aware that the four-prong dimmer relay is no
longer available for my '68. So I got the brasileira
five-pronger and did the jumper deal as per the
archives.

Still, no luck. turns out the brand-spanking new relay
is bad. The VW parts shop is on the far, far side of
construction and its almost an afternoon trip to get
there. 

so, a parts guy at the AutoZone who owns two 70s buses
tells me that he can find a u.s. equivalent. Long
story short, he sells me two relays that operate like
horn relays--not high-low switches. (i looked
inside--shhhh--not even close.)

QUESTION: Is there a relay from a u.s. or japanese
car-- that I can ask for by name-- that can be
jumpered/modified to use on my bus? Like a Courier
truck relay or something.

(I hope this isn't blasphemy among you full-tilt resto
guys.)
