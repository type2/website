A poor decision on your part!  :)

The brake fluid is relatively viscous and the lines rather narrow, 
so bubbles tend to be pushed along the line even if the line goes 
slightly downhill.  Once in the brake cylinders, they tend to rise 
to the top.  I usually put the catch bottle on the ground and use 
thin clear plastic hose (fish tank tubing) to go to the catch bottle.  
The bubbles will slowly rise in this tubing, but slowly enough that 
they will be pushed out the end by the next push.

Not on aircooled VWs.  I think that the first rabbits (golfs) had diagonal brakes.
