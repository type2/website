Subject: Puyallup Washington end-O-da-year Octobugfest

Well Volks the springmeet overnighter set records for
attendance. I have heard from a couple of Volks about
the Octobugfest in Puyallup.
--------------
October 14th   Oktobugfest at the Puyallup Fairgrounds, 
info: (888) 226-9969 
--------------
  I for one need misc. parts and will be there. If there is
an interest in organizing a overnighter (Wetwesties style)
contact me an I will be happy to start a list.

  Just stick OCTOBUGFEST in the subject line so I can keep
track of you all. We had approx 50 for springmeet. Its
supposed to be a dry fall sooooooo.... anyone?
Please e-mail me direct I will post a tally to save list
bandwidth. Also, if someone on the vintage and van-0-gone
lists wants to forward this that would be great.

This event is put on by the NWVWC (North West VW club)
Wet Westy events are informal & family friendly.
