I'd just squirt some engine oil down the cylinders, change the oil in the
crankcase (condensation=moisture).
Disconnect the coil and turn it over until it gets oil pressure. If the
pressure comes up OK, I'd go ahead and start it.

If the new engine was newly rebuilt I'd run it in according to the best
known run in procedures (that part I can't say).
