I'd start with the Bentley, try:

On the 71: follow section 2, page 9, procedure 6.1 "to remove steering 
knuckle"
On the 70: follow 2-11 procedure 6.1 "to install"

On the 71: follow 13-8, procedure 5.2 "to remove"
On the 70: fabricate mounts, install new, correct for 71 brake hardlines. 
follow 13-8 procedure 5.2 "to install"

Locate a place to mount a second spare tire with the later, correct bolt 
pattern for your new front end.

Make sure and determine if the 70 master cylinder is adequate and safe for 
the new disks.
