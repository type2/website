Subject: Oil Cooler: Plate vs. Tube

Reading thru the archives, Ron Van Ness writes: "The consensus among air
cooled folks is that
the best type of cooler is the plate style (not the tube style). "

Why is this?

I have bought a tube style cooler w/ a mounted fan. It's actually two
radiators stacked with the tubes running from core to core.

Based on the above advice, I had wanted a plate style cooler (Kymco?) with a
fan. However, I am having a hard time finding one locally, and am up against
a wall time-wise. I leave for Jerome on Wedensday.

BTW, I am retaining my stock cooling system by adding a pancake adaptor at
the oil filter. So any cooling this external cooler is doing, I see as being
that much better. But a what cost ($) . . .

Please tell me go ahead and install, or tell me OH GOD NO! lol

Thanks
