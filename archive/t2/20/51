Subject: Yard Report - Southern Maryland

Sad news - going from one junk yard to another Saturday noon, I hit a tire 
on the road.  The tire broke off the '73 FORD truck in front of me, and I 
did not react properly...

I saw a spray of 'something' that came from the underside of the truck, and 
I slowed down slightly.  Only slightly.

The truck then commenced to throw up a shower of sparks from the underside, 
where the front wheel broke off.  The truck headed into the ditch, and I was 
slowing a bit more.  But my attention was on the specticle.

Well, the big arse tire (caliper and all still attached)went out toward the 
side of the road (I-95) and bounced off a large tanker truck that had pulled 
over for some other reason.  The tire bounced back to me, and I heard the 
impact, but did not see the tire until it was all over.

Moral of the story I want to share - pay attention to dangers on the road, 
not to the specticles.  You dont know what will come out of the woods to 
bite you.  Also, I should have braked more assuredly, not like a wishy-washy 
driver.  I did not want to embarrass myself by braking solidly!!!

Now, the report:::

Junk Yard in Jessup MD had 2 '73 buses; one camper and one hardtop.  Both 
are GONE!!  (I wanted to get the jump seat from the '73 camper, and some of 
that yellow seat covering, but they are GONE..)

But what is still there is a hardtop '77 camper with a like perfect cabinet 
that sits over the engine hatch.  It has the curved top, so it is perfect 
for someone wanting to add to their non-camper.  The side cabinet is also 
there (needs repair), and must be pulled to provide suppoer for one side on 
the back/top cabinet.

Now guys and gals, don't let this one get by you, like I did with that jump 
seat.

ALSO.  New to the yard is a BLUE '80 camper.  The engine is still there, and 
is missing just the distributer cap and wires.  $125 plus core charges for 
the engine is the yard's published price.

I took the door handles from the slider, and a few small items.

The speedometer says 025,000 miles, but the interior says 125,000.

All glass and most bottom side cushions are there, including a smakk wedge 
cushion, and a 2'x2' piece that I can't imagine where it would go.  Front 
seats there, but worn.  Curtains are tan color (I could not  find the front 
curtain.)


Good luck.  HSD gets first crack at location.  Yard IS open on Sunday.  I go 
to church 08:00, back at 10:00.
