Your soggy bottom IS due to the 009.  Take the 009 out, fix your vacuum 
advance mechanism on the 205 (assuming it's the correct model for your 
engine) and put it back in!  This will help you with your economy, soggy 
bottom, and it'll give you power where your 009 doesn't.  The slow 
acceleration you mentioned is specifically why you have the vacuum 
advance.  With the 205 (or whatever) you have an 009 PLUS the vacuum 
which gives you power across the whole engine rpm band.  This story has 
been told MANY times yet people keep sticking the 009 in and wondering 
why they have bad performance... If you want more info on why the vacuum 
is better, just ask...

don't know much about the carb... sorry :)
