Subject: Looking For Distributor

Hey, Folks.  I am looking for the correct vacuum advance unit for my 74 Bus
w/1800 engine, but I'm not having much luck with my usual sources. The part
numbers are:
                VW   021-905-205N       BOSCH 0231 181 005

Does anyone know where I can find one of these? Or does anyone have one in
good shape that they want to sell? BTW, there are NO bone yards in my region
that have any AC VW's. Already checked that out.

Regards,
Dave
