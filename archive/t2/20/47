Subject: Cylinder Head Temp Sender Wire

I just installed a cylinder head temp gauge and sender with the VDO
Sender, Installation Kit and 600 degree gauge.
I've been searching the archives and came up with this.
---------------------------
The Question:
My real question is when I installed the sensor I hooked up the (heat
sensor wire) the to wires going
to the gague, but I ran out of wire so I added about 2-3 feet of wire to
the orignal wire that came with the VDO gague. Will adding this wire give
me false readings??

He got his response:
If you add it at the gauge end, it shouldn't change the readings
appreciably as long as there is no resistance in the wire you added.
---------------------------
Now for my question:
How long does it take to start getting a reading on the temp gauge?
Is this true about adding extra wire length?
