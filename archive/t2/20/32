According to Bentley, the 1976 Bus had a 1970cc=20
(2.0L) engine, with a bore of 94mm, and a stroke of 71mm.
with electronic fuel injection.

Also the engine was a GD code, with a compression ratio of 7.3
Rated at 70 HP (-at-) 4200 rpm

Just happened to have the Bentley next to the computer.
Hope this helps
