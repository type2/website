Another way to find TDC on #1 is to rotate the crank until the TDC mark
is aligned with the case seam, then crawl under and wiggle the rockers
on #1.  If both have a bit of play you are on the right TDC and you can go
ahead and adjust.  If not, rotate the engine one full turn and wiggle again.

I do the wiggle test on each cylinder before I check it, just to make sure
that I haven't had a brain freeze and rotated the engine the wrong direction.

If the setting has tightened so much that all clearance is gone at TDC, 
you have more serious problems than a valve adjustment will cure.

Amen to that.  I have a wide one that I use just for valve covers.  Doesn't
even scratch the paint.

I don't generally do that.  A ratchet on the generator nut is generally
enough leverage to turn the engine easily, even with the spark plugs
in.

Buy a stack of valve cover gaskets (they're cheap) and replace them
every time the cover is off.  I use Hylomar on the valve cover side of the
gasket and nothing on the head side.  Cleans up nicely when you change
the gasket.
