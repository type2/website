Just replaced the drag link on my '73 auto and wanted to pass on a little 
information. 
Tried the pickle fork after soaking both joints with penetrating oil for a 
few days. The rear joint came apart fairly easily after about 50 whacks with 
a hammer on the pickle fork. 
The front joint refused to budge, even with mild heat applied from a propane 
torch. 
Went to Sears and bought their smallest 2-arm gear puller (46905) for $24.95. 
It looked to be too long as the towing eye under the driver's side appeared 
to be in the way. I moved the two arms on the puller to their alternate 
holes. The puller shaft then fit through the middle of the towing eye and a 
few turns on the shaft with a ratchet and the front joint popped loose.
Hope this is of some help to someone; I've gotten a ton of good info from the 
digest. Thanks!
Eric in Miami.
