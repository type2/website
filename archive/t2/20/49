Subject: Re: [T2] misadventures of a vw mechanic wannabe

I replaced my fuel lines a couple weeks ago, same thing 
happened to me. "it's got an electric fuel pump, the key 
isn't on, so the gas shouldn't spill out" haha! 
I found that a 3/8 drive socket extension makes a great 
plug with or without a clamp.
As for cleaning gas off of the driveway, I pulled out an 
electric fan, put it on high and aimed it at the spilled 
gas. Evaporates the gas and blows fumes away from me.
