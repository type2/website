Subject: Re: [T2] Bad Valves?

Paulo:
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but if the heads have some miles on them,
say more than 30,000 miles, they are probably going to need new exhaust valve
guides at the very least. And maybe new exhaust valves. The guide to stem
clearance should be pretty small, maybe .004-.006 in. Check it with a dial
indicator mounted to the head and measure the movement at the valve head. The
clearance can be wear in the guides or stem wear or both. If you change the
guides, you always must recut the seats, because the guides are never perfectly
concentric.
Most of this work is usually beyond the scope of the backyard/ home mechanic.
There are many shops that can do a good job of this and quite a few that do a
poor job.
Failure to pay attention to these details will likely doom your engine to a
short life.
