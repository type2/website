A friend of mine made an arrangement to trade her fastback for a bug with a 
Canadian.  We drove the fastback up to Vancouver BC, met and swapped cars, 
and drove the grey bug  back to WA state.  I don't think she remembered to 
say anything at the border.  There was some paperwork she did have to do to 
get it a WA title, but no big deal.   You might ask the state you are going 
to title it in about that.   

The bug she got was really rusty, but ran good.  She calls it Bondo, James 
Bondo.  Some time later the motor seized, and funny thing is I dissasembled 
it a couple weeks a go.  Still a 1500, needs rings.  1500 rings are pricey, 
ouch.   Heads failed the leak down test miserably.  rods bearing could use 
replacement, not trashed though, end play ok, looks good inside, give it a 
top end rebuild.  oh ya, it seized from excess carbon between the heads and 
pistons.  wierd, huh.  was it running rich maybe?
