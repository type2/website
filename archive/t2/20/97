Subject: Carb Farts

Could someone explain to me what causes carb farts, (sorry, only know
it as that, I'm sure there is a better name then that) and what is
needed to fix the problem.  I just recently installed a 1700 dual carb
engine in my Bus that has this problem - just on one side that I can
tell.

Thanks,

Kevin
