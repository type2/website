Subject: Wiring VDO Cylinder Head temp.

I just purchased and *almost* installed a VDO cylender head temp gauge.
The sending unit is the type that goes under the spark plug on #3.
There are two wires coning out of the sender into a connector, there is a
connector that plugs into the sender connector and two wires,  one black
and one red (I'm going to assume that the black is ground).
I ran the pair of wires and connected them to the only two terminals on
the gauge, red to + and black to - (ground earth symbol).
I'm aparrently the second owner of this gauge because I didn't find
wiring instructions in the parts envelope.
I am assuming that this gauge isnt nuclear powered and will require
power.
So how does this bubba hook up?
I haven't hooked 12 volt to anything yet, but it has to get power from
some source.
Gauge kit # 310-901, 1-232-901-22d
