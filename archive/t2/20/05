Subject: Flicker

Interesting experience this evening. I started my bus and turned on the
headlights. At idle the headlights and dash lights appeared normal, but when
I revved the engine they began to flicker-- go bright then dimmer, then
bright again, then dimmer, then normal. At idle they returned to normal
again. This continued while driving, but very intermittently.

I'm thinking voltage regulator? Any other ides?

Thanks,
