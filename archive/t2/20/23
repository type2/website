Subject: 70 Sportsmobile Handling (Long)

Hey everyone,

I purchased a 70 Sportsmobile camper about 3 weeks ago.
I checked the archives/library about handling issues,
but thought I would ask anyway, to get real world experience

I know these buses dont handle like my F*rd van does,
but give me your thoughts on what else I can do to make
it handle better, especially in the wind.

I have a 71 Westy, and this one handles pretty much like it.
Winds really move both of them around, esp over 50 mph.
PO put Monroe Shocks on it, is KYB, Boge, or others better?

I have new Yokohama 356 195R14 D tires. They helped a lot.
I am running 30 front, 40 rear.  Are there better pressures
to help the swaying.
The front end is all tight, except there is a small "click"
in what seems to be the steering box when moving
from center.  Will adjustment help, or is a different box
in order?

Does a rear sway bar help much?

Also if anyone has seen a Sportsmobile interior light
cover (5", plastic, 3 holding prongs, Lo-Volt Inc)
please let me know as I have one missing.

Also, the 71 Westy will be for sale soon
Northern KY, Greater Cincinnati area.

Thanks to all for this wonderful resource
Chuck
