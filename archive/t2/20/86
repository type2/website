Subject: Buses Near The Bay

Hey Folks,
      Just a reminder, if you can't make it to Buses By The Sea next
weekend, or if you really like camping and can go two weekends in a row, I
am trying to revive the old "Buses Near The Bay" event at Point Lookout
state park in southern Maryland, Sept. 28-29-30. Click on the link below for
more info. Thanks, Jeff
