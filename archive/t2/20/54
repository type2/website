Subject: Mounting several accessory relays

Dear Listees.

To any who are interested, I have FOR SALE or TRADE, about eight moulded 
plastic mounting cum connector blocks (designed for captive 6.3mm female 
spade connectors), which can accommodate upto SIX accessory relays. The 
blocks have four 5mm screw holes to mount them on a bulkhead or bracket.

I have two of these connector blocks, mounted unobtrusively on home made 
aluminium brackets, beneath the steering column support bracket, of my 1973 
VW Type 2.

Regards.
        Nigel A. Skeet
