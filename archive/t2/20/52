Horrible surprise on "Tulip" ('73 with auto tranny) when I jacked her up last 
night to adjust the brakes: One rear wheel wobbled freely. I tightened the 
axle nut to take out the extreme looseness. Rotating the wheel produced no 
crunching or squealing noises. 
I assume both bearings and races will need to be replaced. My question is: 
can I possibly continue to drive her for another two weeks and no more than 
120 miles of 35 mph easy driving?
Thanks in advance,
Eric in Miami
