Probably, but be sensitive to sudden increases in noise or vibration level.  I 
had a funny vibration that I couldn't figure out from the back of my '71 that
turned out to be the inner bearing on the left side.  The inner race was in
three pieces.  While sussing this out, I drove a couple of thousand miles
from Montana to Oklahoma and across to SoCal.
