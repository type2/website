> if anyone knows the actual VW name of that seal, or maybe a part number, it
would be greatly appreciated. Once again, its the seal around what I believe is
the main input shaft of the transaxle, directly behind the throw out bearing
looking at the clutch assembly with the motor pulled. Thanks!!

I believe it is part # 113 311 113A
