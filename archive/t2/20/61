Subject: Argh! Rust!

Hi all,

This weekend I started work on the rust under the center window on my '75
camper. The rust was worse than I expected and I now have a nice long hole
between the bodywork and the window rubber 2/3 of the way along the
underneith of the window.

The rust has been treated and the bodywork primed, all I need now is to fill
and finish the job.

I was wondering if anyone with experience in this area could give me some
pointers to filling the gap between the bodywork and the window rubber. Will
the usual gause and filler do the job, or will I need to patch in some new
metal under the window rubber to help support the window?

This is the first time I've had to deal with the window rubbers in my rust
killing, so any tips or sugguestions would be most helpful.

Thanks,

Paul
