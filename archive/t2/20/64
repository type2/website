Subject: Re: Fuel injection?

Greetings,
  Here is a copy of some questions I had about installinng a late model
Vanagon fuel injection set-up on a 74 bus with a carbed 1800.  Currently
using a progressive Weber and a 009 which I really dont like.
If anyone  has any info and would be willing to review this and reply I
would really appreciate it.
Thanks,
Ed Maikranz
