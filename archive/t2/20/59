Subject: Valve Adjustment question!

Hello:

I am fairly new to the VW world and am attempting my first valve adjustment 
this weekend with the help of "How to Keep Your VW Alive." However, I am 
confused about one point in the process - TDC.  To get #1 to firing 
position, do I simply line up the paint mark with the crankcase crack - and 
that's it? The book mentions a file mark on the distributor rim, which mine 
does not have. Also, do I use the paint mark on the left or the right (I 
have three). I appreciate any help. Thanks.
