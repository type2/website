hello all listees
Another question about my 72 westy that has been an
ongoing project for a lot longer than I ever expected.

I put a 67 bug engine in in December of last year,
replacing the stock type 4.  It started up and ran
just fine(I didn't have the proper engine tin so I
only ran it for a few seconds).  Due to unforseen
circumstances I had to abandon the project and the bus
has sat since then idle.  

My question is this;  is there anything I should be
concerned about regarding letting the bus sit for so
long without doing any type of pre-storage
preparations?  I have discovered that I have to pull
the engine and have the gas tank refurbished, but am
wondering about the engines internals.

thanks
Kurt Rogers
