I've noticed this on my '71.  I think that this is the overvoltage relay kicking in in the voltage regulator.  It seems to do it more in the weeks 
after after a fresh battery is installed.  A voltmeter revealed that it was cycling from about 12.7 to 13.7 volts.  You should do a voltmeter 
check too to make sure that you aren't getting too much voltage.
