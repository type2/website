If you use a non-hardening sealant (Hylomar, or heavy grease) you don't need to use any abrasive to
clean the cover.  A paper towel will clean it up fine.  I think that keeping the paint coating on the
sealing surface helps prevent leaks, at least if you have newish covers.  I prefer the Hylomar to grease
as it is non-soluble in oil.

There are a remarkable variety of timing marks on various VW pulleys.  A '69 should have three
notches on the pulley.  The leftmost is TDC, the rightmost is 10 degrees BTDC, and the one
in-between is 7.5 degrees BTDC.  This assumes that you have the correct pulley, which is a bit
of a long shot on a 30 year-old car with an appetite for engines.  My '71 has a stamped TDC mark on
the front (FIF) side of the pulley and a single notch at 5 degrees ATDC.
