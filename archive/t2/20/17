This is caused by two things. The most suspect is the idle cutoff solinoid,
the cylindrical item screwed into the carb with the electric fitting. Take
it out and use a battery to activate it to see if it is working. Replace it
if not and that is likely your problem.

If that is working ok, then I would next confirm float level and mixture. 

Always in these cases the ignition comes from hot carbon in the combustion
chambers. Dieseling is not totally unappropriate to describe this. If you
can find Lubro-Moly Ventil Sauber use that in the gas to help clean things
up. Otherwise, most FLAPS will have the Chevron Techron addative, not the
$3.99 stuff but the high strength type costing $13 + or -. Add this stuff
to half a tank of fuel, run it till your down to reserve, then fill with
fresh fuel and reset mixture. The improvement can be great in many cases
but if the buildup is large only sleight improvement might be noted.
