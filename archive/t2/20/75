Subject: Re: [T2] rear wheel bearings

Eric,

On my cross-country trip in June,  I had a vibration that started in
Oregon, drove it to Seattle where Doktor Tim pointed out it was in a rear
wheel, checked that wheel and tightened the big nut.  Drove to San
Francisco, no problems.  Drove on to Fresno and staarted to get a
*different* vibrational noise.  No dice on diagnosis.  Drove on to LA and
had the rear axlew nut loose again.  Pulled a rear hub in a junkyard there
and replaced the whole bearing carrier (Vanagon only... on Bay's the
carrier is welded in) Outer bearing, inner race was cracked straight
across.

Moral of the story is that I did better than 1,000 miles at highway speeds
in the same situation as you are in, but ***YMMV***!!!!!  Replace those
bearings ASAP!!!
