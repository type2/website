Subject: What is it???

Hello List,

I have this black plastic, flat, S-shaped tube that is
about 20" in length. VW part # 113 819 533. I have no
Idea what VW it goes to, or where it goes on the car.
Any help would be appreciated. If it turns out that I
don't need it ( I would like to know what it is first)
then I guess It is Free to who ever needs it. Let me
know what it is first before I decide. Thanks!!!
