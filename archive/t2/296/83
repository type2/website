Subject: The fuel pump was bad

Many thanks to those who responded to my post-Thanksgiving blues.

I did measure the voltage that was available at the fuel pump wires.

Anyway, I managed to install the new fuel pump today and turned the
engine.

There was some form of combustion (the exhaust system got warm and
water came out of the catalytic converter), but the engine didn't
catch. I've been adjusting the distributor to no avail.

Tomorrow, I'll check the air intake (again) and the fuel pressure
regulator. This is a fuel injected system, so it is fast becoming
complicated...  I just hope I don't have to change the injectors...
