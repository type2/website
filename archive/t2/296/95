Subject: Getting rid of the 009 on my 79 2L, but what should I get?

I have the GE 2.0L engine, with dual Dell'orto 36' double barrels. There is a 
vacuum port on one of the carbs for use with a vacuum dizzy. I have an 009 in 
there now, but what should I do? I am not sure that the Dizzy spec'ed for my 
year engine will work, because of the fact is was originally F.I., but again, 
I don't really know. Up until two weeks ago, I didn't really know the 009 was 
a crappy distributor to have in there in the first place!

Any help/info/opinions/etc. are welcome and appreciated. You can just scoot 
me a P-mail if you wish.

Thanks,
