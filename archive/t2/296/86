Subject: Toyota pickup to Splittie pickup.

Just thought I'd share!
While the pages are no longer on the site, due to the WONDER of the
internet, you can see the cached pages of the Toyota PU to Splittie PU.  Go
to
www.google.com and search on  "site:www.sevwc.com Toy Wagen Project"

When the results come up click on the "Cached" links.

I even found cached links to my old websites that way.
