Subject: Re: [T2] How do Retractable Seatbelts Lock?

I had the same problem with a pair of brand new belts that I bought from
Beetle-Mex, to install into my 71 standard beetle.  The little ball bearing
doo-hickeys (inertia sensors) prevented the belts from ever being pulled out
from the retracting mechanism, so I removed them, and now the belts work
fine.  I can easily re-install them if I can figure out how to make the
belts work properly with them installed.  As I have previously posted to the
vintagevw list, this modification leaves me somewhat uncomfortable, such
that I test the belts by giving them a hard yank every time I drive the car,
but so far, they have not failed to lock up when I so test them.  The belts
in my T*y*t* truck are similar in construction, they have the ball bearing
doo-hickeys, but they work just fine, with the ball bearing doo-hickeys in
place.  Me thinks the Germans flubbed this one.

I acquired 2 rear seat Jetta shoulder belts for my 70 bus front. There were
2 ball bearing dohickeys that made the belts totally unworkable, so I had to
pull them out. I had to pop the plastic covers off to do this, but of course
I didn't go anywhere near the homicidal permanent springs.  Now, the belts
lock as soon as you pull on them quickly, but are free at all other times. I
guess the ball bearings were to sense moving off vertical or something,
because I could not get them to release the belts. They slid right out
though, and I could put them back in, if I could find the suckers.  The
belts appear to be safe without them, although I hate to second guess the VW
gods. Tom
