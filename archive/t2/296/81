A lot of the time backfires come from leaks in the exhaust, but I
usually have heard these when going down an incline. I'm a little
stumped as to why it backfired. One thing you should know is that
sometimes the backfire can force the "flapper thingie" in your afm to
slam back possibly breaking or sticking close. I would check this
first. Hopefully you can get the bus to start again & then drive it
easily home to look into the backfire issues better. Take a look there
first & report back.
