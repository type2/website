Subject: [T2] Re: Exhaust - what if?

I've always wondered about this:  On and early bay (or, for that matter, a
67 or earlier), could one install a 2 outlet beetle muffler, and then
install 2 bus exhaust pipes, one going off to the left as normal and one
going off to the right?  I can imagine that you might have to fab/weld some
sort of supports for the brackets to attach to, but would that be the extent
of it?  Not that it would make a whole lot of difference, but, apparently,
the difference in backpressure between the one outlet and two outlet
mufflers is worth about 3 HP.  Probably doesn't occur at a useful point in
the powerband, though.
