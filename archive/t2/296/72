Subject: Drivers door weight?

I have a nasty dent just in front of the drivers door about headlight
height. Need to remove the door to do a good job of smoothing the metal
because I cant reach around the door with the dolly and see the other
side to work the hammer. I don't have a helper to remove the door. I'm
thinking of building some kind of dolly to support the door during
removal and install. Anyone out there know how much the door weighs? Any
good ideas on supporting the thing while doing the job alone?
Thanks,
Tom
