Subject: Awesome Jack

yup, I bought the same jack at COSTCO and it was
designed for dropping VW engines.  I took out the
engine and tranny together and was able to support the
tranny by a little webbing and could roll the jack and
engine around easily.  putting the engine back in was
also a snap.  highly recommend.
