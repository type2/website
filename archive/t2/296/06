Subject: Re: How do Retractable Seatbelts Lock?

	Wondrous List:

	Kudos to Neil Trulock for posting the link to How Stuff Works - if'n
it saves somebody an eye, we all need to bow, scrape and curtsey to Neil...

	The diagram contained within the article shows that loathesome
coiled spring that nearly took me orb ("Hyar! Come and get me, ya spawn of
the evil one.  I've got something for you this time!").  It also shows quite
nicely the locking pawl mechanism, and the importance of maintaining the
"levelness" of the whole reel, both in a FiF/RiR direction, as well as a
side to side (StS?)...  If you ever get a chance to abscond with set of them
at the 'yards - spend a few minutes monkeying around with them in different
"tilts" and prove to yourself how the pawl works - notice how it would lock
up if you managed a complete 360 rollover.    

	Even though I still shrivel in cowardice, fear and loathing in
general WRT to the feeeelthy monsters, I have deduced that the orientation
aspect is important to a successful install, having retrofitted them to
several of my Type 3s, and my '72 Weekender and '73 Deluxe.  The reels in my
two '73 914s are mounted somewhat off the "perfect orientation" and as a
result, cannot be swiftly withdrawn from their recepticles - pull them too
fast and they lock, but pull them purposely and with finesse and they yield
willingly to the master's touch...

	I'm going to have to call my shrink now, I'm starting to feel a bit
queasy...  Aaaaaaargh!  Noooooooooooooooooooo!  They're coming over the
wire!  Flashback!  Blow the claymores!  Blow them now!

	Sniff!  Whimper! Mommy!
