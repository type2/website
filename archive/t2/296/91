Tom,


Here is what I did....

Bought a couple of fairly hefty pulleys and some nice rope.

put the car in the garage and opened the doors about 1/2 way.
Mounted one pulley so that it hung right above the rear of the 
door.  Mounted the other pulley just forward of where the opened
vent would be.

Wrapped a couple of old t-shirts around the top rear and front and
then tied the rope around them.  Pulled the ropes tight and then tied them
off to the side of the garage very securely.

Removed the bolts on the door....it may have sagged about an inch or so, 
but was very easy to move a little while doing it by myself since the 
ropes supported most of the weight.  The door then swung back out of the
way about 8 inches from the bus and I could work the area around the 
hinges very easily...could have a pulled the door toward the side of the 
garage a little more and tied it off with another rope also.

Makes it really easy to put back on too!!!

Total investment for both sides of the bus was probably $15.00 or 
less...get plenty of rope!...be sure an use some *big* eyebolts
for the pulley and put them thru the studs in the ceiling.  The screw 
end of the eye bolts were probably about 2-3""  long.

Cheers, dave
