Subject: Good set of 2L core heads (square port 79-83.5) heads for sale

List,

I have a set of bead blasted MATCHING AMC heads for sale.  They need work.
One head has a small crack between the valves on both cylinders, and the
other head has a crack at the spark plug hole.  No problem for a head
rebuilder.  These are the good heads that have the built in head gasket, so
no sealing ring is needed, just a barrel shim.


$100 and shipping.
