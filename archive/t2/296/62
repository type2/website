Subject: Using later FI ECU, AFM and airbox in 75 FI bus-compatible?

I am having a 75 FI motor rebuilt, and the mechanic Jon Kleckner points
out that it has the earliest throttle switch/temp sensor unit located
UNDER the airbox.  This is unreliable I understand, and was replaced by
VW within a year....We'd like to put in a later harness (77or78), ECU,
AFM, and airbox;   I have a spare 78 ECU and AFM.
-- I have an airbox with the microswitch on top of the throttle and one
without the microswitch....the question is, since this is a 1800 cc
motor, how does the "2000cc AFM and ECU" affect the burning of the
lesser volume?  Is it a simple case of "less draw by smaller engine=
less AFM flow and this will result in an OK mix/burn?  When was the
external microswitch on top of the airbox used, and what AFM/ECU works
with it?
