Tom,

While they're not light ( never weighed them, I dare say David's probably
right on his figure ), they can be managed singlehanded witbout support
mechanisms if you need to.

I've stripped the doors off a '79 & a '75, and refitted the doors on a '72
manually by myself, and while I wouldn't say it was easy, it's doable.

Wind the window all the way down, so that you can use the window frame to
support the door with one hand or sholder while you're releasing or starting
the final/first bolts, and while you're aligning the door ( MUCH harder job,
preferably done somewhere that people can't hear you swear ;^).

Anyway, it ain't easy, but if I can do it myself, I'm sure you can, with a
little bit of grunting and swearing.

Hope this is of use.

All the best,
