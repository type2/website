Subject: Portable propane heater report

We had forecasts of ice and snow this past week here in Middle TN. My 
childhood was on a TN mountain where our power went our frequently leaving 
us with  no heat beyond the fireplace. due to ice storms. We don't get alot 
fo snow - we get ice.  My current house has no fireplace so i was concerned 
the ice might knock out the power and leave us cold. It was time to buy a 
heater..

I didn't want a kerosene heater inside my house (shop okay, not the house). 
Propane was my preferred solution.

I bought a Mr. Heater MH9B 9,000 BTU Portable Buddy Propane Heater at 
Lowe's for $79 or so.

Let me report I am VERY happy with this heater,.

It starts easily. Heats well enough to keep me warm in the garage. Should 
heat a room in the house just fine and best of all will heat our Westfalia 
for winter camping - someday when our Westy moves under it's own power 
again... <grin>

Supposed to run 6-8 hours on a $2.50 propane tank and 80-110 hours on a 
large propane tank from a BBQ grill with a hose they want to sell you and 
me separately.

If you need to heat you van, heat your shed while you work, etc. give this 
one a look.

It's got a tip over shut off feature and a carbon monoxide safety (don't 
trust your life to this of course).

Enjoy.FWIW.
