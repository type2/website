Subject: Awsome jack perfect for installing and uninstalling vw engines

Hello List,

 I found a jack the other day that almost looks like
it was designed and made to install and uninstall vw
engines. I am sure that some of you have seen it. It
is sold at your local Sams Club. Here is a link to the
description.

Just highlight that whole link and copy it in your
address bar. It is only $79.37. 

Let me know what you think of it. It is more expensive
than bolting an old fly wheel to a heavy duty jack but
I am definitely considering it since I don't have a
good jack and am in the market for one. I will put it
on my Christmas whish list.

Just thought I would pass this Christmas gift idea to
y'all. 

Have a great day!

David Kelly
