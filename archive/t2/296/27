Your link timed out. I had to go to www.samsclub.com and then do a search for
the item. It is Item: 288826.

I looked at this style of jack at Harbor Freight. This one appears to be the
same or close. I found the one at Harbor to be worthless to use to r+r engines
since only one end has casters.

You have lift one end to move it. Once you put a weight on it, it no longer is
moveable. If you look in the Samsclub pic, you will see the supports on the
opposite end of the casters. [unless it has casters I can't see.....]
