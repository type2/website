Subject: re: Awsome jack perfect for installing and uninstalling vw

I Just used one like the one Sam's has to remove the engine from my 81
Westy it worked great.
I got mine from Checker Auto for $59.99.
It's an ALLTRADE TOOLS
Motorcycle Jack:
Part Number: 410774 $59.99
It's not as fancy as the ones at Sam's or Sears, but works great for VW
engines.
It has 2 wheels in the front that do not swivel & 2 caster wheels in the rear
that do swivel, the end where the handle is.
My Westy is in the driveway & once the engine was out I rolled the engine on
the jack about 35 feet to my garage so I could work on it in the garage.

Sears also has one but it is even more the the one Sam's has.
Mike

Hello List,

I found a jack the other day that almost looks like
it was designed and made to install and uninstall vw
engines. I am sure that some of you have seen it. It
is sold at your local Sams Club. Here is a link to the
description.

http://www.samsclub.com/eclub/main_shopping.jsp?coe=3D0&oidPath=3D0%3a-15=
221%3a-18349%3a660696&mt=3Da&n=3D0&BV_SessionID=3D_SC_1921116001.10391542=
20_CS_&BV_EngineID=3Dccdhadcglmmfhlhcfkfcfkjdgoodflh.0

Just highlight that whole link and copy it in your
address bar. It is only $79.37.

Let me know what you think of it. It is more expensive
than bolting an old fly wheel to a heavy duty jack but
I am definitely considering it since I don't have a
good jack and am in the market for one. I will put it
on my Christmas whish list.

Just thought I would pass this Christmas gift idea to
y'all.

Have a great day!
