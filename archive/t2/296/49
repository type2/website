Subject: Lifts

The sams club lifts, while at a great price are the ones we use in my
buddies motorcycle shop to hold up bikes.  The wheels are only on one side,
and touch the ground when you lift the other side.
You could probably add casters to all four sides, and use it for VW engines,
but make sure that a few of the casters can be locked.
