Subject: Wanted Transmission/Ring & Pinion for 78 Bus in Los Angeles

Hi All,

My trans is at the rebuilders - Transaxle Engineering/Jeff Field in
Chatsworth, CA (Los Angeles Area)

They say I need a used Ring and Pinion (among other things) for my trans and
it is almost 1/2 again the cost of the rebuild. If anyone has one in the Los
Angeles area (or can get it here quickly), I'd be happy to buy it from you!

Thanks much,

Mark

'78 'Blue Bus' (no trans)
'83 Honda XL600R (actually running now)
