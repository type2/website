Subject: Re: [T2] Installation of Espar Heater

Hi Ted,

Maybe I can help. I believe the Espar was the American name of the German
Eberspacher heater. I'm in the process of installing an Eberspacher BN4 and
have learned quite a bit doing it.

Give me a little description of your heater and I'll see if they match. If
so I may be able to help, not by going to Chicago but with info and advice.
