Subject: Re: [T2] Portable propane heater report

Hello Everybody  Do they make a small heater that is both propane and 
electric??  later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service salem Va  
PS  Kerosene heaters can be real dangous in a garage. I had one start a fire 
in a small garage and liked to burn the shop and split westy to the ground 
due to a gas line leak on the westy. Open flames in shops can be scarry, 
becareful.
