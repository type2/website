Subject: Replacement Panel for a 72 BUS!!!!!!

Does anyone have or know where i can get a replacenment panel for my 1972 
bus. Im looking for the entire front end piece. From the bottom of the 
window frame down to the floor. I need a "decent" one if it is used. PLEASE 
PLEASE help me out. The only ones sold through the vendors are the 73+ ones. 
Someone must know where to get it! Ok. I hope to hear some good news. Thanks
