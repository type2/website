Hello James and List    Sometimes the backfires are a sigh of trobles too 
come. The big vacumm hoses just about always blow off where they hook to the 
bellows( curvey rubber connector between the air filter and intake) I have 
had to glue these in before .3m wheatherstip adhesive. The backfire could 
becaused by pts., condser, coil, bad wire connector, air flow meter. valves. 
need to check over good. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import
