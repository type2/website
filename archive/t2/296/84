Motocycle/ATV jacks are really great for pulling and putting back the
engine.

I basically stripped the old engine and reassembled the new one (tin,
intake and exhaust etc) on such a jack. It allows you to easily access
the underside of the engine which is great for engines with
thermostats and exhaust ports on the underside.

The only problem is the cost (normally >$100). I managed to find one
on offer at the local Kragen.
