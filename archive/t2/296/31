Greetings --

Have you ever realized too late that you should have left something alone?  Driving at night, I lamented the dim yellow light illuminating the speedo and fuel gauge.  So, I did my amateur contortionist act, feet up and head down, to investigate the bulbs and to devise some more effective lighting.  I discovered that the bulbs were basically like Christmas lights, a slender bulb with two wire contacts inserted into a twist on connector.  I twisted out one unit, inspected it, then twisted it back in.  I pulled the headlight switch.  No more light from the bulb.  Hmmm...upon closer inspection, it appeared that there was a ground clip or something on the plastic housing the bulb was in, but I couldn't get the plastic housing to stay in the proper orientation for the ground to complete the circuit.  Luckily, just to the right, there was another identical bulb and housing to light the heat control lever diagram.  So I inspected how it was attached, twisted IT out, and then couldn't get it to go back the way it was either!  So now, alas, I am without the proverbial paradise by the dashboard lights entirely.  Anybody have any advice, anecdotes, or ridicule to sling my way?  Thanks.
