Subject: leak  down again

Dave, Karl:  Thanks for the input.

Fascinating!   I hope I am doing something drastically wrong in my measurement.

Dave: Were your measurements done with the engine at operating temp?

As I think I mentioned, the instructions that came with my gauge said 
to only  test with the piston down to avoid having the compressed air 
move the piston and perhaps crank the engine.

In thinking about this, I don't see what difference it makes. Should 
not leakage past the rings or past the valves happen regardless of 
where the piston sits?
