Subject: Brake servo rebuild kit?

Hey all-

To my great dismay it seems like my booster isn't working right. My problem
- when I apply the brake I get an instant increase in idle, leading to an
eventual stall.  Sounds just like a massive vacuum leak.  All my lines,
hoses, etc. are new/and or in great shape. Everything is tight.  I know the
servo is a pricey bit of metal (200 and up for a rebuilt one, near 400 for a
new one...lol), so I've been thinking of rebuilding it.  How hard is this?
Should I just opt for the rebuild, close my eyes and grab my wallet?  I've
got access to a garage, proficient mechanical skills, so I figure I could do
the rebuild on my own. Plus I might learn something.  But is there a kit out
there?  I can't seem to find one...  Any input would be greatly appreciated
by both me and my unstoppable bus.

Thanks -
