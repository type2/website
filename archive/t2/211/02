Subject: Re: [T2] leak down test


My 78 t4 was tested with the same set up(made it myself also).

Tested with piston at *top*.

all were about 98% except #1 that was at about 85%...could feel air coming 
out of the tail pipe on that one, so I know it is a bad exh valve.

Compression on #1 &3 was about 70 psi and #2 & 4 was about 130 psi.

It will still run 75+ on the interstate....

Cheers ,dave
