No. 1, verify gauge function on a good running motor.

No. 2, verify no compartment or tin leaks. Make sure the perimeter seal is 
sealed and the hole under the battery is blocked, even with just copious 
adhesive and a custom trimmed ply board.  Make sure there are no birds or 
bees nests blocking the cooling air intakes at the upper rear sides. Verify 
the rear hatch seal is functional. This one seems the only logical 
diagnosis that would affect all engines.

No. 3, verify what the timing curve is doing. Verify your TDC procedure as 
if somehow you are setting all engines wrong, it would account for the same 
problem will all engines.

Do a compression test on this one, the vacuum gauge says it has valve 
problems, too.

Again, do a compression test on this one, the vacuum gauge says it has 
valve problems, too.

Of course, you plugged the booster port at the manifold for testing??????
