Mike,

You can remove the hubs and rotors as an assembly you know.  :)  After 
replacing my (original?) bearings the first time, they have seemed to fail 
more frequently.  I always carry spares now, one inner and one outer front 
bearing plus new seals, and enough tools to do the job on the side of the 
road.  I've had an outer front bearing fail twice just since I've been in 
Dallas (the last six years).  I don't think I'm doing anything wrong as I 
never had problems like that in the Mustang which had the same style 
bearings (before I upgraded to later, sealed hubs).  I suspect the quality 
of the replacement parts, but I also think water might be getting into the 
left front hub through the speedometer cable assembly as it has been the 
left side all but one time that failed, and there is a lot more rain in 
Dallas than there was in San Diego, where I bought my bus.  Anyway, spare 
bearings and seals take up very little space and give me a lot of peace of 
mind.
