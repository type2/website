Thanks, Terry..
Yes, I have already bought an Binks knock-off, some time ago.  =20
I am not sure what the "bounce" is, either. They mentioned it on this =
one
site (one of you guys posted it) where they are selling HVLP painting
systems. Basically, they are saying that a lot of the paint goes where =
it is
not supposed to go, and then some of it comes back down as dust. I have =
a
good area to vent to.. Is there a minimum CFM that you would recommend? =
I
guess that a lot of this dust would be ducted away by a strong enough =
air
evacuation system. As for the "viscuine", is that the heavy semi-opaque
plastic sheeting that comes on a roll? If not, where would I get that?  =
