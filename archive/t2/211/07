There is very little cylinder wear at the bottom of the stroke.
On a gas engine, cylinder wear is always at the top of the ring travel. The
rings will wear the wall enough to form a ridge. On cars with a solid block,
you sometimes need a ridge reamer to get the pistons out. The ridge reamer
cuts down the wall.
