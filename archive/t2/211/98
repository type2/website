You will probably get a max of 7 - 8 hours out of that battery. the next 
one up (group 27) gets 10 hours

I have a few questions for you folks with the Mobileaire "Iceless"
icebox.
was about 90F in the van.  I then checked the temp in the fridge this
morning.  It was exactly 40F.  My aux. battery voltage was down to
8.7V.  Is
this normal?  Is it OK for the fridge to use about 25% of the battery
capacity in12-15 hours? Thanks.
