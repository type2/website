The key word here is "could"  It is just as likely that add-on scoops
would make things run hotter.  They did a lot of work on the stock cooling
system and if one wants to second-guess their engineering one would have
to do considerable research before cutting metal.

First question:  how thick is the boundary layer?  Will the scoop even be
in the slipstream where it can get a ram effect?  Note that the stock
inlet on a bay isn't a scoop at all, it faces mostly sideways!
