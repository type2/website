I can attest to the fact that Kumho tires are of good quality.  I have not 
used the 185R15 tire on my bus (it's just too narrow for me, please no 
flames) but I have Kumhos on my Mustang now after hearing my friends rave 
about them.  They handle and wear very well.  I've also used their DOT 
legal roadrace tires with good results.  I would not hesitate to recommend 
Kumhos to anyone.
