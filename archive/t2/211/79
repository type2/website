Subject: 1600 to 2L

I was wondering, don't Ghias have 2L engines for the '71s?  I was thinking about putting one of those in my bus that has a 1600 in it now.

I live in the mountains and I would like more power.  I heard those engines are made to be really low or something, like they don't have the fan shroud that is kind of tall...can I convert it to being like my engine with a fan shroud that comes up and makes it easy to work on?  I heard being pancake style like that makes them hard to work on.

Also what exactly is a stroker engine?  I know it has a different crank/cam setup but how does this affect driving it?

And last but not least, would it be best to go with a five speed tranny if I had a 2L?

Thanks for all the help.
