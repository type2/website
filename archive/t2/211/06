Subject: Re: [T2] My mouse story and a nest.

Last Week I was cleaning out the interior of my 74
westy to make sure I got all of the illegal things
left by the previous owner before I started driving it
on a normal basis. I only found a half a joint under
the back seat. I pulled out the sink cabinet because
there were what looked like mouse droppings under it,
I got it out and there was a mouse hole in the drivers
side wood wall panel. It wasn't a hole that a mouse
made. It looked like it was cut wuth a saw and it
looked like one of those cartoon mousholes off of tom
and jerry or something. Anyways I think someone had a
pet mouse living in the van at some point. The nest
between the wall and the panel was huge. with all of
the little pieces of metal some mouse had like a nice
5 story house. That was a bitch to clean up for sure.
Later,
