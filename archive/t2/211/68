Subject: What is this??? 

Hello list,

When I removed the engine tin that was on my 914
engine I found this hosesticking out. It was connected
to nothing and I have no idea what it went to. Does
any one know what it is?

Any info on it would be much appreciated!


Thanks and have a great day!

David Kelly
