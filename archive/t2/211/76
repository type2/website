I nearly ate my socks, recently when one of these got away from me on eBay..
a NOS ATE brake servo went off for $153.00, only three bucks more than my
bid. I don't know of any rebuild kits, but some places do sell rebuilds on
order, with core exchange. I do know that Bus-Boys had some back ordered,
last I checked. Very pricey. You don't need them to stop and drive the bus,
but you will have to cut a section of hose and put a bolt and clamp on the
end to stop the vacuum leak.  Jan B
