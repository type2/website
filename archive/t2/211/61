Jack

I do leak down tests all the time,, I just tested an engine today,, 95% leakdown 
I have tried to remove the rockers, and test the engine with the piston at BDC
so I don't have to hold it from turning,,,, 
No success,

So, I still loosen off the rocker shaft so I know there is lots of play and the
valves are not being held open,, then I do the test at TDC

I think your engine with 48% is bad,,, no matter what temp it is at!

my current engine is at 60% leak down, all rings leakage, and 23 psi compression
on all 4 cylinders,  starts, runs, drives "fine" until I hit that BIG hill,,,,
then .... "2 SLO 2 BAD" is my motto..... :-)

Yes,, that engine is TIRED. I put it together temporarily, with rings that had
0.090 end gap as that is all I had at the time,,,
