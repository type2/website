Subject: Riviera fridge questions

I have a few questions for you folks with the Mobileaire "Iceless" icebox.
I am getting things tested for our first campout next weekend.  I put a
frozen bottle of water & a can of pop in it at about 4:00PM yesterday.  It
was about 90F in the van.  I then checked the temp in the fridge this
morning.  It was exactly 40F.  My aux. battery voltage was down to 8.7V.  Is
this normal?  Is it OK for the fridge to use about 25% of the battery
capacity in12-15 hours? Thanks.
