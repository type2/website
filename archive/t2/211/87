Warren,

The resevoir is not part of the pressurized brake system.  It is OK to
open it and add brake fluid at any time.  Only if it is empty and air gets
into the pressurized part of the system do you need to bleed again.  As
your disc pads wear, you will have to add a bit of fluid by times.  Be
ready to syringe this fluid out when you replace the pads (AMHIK :)

On an "it's only funny bcause it happened to someone else" note...  I have
heard that if one side of the piston of a dual circuit MC blows its seal,
then it is possible for the MC to push fluid up into the resevoir.  This
reported by a friend on a non-VW.  His quote was "Thar she blows!!"  I
have not experienced this on a VW, and I have had *lots* of MC failures,
but I wanted to get it on record.  If you see fluid coming into your
resevoir when you step on the brakes, then the MC is toast!!!
