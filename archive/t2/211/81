Subject: Help me find an Oil breather hose

The day finally came: my oil breather hose is ruined and I'm stuck (luckily
I'm at home).  I tried the 5 major FLAPS in the area but all they have is
3/4" radiator hose.

Can anyone provide me a source for 22m or 7/8" hose.

This is the state of my hose.  It's the original and the braids have no
strength and the rubber went hard.
