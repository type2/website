Not sure how many times you've cranked it so far but after I change lines
and put everything back together, I poke a screwdriver in the airbox to get
the fuel pump to prime the system.  You can hear it working. It's a long way
from the tank to the pressure regulator.

Did you forgot a connector at the heater fan.  Is the connector to the air
box pushed all the way on?
