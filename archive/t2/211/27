Why not quit listening to the list and go to a NAPA store, I think a
$195.00 gravity feed spray gun is what you need. You do not need a high
dollar *airless system*.
Many times I just drive around to a few backyard body shops and ask what
they're using. 
Check out the cleaning procedures on whatever you buy, simple is better
when you only use the gun twice a year.
