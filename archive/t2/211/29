Subject: Compression test tells all...

Hey there Folks,

Not really a question, but I just wanted to blow off some steam. Hit
the DELETE button now, if your don't want to here me whine. 

I'm writing this at home, when I should be at Transporters by the
Tunnel. Why ??

Because the compression in #3 is 30lbs (ahh... cr(-at-)p). Adding oil
didn't help the reading, so it's valves.

Went to take the bus for a spin last thurday nite and noticed that it
sounded like it was running on 3 cylinders. I had to wait till
yesterday to spend some "quality time" w/ the bus. Checked the
timing, 7.5 degrees. Checked for spark, all four are firing. Ok, so
while some people will dicker w/ some other checks (fuel, etc.), I
pulled the plugs (they didn't look good), and grabbed the compression
tester. I knew to check #3 first as it was at 90#s the last time I
checked (rest were at 110-120).

I saw it coming as the bus has been getting slower on some of the
bigger hills around here ("I never had to use 3rd gear on this hill
before!!"). Peanut Butter has 102,000 miles on the original engine,
and some of the PO weren't easy on her (the more you work on a bus,
the more you learn about it's past). See ran fine for the 300 mile
(roundtrip) to the NH show last month, but she decided to wait till
we got home to let me know that it's time for a rebuild.

Looks like Boston Bob Donalds will be getting a call from me this
week. I probably could get away w/ just a top end rebuild, but I
don't see the economics of not doing it right the first time and be
done w/ it.

Checking the compression on an engine is a sure way to check it's
overall condition. If you're looking to buy a bus, checking the
compression *must* be part of the pre-purchase inspection. If it
isn't you'll be calling your local rebuilder like I am :(

(I guess I'll hafta change my sigline now).

Later...
