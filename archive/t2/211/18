Subject: Re: [T2] leak  down again

My instructions say TDC.  I'm pretty sure that at BDC there is some
overlap where either the exhaust or intake (depending on which BDC) is
slightly open.  I'm remembering something about a scavenging effect
causing it be more efficient but my memory tends to be fuzzy. Know what
I mean?

I tried my leak down tester for the first time today on the remains of a
1600 DP that I bought for the doghouse fan assembly.  95% leak down with
leaks around the cylinder head to cylinder interface.  So I tried every
90 degrees just for S&G's and besides the head leaks, I got leaks out of
the expected valves it seemed like both at 180 degrees out TDC between
exhaust and intake.  Tear down revealed rings on 3/4 side were all lined
up instead of staggered.  No good clues as to why the cylinder head
leakage.  Head bolts seemed to be fairly closely torqued.  Just learning
about these engines.
