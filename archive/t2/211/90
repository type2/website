No, actually it's worse than Freon. Freon is a chlorinated flourocarbon.
Halon is a halogenated chloroflourocarbon. Having gone to chemistry class
before they had such things, I have no idea what the significance of this
is, except that it eats the ozone layer faster than plain CFCs do.

If you're buying a new jetliner or a new army tank, you can still get a
Halon system--the international protocol banning HCFCs allows these two uses
until a new agent that has the same effectiveness is invented even though
they can't make halon anymore--but everyone else has to use different
agents.
