Subject: Mice in the poptop

All this mouse rap- I can relate, but the biggest &(-at-)#^&^$$ in the ass is
when they chewed into my new poptop and screen!  Got in where the poptop
meets the front rack and set up a nest in that gap.  Other places
they've nested is above the front panel in the fiberglass, and in the
space behind the front kick panels.  I've learned to be wary pulling
that panel down and getting a head full of mouse droppings!  With a
veterinary pastologist as a spouse, I hear about Hanta virus all the
time.  We are sure not to leave food in the van when not camping, and I
understand mothballs along the poptop helps.  For the right to life
crowd, Home Depot sells a trap that you wind up and it tosses them into
a holding end; this is fairly tight and cruel; if you use this, pull up
and off the end cover, and make a rectangular cage out of hardware cloth
that wraps around the end.  This can be secured with a bike spoke
through the vent holes, and at least you'll see when you trapped one or
more.
