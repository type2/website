Subject: RE: [T2] LOUD FUEL PUMP?



Mea culpa. After all that, I go and read carefully and, going by the
Busboys part numbers, it looks like this is a rebuild of the other
German fuel pump:

"251-906-091  GR Pierburg, 1975-1979  $178.25

Fuel Pump - Electric - Rebuilt - Exchange
Now available as an affordable rebuilt, we feels these pumps are as
good, if not better than Bosch new ones. Warranty is 6 months.

251-906-091X  1975-1979 $127.95 PLUS  $45.00 Core"


As you see, it was the "Bosch new ones" that threw me. I'll stand by the
rest of my POV on pumps and brand names.
