Subject: Re: [T2] Painting question

John was elderly man when I met him. His family owned the Cadillac /
Pontiac dealership in Morgan city LA. They also owned Pelican State Lime
plant, Pelican Shrimping co (they never shrimped, just rendezvoused with
Mexican shrimpers and bought their catch) and they had a Shipbuilding
Company and of course the one thing every rich man needs *Johns Bar*.
John gave me that old Willis Overland Knight Car I previously mentioned
with the sleave valve engine. 
We remained friends for the remainder of his life.
Finally got the paint right, had some experience by then.

IMO, your friend John is lucky to be alive. I'd have made him sand it
out. 
Are you still friends with John? 
Did you finally get the good job you wanted?   
You are right.. pesky friends can really mess you up.
