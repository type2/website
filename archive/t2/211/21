Been doing this since I reworked my first distributor and found the
shafts rusted and behold a felt pad that is supposed to be oiled!

No oil can handy? Just pull the dip stick and let that drop of oil off
the end fall on to the felt pad. Do that a couple of times every few oil
changes and gone are the rusted shaft problems.
