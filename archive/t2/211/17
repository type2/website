Oh... Is that the same one that tried to end run me by offering an extra
hundred dollars to the seller after the auction? Hey! We've all been outbid
and outbid others, in turns. Sometimes we cry, sometimes we laugh.
Well, we just got back from Goleta and the nefarious Westy camper is sitting
on a trailer out front. I finally saw that this was the only way to go..
rented a trailer for $56 and hauled it off.
No engine, no transmission. Fully equiped Westy with pop-up tent. Good
interior, camper cabinets (AC/DC/propane fridge/stove/sink combo), bed,
swivel seat, dash.. good tires, good glass all around, lenses and
electrical. Pop top looks dirty and grey. I haven't evaluated the tent yet,
but it looked good from the inside.
I DO have the long fat nubby deal that the bumper sits on.. in great shape.
Front bumper also good.
Sadly, the body is shot.. too much rust problems. So, it gets stripped for
sure.
"Some die, that others may live."
I want to begin the carnage this week, but I have to see an oral surgeon on
Monday (moan-day?), so depending what the dentist does to me, I may not be
real up-to-snuff for a few days.
