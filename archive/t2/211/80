Hey! You're talking about my car family! Be careful!
Actually, two are on the way out. A couple of old beater trucks.. We paid a
guy to prep one and he did a terrible job, never finished, just made it look
like heck. We'd take a $300 loss at least to sell it this way. We're far
worse off than when he started. This was my husband's idea, by the way. I
had my doubts. I knew the guy was a drinker, and sure enough, he'd get a
little advance money, go off drinking, and show up four days later with a
buddy to help him. He always had a different buddy.. I don't think he paid
them anything. Finally we'd already paid him almost all of the agreed price
and he came to the door for another advance.. We told him, "No, finish first
and we'll pay you off". His response was to come back when we weren't here
and to steal some tools. Well, we should have known better..  :0(  Sadder
but wiser, Jan B
