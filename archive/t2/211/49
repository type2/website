Drop the big tube. Stick a shop vac or leaf blower
in the dash vents and blow all the crap out of the 
vent tubes... blow the center tube out.. have the bus
running while you do this and if they are towards the
back... the heat should drive em out of the back
tubes.
  Dont know where you are but in some parts of the
country... little mouse turds can make you real sick!
