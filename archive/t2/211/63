Subject: brake bleeding

ok. here is my situation. Im new to working on cars and i read somewhere 
that anytime you have your brake system open you should bleed your brakes to 
get rid of air. then i read in muirs book that when you are done bleeding 
and adjusting all brakes you should fill up your brake fluid so that it is 
full. well isnt that considered opening your brake system? or is it ok to 
open the tank. thanks for any help
