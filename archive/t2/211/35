Subject: Re: [T2] Riviera fridge questions

What size battery?  was it a deep cycle or auto start battery?
Using that much current for the standard load of a fridge of that size 
(7 or 8 amps) on a standard car battery will drain it below its charge 
in 4 to 6 hours.
NOTE>>>>
1. That is not 25% of battery...that is killed battery and my be just 
that.  Do not put a high current charger on that battery.  a discharged 
battery is at 11.5 volts.
2.  auto batteries can only do (depending on quality) about 20 to 25 of 
these rechargings in their lifetime. (and repeated chargings of this 
type kill alternators before their time,)  When a battery has been 
drained to this level many standard chargers will toast themselves 
trying to charge it.
