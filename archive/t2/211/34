My next question is--what are you going to paint with a detail gun?

Model Buses?--:>)

I used to have 2 spray guns. both air powered. one was a large container
gravity feed and then a smaller volume (detailer gun) suction feed. I
found that even though i had to fill my little conainer more often i
could use the smaller gun much easier. so a friend made an offer on my
bigger gun and i sold it. I am very happy with the smaller gun dont know
what a price would be on them now but i paid about 80 dollars 10 years
ago 
I find that the compressed air sprayers seem to handle the thinner
automotive spray jobs much better and for the most part are easier to
clean up afterwards. Also buy you paint from a "pro" shop that has
people that know auto paint chem systems. Then you always get the
correct combinations of base, top, hardeners, thinners, and cleanup for
the job.

Why not quit listening to the list and go to a NAPA store, I think a
$195.00 gravity feed spray gun is what you need. You do not need a high
dollar *airless system*. 
Many times I just drive around to a few backyard body shops and ask what
they're using. 
Check out the cleaning procedures on whatever you buy, simple is better
when you only use the gun twice a year. 
perfect for my needs.. happily also the state-of-the-art way 
of being environment friendly and doing a nice job, too. It looks like
these systems go for around $600 to $800, and they are very compact. Can
you make any other recommendations regarding the relative quality of
different brands? Are systems now much better than older, used ones? Any
other comments or tips? Thanks in advance! Jan B
