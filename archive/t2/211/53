Subject: Re: [T2] Painting question

Just for the sake of bring Murphy's Law into this discussion, I want to
lay this story on you.
The first car I painted (without help) was a 1956 Mercedes 190 SL
Convertible.
I did a meticulous sanding and prep job and when I was ready to shoot the
car, John Saracusa, the Cadillac dealer let me use his dealership spray
booth.
I washed the car outside before I drove into the spray booth, I drove the
car in after I wet the floor down and I wiped the car down with tack
cloth to get it very dust free.
This was going to be my premo project for 1962 and every stick of chrome,
every door / hood / trunk gasket and even the windshield and hood & trunk
lid had been removed to get the perfect results.
One thing went wrong; I was using synthetic enamel and my friend John
plugged the compressed air supply hose into an air supply that had a line
oiler on it full of Marvel Mystery oil.
I knew there were two air supplies, one with a series of dryers on the
line and the other with line oiler for impact tools. I just never
considered that John could not know this.
John didn't catch this and I had a very nice looking flat finish on my
car that never dried.
I didn't go back and rave at John, I just waited about six months and
sanded it down with lacquer thinner and had another go at it with clean
dry air supply.
If prep is everything then running off the visitors is the next most
important thing.
