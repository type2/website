Subject: Re: [T2] Dual batteries?

for what you are proposing you need to invest in a small700 to 1000 watt 
generator. and possibly a battery bank.  This gives you a generator to 
run on or charge your 2 or 3 battery battery bank with.  get deep cycle 
batteries for bank.  I have set this kind of setup in conversion vans 
and it is just a downsizing of what is in the RVs.  Have a similar  way 
to operate in my westy  right now.  The thing i am working on though is 
a way to quiet the generator down a  little  more.  These units are 
small only weighing about  35 to 40 lbs.
