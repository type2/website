Subject: Blatant spam: Rust-o-leum Industrial Enamel

In the paint department at Home Depot (disclosure: I sell lumber there) you
will find a product called Rust-O-Leum Industrial Enamel. It comes in quart
and gallon cans; the gallons cost $22. It's packaged in the most delightful
colors--safety red, safety yellow, black, a light blue for making
handicapped signs, and a couple other colors I'm not remembering right now.
There's also a Primer for Clean Metal and a Primer for Rusty Metal. All of
the topcoats are glossy. There's also a special traction additive for making
non-skid walking surfaces.

I got a can of this stuff in Safety Yellow (Home Depot employees pay full
freight on all our purchases) and painted the catwalks on a printing press
with it. I used a brush. It flows out really nice and looks good. Catwalks
are already nonskid, so no problem with the gloss. It thins with plain ol'
mineral spirits.

It ain't car paint quality, but it's a far sight better than a rattle can
job--and at $44 for a can of primer and one of topcoat, it's about as cheap.
