I used to have 2 spray guns.  both air powered.  one was a large 
container gravity feed and then a smaller volume (detailer gun) suction 
feed.  I found that even though i had to fill my little conainer more 
often i could use the smaller gun much easier.  so a friend made an 
offer on my bigger gun and i sold it.  I am very happy with the smaller 
gun dont know what a price would be on them now but i paid about 80 
dollars 10 years ago
I find that the compressed air sprayers seem to handle the thinner 
automotive spray jobs much better and for the most part are easier to  
clean up afterwards.  Also buy you paint from a "pro" shop that has 
people that know auto paint chem systems.  Then you always get the 
correct combinations of base, top, hardeners, thinners, and cleanup for 
the job.
