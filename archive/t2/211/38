Subject: 78 Front End Rebuild Comments

hello all,

i'm in the process of rebuilding the frontend of my 78 bus and i'm 
interested in getting some feedback from others who have done this to 
vans of around the same year. so far i've cut off nearly all of the nose 
panel and most of the front bumper mounting/ deformation panel. i have a 
clear picture of where i plan to take the nose panel, but i'm a little 
unsure what would be the best path to follow for the deformation panel. 
i've not been able to locate this part in the states, and i'm looking at 
a 3 to 4 month wait from one parts company that carries this piece in 
the UK. i've read one persons article,  
http://www.geocities.com/stevescamper/ on how he handled it, and i'm 
thinking that this may be my best option.

your thoughts, comments, opinions?

darin
