Billy,

Hate to mention it(don't ask how I know)...did you pinch off the fuel line
near the tank to replace other lines and forget to take pinch device off?

The basics.....

Spark?   at the right time?
Air?
Fuel?

Reconnected cold start injector?
Reconnected temp sensor.....this is the usual biggee!

Cheers, dave
