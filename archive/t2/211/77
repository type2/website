It very difficult to impossible for you to rebuild your booster yourself,
even if you could find the parts, which it is unlikely that you would be
able to.

I recommend that you get it rebuilt.  I recommend H&R auto parts rebuilders
in Dallas, Texas:

H & R Auto Parts Rebuilders
10328 Oakwood Dr, Dallas, TX 75217
Phone: (972) 286-5516


Mine cost $81 including shipping and they did it the day they got it and
sent it back the next day.

This is a great buy, believe me! I paid much more for a rebuilt here in town
just in the last year. Jan B
