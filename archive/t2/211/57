While you're at it, replace that old rusty thing and
re-insulate all of it. I used 4" dryer duct, household
foil-backed fiberglass duct insulation, duct tape,
cable-ties, and coated the whole apparatus with
rubberized undercoating. I also found a wadded up
paper bag in my duct, along with some colored pencils.
Good luck!                   -Paul Deatherage
