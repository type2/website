I've techincally been living out of mine for six months but have
frequently borrowed couchs and futons from friends and family. But it can
be done. I met a retiree in Florida who had been living in his '80 Westy
Wedge going on four years.

Recommendations:

1. A good cell phone
2. A power inverter
3. A battery charger
4. Aux battery setup
5. Locate showers - if you're in a campground, your set, otherwise, join
the YMCA.
6. Locate a good laundry
