Subject: Re: [T2] wrist pin keepers or circlips

Mark,

Thanks so much for posting this. After assembling a number of engines I just 
came across this comment (Craig Richter's book on 356's) about installing 
circlips with the flat side out. Don't recall ever reading it before even in 
piston installation instructions. Makes sense and upon examination I can see 
the round and flat sides.

Also remember that the correct way for these clips to be installed is the 
flat
side out. very important to keep them from poping out . Think about how they
are made they are stamped out creating a round side and a flat side   later 
and
have fun  Mark dearing
