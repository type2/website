Subject: Re: [T2] valve adjustment

Hi Lee,

You said, "Here is what I've done:  pointed the distributer rotor 
towards the notch to put the cylinder 1 in TDC position.  I adjusted 
the exhaust to .006 on the cylinder one and went to adjsut the intake 
but it won't move.  The adjusting nut is loosened and the screw will 
turn, but the clearance won't change.  If I rotate the engine 180 
degrees, it will move and I can adjust it, but, according to every 
procedure that I've read I shouldn't have to turnt he engine to adjust 
the intake.  I shoul be able to do them at the same time without 
rotating the engine right?  What am I doing wrong?"

I believe the correct procedure (and the one I successfully use) is to 
start just as you did but, in addition, verify that the crank pulley is 
also on or near the zero degree mark.  Adjust both number one valves 
then turn the engine counter-clockwise so that the distributor has 
moved 90 degrees and the crank pulley has moved 180 degrees.  Adjust 
both of the number two valves.  continue that procedure for number 
three and then number 4 cylinders.  If one of the valves or adjusters 
is stuck, that indicates a something may be amiss besides valve 
adjustment.
