Subject: Glass questions

I flipped through an old VW magazine that I found the other
day and saw a bus that had been modified in the traditional
hot rod style, you know, chopped roof, rake profile, tinted
glass, custom rims and paints.

It got me to thinking.  How do these guys find safety glass in
the exact dimension of the frame that holds their windshield?
Especially a windshield since it's convex.  If you chopped a
bus down, there would have to be tons of specially sized up
glass for that.

Just curious.  I have no plans to destroy a bus or anything
like that.
