You're absolutely right.

But my comments were not being aimed specifically for the 73 Bus
w/1600 Dual Port, because I knew that 71 was the last year for the
1600 for the USA market.  My comments were intended to inform those
that regardless of the year of vehicle back to 67 a smog test was
required until the early 90s.  If that person with the 73 1600 Bus
arrived in California in like say 89 or so, the local "Smog Tech"
(very loosely applied of course) would have probably asked where the
Smog Pump was (required on 73 models), the EGR Filter & Valve and if
he/she was a bit more knowledgeable, may have asked where the Dual
Carbs and Paper Air Filter unit was and (shudder) might have even gone
further to ask why doesn't the existing engine code start with a CB
instead of the A? code of the 1600 series engine.  In addition, the
station would have probably tested the vehicle to 73 standards
regardless of the engine - heck, it might have even passed the "sniff"
test, but certainly not the "visual" inspection if the "tech" was on
the ball (and most weren't) ;-)

Having owned a 73 Panel with a stock 1700 with all of the EGR
crap/Smog Pump back in those days, I cringed almost everytime I had to
have it tested.  Made it thru everytime by the skin of my teeth and
only after having to show the "tech" where everything was so I could
pass the damn thing.  Wish I still had it even moreso now that it's
exempt.

Passing my 67 Deluxe 21 Window wasn't something I looked forward to
back then as well.
