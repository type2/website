Subject: New thread, sorry its related to California again

Dear all,

All this kerfuffle about missing Califormia has reminded me of something 
I wanted to ask. Does anyone have details on what the emissions 
regulations are in California (or any other state for that matter, 
although I heard California was the strictest)? I am particularly 
interested in how they would apply to a 73 westy with a stock 1600 DP 
engine, as I am trying to figure out what the 'best' my engine could 
achieve is. Over here in the UK our emissions standard for vehicles 
before 1975 is rather quaint - "There must be no visible smoke". I was 
hoping to set myself something a little more difficult.

Stephen W
