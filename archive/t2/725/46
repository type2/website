Subject: Vanagon side tent

Volks,

I picked up one of the side tents that Ron is selling as part of the
garage sale.  It is nice but without the pole set :-( First, if I am
beyond belief lucky, someone has a pole set that they don't need because
their dog ate the tent.  Barring that (and back in the real world)is there
anyone in the DC area who has one?  I would love to look at it and measure
it.  If it is anything like the bay tent, then it is made of bent and
welded thinwall conduit and I can make one up pretty easily with a model
to work from.
