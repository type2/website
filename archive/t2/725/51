Hi Richard -

The spring holds the flaps OPEN.

When the thermostat contracts due to the engine having been turned off, the
flaps CLOSE and the thermostat keeps them closed until the engine is restarted
and warmed up.

I don't remember which way you move the flaps lever to wire them open, but
someone will.  I *think* it's towards the driver's side, but with zero
confidence, so please ignore my answer and wait for someone else's.

- Miles
