Nope, there are little diverter valves that allow air to flow past the
heater boxes.  Without this, the heater boxes run hotter.  Some people
have disconnected them without apparent harm.  However, seeing as how the
VW engineers didn't spend a dime without reason, there might be a reason
that the heater valves have this feature!
