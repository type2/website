You can always add a cat, although it would require an entirely 
different exhaust system from the exhaust ports down. Beetles were fuel 
injected, so swapping FI for carbs will make a difference. So too will 
the addition of an EGR valve and filter.

But all of these things are going to impact horsepower and fuel 
efficiency.

If you want to go this route to clean up emissions out of good 
citizenship, then simply look at the equipment for, say, a '77 or '78 
California spec beetle.

Smog equipment standards came in jumps. The first thing that was 
required was a closed circuit for crankcase emissions, which were 
vented sometime around '67 or '68 into the air intake system (with a 
PCV valve as a safety mechanism). Then came air pumps between 1970 and 
1973. A lot of companies went to fuel injection between 1973 and 1975, 
Volkswagen included. Cats came in around 1975/1976. Almost everything 
in this period (1970-1975) was poorly engineered, prone to failure, and 
was relatively ineffective. True smog equipment didn't really come into 
its own until about 1976, and this has a lot to do with the loss of the 
exemption in California: from 1976 on, smog equipment sort of became 
worth the candle and allowing it to be removed would make a difference 
(how much of a difference is debatable). Equipment through 1975 was 
most Rube Goldberg.
