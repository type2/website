Subject: Fuel line from McMaster-Carr - high enough pressure?

When I put a new engine in my '76 Westy in two or three weeks, I plan to
change out my fuel lines.  High-pressure hose I've found from the usual
suppliers is between $3 and $4 per foot.  I found some at McMaster-Carr
(Item # 5645K22) that is $1.21 per foot, rated at 400 PSI, which is the
highest pressure rating for fuel hose I found on MMC.  Not sure if that
is high enough, though, as other fuel hose I've seen was up to 900 PSI.
Seems like overkill to me.  Anybody know the required PSI?

Speaking of McMaster-Carr, does anybody know off-hand how many feet of
the push-on seal (item # 1120A233) I need to do my poptop and luggage
rack?  '76 Westy.  Will 25 feet do it or do I need a 25' and a 10'?  And
has anybody found a seal that works between the poptop and the luggage
rack?
