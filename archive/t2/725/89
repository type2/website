I see two types of  205 "SVDA  distributors are available.  One is from 
Mexico and
the other is a "Bruck Germany" for 20 dollars less.  Does anyone know which 
is the
better of the two.  I don't mind spending 20 dollars more if I know I am 
making the right choice.  Any advice appreciated.........
