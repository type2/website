[ Here's hoping your mail reader obeys my
hard line breaks or this will be jibberish ]


I made my own rack.  I can take pictures if
you like, but it is a pair of wood tripods
that look like this in ASCII art:


End of rig, side of bus view
         ___
        /| |\
       / |O| \
      / /| |\ \   wood A-frame
     / / | | \ \   with rabbeted
    / /  | |  \ \   joints
   / /   | |   \ \
  |-/----+ +----\-|
  |/-------------\|


Cross section, end of bus view

     ___                     ___
     | | ___________________ | |
   =[| |====================[| |]= 1/2" threaded 
     | | ------------------- | |   rod locked with
     | |                     | |   nuts and washers
     | |             ^       | |   on each side of 
     | |             |       | |   frame
     | |             |       | |
     \ |             |       | /
      ||             |       ||
                     |
   lower ends        | 3/4" galvanized pipe
   narrowed to       | as a sleeve around
   fit in rain       | the 1/2" rod
   gutter
  

A pair of 'em are put on the bus; the width
of the A-frame foot provides anti-tip control
while the threaded rod locked on each side
of the wood frame provides constant/perfect
width and rigidity.  With nothing securing
'em but gravity, I roll the canoe onto the bus
by myself from the rear.  The "roller" in 
this case is the 3/4" galvanized pipe spinning
on the 1/2" rod (which is well greased once
a year).  Once on the bus, I tie down to eye
bolts I have attached to the bumpers at the
bumper frame/mounts using nothing more exotic
than nylon-core sash cord.  That keeps the whole
thing, canoe carrier and all, sucked down tight.
The canoe in question is a 17' job.
