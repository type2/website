This would be the alignment problem of the century!  Yes, it could be
done, but be sure that you can get everything lined up before you start
hacking!

I have seen one double sliding door baywindow in person.  I couldn't find
the owner (it was parked on the street) and my note offering to buy it was
ignored  :(

If I could find a LH sliding door in the US, I'd probably be restoring
that bus, not hacking it to add a second door to a US-spec bus
