<FWIW, back in HS, a friend's older brother got his car (a '58 Pontiac from
his uncle) thru NJ inspection using "a rebuilt engine in a tablet" dropped
into the spark plug holes to cure the smoking>

I had a CR-X with worn rings that about 15K miles after I bought it for $150 began to be noticable. Not using alot of oil but puffing after stoplights. Used some miracle ina  can stuff and it worked for about 750 miles at a time... Usually I'd change the oil, add this stuff and then drive it 12+ hours to see my girlfriend. By the time I got back it was starting to smoke again but I didn't use alot of oil on the trip. 

Would I do that to a motor that I wanted to last? No... <griN!>

Never did figure out how it did it's job, different from motor honey.
