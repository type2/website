This is fine for all windows but the windshield, which has to be
laminated.

Since laminated glass isn't tempered, there might be a way to cut down a
stock windshield, though.

I suspect that a lot of the rodder types simply use Lexan, though!  If the
car is just for show, the durability of the glass isn't an issue.
