The 034 (Bosch 0231170034/VW 043905205) was originally equipped on 74
Federal Dual Port 1600 Beetles w/Manual Transmissions.  It is an
excellent distributor combining the benefits of a Mechanical Advance
(great for extended highway use) with a Single Vacuum Advance to help
against or practically eliminate that notorious "flat spot" when
taking off from the stoplight/stop sign.  It is essentially a factory
SVDA that I've never seen the need to recurve for use in either Type 1
or Type 2 upright applications.

I've installed one (used German) on a 71 Dual Port 1600 Bus with the
stock 34PICT and the owner of that Bus has been running it for almost
a year now with no complaints - just loves not having any hesitation
anymore.

I also ran one (used German) in a 68 Bug w/1600 Single Port for about
two years.  The person who bought the Bug from me still runs it with
no complaints.

The current new 034's are being made in Mexico by Bosch - they come in
VW Mexico boxes with their current part number 043 905 205ZB.  I've
used two of these in the past several months with excellent results -
they seem to be just as good as their German counterpart so far.  One
thing to remember though, the replacement condensor is different from
the German model - use Bosch 02054 instead of 02074 (the hole in the
side of the case is round instead of square).

The 205T is an excellent distributor in it's own right, VW having used
this unit from 69-70 on Type 1s & Type 2s (the 68 models used a close
variation with a short cap and rotor), but is Vacuum Advance only,
which could be a potential bummer if the diaphragm rips somewhere down
the road.  VW engines are not very forgiving when that happens on
these distributors.

Is it worth the $100 (or the $130 SVDA from aircooled.net)?  Depends
on your requirements, how much yer willing to spend, etc.  If your
current distributor functions well enough, then pass (if it ain't
broke, don't fix it).  Either the 034 or John's SVDA work very well.
And yes, your carb's gotta have that vacuum port.

For info on the 034 check my webpage link:

I'll be soon uploading some updated info on the Mexican 034 as well as
a couple of other off-beat Bosch distributors in the next 60 days or
so.
