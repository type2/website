That's all overkill. Even the high pressure CIS injection systems on
rabbits, audi, etc is well under 100 pounds. I think bus FI is under
50 pounds.

 When I put a new engine in my '76 Westy in two or three weeks, I plan to
 change out my fuel lines.  High-pressure hose I've found from the usual
 suppliers is between $3 and $4 per foot.  I found some at McMaster-Carr
 (Item # 5645K22) that is $1.21 per foot, rated at 400 PSI, which is the
 highest pressure rating for fuel hose I found on MMC.  Not sure if that
 is high enough, though, as other fuel hose I've seen was up to 900 PSI.
 Seems like overkill to me.  Anybody know the required PSI?
