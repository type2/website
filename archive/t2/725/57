Jim,

I tracked what you said up to the point where you said that there were 
standards for both engines. Indeed, there were standards for both 
engines, but there was no standard in 1973 for 1600 DP in a bus, 
because those were not sold in California (or anywhere else in the U. 
S. that I know of). Smog standards are always established for engines 
in combination with model, vehicle weight, etc.

So I am sticking by what I said: no such standard for a '73 bus with a 
1600 DP exists. (But if one did exist, it probably would have involved 
an air pump.)

As for the "smoking" standard, I suspect that this "violation" long 
predated smog standards. A badly smoking car could have been cited as a 
nuisance.
