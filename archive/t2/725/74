Ricardo and Karl, thanks for your answers...
it's obvious that I have to use the newer sender on the FI tank.  
The question is, will the newer sender work with the 72 guage or will I have to get a newer guage?
 
Also, will it be OK to tap the fuel fill breather (formerly into 72 middle tank vent) into the smaller vent (for canister)?
 
Anyone put an FI tank into a pre-FI Bay?

People have been able to fit the newer sender into the old tanks so I
suspect it might work.

The early senders, from 1968 yr model thru 1/73 (chassis #2x3 2138 900), are tube style and
are bolted to the tank with 5 bolts. Part # 211 919 051

The later senders, from 2/73 (chassis 2x3 2138 901), are swing arm styly and are twist-lock to the tank. Part
# 211 919 051A

There is no way to install an early sender on a later tank, unless you cut out the top section and weld it in!
