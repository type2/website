Although smog laws certainly applied to later Super Beetles with 1600 
engines, I don't believe that they ever applied to buses with those 
engines. The carburated 1700 replaced the 1600 in 1972 and all buses in 
the U.S. were FI by 1974. So there is no way to really specify 
standards or equipment.

The closest you could come would be to install an air pump. But, 
believe me, I'm just kidding.
