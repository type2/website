Subject: "taco plate" cover? 2 questions

My 78 Westy has a 79 drivetrain. The PO installed an oil temp sender
in the taco plate a la Porsche 914. I've seen pix of a cover for said
taco plate, but mine does not have a cover.

Question. Was I hallucinating (maybe spring fever?) about the cover?
Are they available anywhere? I've been emailing some vendors/parts
dealers, but don't want to appear to be a complete newbie on the
topic.

Question 2. Grab bars to haul my fat butt into the cab. I see grab
bars for sale. Were they a stock item on buses, specifically late
Bays? If I were to install one in my bus (to prevent using the fragile
armrest for a boost) where would they be installed?

First camping trip coming up next month. Copper Harbor in the UP of Michigan.

best regards to bus pilots and passengers,
