Subject: 1970 Clock install Question

I see the Bentley shows the positive lead for the VDO clock is to terminal
30 on the headlight switch. What I wonder if the switch itself has a tabbed
provision for the clock, or if it requires breaking the original connection.
I am slightly apprehensive of disturbing this connection.
As an alternative, I understand there is a spare fuse for the optional fans.
Would it be easier and less intrusive to simply wire to this fuse, if tabbed
provision is there, or is this conenction power on only with ignition on. My
primary concerns are further load on the headlight switch, although trivial
I imagine, and disturbing currently happy wires....
Thanks,
Al
