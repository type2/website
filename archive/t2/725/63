Subject: Smog codes

As someone -- maybe Richard Atwell (and if it wasn't Ratwell, then I'm 
guilty of Matthew effect) -- pointed out, there have never been 
provisions in air quality legislation for tinkering. Most early smog 
inspections were much more focused on original-spec equipment than on 
the actual emissions coming out of the tailpipe. You could pass smog 
with submaximal equipment (as long as it was there) and high emissions, 
but never with nonstandard or missing equipment even if your emissions 
could sustain life in Biosphere II.

Thus, there has never been a market for alternatives (except for 
electric conversions), no tinker's ingenuity, and really almost no data 
or practical experience to draw on in order to back-engineer lower 
emissions into an older vehicle.

A total failure of imagination.
