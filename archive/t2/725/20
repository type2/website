Hey David! Great project idea. I don't want to do one, but I'd love to see detail pics of the differences in the vehicles. Have you looked for rust repair panels that might help you duplicate the upper and lower door channels? 

How is the frame different Bob? Just curious! 

I'd love to see a double door Weekender with the rear facing jump seats.

project update: 
attic ladder added to garage over weekend

Next project:    
decking the attic floor so I can locate excess Westy parts (strandby for install) and Beetle parts there
