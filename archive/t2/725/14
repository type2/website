I just received a new foam engine seal for my 73 bus.
One side is normal foam, and the other is "squared off" and appears the 
cells of the foam are more "sealed".
Which side goes of the foam should be facing the inside of the engine 
compartment? The previous seal was too dilapidated for me to use as a 
reference.

Thanks
