Subject: 78 Driverside Sliding Door

Ok, Im thinking about putting double sliders on my 78 Transporter.
Would anyone have done this before?  I did a cursory review of the
shell and see that most of the body elements are on both sides, so, I
suppose i'd just have to find a donor (thats the hard part) .

thoughts?

David.
