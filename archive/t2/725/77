Hi Evelyn -

You'll need to buy two different-sounding 12-volt electric buzzers from Radio
Shack.  The total parts cost will be anywhere from less than $10 to more than
$20, depending on which buzzers you choose.

Here are the Radio Shack item numbers, Depending on how loud you want your
buzzers to be:
75 decibels: 273-054 and 273-055 (one high-pitched and one low-pitched)
85 decibels: 273-060 and 273-080 (one high-pitched and one low-pitched)
100db LOUD!: 273-070 and 273-079 (one high-pitched and one siren-modulated)

You'll get to check their operation before each start, just like you do now
with the idiot lights.  That's why you don't want two buzzers that sound the
same: then, you might not notice if one stops working.

...time passes...

Been to Radio Shack?  Great!  Now that you have the two buzzers, ask your
mechanic to connect each buzzer in parallel with its respective idiot light.

Or, do it yourself with help from the list: it's never too late to start
working on your own Bus!

Cheers,

- Miles
