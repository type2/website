well maybe Maryland is slightly enlightened (but doubtful) since from the
beginning the only thing they cared about was what came out the tailpipe.
when I take my van in, they check my gas cap for proper sealing and stick
the probe up the tailpipe, if it sniffs below standard it passes. so far
they have never even opened the engine compartment.

now one problem that has come up every time that requires a manager to
override is the lack of sufficient digits in the serial number...it won't
accept the test with only 13 digits it needs 19 or something to initiate
the test.   so some manager has to come and manually overide the number
limit, but then it finds the correct standards for a 78 Bus with the
smaller number,?? go figure
