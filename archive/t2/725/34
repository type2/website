Subject: RE: Bus Depot Clearance Sale -UPDATE

The last batch of items has now been added to this year's Online Garage
Sale.  I have also reduced prices even further on some of the remaining
items. There is lots of Bus stuff there, plus other aircooled (Bug, Ghia,
etc.). After we sell another 15 to 20 items I will end the sale, so check it
out now if you haven't already.
