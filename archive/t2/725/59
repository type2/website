It sounds to me that your goal is to have cleaner output--for the sake 
of being a responsible citizen --and not to pass CA smog requirements 
for a particular bus model. Is that correct?

If that's the case, then I think you would want to know what the 
standards are for a later model air cooled engine, say 1980.

The biggest question in my mind is, would adding a catalytic converter 
(not required on my 1974) be a benefit to air quality? Or would it be a 
waste of money?

I gather that the best thing you can do is keep your engine tuned 
within specs and running well.
