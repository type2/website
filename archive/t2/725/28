Subject: valve adjustment

I need some clarification on valve adjustment procedure (77 westy). 
 
 Here is what I've done:  pointed the distributer rotor towards the notch to
put the cylinder 1 in TDC position.  I adjusted the exhaust to .006 on the
cylinder one and went to adjsut the intake but it won't move.  The adjsuting
nut is loosened and the screw will turn, but the clearance won't change.  If
I rotate the engine 180 degrees, it will move and I can adjsutit, but
according to every procedure that I've read I shouldn't have to turnt he
engine to adjust the intake.  I shoul be able to do them at the same time
without rotating the engine right? 
 
What am I doing wrong? 
 
Thanks!
 
Lee
