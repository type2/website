Subject: Re: Gas in Mexico

I have just returned from a week in Sonora and Sinaloa in the bus.  Gas is
plentiful and readily available even in remote areas, if expensive.  It
seems even the smallest towns are getting new Pemex stations that look as
modern as anything in the US.

I burned Magna grade in my 1776 and had no trouble with pinging or running
rough.  I do have 2 external oil coolers for the Arizona heat, however,
and Mexico was not as hot as here.  I started losing my fan/generator just
south of the border on the return and decided to go for it - I made it
back to town just as the red light came on for good!
