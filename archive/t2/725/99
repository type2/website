Hi Tim,

Gehts gut, danka.  I did exactly what you are contemplating on my 1976 
Westy about a year ago.  I used the BusBoys three-gauge trim ring as a 
cutting template and it looks great...almost like it could have been 
OEM.  Follow the VDO electrical instructions that come with the gauges 
and it's a pretty painless process.  I'm still pleased with the 
appearance and function of the VDO gauges.
