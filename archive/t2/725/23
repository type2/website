Thanks so much! 

That's the problem I have with my little 120V wire feed welder. All the moving parts are plastic. I want no more of that. I have a brace worked out that corrects a problem with the drive wheel but don't want to design "fixes" for a new machine. Hobart is off my list then... I'll look at the Miller site and see what models are in my price range. 

Does yours have infinite speed and heat controls? My Lincoln candidate has inifinite speed but 5-6 ranges on the heat.
