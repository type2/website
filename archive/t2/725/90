This reminds me of a friend who has a vanagon westy with a american V8
in it. Says he has no questions asked when he takes it for smog. Makes
me wonder where he goes...

 But my comments were not being aimed specifically for the 73 Bus
 w/1600 Dual Port, because I knew that 71 was the last year for the
 1600 for the USA market.  My comments were intended to inform those
 that regardless of the year of vehicle back to 67 a smog test was
 required until the early 90s.  If that person with the 73 1600 Bus
 arrived in California in like say 89 or so, the local "Smog Tech"
 (very loosely applied of course) would have probably asked where the
 Smog Pump was (required on 73 models), the EGR Filter & Valve and if
 he/she was a bit more knowledgeable, may have asked where the Dual
 Carbs and Paper Air Filter unit was and (shudder) might have even gone
 further to ask why doesn't the existing engine code start with a CB
 instead of the A? code of the 1600 series engine.  In addition, the
 station would have probably tested the vehicle to 73 standards
 regardless of the engine - heck, it might have even passed the "sniff"
 test, but certainly not the "visual" inspection if the "tech" was on
 the ball (and most weren't) ;-)
