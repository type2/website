Subject: Re: [T2] Pop top seal questions

I just did mine Tom,
Here is my experience

 From what I understood in the manual and when I looked to some other 
Westy, the seal on the front of the pop top start at the corner.

Some people advise to start putting the seal with a small extra marge 
sticking out, the reason is that temperature may change the length of 
the seal over time, than after a few day , you can cut the extra parts.

I guess so , there are different anyway !!

I strongly encourage you to remove the luggage rack , just for the sake 
of cleaning underneath , you can't image how dirty it is and how many 
stuff your are carrying on the top of your head !! , it was starting to 
damage the painting.
