Subject: RE: [T2] 78 Driverside Sliding Door

Well, I cant say I havn't thought on it.  The rear rail for
the slider is already there, the rest of it isn't though.  You
would need to weld in the top and bottom slider rail I think.
The hardware and door would have to come from a donor.  I
personally have only seen double sliders on pictures of buses
in Europe; and those were always utility buses for businesses
and such.  *shrug* I'm not the expert.  I have no idea if
Brazil or Australia or Asia ever had the double slider.  It
sounds plausible.

Transporter.
Would anyone have done this before?
thoughts?
