In California until the early 90s or so, all vehicles (except new ones
younger than 5 years old of course,) back to 1967 were subject to an
every two year smog test, so there were some sort of standards with
both engines and required equipment (if any) in place and AFAIK, they
can be applied to those so-called "exempt" vehicles 67-75 if they are
spotted with excessive smoke coming out of the tailpipe (as noted in
an earlier post) when being ticketed and compelled to get it fixed.
