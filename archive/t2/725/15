Subject: Re: [T2] Foam engine seal..which side down?.

As water splashes up, I always put it shiny side down.  If it is closed
cell foam, it likely matters not- although it is hotter below also.
Looks better from inside the engine comp. if the black is up, however. I
noticed that mice seem to chew on it.  Start centered in the back, then
work each side towards the front- then lie underneath to pull down what
did not fully seat through the gap.
