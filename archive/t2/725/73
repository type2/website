Subject: Fw: Re: [T2] distributor on 71

I think most folks driving '71s have either a 205 (stock?), a 009, or an
aftermarket SVDA distributor.  I don't know anything about the 034.  However,
$100 doesn't sound cheap to me!  The often-recommended SVDA distributor from
aircooled.net costs only $130.  I can't imagine a good reason to install the
wrong distributor for only $30 less.

It is better to have a distributor with vacuum advance, but it will not work
unless your carburetor has the correct vacuum ports.

Most people no longer recommend the 009 because it provides less than the
ideal amount of advance under load at low RPMs.  However, it certainly does
work.  My '71 has had a 009 for as long as I've owned it.  People who upgrade
to a better distributor usually keep their old 009 around as a spare.
