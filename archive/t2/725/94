Subject: Re: [T2] VDO 3 guage dash panel

I actually cut my dash and put the 3 instruments in the section between the radio and the ash tray. Looks factory BUT I recognize and respect your choice not to cut. 

However if you want a 3-29 gauage panel, the sports imports folks have nice plastic/ABS mounts for dash top mounting. Covers the back of the gauge too. Run the wiring throught he old speaker grille opening. Since the dash is so wide, you might get up to 30 instruments up there but for my needs 3-4 2" gauges work dandy.

You could also consider some of the windshield post instrument clusters. Paint 'em black. Red and racy never seemed to be the right style in my mind, unless you want the 5" tach with shift light! <just kidding!>

Might check JC Whipme too. (whip me on the shipping...)

I may add a couple more isntruments to monitor volts or amps, mixture, etc. 

I DO plan to add an engine hours meter but that will be out back in the engine compartment.
