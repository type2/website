The current regs in California are remarkably similar to yours.  Before a
certain year (75?) there is no smog inspection, although you can still be
nicked for "visible smoke".  After that year, your bus has to meet the
standards established for that year's vehicle.

In California, there is no such thing as a "'73 westy with a stock 1600DP
engine" as all type 2s imported to the US from '72 onward had type 4
engines.  Still, your bus is old enough to avoid smog inspection here.
