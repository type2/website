   I think I will finally  go through with wiring up a really loud buzzer along
    with the idiot light  too. Always wanted to do that, don't know why I don't.
    Ill do the generator  light, too in case I throw a fan belt. It may buzz for
    a second.......

We have a 71 Kombi, and I would like a buzzer to warn me when oil or generator 
problems arise.  Trouble is, I've had the bus for 19 years and have never had 
the nerve to work on it myself.  If I ask a mechanic to put such a thing in, 
what exactly should I ask him to do?
