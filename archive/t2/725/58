Wrong link. Sorry 'bout that... 

www.volksrods.com Leave the "s" off the end of rod and you get one of those sites that sort of hijacks you with a bunch of worthless links. 

Their tech page is good reading. Some articles, some links. Radical customs.

I was saying NEW flat glass is easy. Curved glass is done by the link above. And that is for laminated glass. Tempered glass can't be cut as it just explodes. Been there, done that... <grin!>
