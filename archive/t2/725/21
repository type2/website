Subject: MIG welders - opinions requested

Am in the final stages of researching MIG welders for a future purchase. 

I think I am zeroed in on a Lincoln SP-175+ I know there is a plain non-plus SP-175 but I have to go find out the differences between them. The local home improvement store has a non-plus 175. 

Anyone have any opinions about Lincoln vs. Hobart vs. Miller vs. ??? 

My requirements are 220v, primarily a gas welding machine. I have a flux-core wleder now and it is fine but flu-core is too hot to weld on bodies with. Try to buy a machine I won't outgrow in short order. 

My budget is about $650 or so. Waiting on my 1st house to sell... 

What does a bottle of welding gas cost? CO-Ar or plain CO? 

Have a couple SMALL holes to fix in our Westy before it's next paint job, and our Beetle has a whole list of patches along with some minor customizing... 

Thanks.

Chris
