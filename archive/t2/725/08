I'm afraid I can't answer most of your questions.  For the fasteners you 
might try:

http://mdmetric.com/

     They have ALLOT of different stuff, all metric.  Their sales staff has 
always been really nice to me.  They would probably let you just mail them 
one of each of the fasteners you need and try to match them up, or maybe 
email them a picture?
