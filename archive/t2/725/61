Hello Barry  I should have some used ones if that would help  let me know   
Also remember that the correct way for these clips to be installed is the flat 
side out. very important to keep them from poping out . Think about how they 
are made they are stamped out creating a round side and a flat side   later and 
have fun  Mark dearing
