Karl raises some very good points...kudos. He is up on his CARB and CA
state info. (Cali Air Resources Board) Most of you may not know this, 
but in some counties, using Charcoal grills was actually outlawed for a 
while. May still be.
(Didn't stop many purist, though)

On a practical level, I can offer this personal experience...

I had both a 1973 Eldorado convertible and a 1957 Nash Metropolitan in
Orange County, CA. When it came time to first register both in
California (The Met in 1983, and the Caddy in 1997) the Met barely
registered any interest from the DMV hack who gave me my new plates.
They didn't even come outside to look at my Mondo Met, which sort of
ticked me off, since I had just restored it, and I was a snotty Senior
in high school (yeah, I am old) showing off his groovy (if not
miniscule) ride.

The 73 Caddy, when I registered it, was basically the same. The DMV
lady (who reminded me of Marge Simpson's sisters) asked me three
questions (was it running...can I see the sales slip...and are the tags
original) and then typed into her computer and punched out the info I
needed. She then handed me new decals, and I was on my way back to the
office.

Both cars were registered in CA through 2002, and not ONCE did anyone
ask to see the car, have it inspected, or any other questions.

So...my experience was such that DMV (at the San Clemente
office...OCEAN VIEW!) could not have cared a WHIT about my old cars.

Your mileage may vary, of course. CARB may have gotten more nasty in
the last 3 years.
