FWIW, back in HS, a friend's older brother got his car (a '58 Pontiac from
his uncle) thru NJ inspection using "a rebuilt engine in a tablet" dropped
into the spark plug holes to cure the smoking for a couple hundred miles 
or so...The Poncho also went thru a quart every hundred miles or so...
Fox Head reprocessed oil was its diet of choice...That, and Pep Boys "Oil
