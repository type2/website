No smog check in required for a 73 in CA.




Dear all,

All this kerfuffle about missing Califormia has reminded me of something
I wanted to ask. Does anyone have details on what the emissions
regulations are in California ? I am particularly
interested in how they would apply to a 73 westy with a stock 1600 DP
engine,

Stephen W
