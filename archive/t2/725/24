Subject: Re: [T2] canoe rack for bus-Sportsmobile top?

I have a Kartite ladder rack that was made for a Chevy
van.  It, of course, wouldn't clear the camper top but
had enough room on top of the brace that I could drill
two more holes and the bars clear the top by an inch
or more.  That would be perfect for a canoe.  I use it
to haul my hang glider.  It is extremely sturdy and
easy to take on and off with a 1/2 inch socket wrench.
 You can also loosen it and slide the rear one forward
to put the top up without removing it.  I think it
works great and costs around $150!  Much cheaper than
the other things I looked at.  If you're interested I
can send pics.  Take care....KR

 no I wouldn't trust that setup, maybe if you had a
