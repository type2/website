The squared off side goes down toward the mufflers. 
If you'll notice, edges of the seal are beveled so
that it will only fit properly one way.  I just put
mine on and lowered the engine temp 20-30 degrees. 
And most of mine was still good!  One short section
over the muffler was causing all of the problem.  
Now, no more dieseling or backfiring.  Good luck...KR
