fuel filters can cause all sorts of strange problems.
if you haven't changed it recently, they are cheap change it anyway

also I have had fuel lines which have developed pinholes and after the 
engine compartment got warm they started sucking air under acceleration.
fuel lines should be changed especially if of unknown age.

I have lost power like this when a cyl failed and gave no indications did 
not run rough etc.  basically the valve never closed so it never developed 
compression.  measure valves stems.

also the high output coils can fail if one does not use the resistor or 
blow out the points replacer, but this usually causes engine to stop.

good luck

problems.
