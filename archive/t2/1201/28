Subject: RE: [T2]  coffee- was trip report - Big Sur

Yeah, I've got the boiling water thing down - as tea is my drink of choice.
I got her a French press/coffee mug thing two years ago - I think she only
used it twice. She was not a fan. She loves French press at home, in the
glass thing. I don't feel good traveling with that glass thing. I'll look
for one of those drip things - thanks for the tip. There is a coffee shop on
the corner of our block - I'm sure they can grind it to my specs...sounds
like you are recommending regular ground coffee instead of fine ground?

My next experiment was with one of those cones you put on top of the cup,
put a filter in and pour the boiling water over the grounds. 
That worked great when we used fine ground coffee, it was easy to clean and
with more than one cone you can make more than one cup at a time. This has
been the daily coffee tool for a year or so now. The cones are cheap & light
weight, the filters are cheap and the coffee is good.

This morning I tried regular ground coffee (ran out of the fine ground and
the grinder makes too much noise for that hour), tossed in a cup & the
boiling water on top of that. Gave it 4 min to make coffee then poured it
thru the cone-filter and ended up with clean coffee & nothing to clean other
than to rinse the brewing cup.

A pot to boil the water, $5 worth of coffee making stuff, some coffee & you
are in business on those fine Big Sur mornings ... or where ever you wake
up.
