From Wikipedia:

In the early years of the twentieth century, the vapor absorption cycle
using water-ammonia systems was popular and widely used but, after the
development of the vapor compression cycle, it lost much of its importance
because of its low coefficient of
performance<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_performance>
(about
one fifth of that of the vapor compression cycle). Nowadays, the vapour
absorption cycle is used only where waste heat is available or where heat
is derived fromsolar
collectors<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_thermal_collector>.
Absorption refrigerators are a popular alternative to regular compressor
refrigerators <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor-compression_refrigeration>
where
electricity is unreliable, costly, or unavailable, where noise from the
compressor is problematic, or where surplus heat is available (e.g., from
turbine exhausts or industrial processes, or from solar plants).
