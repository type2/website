Subject: Re: [T2] Sudden loss of power

I'm certainly no expert but that sounds rather like the issue my old girl
had, dropped a valve, she's been sitting in the garage for a while waiting
for us to have the time to look at her (now that I'm home), but my mate
who's fixed this on a beetle we both owned at various stages said it isn't
a big job.

Good luck,

Neale
