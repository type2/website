Check your local favorite car dealer too - believe it or not - the last 
time I needed a battery for our Honda daily driver - I was able to buy a 
Honda branded battery at the dealer for about $8 less than the off 
brands that the discount auto parts stores were selling. The first 
battery (factory) in 1999 lasted about 6-7 years. The replacements from 
the local auto parts store (franchise battery brand) never lasted more 
than 3-4 years in two different cars. The little 51 series battery the 
dealer sold was HEAVY - possibly heavier than the discount store battery 
indicating to me that it has more lead in it???

I miss the days of $35 car batteries. ;)
