Subject: Slipping clutch? Daughter's 75 bus

Daughter's 75 bus (10 yr on rebuild, about 80k mi)- noticed an odd 
fgeeling when letting out the clutch- even though it grabs soon of the 
floor and has free play, it  did not have the "instant grab" feel when 
taking off from a stop.  Power seemed OK driving 2 hrs to IKEA a day 
ago. (not hilly) , no smell on shifting. So I tried the parking brake 
on, put it in 3rd, gunning it a bit, and letting clutch out- it slowed 
down but did not stall.  Is this a worn out clutch, oil on clutch (no 
drips form trans) or weak pressure plate or what?  My 78 went over 150K 
on original clutch, but she shifted a lot at college in Savannah (-8
