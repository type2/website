Are you running a 009 mechanical advance distributor?  I had an issue where
my Ghia would run fine at idle but the 009 was gummed up because it had
been over sprayed with WD40 and it collected dirt.  The dirt would prevent
the weights in the 009 to swing out smoothly which is how the 009
advances.  If you are running a vacuum advance perhaps there is a vacuum
leak?
