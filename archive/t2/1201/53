	I have no experience with refrigerators in campers.  I'm down 
on the primitive level of deep-freeze ice in thick plastic bags 
frozen in the home deepfreeze, which keep styrofoam boxes {Australian 
'eskies' ; Kiwi 'chilly bin'} cool a couple d in my climate.
	Nevertheless I intervene in this discussion to issue a 
general warning: any dry-ice should be carefully vented to the 
outside of the vehicle.  A little-known hazard of dry ice is the 
subtle intoxication its vapour (i.e CO2 gas) can induce, far short of 
concentrations which kill by asphyxia.
	For instance, if you are offered an opportunity to ride in an 
elevator with a bucket of dry ice cooling some samples, and the 
fabulous 'rok concert' white fog is liberally flowing out of that 
bucket, at least stay out of that lift yourself (and perhaps warn the 
occupants that their thinking may go wonky).  Even if the elevator 
doesn't jam between floors and then cut up ugly as the occupants 
behave irrationally (which in my esperience they tend to do even 
without dry ice =-O), they may behave oddly soon after exiting that 
confined space.
	Bus content: Impaired judgement in low-CO2 air could be 
caused by unintended buildup of carbon dioxide gas within the air 
breathed by the driver.
	Whatever probability may be estimated {yes, you can expect 
the incantation "one in a million"} for such a disaster, the gamblers 
among us will dismiss it as negligible.  After a long career 
assessing zero-infinity dilemmas e.g nuclear reactor meltsdown, LPG 
fireballs etc, I urge prevention where feasible.  Not having seen a 
dry-ice frig let alone in a camper, I can't assess what concentration 
of carbon dioxide it might accidentally produce in the driver's air; 
I merely point out this is a hazard, and claims of low risk are at 
best only calculated averages which will not help you if you give R 
Nader a belated excuse to jeer 'see, I tole youse the front of that 
kraut wagen was too weak'.
