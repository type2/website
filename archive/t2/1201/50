No direct experience with this but...
B 
The Dometic ones worked better than
the Vanagon Dometic fridge (which I think is fine when well tuned BTW) likely
because as coolers, cool stays down.B  So the concept is sound.B  I had a
Dometic that I paid $400 for in early 90's dollars, and then sold for $450
when they got a bit scarce.B  Now this was long before all the little AC/DC
ones came about.B  So for the relatively trivialB price by comparison, if it
works, seems like a great stinking idea.B  The if it works will be the
question, although trivial compared to that Dometic, $300 is a chunk to drop
on something that doesn't.
B 
My only gripe with the Dometic was, it was of
course more effective on LP, but you didn't want to run it in an enclosed non
vented space on LP, and remembering to change from LP to electric was a PITA
for my lazy self.B  I eventually solved this by simply carrying it up in the
luggage rack, and generally ran it on LP only.B  Didn't blow out, and I ran it
off a little small sized 10lb LP tank I had, would run indefinitely.
B 
Anyway
in a direct sense, useless, but still my opinion.B  If the shipping got one to
AK, I'd do it for that money and take a chance for the '77.
