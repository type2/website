Subject: Torsion arm replaced

Hi,

This week I did my first torsion arm with ball joint replacement on my 69
Westy.  Taking everything apart I notice my Bus still had the original shocks,
as well as the ball joints, and steering damper.

Thanks to everyone who gave me pointers on how to do the job.  My new ball
joints do not seem have any grease fittings installed. Anyone ever consider
doing so? Is it necessary?

Brian
