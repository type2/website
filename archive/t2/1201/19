Subject: Re: [T2] Bearing Housing Question - '72 Weekender

There doesn't seem to be any wear on the sleeve, but it there's at least a
quarter inch between it and the housing wall. It appears (to me) that its
function is to keep the bearings in place along the axle.
 
And for what it's worth, the existing bearing does not seem to be worn and
appears beefier than its new replacement. I muight just use the original and
repack it after all the stories I read in the forums about on the quality of
newer bearings.
