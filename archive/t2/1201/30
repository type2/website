Fine ground for the cone, reg ground seems to go thru too fast.
I've been buying the little cans of 'Espresso" ground coffee for the 
cone, kept one in the bus along with 2 cones & filters.
FWIW those little electric coffee grinders work well at turning reg 
ground coffee into finely ground coffee.
