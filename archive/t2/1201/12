Subject: Re: [T2] Slipping clutch? Daughter's 75 bus

I watched as she pushed the pedal, it has free play and engages- but 
there is noticable play  of side to side movement in the ?sleeve bearing 
holding the shift fork shaft.  Years ago her return spring failed, could 
net get off the arm- I ran an external spring to the engine wall with an 
eyebolt which still works.
Guess the engine is going out- we've done it both with trans and 
without-taking off the axles and removing shift coupler is no fun, and 
was heavier, but I do have a motorcycle jack.  Also, with Jamie's hitch 
on the bumper/frame, I think we had to remove the bumper to get engine 
far back enough.  I'm playing in a musical plus 2 major concerts in a 
band and orchastra, can,t get to this until week after memorial day weekend.
