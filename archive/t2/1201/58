Subject: Re: [T2] Sudden loss of power

I'm not dismissing anything. Just trying to prioritize the order I
check things and make sure I check everything it may be.

Clogged fuel filter should recover and run good for at least a block or
so after an overnight sit to allow everything south of said filter to
fill up. My filter is under the bus, outside the engine bay. I'll look
when I crawl under to pop the valve covers.

The power loss seems a bit too ... consistent ... for just a dirty
carb. plus, it seems that idle would be affected. Doesn't the idle
circuit draw a bit of it's fuel/air through the main?

Same with timing. It starts good and idles nicely, including when
coming to a stop after driving a mile or so. Timing slipped far enough
to affect power should cause a really high idle and hot running
(advanced) or an ugly, slow, stumbly idle and hard starting (retarded).
