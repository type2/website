Subject: Drawing Needed (tubes under the floor)

I remember seeing a sketch someone made labelling each tube (under the floor)
of bay window busses that carry the vacuum, brake cables, heater box cables,
clutch, throttle, and wiring. I have searched both Samba and Ratwell, and
cannot find it... does anyone know where it is ?
