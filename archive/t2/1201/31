When I camp with our Boy Scout troop - one of the Dads brings a blue 
steel peculator pot that sits on a stove or the fire. Makes really, 
really good coffee by my measure.

I've seen similar pots at the local discount stores.

Another option if you have an inverter:

I run mine on a 750W or 1000W inverter (I have both). Even on a 51R 
series battery it will brew something beyond a half dozen cups though 
the inverter low voltage alarm triggers. The engine in my daily driver 
cranked over happily anyhow.

We have two of these and use them every morning. No filter necessary. 
Occasionally likes to be cleaned out with white vinegar - just fill the 
water reservoir and brew a cup of nothing. Then brew of cup or two of 
plain water to rid it of the vinegar taste. The check valve ball gets 
stuck if it is not cleaned monthly or so.

Glad your trip went so well.
