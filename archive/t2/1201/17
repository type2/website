There is no debate... leave the trans in... let it loose from the upper 
hanger tho..
make sure it is neutral to ensure the shifter doesn't get bent...

You most certainly do NOT have to remove the bumper to drop an engine....
even if you have an inadeqate floor jack,, and tiny floor stands... [lol]
the engine doesn't HAVE to come all the way out onto a bench....
leave it under the bus,, turn it a bit to get access,, and pop on the new 
clutch stuff
put it back in!  Saves 30 min on the flat rate!
lol   boom,, your done! ... you can do it tonight ... don't worry about the 
musical stuff
45 min for it to be on the floor..  add double that and your driving out the 
door!
