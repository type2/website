Other info I left out. I'm just trying to get a good list of places to
check so I can prioritize them when I can break away from customers
long enough to go start.

Taylor spiral wound 8mm wires with connectors that almost require
pulling the motor to get enough leverage to pop them off.

MSD 6420 (6AL)

NGK B7HS plugs gapped at .045 or .050

MSD Blaster epoxy filled coil without ballast resistor while the 6AL is
hooked up.

Using the points as a trigger only, condenser etc. not used. 

It gives me another place to check though. I can plug in the ballast
resistor and switch back to points in about 5 minutes.

Have been running the MSD since December
