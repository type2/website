Subject: re: replacing battery tray

I bought a battery tray for our '72 Bus a number of years ago and the
recommendation at that point was to get one from a certain Mercedes Benz
model, which I've now forgotten.  It sat on a shelf for quite a while and I
eventually used it for my '69 Opel GT last year.
