I'll second the Honda EU1000. We have one at work that we use to power 
the lights and cellphone/laptop chargers at BajaSAE races and it sure is 
nice to skip all the noise of the typical Briggs & Stratton powered 
generator until the B&S is needed to power an air compressor or welder.

Personally I'm planning to buy the Honda 2000W EU series ginny 
eventually. Storms and camping trips (if we want to haul a ginny). 
Normally LED lights and a cooler are enough to make us happy.
