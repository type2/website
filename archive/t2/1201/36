Subject: replacing battery tray

I picked up a battery tray from schofield, as per list recommendations. I
got it quite a while ago.

 

I'm finally trying to find some time to install it. I talked to my bodyshop
guy. He said no problem, but he doesn't usually work on VW's like this. I
told him I would ask for recommendations on installing this, and let him
know. I have not dug in there to see how bad the original is, but I know it
is pretty bad. I imagine I'll cut it out, and then is it spot welded around
the body, and then some seam sealer?

 

After this.maybe sometime this summer I'll get to the rocker panels-which
are really bad.

 

Thanks for any tips.
