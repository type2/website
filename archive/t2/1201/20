Subject: 15" Tires

Hi-

I have been off list for a while, and have thinned my herd down to just my
daily driver - a '73 panel van.  I have 15" BRM style wheels, and completely
worn out 195/60R15 Yokohama tires.  This was the recommended tire when they
were installed 10+ years ago.

Can anybody recommend a suitable tire?  I am hoping to go with a slightly
taller tire for better freeway cruising.  The Bus Depot tire (Vredstein)
doesn't blow my skirt up, and a trip to Discount Tire wasn't very productive.
Another tire shop recommended the BF Goodrich Radial T/A, and it does seem to
have a pretty hefty sidewall.

Suggestions?  Thanks!
