They have a very decent general store, which had coffee, which is a priority
for my wife. I've got to figure out how to make decent coffee on our own-as
most campgrounds don't have this. <<


Coffee is important in my world & boiling water is not really hard to 
do in a bus. I'm skipping over perked coffee, cowboy coffee & instant coffee...

I started out with a French Press which worked well, made good coffee 
but was a pain to clean.
My next experiment was with one of those cones you put on top of the 
cup, put a filter in and pour the boiling water over the grounds. 
That worked great when we used fine ground coffee, it was easy to 
clean and with more than one cone you can make more than one cup at a 
time. This has been the daily coffee tool for a year or so now. The 
cones are cheap & light weight, the filters are cheap and the coffee is good.

This morning I tried regular ground coffee (ran out of the fine 
ground and the grinder makes too much noise for that hour), tossed in 
a cup & the boiling water on top of that. Gave it 4 min to make 
coffee then poured it thru the cone-filter and ended up with clean 
coffee & nothing to clean other than to rinse the brewing cup.

A pot to boil the water, $5 worth of coffee making stuff, some coffee 
& you are in business on those fine Big Sur mornings ... or where 
ever you wake up.
