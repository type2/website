Subject: Pop top fixin up Q's:

Hello -

Here are my "questions for the day:"

- Anyone know where I could purchase another white seal to go around the 
base of my '70 ASI/Riviera pop top (the pop top that pops straight up as 
opposed to at an angle)?  It's the part that goes around the base of that 
top part when the pop top is down...if I explained that right.  Someone 
suggested that I can buy one that is speckled or something like that - as 
opposed to white.  But I'd of course like to get original color for my white 
on white camper.  Actually, it may be that mine isn't in too bad of 
condition...it's just come off.  Suggesitons for re-attaching, if it turns 
out mine's good enough to keep?

- I've finally taken the camper out of the garage where it's been sitting 
for years, to have some sun.  But lately we've had scorching sun or else 
rain.  With my pop top seal being half off, am I putting the camper at much 
risk when it rains?

-Those long coiled springs that are on the outside of the poptop: mine work 
fine but look to be rusty.  Anyone know of a way to remove and clean off the 
rust (?) or else replace them??

-Finally, I've read about pop tops for Westies being easy to replace, but 
what about for Rivieras?  This is the only one I haven't tried to look up, 
so apologies if the info is at my fingertips somewhere.  Does anyone sell 
reproductions (e.g. yellow vinyl straight-up pop tops)?

Thanks very much in advance!
