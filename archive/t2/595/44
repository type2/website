Subject: Re: [T2] Westy sticker

Rob,
	Looking out my window at my 72 westy I can see a completely faded 
sticker of the same shape as the one shown on the drivers side luggage 
rack. It is positioned all the way forward on the luggage rack just 
above the first "step" in the fiberglass. Hope this helps. -Jeff
