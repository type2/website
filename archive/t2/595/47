Subject: RE: [T2] VW vs Porsche Backyard Mechanic?

Of course, the parts are an order of magnitude higher, but the 911 is as
easy to work on as any aircooled VW.  They are amazingly similar in their
engineering.

There is a great website for porsche called www.rennlist.com, the mail lists
are great -- shockingly similar to this one!  I have a website over there
called http://members.rennlist.com/rmdanie/ ,check it out if you want.

I've been around vws and porsches since I was in high school and I love the
aircooled technology.  Actually, now all my vehicles are aircooled!

Hope this helps,

Hello,

I have been working on and off VW's for the last 20 years. I consider myself
a "qualified certified backyard mechanic", my friends agree that I am
definitely "certified". I am considering tinkering with Dr. F. Porsche's
other car - the Porsche. My mind wants an early 911, but my wallet (and more
importantly wife) says I should tone down my desire to a 914 or 924. No
offence to those that have those vehicles -  but no thanks. So my compromise
is the 912 (not the 1976 version). It looks like a 911, but has two less
cylinders.

My question is to those that are fortunate enough to have two great air
cooled cars. How easy or hard is it to work on the Porsche's compared to the
VW? Are parts as available as the VW? Is the Porsche network as good as the
VW one? Any other comments/advice?

Thanks in advance for help, Phil.
