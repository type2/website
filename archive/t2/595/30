Your business caught my attention while I was
online searching for a auto repair shop for my 97
Volkswagon Jetta.  

I'm sorry to say that I don't have a business and
never did.  I once recommended a shop in WV and
that's probably what you saw.  

>I just bought it... for some reason just the
other day it wouldn't start.  I live in Bremerton
WA.  

Can anyone in the Bremerton, Wash area recommned
a shop for this sailor?
