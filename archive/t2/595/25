Oh, and once you finally get them off, it might be smart to apply a
little high temp anti-seize to the threads before re-torquing them to
the proper tightness.

Heat the lugs with a torch. Sometimes that helps to break them free.
I've heard of people heating lugs with torches, then pressing a candle
against them. The idea is that the molten wax will wick into the
threads.

Also spray them repeatedly with PB Blaster

Be careful not to strip them. You might try taking them to a different
shop with some higher power lug wrenches.
