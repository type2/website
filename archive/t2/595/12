Subject: 84 Wolfy, Dunner, for sale to a good home

Hey Gang,

It was with great sadness that I'm emailing to put my VW up on the selling 
block.  My granpa just passed away a couple weeks ago & I inherited his 
truck.  Unfortunately with 17k miles on it it's too good of an opportunity 
to pass up & I can't afford to do anything else with my van (time, space, or 
money).  He's been good to be but I have to let him ago.  It's the tragic 
end to a good epoch - at least I can say I fulfilled a childhood dream.  I 
thought I'd put him up on the lists first where I know he has the best 
chance of finding a good home.  Before I give the specs I just wanted to say 
thanks for all the support.  I've flown generally under the radar but the 
information I've had made available has been tremendous & truly appreciated.

Here's everything I could remember of noteworth:
1984 1.9l VW Vanagon Wolfsburg Edition, automatic, 160k mi, bought 2yrs ago 
with 148k mi on it.  Still have factory curtains & rear bug screen, ac (did 
but doesnt work).  The Van has rebuilt engine by Porsche-trained mechanic 
(14k ago), replaced torque converter (14k ago), replaced afm (14k ago), 
replaced fuel hoses (1yr ago), replaced alternator (1yr ago), replaced brake 
pads (2yrs ago), new midas muffler (1yr ago), reupholstered front bucket 
seats (1yr ago), 2 michilin agilis tires (2yrs ago), 2 big-o tires (1yr 
ago), 2 new batteries (one auxiliary) 1yr ago, cd player w/ 3 additional 
speakers (1 sub-woofer & 2 6x9s) & 1000watt amp, regular oil changes & 
routine maintenance (various little odds & ends replaced).  Dunner has minor 
dents & scratches, some surface & seem rust.  The interior is in relatively 
good condition, although back seats upholstery are worn.  The vn has the 
original owners manual (w/ wolfy supplement) & Muir, Haynes, & Bentley 
Manuals.  He runs just fine now & has had many essential components 
replaced.  With a few little odds an ends it could be like a brand new van 
(joints, starter, O2 sensor may need replacing in next couple years).  Also 
the PO from Ohio passed emissions 2 or 3 yrs ago, although none since (no 
standards in KY), so I assume it can still pass emissions standards.

For any questions or inquiries please email me off list at 
zenlunatic42(-at-)hotmail.com.  I'm asking $2200 obo.  If I don't hear anything 
from you guys I'll probably throw him up on ebay in the next week or so.

Thanks a bunch.

  -Andrew of Frankfort, KY
