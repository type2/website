Subject: Re: [T2] Double Relay to fuel Pump

Hi Volks,

Addendum: If there is power from the battery at 88y/88Z and the fuel 
pump spins when power is applied to pin 88D but the bus won't send 
power to the pump with the key turned to start or the AFM vane moved, 
you have a bad double relay.

Happy trails,
