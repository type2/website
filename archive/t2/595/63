Hi Michael,

Just clean both sides of the contact area ( body and strap) with a wire 
brush and reconnect them. A coating of dielectric grease on top of that 
will help put off further corrosion.

My own answer to this eternal question was to install a new secondary 
ground cable from the battery to the fan shroud. For the $8 it cost, it 
was a 10 minute install.

Happy trails,
