Subject: Re: [T2] Can't get lug nuts off!

I reccomend using a socket with a breaker bar. Once you have the socket 
on the lug and a good amount of force on the breaker bar, hit the 
breaker bar where it connects to the socket with a sledge hamner. The 
direction of the hit should be towards the brake drum perfectly 
parralell to the axis of the wheel stud. A couple of good whacks with a 
heavy sledge while applying a good amount of torque with the breaker bar 
should break them loose. Hope this helps - Jeff
> I am having new tires installed at Costco and they can't get the Lug Nuts off.  Said they had their torque wrench up to 330lbs and they would not budge.  What happened?  did the drums overheat causing them to freeze or something?  I busted 5 different lug wrenches with a 4 foot cheater bar trying to get them off.  Any suggestions?
