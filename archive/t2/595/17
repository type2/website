Subject: Sportsmobile logo

Hi Volks,

A friend of mine just acquired a sportmobile roof to upgrade his 68 
westy. He was wondering if someone could send a pic of the sportmobile 
logo so that he could have a new one made for the roof, the original is 
pretty much gone.

You can post a link or send the pics direct to me, whatever is more 
convenient. I've been to the sportsmobile website, but I don't know if 
the logo there is the one we need.

Thanks in advance.

Happy trails,
