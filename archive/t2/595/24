I've heard of people heating lugs with torches, then pressing a candle
against them. The idea is that the molten wax will wick into the
threads.

Beg, borrow or... replacement lug nuts...
Find an old fashioned ive cream parlor or
any source of dry ice...Heat the lug nuts
with a torch and (with a gloved hand) apply
the dry ice to the lug nuts one by one...
Don't let the dry ice touch the studs!!
A "nut buster" might also work, but I
know that mine doesn't fit with the 
wheel on...
My thinking is that it's probably better 
to sacrifice the lug nuts rather than 
snapping the studs off if the nuts are
THAT tight... ;-(
