Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical Delima, No power up front.

Thanks to all that helped in this one. Either it's just me being a bus 
newbie or the fact that I was doing this at 5:30 am Sunday after being up 
all night connecting Vacuum lines fuel lines misc. electrical and such. But 
I did go back to double check as I remembered what I had done. As I was 
Cleaning the wire connections I had shoved two of them up behind something 
above the accordian tube fron the heater box. That was when the rain got so 
bad I had to crawl out of there and wait. When I went back I cleaned and 
connected the remaining wires and forgot to pull the others back down. I 
went under there yesterday evening and there they were. Power has been 
restored up front. The big black wire I found dangling from the fuse block 
is the main feed for the AC Unit. It connects to the #9 Accessory Terminal. 
Makes a big spark and it is live all the time. I disconnected the wire that 
went to the fuse block for the radio. PO had had tied it to one of the tangs 
that holds the fuses. Quick and handy insulated VW connector to the big fat 
one and the radio and bingo radio and no big sparks flying around as I get 
in and out.

The engine still has not fired though on to the next post.
