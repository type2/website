Subject: Westy sticker

My buddy has a '72 Westy and he bought the small Westy sticker (shown here)
http://www.baywindowbus.com/september004.JPG

He said the guys at WolfsburgWest told him it was original to his '72 and it
went on the "roof". However I don't think that sticker was on the early buses.
Can anyone confirm this for me?

I looked on my brochure, but the pics are only from the passenger side as I
guess they were accentuating the sliding door shot.

Thanks!
