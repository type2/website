Phil, I am with your wife (hmm, maybe that doesn't sound right...) on 
this one.

I am the happy owner of an '83 944, which cost me $6K CDN 2 years ago. 
It is the most fun, reliable, robust, good looking, and fastest car I 
have ever owned.  The parts are more expensive than a VW certainly, but 
do not reach the 911 stratosphere, and 912s being rarer are not going to 
be cheaper.  Interesting there are cross-over parts from my '82 Westy to 
the Porsche, notably the Bosch FI system which operates almost identically.

There are almost as many Porsche part suppliers out there as VW too, so 
don't worry about that (www.pelicanparts.com is a good example).  For a 
glance at the most well-known online community go to www.rennlist.com.
