Subject: Re: [T2] Was Hard to Crank. Now FLOATING TIMING

I just went back out to do some tests on the Fuel Filter to see if maybe
that was it. I cranked it, it ran for like 5 seconds. I waited about 20
seconds, cranked it again, and it ran for another 5 seconds. I tried again
right away to keep fuel pressure from building (that my theory of whats
happening) and it did not start. So I waited like  almost a full minute with
the key in the "ON" state, and tried again and now it's working fine. I'm
thinking maybe I had air and/or filth in the lines that needed cleared. And
that maybe some of that decaying hose matter either got backed up through
the system or let in the air in the first place.

But now my Timing Floats. It's going from +8 to -4 on the timing gauge/bar
thing. What would make timing float? Only floats about 1degree per 45seconds
give or take. Does timing change with engine heat? I disconnected the vacuum
to the can, but that didn't do anything, and I felt no vacuum in the line.
It's a Dvda and I don't have a retard hose hooked up (dizzy was a junkyard
find).
