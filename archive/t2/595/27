Subject: fuel pump relay voltage requirements

A fuel pump relay should provide power to the pump
when the key is turned to the on position. Pressurizes
the system. then it clicks off and waits for the
signal
from the coil to close again and start the pump.
The initial start up of the fuel pump allows for the
system to pressurize so the engine will start.. as
soon
as it starts the coil puts out the signal to restart
and
operate the pump. common connection is a red/black
wire.
Disclaimer: I havent had to mess with a FI bus... but
have rewired a 83 bunny for a 92 passat 2L 16v. The
above is based on that exercise. I assume the
requirement
for the coil output is a saftey feature so that the
pump quits if the engine dies. like in case of an
accident...

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me What a long, strange trip it's been.
