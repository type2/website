Subject: 77 no beep-beep (horn)

Ok, so we're trying to get this wonderful 77 inspected for my friend...at
least it's now running, but the horn doesn't work, and it seems to be a
lot different from splitty horns. I've got 12v at both terminals on the
horn, but seems to be no continuity between the terminal at the bottom,
and the one under the button at the steering wheel. I pulled out the ring
with the spade terminal from the top, but can't see where the wire goes.
Bentley of course is completely unhelpful...I'm beginning to think ol'
Bentley ain't all it's cracked up to be.
Anyway, also looking up at the steering column from underneath, there
looks to be a short wire bridging across the joint in the column. Is this
part of the horn? I get no reading on it either way?
What am I missing, besides a good manual which actually has decent
diagrams and diagnostic procedures???
