sounds like it is running rich. Try starting it with your foot on the floor as if it was flooded. Hold your foot there. If you crank it and it won't start, keep your foot there and let the starter rest, and try again. After 3 or 4 20 second attempts, it will prob go. Every time you move your foot, it will pump more gas into the cylinders. Are the carbs synched correctedly (linkage not failing?)
