Subject: Fuse Holder Leads to Double Relay

This is a '77 Deluxe Westy(production date 11/76), but I looked in there 
last night and the inline holder is there. But only one line in and one line 
out. I do have a direct line that goes to the coil(black) that is connected 
to the positive side. Before I figured out the starter connects, I put a 
live feed to the positive side of the coil and the relay would click. Now 
with the key on and I operated the flap on the AFM the relat will click. I 
will take another look today around lunch time and get a few pics. I think 
the lead for the fuse holder came from the harness to the relay, the other 
side of the fuse goes to a battery connector for the Aux. battery. No 
battery there currently.

Any ideas? Am I looking at the wrong thing?
