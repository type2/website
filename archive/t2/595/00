Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical Delima, No power up front.

No power at the fuse block. Could there be somehting with me cleaning up the 
 connections at the starter?
 
 Two spade connectors one fat one small on the solenoid.
Three ring connectors on the post for the starter.

Only 3 on the starter post?  Better look for more...... I have 6 on my 77 deluxe Westy.
