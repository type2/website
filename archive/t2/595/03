I believe that Mark has misunderstood me as well.  I have two aircooled
VWs and they have served me in good stead for decades.  The engines have
been restored to completely stock condition, except for carburators
(now 30/31) and alternators.  I have gone through and carefully restored
all the tin and have _zero_ overheating problems even on the hottest days
and steepest hills.

I appreciate a well-kept aircooler, and I also appreciate a
well-executed engine conversion.  I do not appreciate a hack job whether
it involves an original aircooled engine or an watercooled engine.

As the doctor's rule says:  First, do no harm.  The best conversions are
completely reversable.  If, later on, the owner decides to go back to
aircooled power, it is a matter of swapping parts.
