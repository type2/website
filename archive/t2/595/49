Subject: Orange '73 VW Bus wanted in Saskatchewan

Hi Volks,

I thought I'd pass this along. If anyone traveling around Regina 
Saskatchewan sees an orange '73 bus, please report it to the 
authorities ASAP. Perhaps our fascination with spotting buses can help 
with a criminal investigation, and get this little girl home.

            Police and volunteer search-and-rescue teams put in 5,600
            man-hours looking for Tamra before the focus shifted to a
            investigation last week.

            The search was then picked up by aboriginal groups who came
            to Regina from across the province.

            In another development, police said they were looking for two
            vehicles: an orange 1973 Volkswagen van and a red-and-silver
           1989 GMC 1500 pickup truck with a 4X4 decal on the side
            toward the back.

           Both vehicles were reported stolen the day Tamra was reported
           missing and have not been recovered.

           "They may be involved in the disappearance of Tamra Keepness;
           they may not be. We don't know and until we recover the 
vehicles
           we won't know," Popowich said.

           Tamra was living with her mother and five siblings, including 
her
           twin sister when she disappeared.

           She is thin, three-foot-five, and weighs 40 pounds with bobbed
           brown hair and brown eyes. When last seen, she was wearing
           a light-blue striped halter top with pink accents, light blue 
jeans,
           and pink and white shoes.

Happy trails,
