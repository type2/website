Are these nuts or the bolts?
I use a breaker bar with an impact socket and then the cheater bar, then I 
'bounce' on it.
If rust might be a issue I always squirt it down with a penetrating fluid 
first, if rust IS an issue and you have the time squirting down every day 
for a few days is not a bad idea.
Heat will help a bunch if it's a nut....

In the FWIW file, I have had problems in the past with steel lug nuts on 
alloy wheels, dissimilar metals. The wheels were torqued with a torque 
wrench then 3 months later (for the rotate) they were tight, tight, tight! 
A touch of anti-seize between the dissimilar metals did the trick for the 
next rotate.

Good luck!
