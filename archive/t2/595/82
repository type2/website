is your ground good?  Ive had starters not go because of crappy grounds.

It sounds like your timing may be too advanced, and the early firing may be
stopping the engine, trying to turn it the wrong way.  However, you said it
ran fine right before that, so it seems odd that it would just go off on its
own.

Sorry but thats all I can think of.  Good Luck!
