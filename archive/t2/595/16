I'm using a stock VWofA accessory hitch on my '71 and was a little
concerned that I would have problems with my new Berg exhaust but the
beauty of the stock hitch is its ability to be assembled on the Bus and I
ended up having no problem at all with the installation. I'll
take some pictures of the setup tonight.
