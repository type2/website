Subject: Can't get lug nuts off!

I am having new tires installed at Costco and they can't get the Lug Nuts off.  Said they had their torque wrench up to 330lbs and they would not budge.  What happened?  did the drums overheat causing them to freeze or something?  I busted 5 different lug wrenches with a 4 foot cheater bar trying to get them off.  Any suggestions?
