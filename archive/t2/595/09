Look on the drivers side in the engine compartment, the aux battery would be on a deluxe Westy.
Do you see a black in-line fuse holder?
If yes, [hope so!], it will have 3 black wires. 2 coming out the rear and 1 out the front.
One of the 2 coming out the rear HAS to go to the positive side of the coil. It is what feeds key on power to
the double relay. The 2nd one out the rear goes to the double relay.
[The one out the front, going thru the fuse, goes to the back-up light switch on the trans]
