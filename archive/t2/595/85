Hydrolock is when a cylinder fills up with fuel or water. 

Air is compressible and a liquid is not (for our purposes) so the cylinder will go towards top dead center and get stopped by the fuel because it does not have any place to go. Once it leaks out past the valves or rings, the engine will rotate past this point. 

A leaky injector could cause this. 

I like to start with the simple causes first - they are easier to fix and cheaper to fix too. 

Check your timing and then remove the spark plugs AND disconnect power to the coil and spin the motor. If it spins fine or if there is a strong smell of fuel - or worse fuel sprays from an open spark plug hole, you've found the problem. 

BUT like I said check your timing - position of the distributor and points setting. You didn't just replace spark plugs, or dist. cap or wires did you? I've caused this problem by getting the above in the wrong order. Essentially this causes the timing to be WAY off.
