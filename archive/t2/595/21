Subject: Re: [T2] Can't get lug nuts off!

This is what happens when the lug nuts are put on with
a air wrench, use a torque wrench to put them on once
you get them off , it may cost you some money to get
them broken loose, go to a truck tire shop they should
be able to get them loose or broken off. when the lugs
are put on that tight it warps the rotors. Good luck
with getting them off. Phil
