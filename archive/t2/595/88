Subject: Seat Questions

I found the seat stand mats on busdepot.com so that answers one question, but two are remaining.  
 
What do I use to attach the seat stand mats?  Has anyone used other materials?
 
Also within the seat stands is a large opening.  I was wondering if there were any  coverings that are supposed to cover this area.  Or is this just large open storage space?
 
regards,
cp
