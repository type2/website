Subject: RE: [T2] Fuse Holder Leads to Double Relay

Hey there Michael this is yourself talking to you. No that is not the 
correct fuse holder. I just talked to your friend Wes Brown another listee 
who was looking at two buses for the same fuse holder.

78 Westy Deluxe - Yep it's there.
77 Westy - Yep it's there.

Michael maybe the question that you should ask yourself and the list is:

Would that fuse holder still be there if it were an Automatic (77 Westy 
Deluxe AutomaticTransmission)?

Anybody out there with a '77-'78 Westy Automatic Fuel Injected that has this 
fuse holder on their bus? Just looking for verification that someone else 
does.
Location for those who missed it; engine compartment, driver's side, three 
wires, one goes to the double relay, one to the coil, and one to the reverse 
light swith on the tranny.

Thanks and Michael test the double relay when you get home, okay.
