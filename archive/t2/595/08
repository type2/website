Subject: Fuel Injection Troubleshooting

Good Monday Morning to all of you,

Okay after getting the power back up front. Engine installed, all vacuum 
lines accounted for fuel lines all check out. Power to coil, spark at the 
coil and at the plugs. Relay clicks when power is added either by jumper to 
the coil from the battery or by pulling the cover from the AFM and pushing 
the needle over to trigger the relay. But....

The fuel pump is not kicking in! I know that it works great I tested it out 
of the vehicle with straight wires to the battery. I crawled under there to 
verify the wires were connected, they are.

I touched into the bootleg copy of the Type II Fuel sytems book last night 
but gave up as tired eyes kicked in and they don't go well with those 
bluuuurrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyy pages. Although I can't complain when I can't seem 
to find a manual of my own. Plus I had to start packing up my shop. Put away 
all the tools, throw out the trash and debris from building the engine. I 
have to get rid of all those Type IV Heads, Cases, Carbs, Westy Camping 
Gear, Factory Dash Clocks, boxes of NOS Injectors and a 200 gal. tub full of 
other NOS FI parts still in the packages(ECU's, Wiring Harnesses, deccel 
valves, AFMs, etc). Is your mouth watering? I am just kidding.

I guess my question is, could the relay be clicking and not functioning? 
When I say clicking, I mean it has a single click when power is added.

This is actually a relief. The power thing upfront was a frantic feeling of 
WTF did I do. I though it had to do with the AC Unit Removal. Silly me. But 
I expected to have to troubleshoot and make repairs/replacements to the FI 
system. It is used and why would some one want to remove it unless it wasn't 
working properly? I am glad I was able pick up the entire System to replace 
the Weber. I am sure I will be posting more soon i reguards top the FI.

I will be slow on "el Verde" this week I am going to be moving. I have to 
prepare the house to be moved into before I can take all my Sh(-at-)# over there. 
It sucks that I will not be driving her over there, but it is right next 
door =D. I hope I can get moved, get the rest of the bus finished and rest 
in time for HCBF.

So if there are any quick suggestions in reguards to the fuel pump issue 
that others have found please let me know.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
'77 Westy Deluxe, "el Verde" so close
