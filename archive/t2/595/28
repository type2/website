>how do i  find the timing degree marks to set it
at 5 degrees BFTDC? 009 dizzy?

You'll need a degree pulley because you are
switching from a stock dizzy.  You will also need
to forget about that 5 BTDC timing.  The 009 has
18-20 degrees of advance, meaning if you retard
the idle timing by 5 degree, you'll get about 13
degrees of advance max.  That will be a real
slug.  

The 009 guys say that they time it at 28-30
degrees max and let the idle fall where it may,
usually about 12-15 BTDC.  This will give you a
real throttle lag, but, at least the dizzy is
cheap.
