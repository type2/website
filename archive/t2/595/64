Subject: was Double Relay to fuel Pump, now battery cables/connectors

Thanks I will try that first either way I should have done it when I was in 
there. I have to buy a new ground strap later anyway. The one tha the PO 
installed is RED. Well no come to think of it I wrapped it in electrical 
tape so I wouldn't confuse myself.. Color is okay.

I replaced the battery connector on the positive side of the battery with a 
brass connector. Can anybody think of a problem that this could cause?
