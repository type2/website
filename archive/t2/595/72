I don't believe anybody sells that.

>I also need the entire engine wiring harness. I can't seem to figure out what goes where. I need the harness that goes from the battery to the starter, from the starter to the ignition / alternator, etc. I don't even know if what I have is set up the way it was supposed to.

I don't think anyone sells that for a 72-79 bus.

I believe almost all of the wiring harnesses come indirectly from Wiring Works in San Pedro, CA who support the "vintage" restoration market. West Coast Metric also sells their own harnesses.
