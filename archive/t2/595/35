Subject: the 2 wires that connect to the regulator

Hi all...

I have a question about wiring in hopes to solve an ongoing electrical
problem.

Bus: 74 Westy, 1800cc

I know that there are 3 things that are supposed to connect to the voltage
regulator on a westy. The harness from the alternator, the blue wire that
goes to the dash light, and a black wire. What is the black wire for?

I vaguely remember that it has something to do with the auxilary battery
charging system on dual battery busses.....

Where does that black wire lead to? 

My bus hasn't had a second battery since I've owned it, but it has had an
electrical problem that causes the tail lights to blink weird and slowly
drain the battery when parked. 

Since I've disconnected the little black wire at the regulator the problem
has stopped. I just wanted to be sure that it was ok to disconnect.... AND
know where it goes so maybe i can find a short.

thanks all

Eddie
