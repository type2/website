Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injection Troubleshooting

Awesome I was wondering about that. There is a fuse holder over there. It 
doesn't look like a normal VW Fuse holder that I am used to seeing. I 
thought that it had something to do with the aux. battery. Which is all 
sorts of disconnected by the PO. I will fix that later. But when I get home 
I will try out the fuse and see what wires are going where?

How many wires do you have on the positive side of the coil? I am guessing 
that if I add another it will make 3.

You said that you have 6 wires to the post on the starter? I have only 5 on 
the post and then the 2 on the solenoid.

These buses are a little more confusing than the bugs and ghias, but I am 
learning.

Thanks,
