The number of wires on the sarter terminal varies depending on year and
accesories.  "Losing" one is very easy and most of them are necessary to
get the engine to start.  When I remove these wires I bring a zip-tie or
twist-tie under the bus with me and slide them straight off the stud onto
the twist-tie.  That way they are all in one place when it comes time to
reconnect them

OOK!
