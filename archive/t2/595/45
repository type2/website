Subject: Oil Cooler Leak- Solved!!!

Hi Everyone,

I just want thank you for you help in solving my leaking oil cooler problem.
I am now certifiable in removing and installing Type 4 oil coolers.  I
removed the oil cooler this morning and inspected the cooler and sending
unit.  Sending unit was dry, so I moved on to filling the oil cooler with
solvent then pressurizing.  I couldn't detect any major leak so I took the
unit the dreaded 30 miles to my nearest VW shop.  They had a really neat rig
were they pressure test oil coolers.  Instantly mine was losing pressure.
The owner promised me it was holding pressure last week when I brought it in
to determine if it had bad seals (which it did), but mainly an oil leak.  So
he showed me a refurbished unit on the tester and it held a steady 40 psi.
He made me a deal of $50 on the refurbished unit and threw in some new
seals.  I replaced the cooler this afternoon and had great joy sucking
exhaust fumes for 15 minutes while watching for leaks.
I degreased the under side of the engine tonight.... Ah, clean non-leaking
VW engine sleeps in the carport.  I actually feel good about the bus
tonight! Yeah!
Thanks guys,

Tom
