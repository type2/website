You should check the fluid level and refill if necessary. Use GL-4 (not GL-5 or ATF) tranny fluid.
 
Yes, the tranny will need to come out to fix the leaks, but they are easy to fix:
1) Nose Seal (Probably your leak)
2) Nose Cone-gearbox gasket (replace to get at #1)
3) Drive Flange seals (if they leak)
4) Gearbox-Bellhousing Gasket (probably OK)
 
You can get all the parts from http://www.longenterprises.com/index.htm
