Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel vents and charcoal canister

Seems that if you cut it off in the vent wing then the vapors will be sucked 
right back into the engine compartment along with the fresh air that is 
coming in. Not sure as to why the double except for the following.

(This is all theory and logic and I am not a VW Engineer but it makes sense 
to me.)

A B
X
C D

C and D would be the connections to the tank. A and B would be the 
connection to the lines.
Senario: Full Tank or Moderately full. Take a left turn, the bus rocks to 
the BD side and the gas could flow up into the B side tubing bu the A side 
would still be vented. The vent lines run up to the top of the vent wings to 
prevent the gas from traveling that far up. If it didn't then you would have 
gas running down into the charcoal canister. It really wouldn't take much to 
make it correct and be safe.

It sounds like your tee setup could work although the senario above wouldn't 
work out exactly right, not the same capacity.  Do not cut the vent line.
