Subject: Thermostat installation - Type 1 Engine

My '71 bus engine is totally stock, except that, for years, the thermostat  
has been missing.  A few years ago, I saw the light and got the thermostat  and 
all associated parts (mounting bracket, link rod, etc) so I have everything  
I need.  What I can't figure out is how to install these parts without  
pulling the engine.  Obviously, if there is a way to do this without an  engine 
pull, that would be best.  Has anyone ever done this without pulling  the engine.
