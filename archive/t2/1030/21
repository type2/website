Subject: NOT T2 related (2001 Ford Expedition) but I need educated

I have a 2001 Ford Expedition that is a company vehicle. As of the last few
months, it has started making this sound (not terribly loud) like the
knocking of marbles together. I recently had the oil changed, and the sound
goes away when I take my foot off the accelerator. I only hear it briefly
when it is going from first into second and then into third. It gets a
little louder when the RPMs are higher and then fades to nothing when the
tranny shifts.

Could this be the result of not putting in high enough octane gas? I have
been putting in 85 (lowest Octane in Colorado) although the manual asks for
87 and higher. Is this simply "knocking" that I am hearing or possibly a
bigger problem?

I was thinking about filling it up with some 91 just to see if it helps
(though my wallet is gonna scream) and popping in some BG44K.

VW Content: Thanks to the nice weather we are having here in Colorful
Colorado, I am very excited that I may have Zoey back on the road before
May. Then I can stop driving the gas guzzling Ford all together.

I miss driving my bus.
