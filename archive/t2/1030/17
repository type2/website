Subject: Re: [T2] is this a double relay issue 

Tim
Can you do a diode test on the double relay,,  you should get continuity
between term 86a and 86b ... or 86a and 85 in one direction.. and no
continuity if you reverse you leads .  if that diode is shorted... power
could go from 88z ,, thru that relay.. resistor,,  AFM flap switch.. thru
the diode backwards.. to the starter term 50,, and hold the starter
engaged.... I really doubt this could happen...   the afm switch shouldn't
be closed till the engine is running.. and the starter solenoid would be in
series with the internal resister in the double relay.... which should lower
the current to the solenoid... and it should not hold in....

those are the long shots i can guess at...

hope that helps
