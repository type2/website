Subject: rear torsion bars

In my quest to tune up my 74 bus rear suspension.. I have been trying to
figure out if there is a slightly heavier torsion bar available.

Thing is.. I don't even know what is in my bus!  any idea?  what is stock
for a 74 Westfalia ..?

I have a spare pair of green torsion bars.. iirc.. they came out of a 78
camper that I parted out. they measure 29mm x 610mm

I am not trying to lift the rear... but after having my bus around since
90.. I have noticed it is lower to the ground.. to the point the rubber
snubbers are in contact with the trailing arms

My bus came to me with load levelors coil over shocks ,,  I replaced them
with new coil over shocks,, but the new ones only last about 11months... as
the shaft is smaller diameter.. and it flexes.,, breaking the chrome
plating.. causing seals to rip, and the shaft to rust.

I'd like to be prepared with new,, good used,, torsion bars,, rubber
bushings etc,,, to limit the downtime to a min.

so,, I thought I'd ask if anyone knows the specs of the rear torsion bars
from 1974 Bus,, would Westfalia have spec'd heavier torsion bars for the
campers

Here is a picture i got off samba,, is this a perspective thing,, or is one
bar shorter than the other...

 Sway a way?  I can't find the 24"  [610mm] bars on the website...
