Subject: Early Bay Westy Upholstery

After all these years (got my 1971 Westy in 1984), I'm thinking it would be  
nice to redo the camper upholstery.  I'm refering to the honey-opal  colored 
vinyl material in the back, not the standard bus upholstery in  the driver and 
passenger seats - already re-did that and it's all nicey  nicey.  I remember a 
thread a few years back regarding this subject on this  list, but couldn't 
find it in the archives.  If I remember right, there was  a supplier that had a 
close match for the upholstery material, but nobody was  repro'ing ready to 
install upholstery.  Has anyone started making this  upholstery in the 
intervening years since I was last on this list?
