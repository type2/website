Subject: Re: [T2] Removing bleed nipples from 79 bus brake caliper

In bad situations I have had good luck finding a nut that fits around the brake bleeder, usually a 3/8" or 5/16", and welding the bleeder to the inside of the nut.
Do it quickly so that the heat doesn't spread into the caliper, you want the bleeder to get hot, it will try to grow but only can in length, when it cools it will pull itself away from the sides and be looser in the hole.
PUT THE GROUND ON THE NUT YOU ARE WELDING TO THE BLEEDER
This works.
