Look for a rating on the bottle sof oil--SG, SH, or SJ.

Avaoid at all costs any oil with an Sm rating.
It's real low on the zinc and bad for flat tappet engines.

Penzoil, or Quacker Sate racing oil ( or any high performance oil)  is
exempt from the current EPA rating and has a higher dose of ZDDP ( zinc)
and Ok for your engine.
Kendal has some decent HP oil that has a older, correct rating.

Conoco /Phillips / Kenda; has some decent oils--you just have to locate
it.

Rotella is Ok--but be sure your not buying the newer low sulphur, low
zinc, high boron content diesel oil--it ain't no good 
for your flat tappet engine.
