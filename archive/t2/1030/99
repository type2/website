Subject: RE: Acetone...Try Hydrogen...

Hey guys, Been doing A LOT of research lately on HHO Ya know.. that stuff
that got that one guy who made a water powered car killed??? Yeah.. Well
apparantly, its not too hard to build a Hydrogen Fuel Cell thats pretty
harmless, It Uses basically Water and baking soda... try looking it up..
really interesting stuff. I am going to try to make my own and experiment,
All I know is that my friend drives a honda that got 28 mpg.. He made one of
these, trial and error over a few months. has it on his honda.. and is now
getting 38 miles to the gallon. Its pretty crazy, He does look funny
changing the water twice a month.. but he has saved a lot of money. Any of
your thoughts are welcome. Oh, and an update on the bus Engine.. Woot!! Its
finished. Runs like a top except for a nasty exhaust leak on the passenger
side where one of the exhaust studs took a dive, I will soon be throwing a
case saver in there to alleviate the problem..

Jason
