Subject: Head light switch?

When I turned my headlights on this morning, while rolling down the driveway
at 6:30am in my '61 crewcab(12 volt), all lights dimmed for about a half
second and then the "main" fuse blew (the 16amp one on the far right of the
fuse panel). It killed the ignition too. Replaced the fuse, started it up,
turned on the lights, same thing, fuse popped. Even if I just turned on the
parking lights it would blow the fuse.
    I didn't see any loose wires on the switch itself or the ignition switch
or on the headlights themselves. Any idea on where to look for the problem?
Swap out the switch?
  Had to wait 'till it was light enough to drive to work with no headlights.
