Subject: Re: [T2] Need help identifying part

Thanks to all the list members who helped me when I was having a senior moment
by identify the parts as motor mounts.
I also want to thank the folks who gave me some upholstery tips in response to
a previous post.

Jamie - The "Twinkie" seemed to be 75 feet long when I sanded and painted it
last month.

Dan - You win the opportunity to help rebuild the engine in my sunny and warm
Arizona carport this summer. LOL
