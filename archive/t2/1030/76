Subject: Last chance for EveryBus X shirts

EveryBus 2008 is coming up soon - 4.17 thru 4.20. 2008

I am extending the T-shirt ordering deadline to Monday 3.31.08.

There have been a few requests for long sleeve's and hoodies. You can  
go to the web site and figure out what the regular t-shirt will cost  
and add
$9 for the long sleeve
$15 for a hoodie. (image will be printed on the back of the hoodie)

The shirt page is here
