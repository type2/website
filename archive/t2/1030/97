Subject: Type 1 Motor for sale

I have decided to go with a different motor combination in my '68 Double
Cab.

 

If anyone is interested in buying my 1914 EFI Type 1 motor, contact me off
list.

 

It is in nearly perfect condition and is ready to be installed in any
'68-'71 Bus. Quiet, powerful and very smooth.
