From what I've read, this product was banned by the EPA for its chemical content. It was not available for a while then reappeared with a new part number seemingly with EPA approval which begs the question, "what's inside it now"?

It's probably worth paying to test it to see what exactly you are pouring into your engine.

In that mid-2007 thread, you can see C. Navarro mentions buying up all the additive he can find in a 100 mile radius. Reading his dissertation in empiricism he now states <http://www.lnengineering.com/oil.html>, "WE DO NOT RECOMMEND USING OIL ADDITIVES ANY LONGER. IF YOU MUST, PLEASE REMEMBER MORE IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER AND THAT USING THE RIGHT OIL IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN ADDING OIL SUPPLEMENTS TO INFERIOR OILS!".

So as you can see, advice is constantly changing. In my opinion, the herd is still looking for a solution to a problem they haven't proven exists.
