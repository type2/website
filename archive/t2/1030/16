Well there you have it.

There are two single pole, single throw relays (SPST), a resistor (ohms not
shown) and two unlabeled diodes. The resistor would have a 12VDC coil, and
the contacts would have to be rated for what the fuel pump draws in amps.

Don, I'll work on putting Richard's sketch into CAD tomorrow with some of
the electrical details, and send a PDF to anyone who wants to comment.  I'll
incorporate the reviews and we can come up with a parts list (would have to
reference various years) and a build it yourself plan.

Unless Richard has done that already also.
