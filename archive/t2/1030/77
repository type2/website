Subject: New Upholstery...

Hey guys, I'm getting ready to upholster my existing seats. I re-upholstered them with some junkyard covers about 5 years ago (just to get me through until I could finish working on the body, etc). 

The seats / frames are a bit rusty. There's no pitting or scaling, it's just all surface rust. Would it be considered poor practice and / or ghetto if I was to just wipe it down, paint some rust inhibitor on it, and then put the new covers on? I don't have a sand blaster, so I don't really have any way to get the surface rust off.

My plan for re-upholstering it was getting rid of the hay? material that's under there now, put some jute padding wrapped around the frame edges, put a new seat and backrest pad (from Bus Depot) and then the seat cover with new hog rings. Did I miss anything?


Thanks!!!
