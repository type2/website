Subject: RE seat covering

""The seats / frames are a bit rusty. There's no pitting or scaling, it's just all 
surface rust. Would it be considered poor practice and / or ghetto if I was to 
just wipe it down, paint some rust inhibitor on it, and then put the new covers 
on? I don't have a sand blaster, so I don't really have any way to get the 
surface rust off.""


I'd use at least some sandpaper to remove the loose stuff, then go with the rust convertor (or POR15, RustBullet, whatever flavor you prefer) then paint them semi gloss.? 

It'll hold up longer and look a little better.
Make sure to check for broken springs?and/or loose wires and sharp edges.? They'll eventually poke through, or at least be uncomfortable.
Do yourself a favor and either get the covers really nice & warm in the sun or turn them inside out and let them take a tumble in the clothes dryer for a little while, too.
