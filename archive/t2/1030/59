ooh, don't get me started--but I hope yours isn't as bad as mine was.  I 
just welded in a replacement assembly.

check to make sure the axis of rotation is straight and it doesn't cant 
sideways when you push it down.  that's a bad sign.  It's not hard to 
punch the pin out, you can get new pedal, hinge, and pin from wolfsburg 
west.

you can pull your underbelly pan and grease the linkage with spray 
lithium grease. look at what happens with the pivot arm when operated.  
mine actually wore completely through the shaft!
