You might want to start with greasing up the linkage at the back of the
pedal itself. A few dollops of moly lube will last a long time. If that
doesn't help, do the same to the linkage at the engine. Only after those are
done and not working will you have to pull the cable out. Might as well
replace it while you're doing all that work anyway.
