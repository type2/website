I thought it was a Type 2 ... but that's a different thread I guess.

This seemed like an easy thing to try so I replaced one of the hoses, that I am assuuuuuming is a
vacuum hose (goes from the left carb to a metal tube).  I also rotated a bunch of other ones just
to see if there was any effect.  Wouldn't ya know ... it started!!!!!  Surprised the heck out of
me :)  Idled pretty good actually.  Turned it off ... started right up again.

Unfortunately, I must have messed up the right valve cover gasket because now I have a flowing oil
leak. So I couldn't drive it up and down the street.  I'll see if she fires up in the morning.

Thanks for the input everyone, though I'm surely not out of the woods so easily.
