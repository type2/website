Subject: Re: [T2] is this a double relay issue 

recently Karl posted that there is 2 relays.. which one do you have Tim

Karl said
 The difference is 79 Calif/80-83.5 Calif and the others.

13 pin Calif http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=071906059A

11 pin all others http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=071906059

It is hard to diagnose a home made wiring harness over the internet..  I
could assume you wired the red white wire that was supposed to go to term
86a to someplace like 88d.... then the relay would hold the starter,, and
the cold start valve on....

but assuming you didn't make any wiring errors... have you swapped in a
known good double relay?

can you measure the voltage at terminal 86a when it doesn't start.... if
there is 12v there.. with the key off .. then there is a problem in the
relay circuit.
If there isn't .. there might be a problem in the starter itself from a
mechanical perspective...
