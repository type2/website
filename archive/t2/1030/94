I concur. You have to totally remove the fan shroud and I'd say thats pretty
much impossible with motor in.

With practice you can remove and install a motor in a 71 pretty darn quickly.
About 30 minutes for the pull and an hour for the install including bumper and
apron.

You might just keep your thermostat parts stored until you need to pull them
motor anyways.-Daniel

its allot easier to pull a motor then say a 72.
