Subject: Brake Pedal Sticking?

Hi All,

Pumpkin II has a slight brake issue, it's actually
been going on for a while, but intermittently.

Sometimes when pushing the pedal, I encounter a lot of
resistance after very little travel.  I can push
through this resistance to get normal pedal travel and
normal resistance.  No pulling or anything, but
sometimes hear a clunking noise from the rear as I
push through the early resistance.  Also I do get some
braking action with the early resistance.

I have a new brake booster, new brake hoses, and have
rebuilt the rear brakes within the last couple of
years.  Brakes have been inspected and adjusted
recently. I'm sure it's not the booster.

Might this be a problem with the gadget which senses
deceleration to meter brake pressure to the rear
lines?

Also my e-brake cables are uneven, one is old and
stretched so the e-brake is hard to adjust (I'll
install a fresh cable soon).

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Rick
