<<From what I've read, this product was banned by the EPA for its
chemical content.>>>

Locate & read Feb Car Craft Magaizine.
This is not the case according to them---or if you pick up the phone and
call GM's tech line, or talk to any GM parts representative, you'll soon
find out that the original manufacture wasn't whipping up the EOS to
GM's original spec's and they yanked  what they had of the stuff off of
their shelves.

The EPA had nothing to do with the removal of the product.

<< It was not available for a while then reappeared with a new part
number seemingly with EPA approval which begs the question, "what's
inside it now"? >>

Same stuff, different part number, different label.

<<It's probably worth paying to test it to see what exactly you are
pouring into your engine.

In that mid-2007 thread, you can see C. Navarro mentions buying up all
the additive he can find in a 100 mile radius. Reading his dissertation
in empiricism he now states >>

I wonder why he did that--

Must be good stuff.

<<http://www.lnengineering.com/oil.html>, "WE DO NOT RECOMMEND USING OIL
ADDITIVES ANY LONGER. IF YOU MUST, PLEASE REMEMBER MORE IS NOT ALWAYS
BETTER AND THAT USING THE RIGHT OIL IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN ADDING OIL
SUPPLEMENTS TO INFERIOR OILS!". 
So as you can see, advice is constantly changing. In my opinion, the
herd is still looking for a solution to a problem they haven't proven
exists.>>

The problem with the current reformulated  oil appeared way before the
VW folks even knew it existed.
 
The flat head Ford folks were having problems with their tappets & cams
starting a few years ago and was reported in a antique car magazine.

And in reading the alledid problems it wasn't so much with an original
equipt bone stick enegine--it was with any engine remanufactred with
aftermarket valve train compnents manufactured in some third world mud
hole, using sub standard alloys.

The article reported that back in 32 or 42 or 52, the oils didn't of the
day didn't have any higher spec's than the current SJ standards
anyway---and the engine still survived.

I believe that the low horsepower, low performance VW flat 4's using the
stock  original valve train components will survive the low zinc
content's lubricity, and not suffer at all.

If the engine happend to be a high performance 800 hp, 12,000 rpm
capable power plant, then you might just wind up having some problems.
With the the VW flat 4's limited capacity I really woudn't worry about
it.

The only possible move I would consdider with an air cooled engine is
the viscosity longevity, and with that thoght in mind, I would make an
immediate move to some air cooled MC oil's capable of holding their
lubricating capacity for a longer period of time under an extreme load.

Golden Spectro is an excellent, highly recommended Air cooled or H2O MC
oil, which would work great in any air cooled VW 4 banger without any
penalties, or lack of lubrication.

I think this new allegid oil problem  is just another unwarranted scare
tactic.

And unless your engine is bored, stroked, shaved, ported, polished,
balanced , running nitros, alcohol, nitro methane, a turbo or
supercharger, I wouldn't worry about it.
