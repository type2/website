Hi Dan,

I'm with Don on this one... John Muir was a smart guy, but he never 
owned a 30 year old dual-carb type4 bus. There are a couple of vacuum 
elbows on the carbs that will severely affect driveability across many 
speed ranges. Or it could be a loose manifold, or a split intake gasket.

If it was a points problem, it would tend to affect performance at 
higher rpms before the effect progressed to affecting idle. This case is 
the other way around; the problem was seen at cold idle before it 
started to affect higher speeds and a warmed up engine.
