Subject: '68 brake backing plate

There's a '72 in a local salvage yard, I'll look it over this weekend for engine parts as directed by Karl. Anyone know if the brake backing plates would fit the '68 someone here is looking for? Any other dibs on parts? The body is crusty, no back seats, and it's a non-walk-thru passenger bus.
