Believe what WebCam says, if the lifters are solid when you push on them (and if new I bet they are,) no need to even consider it.  If they aren't pretty much rock solid, I'd install them loose adjusted like a mechanical to a 0.006 gap, run the engine at breakin, then readjust after the first short run to contact plus whatever WebCam suggests.  Bentley is talking about original German lifters, do whatever the manufacturer says.

however, bentley says to bleed the lifters before installation.
