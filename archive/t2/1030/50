Subject: Removing bleed nipples from 79 bus brake caliper

Hello to you all.

Wich is the better way to remove rusty bleed nipples from a brake caliper?

And in case they are already broken, what can I do?

I'm also looking for a pair of caliper pistons to replace these ones. Although
they are still functional, the edge that keeps the seal in place is somewhat
reduced in size.
