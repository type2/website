Yes, I did get your emails - been kinda swamped w/ work.  However, your 
images don't explain which is specific to hydraulic and which is 
specific to solid, if it even matters.  Plus, I am dealing with pre-78 
rocker arms....

To further confuse things, all of my rockers from each have different 
markings...
