Subject: Re: [T2] Head light switch?

Strange... well,, your Truck has been converted to 12v.. so it may not
follow the diagram.
http://vintagebus.com/wiring/bus-57-61-usa.jpg

all the buses I have worked on.. the ignition it not fused... so even if
there was a problem large enough to kill it the first time..  once the fuse
blew to the faulty item,, the ignition would work again.

reading the dia for a 61 -6volt.. the headlights, and the ignition are not
fused....

the tail lights are fused,, and they are fed thru the headlight switch.. the
center 2 fuses...

the fuse you said blew,, should feed the wiper motor,, the interior lights..
and the horn

that is provided a Bus, and a Truck used the same wiring...

have you found the issue yet John?
