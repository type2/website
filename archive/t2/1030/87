Subject: How do I adjust air to fuel ratio?

I took my 77 Westfalia to DEQ earlier this week because I need to renew the tags.

The 2 numbers I need to be under were 300ppm of HC and 2.5% CO

I was at 159ppm and 7.3%

I dropped it off at Trafton's in east Portland for a few things and asked them to tweak it to pass which they did at no charge.

Now it is at 41ppm and 0.28% but it is that it is a little herky-jerky when I drive it.

Was 159ppm -  Is 41ppm

Was 7.3% -  Is 0.28%

I am leaving on a 1 week road trip on Sunday, can somebody tell me how to back of the adjustment just a little to fix the drivability?

I want it to have as low of bad emmisions as possible but I also want it to run smoothly, how can I barely adjust it to smooth out the driving?

Thank you,

James in Portland, Oregon.

I am also looking for a Bosch D-jetronic expert in the Portland area that will work for food and beer, both being exceptionally good
