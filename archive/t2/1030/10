Check your brake hoses. They are rubber, and often break down over time. 
This is really common on bugs. Mine collapsed inside because they were 
original 30 yr. old lines. They would allow the fluid to go to the calipers 
on my disc brake front end, but would not let it back. Thus the calipers 
were dragging. Replace the rubber brake hoses.
HTH,
Courtney
