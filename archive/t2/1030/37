Subject: Engine drop report and oil leaks question

Hello all,

since I got my shiny and brand new cylinder heads, I finally dropped the
engine to install them. I never removed the engine and tranny as one
unit, since I thought it would be very difficult to handle the
additional load and length. But boy was I wrong. It's absolutely a piece
of cake compared to a seperate drop, since almost nothing has to be
removed from the engine. Got it out in 3 hours, while one of the three
was spent on removing the shift rod from the coupler (rust!). Put it on
my brand new engine stand that had to be modified to accept the short
studs from engine to tranny and the small lip that fits into the
bellhousing. I fabricated some rubber inserts to not damage the lip and
supported the engine by an additional stand while I'm not working on it.

So I got some question concerning the oil leaks on the tranny:

Looking at these pictures:

Where does the oil come from? I did not take closeups (shame on me) but
you guys probably know how to interpret the oil leak, don't you? Is it
the shaft seal or the nose cone seal?

Also take a look at this:

Seems to me the main tranny seal is leaking, what do you think?

What would you do to the tranny since it is out anyway?
Help is as always greatly appreciated.



Cheers,

Timo
