Subject: Removing/installing  the window crank regulator

Driver side crank regulator on the 78 has a bad crank mechanism 
(stripped under wher crank attaches)- I have I thought in the past did 
this and somehow slid the whole "U" shaped thing over the top of where 
that window guide post bolts, but it is not clearing- I checked the 
archives AND Ratwell's site; no pictured "How-to" for this??????
    Bentley only mentions removing the bolt under the window guide post 
and "moving it to the side"- it will not move- is there more that has to 
be removed, like the rubber along the vent window, or even the vent 
window itself?  It makes no mention of that although later it shows how 
to remove the vent window.  In my 71 I have a memory of being able to 
slide it OVER that bolt, but that will work only if the coil tube is 
cut. (gotta consider how to get the replacement in!)

  It can be a hassle to get out for sure. It's hard to explain over email.
  Just make sure it's all unbolted. Use your Bentley manual as a guide.
  I'll send the online pay link tomorrow.
