jamie,

the VW parts book lists 4 different torsion bars. the green bars are  
heavy duty, as they are listed as being for M140 (fire truck) and  
M531 (hard torsion bar). there seems to be 2 different green bars  
however and i can't say how you would tell them apart if the numbers  
were not on them.

according to the book, since a camper was built on a type 231, your  
'74 should have 211 511 115 C and 116 C, which are green bars and  
heavier duty.

i can't say for sure if the bars from a '78 are the same as '74 since  
the parts book technically ends at '72. we have a '78 7-passenger bus  
here with the rear suspension taken apart and it has red-brown  
torsion bars, which also agrees with my parts book info.

the photo with the two bars that are different lengths doesn't make  
any sense to me. they are the same length.
