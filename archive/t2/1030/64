comcast.net> There's a '72 in a local salvage yard, I'll look it over this
weekend for engine parts as directed by Karl. Anyone know if the brake backing
plates would fit the '68 someone here is looking for? Any other dibs on parts?
The body is crusty, no back seats, and it's a non-walk-thru passenger bus.

Well, no. The 72's will not work on a 68.

211 609 439 D was left.
211 609 440 D was right.

This was for up to the end of 1970, vin 2x0 2300 000.

BUT, there is a note attached: For 1968 up to vin 2x8 109 see Workshop
Bulletin B - 14/68
I do not have a copy of that bulletin......

The early backing plates have been NLA for a looonng time.

71 and up rear backing plates were 211 609 425 G left and 211 609 426 G
right.
