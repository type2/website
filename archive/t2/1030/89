Blast them with good penetrating oil.  Hit the threades externally and
squirt it into the hole as well.  Don't worry, you can't get the penetrant
into the cylinder this way.

Tap the end of the bleeder with a hammer.

Wait, repeat squirt, tap, squirt, tap, etc.

Do this for several days.

Now, use a 6-point socket that fits the bleeder well.  You don't want to
round it off.

Apply twist carefully without tweaking the bleeder any other direection.

Try going a tiny bit in the tighten direction too.

Using this method I have a pretty good success rate.  The more patient I
am, the more likely I am to be successful.
