Hi Mike, this is what I ended up doing when I got a new set of Febis. It's 
usually not necessary to remove the clip in order to bleed them. What I did (and 
what worked best for me), was to submerge all the lifters in a large coffee can 
filled with transmission fluid (ATF). I let them sit (tops up) for a week in the 
garage. I would see bubbles slowly come up through the hole in the top. 

A couple of days before I was ready to put them in, I got (and cleaned) an old 
pushrod from an Oldsmobile 455 big block I had laying around. I took this 
pushrod and I repeatedly used it to compress the lifters in the can (I would 
focus on one at a time of course). As I was doing it, I would see air bubbles 
escape from the side oil inlet hole. It was different for each one, but after 
about 5-8 times of this, they became basically impossible to compress (which 
told me they had been properly bled). 

I then left them in the can overnight again, and installed them one at a time. 

I don't know what difference this makes, but when I installed the new lifters, I 
installed them with the oil inlet hole facing to the top. I would doubt this 
makes much difference since at some point they'll probably rotate around again, 
but I figured it probably helped initially to get the lifters to properly finish 
the job when they were installed. 

Make sure you use assembly lube on the tappet portion of the lifter as well as 
the contact point of the pushrod. Since these are new components, they are 
stronger and not properly mated with everything else. You want your lifters to 
take the wear, NOT the cam and / or the pushrod. So please make sure you use 
engine assembly lube. The LAST thing you want to do is trash your existing cam 
in there. 

Another thing is, if you're going through this hassle, I would recommend you get 
yourself a set of new pushrod tubes and seals. They're not very expensive, and 
it's worth it. I think I honestly paid like $30 something bucks for a set of 8 
pushrod tubes from Bus Depot, and another $8 bucks for the O-rings. 

I degreased them, cleaned them, painted them with hi-temp primer, and then 
sealed them with hi-temp engine paint. I've driven the Bus about 600 miles since 
having the new lifters installed and even after 2 months of not having been 
driven, it starts up immediately without any clatter. 


If anyone disagrees with my advice or has a better idea, please speak up! 


Hope that helps...

So, my friend got some new webcam hydraulic lifters and it specifically 
says not to remove the clip from the lifter as it cannot be reused... 
however, bentley says to bleed the lifters before installation. 

What to do? We're gonna call webcam tomorrow, but I imagine that 
they're going to say to just put them in. Will they properly pump up on 
their own? 

Thanks! 
Mike
