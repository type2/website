SG was introduced in 1993; SH in 1996; SJ in 2001.

Major brand name oils categorized as automotive type (and/or diesel)  
with these ratings are no shelved. SM has been on the shelf for a  
long time already. Pick up your favorite brand at any auto store and  
it will be SM unless it's got a heavy layer of dust on the bottle.

If you want those older ratings you need a more expensive motorcycle  
or boutique oil.
