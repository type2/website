Subject: Perplexed Sliding Door Adjustment 

1971 Westy ..

Sliding Door has worked flawlessly , kept in garage, went out this weekend and
when you go to open the sliding door the rear latch has to be nudged to open
and allow the door to travel back ...

I've kept the latches and locks well lubed but wondering if this is an
internal adjustment?

Anyone had the same problem? Looked in the archives but didn't come across
anything.

Thanks,
Trey
