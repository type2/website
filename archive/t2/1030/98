Subject: unable to bleed front brakes - need help!!!

Hi,

I'm getting a little frustrated with my brake job and any help or advice
from anyone on the list would be greatly appreciated - especially as I need
the car for Monday. I have an 83 Vanagon 1.9 and recently rebuilt the brake
and clutch systems  - new master brake and clutch cylinders, slave cylinders
and new calipers, all new pads. I've been able to bleed the 2 rear slave
cylinders and the clutch slave cylinder but not the front calipers - all I
can mange is a dribble now and then out of the lower bleed nipples - nothing
out of the top one. I'm using  DOT 4 fluid and checked over all my
connections - no leaks. I've tried the 2 person method, even got one of
those hand-held vacuum pumps to try to suck some fluid out of the nipples,
but I've had no luck. What do I do? Is something wrong with the new master
cylinder or the new calipers?  I didn't bench bleed the MC before installing
it - Bentley doesn't mention anything about this - Am I doing something
wrong? At no time did I have the van running while doing this but on the
other hand, I didn't take off the vacuum line to the power booster - would
this affect bleeding brakes?? I've done the brakes on lots of other cars
including Bugs and Bays but not a Vanagon. What should I look for? Do other
people bench bleed before installing their MC? If so, what's the procedure?



Sorry for all the questions - but thanks for reading!!!!
