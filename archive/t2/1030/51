Subject: Oil Discussion

Hey everyone, Im not sure if any of you were able to see my engine  
rebuild pics, but when i finish it tomorrow i will post them on  
photobucket or something. But im sure this may have been discussed  
already. I talked to Webb Cams and Eagle Cams a couple of local shops  
here in utah and a local engine builder and some california shops..  
According to them 2 years ago or so the EPA had Oil Manufacturers Take  
the Zinc and Phosphorous out of Engine oils. According to them thats a  
bonding agent for our old style tappet engines. and they said over the  
past few years they had been having higher than normal amounts of  
camshafts come back being told they were junk.. well i guess they  
arent.. but they told me that in my VW And any older style Tappet  
engine.. I should be Running Rotella or Cummins Blue. Diesel Oil. They  
say it is a lot better. I didnt ask them about synthetics but at least  
the Rotella is about 10 bucks a gallon.. Thoughts anyone??  I know i  
will be running it in my bus from now on though.. ;)
