Hi all,

Sending long URLs is not a good idea, so here are is the original post
with links that work:

I got some question concerning the oil leaks on the tranny:
Looking at these pictures:

Where does the oil come from? I did not take closeups (shame on me) but
you guys probably know how to interpret the oil leak. Is it the shaft
seal or the nose cone seal?
Also take a look at this:

Seems to me the main tranny seal is leaking, what do you think?
What would you do to the tranny since it is out anyway?
Help is as always greatly appreciated.

Cheers,

Timo
