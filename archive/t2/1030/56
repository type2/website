Subject: accelerator sticking

can someone point me to the obvious places to look?
the accelerator pedal will stick a little, not terribly, but enough that i
have to sneak my foot underneath to pull the pedal up,
so im either repleacing the cable or greasing right? where do i want to
grease? thanks in advance Joe
