Subject: Another "Not Running" Problem

I have a 1974 dual carb Westy, orange :)  I have a problem that's gotten steadily worse and now I
can't keep it running.  

At first it ran well once it was good and warm but if I didn't warm it up good it would die,
usually at the point where I was shifting to 3rd, or on a long hill in 2nd.  Once warm, ran fine.

Things got worse and I could only keep it idling if I gave it gas, sometimes having to pump the
accelerator or it would die.  Once it was warm it would still die after maybe a minute of driving.

Now it won't stay running at all.  When its cold I can pump the gas a couple of times before I
start it and that will get it running for 2 or 3 seconds and then it dies even if I keep pumping
the gas.  Carb cleaner in the carbs has the same results.

I'm a novice and I've just started (adjusted the valves) going through the tune up procedures in
Muir's book but am wondering if anything there is going fix it.  I'd like to get it running well
enough to get it to the shop, which is what I should have done when it started acting up.  Oh
well, live and learn.  It's finally warm and I just gotta get it running.

My question is, what would you guys do first?  Next on Muir's list is adjust the points, so I'll
start working on that at lunch and after work today.

Thanks,
Steve
