Hi Alan,

In a matter of speaking, yes:

If you don't want to re-engineer the FI system or reverse-engineer the 
double relay, the easiest thing is to just plug in a spare. It's a 
pretty common swap-meet/ebay part, and AFAIK they are all the same from 
1975-1983. If that's not the case I am sure someone will chip in here 
and correct me.

Happy Trails,
