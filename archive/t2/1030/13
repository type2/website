Subject: is this a double relay issue 

Has anyone seen one sort of fail. Like the engine runs but has some issues
when starting. To clareify this I will try to explain what happens.
If I turn the key to the start position and it starts to turn over. But I
turn the key back to the run position it continues to turn over until it
fires and runs. If it doesnt start to run the only way I have found to stop
it is to pull the cable off the battery. Now the harness on the car side is
home built. I would love it if someone has this part of a fi bus harness to
get rid of.
So what are the chances that this could be a faulty double relay .
