Subject: to bleed new webcam hydraulic lifters or not?

So, my friend got some new webcam hydraulic lifters and it specifically 
says not to remove the clip from the lifter as it cannot be reused... 
however, bentley says to bleed the lifters before installation.

What to do?  We're gonna call webcam tomorrow, but I imagine that 
they're going to say to just put them in.  Will they properly pump up on 
their own?

Thanks!
Mike
