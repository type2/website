I used to have this problem with my 74 Thing. Without looking at it, my
first guess would be to look at the action of the pedal itself to see if any
of the metal components have bent or shifted out of place resulting in hang
ups. Mine was a pretty simple fix involving a flat-head and a pair of
pliers.  I know that a Thing is a completely different model, but all VWs
seem to have similarities... at least the classics do.

Overall though, I would just get under there and start pushing and pulling
things to see where you are hung up.

Good luck!
