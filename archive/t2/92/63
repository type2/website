Subject: Working Fuel Injectors, gaskets and manifolds

Woopee!  The 78 runs, but poorly.  I put all new
injectors in it, from Autozone, gp/sorenson brand,
$29.99 a piece.  Then it still wouldn't work, a new
cold start valve was tried, $57.99, from autozone,
gp/sorenson, but the thing said bosch right on the
unit.  After about 7 hits on the ignition, it started
to fire.  First time in almost 6 years from what I am
told.

Anyways, is there a gasket between the intake
manifolds (where the injectors squirt into before it
enters the head) and the haed?  Do I have to remove
any cooling tin to take loose this intake manifold? 
There is dry backfires coming from this area and the
stinking thing will not idle.  Also, there is smoke
rising from this area as well.

Also, there is a pretty good leak out of the drivers
side, just above the heater box.  I am thinking, valve
cover gasket????  How hard is that to replace?  remove
the heater box and exhaust and take the valve cover
off and will it come off?


Thanks alot, the advice here has been great!!
