3) There is a god awful rattling through certain RPMs - sometimes
4) When I disengage the clutch (regardless of gear, even neutral) the rattling will stop (mostly - the humming part)

If the noise is present even in neutral ( not a gear ):
When you remove your foot from the clutch pedal
the release bearing is not loaded, so the noise will stop
( the humming part, not the rattle ).
