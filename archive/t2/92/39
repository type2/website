Subject: "They Said You Were Hung!" (Front Axle Beam Installation Update)

Volks,

And they were right!!!! :-)  A while back, Ron posted that Bus Depot
(www.busdepot.com) was now carrying new front axle beams.  I ordered one
of them in late December since the beam on the '73 was showing rust at a
couple spots and I was worried about it.  Well, finally this weekend it
was warm enough and I was free so I have spent the weekend removing the
old beam and installing the new one.  The process has gone more slowly
than ever before, as (a) this is the first time I have attempted to do
this alone and (b) I have stopped every couple minutes to take a picture.

The good and very pertinent news is that the new beam is on and it fits
damn near perfectly!!!!  It is a hair wider than the frame and will need a
shim or so, but that is fine and not totally unexpected.  Bentley, in the
section on front axle beam replacement, says,

         "NOTE ----
          If there is a gap between the axle end plates
          and the frame sidemembers, take up the gap
          with spacers, which are available in thick-
          nesses of 0.50 and 1.00 mm (.020 and .040
          in.)"

Apparently VW expected this and it is not a problem. Actually, in a
replacement, I would far rather that the beam was made to the widest
tolerances, as the frames apparently are allowed to vary a bit and having
a beam that is too narrow would be very bad.  More important is that the
bolt pattern and spacing were spot on.  The welding and finish look good.
I am very happy!

This beam is installed on a '73 and is the second beam I have put on this
bus. The donor for the old beam was a '79, so I feel confident saying that
Ron's new beams *will* fit buses from '73-79.  I thing they will go back a
couple years as well, but I know the bolt pattern changes a couple years
before my bus.  In '71 or '72?

I have put copies of the raw pictures I took (all 153 of them!) at:

I will be playing with them and writing text to go with them (and
deleting the really fuzzy and duplicative ones :)  But I want everyone to
see the last one right away!

Isn't it *pretty*??? :-)  I am *so* happy!!!! (did I say that already?
Well, I am :-)

On "going it alone", well, it is *possible* but I would never do it this
way again if I had any choice.  The beam is not super heavy, but it is in
the neighborhood of 75 pounds, even stripped to the bone and the position
is *very awkward.  But I did manage it and didn't damage anything, even
me! :-)
