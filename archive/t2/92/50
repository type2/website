Subject: '79 FI dual relay

Hi folks,

I've a '79 Westy California model and would like to know what the
difference in the dual relays is between the Cal model and the Fed
version. I think that my relay is bad; no current at 88b with the
ignition in the running position. My relay # is 071 906 059A it has
thirteen terminals the other model relay has the same # minus the A and
has eleven terminals. Anybody know what the two additional contacts
power on the CA version? Thanks for you insights.

Paul
