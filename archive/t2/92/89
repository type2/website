Subject: Front Floor Replacement

I just got a couple of front floor panels for my '71.

When comparing them to the real floor I noticed that. . .

- The pattern of the grooves (that provide rigidity) comes nowhere close to
matching the original.

- The location of the holes for the pedals appears to be way off too.

These are advertised and being for 68-79. Do I have the right panels? Why
the mismatch? Is this mismatch common? . . Expected?
