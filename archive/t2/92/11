What the heck are you doing in Calgary!! ?  :-)
I guess you checked Canadian Tire eh? Let me look at my friends house, he
came down from kamloops and I thought he said he had one that went on the
sump plate of a Type1 engine. If he has it still, I'll see if he wants to
move it on. Lots of work still in Calgary?
Take care,
Courtney

I've looked high & low on every website I know (cip1.com, bus depot, etc)
and nobody has them.  Not very surprising as how many people drive their
busses in the winter?  That is, true winter, Canuk style.
