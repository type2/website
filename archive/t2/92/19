Carl, good to see a new person on the list, I'm sure you will enjoy it.

About your overheating, you may want to add a sump, but I'd try to figure
out first why it is getting so hot in the first place, maybe running lean o=
r
timing off.  Did you use a latter fan?  The early fans don't push as much
air.  You didn't use a power pulley did you?  A power pulley won't turn the
fan as fast.  Belt tight?  Anything in the fan?  Is your engine seal inplac=
e
and in good shape?  A bad engine seal will overheat and engine in no time.

About heater problems, a gas heater is the only way to go, those things are
great!!  Some people will go with the BN's or BA's, they were installed at
the factory, but I prefer the Stewart Warner models.  The SW heaters are
very plentiful and easy to work on.  Parts were getting harder to find, so =
I
got with the factory and became a parts dealer for the VW models only.

You can put a gas heater anywhere in or out of your bus, but I prefer to pu=
t
the heater inside the cabin where it can recycle the air and heat it
quicker.  SW made an underdash unit that blew 13,000 BTU heat right on your
feet!!  The other SW bus heaters were 20,000 BTU.

For camping, you can put a house thermostat on your heater and it will work
like a house furnace, coming on and shutting off to keep your bus at a
constant temperature all night long.  And gas heaters won't put extra
moisture or fumes in the air.

Biggest concern about a gas heater is to keep new pressure lines on it with
the proper pressure fittings and keep the exhaust pipe in good shape.  Just
like a gas furnace in your house, the combustion chamber needs to be
inspected for rust or cracks.

There are many old wives tales about gas heaters being dangerous, but I've
been working on them since '73 and have NEVER seen one that has been on
fire, but have worked on numerous VW engines that have been on fire.  And
your chance of getting CO poisioning is much greater using a stock VW heate=
r
setup than it is using a gas heater as long as you have checked the heater
out.  But a CO detector is cheap insurance in any VW.
