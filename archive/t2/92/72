You just have to operate in the right circles - the Italian cars - like 
Alfa Romeo and Fiat have their own clubs and catalogs. There are parts 
available you just have to look in the right places. Certainly not he 
quantity of parts out there for Dells vs. Webers I'm sure but I doubt any 
of us will be without repair kits for the immediate future.

I've got a set of 36mm DRLA down draft carbs and a set of 45mm side draft 
Dells..
