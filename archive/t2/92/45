Subject: RE: [T2] "They Said You Were Hung!" (Front Axle Beam Installation Update)

Thanks, Steven, for the update, and for being the first to try one of these
new beams!

I have five available at this point, at the special price of $299.95.  Part
# 211 401 061N .  These include new bearings and are genuine VW stock -
identical to the one Steven installed.  They were about $1200 when last
available about 20 years ago.

I have 12 more, but a buyer in Europe has expressed interest in taking all
12 at an even higher price.  (Actually, he wanted all I had, but I do want
to keep some for listmembers and US buyers, rather than selling all of them
to someone who will certainly jack the price up dramatically, particularly
after covering transatlantic shipping costs plus his own profit margins.)
If he does indeed follow through (which I don't consider a definate until I
have the $$$ in my hot little hands :-), the remaining 12 will go to Europe,
leaving only the original 5 for sale to listmembers.

There will be no more where theyse came from, as near as I can tell.  This
was a very lucky N.O.S. find, and these beams have been discontinued for the
better part of 20 years.  For that long, nobody (including myself) could
find new beams anywhere, until I lucked into this source and took all they
had.  I would love to find more, but I'm not estimating my chances as being
very good at all.

Do yourself a favor and go look at your front axle beam in the morning.
You're crazy not to.  As many of you know, this is a weak point on the Bus,
so you may be surprised at what you find.  If yours has signs of rust, this
is very possibly your only chance to get a brand new beam (as opposed to a
junkyard beam with 25 years of wear and tear).  These are an absolute steal
at $299 (which is a listmember promo; regular price to be $349).  If I were
the greedy sort I'd price them at twice that, bide my time, and still
eventually sell them all, as when you need one, you need one, and I've got a
monopoly on these.  Supply and demand, you know.  But my policy is that I
pretty much work at a fixed markup, so my retail prices are directly tied to
wholesale cost.  In this case, the wholesale supplier frankly let them go
for much less than he could have, so I'm passing it on. I only wish he'd had
more.
