Here is the heat consensus of this list as gone over a few weeks ago:

1) anything 12v just won't heat the large open space of a bus.

2) Propane heaters are better, but require GOOD ventelation and sometimes
cause condensation to build up in your interior. CO2 detector a must.

3) Gas heaters work good!! They use the gas in your gas tank and is probably
the only thing to consider in Alaska. Can be used while driving or camping,
but a CO2 detector is a must and these heaters are expensive, 150-400 bucks
depending on whether it is running and complete. Also you must replace the
fuel lines for safety and have it installed by someone who knows what they
are doing. There are good artilcles in the library:

 I recommend the BN4 for your bus. Others like the Stewart Warner model.

Hope this helps!
