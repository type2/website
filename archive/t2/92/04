Subject: Update: gas tank/fuel sender clues

Folks,

Did I mention this one still has a/c?  :-(

Got the engine and gas tank pulled today.  It took about 2 hours longer
than I figured, but I wasn't in a hurry.

Did I mention that this one still has an a/c compressor?  :-(

Wait till you see what was in the gas tank!
Also, there was one(just one) fairly good size(<1/4") ball bearing
"laying"in the bell housing...what's up with that?  wait till you see
where it was "laying"!

The gas level sender is absolutely toast...

Pictures by tomorrow.

The only problem was the 2 sheetmetal screws that held the bottom of the
fuel tank bulkhead....nobody mentioned those...and they are
"hidden"..  The other was that you absolutely *must* have a *deep* 13 mm
to get the tank strap nuts off.

Transmission out tomorrow to replace the cv grease and boots, and replace
*all* of the shift rod bushings and seals.

Did I mention that this engine still had a/c?<grin>


Cheers, dave
