Subject: Relay for aux. heater blower

 I'm not sure if the blower on my 72 Westy has ever 
worked properly (come on when the heater lever is pulled 
all the way down). So I finally decided to do some 
checking. 
Pulled the fan and connected straight to 12v power, it 
spins.
verified that there is power going into the fuse(it's 
good too) before the relay. Power is there even with key 
off. Is that as it should be?
verified continuity of wire that goes from relay up to 
heater lever. 
I have yet to verify that the contact at the heater 
lever is grounding the relay, but I am certain I need a 
new relay.
Do I have to have the exact same one or can I fit a 
generic one from FLAPS or boneyard with 
minimal "engineering"? 
Obviously an exact replacement would be the easiest. Are 
they available new or used?
tia for any suggestions or advice
ps-anyone have any idea of the cfm of stock blower?
