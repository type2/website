I think Fat Performance and CB Performance has what you want but you will 
have to ask specifcally for them. CB Performance lists only "turbo" 
emulsion tubes with no hint how they might relate to stock emulsion tubes 
but I think if you ask they will have what you want

>Then maybe you could tell me where to find some emulsion tubes for
>my DRLA 40's?  I have found zero sources for them in the US.
