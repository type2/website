	How did you get the steering wheel off? I've tried "pry the
horn button off", prying between the metal ring on the outside of
the botton and the plastic steering wheel, and it makes pieces of
the wheel crumble and come off. CLEARLY I'm doing this wrong, but
I haven't had the gumption to build something that would rest on
the wheel and allow me to pry at the horn button.
