Subject: 1.7-2.0 MPG?

Just talking offlist with a guy who gets 20+ mpg
out of a FI 2.0.  I was surprised because I
remember VW claiming the vanagon wasserboxer got
better than the aircooled engine.  Vanagon list
consensus was that 17 mpg was normal if your FI
was right.  Now I'm wondering if the bus is
capable of better MPG due to less weight or other
issues.  Maybe I should reconsider FI.  (I know
and agree that stock iste beste and I should get
the entire system, including fuel tank and
possibly tranny.)  

Some folks also claim decent MPG with aftermarket
carbs or properly rebuilt stock twin solexes. 
Hoover claimed CDI would increase MPG.  Does
anyone have any experience with this?  

Just wondering what city/highway MPG you type 4
engined guys and gals get.  Please identify year,
engine, fuel system type, and any pertinent mods
(ignition etc).  

Thanks,
