Subject: Re: [T2] 78 gas tank job pics now up

I noticed that the hose between the fill pipe and tank is different than
mine. Mine has a cloth covering on it. It appears to be in good shape. I
wonder if yours is a later 78 than mine or is it replacement hose from
sometime? I did catch a brief word of someone in
the process of repro' this hose.
As for the gunk in the tank I don't know who to take it to for that. My
father has a Stearns Knight that the tank was real bad on.
He took and ran a line off out steam boiler at our cider mill. It bubbled out
junk for days!
