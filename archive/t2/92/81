Is there a source for engine tin when a type 1 engine has been fitted =
into a type 4 engine bay?=20


This is a 72 bus that I might pick up cheap. New mounts were welded in, =
but there is no tin (which will kill an engine and make me not want the =
bus). The rest of the bus is in good working order (daily driver) except =
for the tin missing.
I don't know the rest of the history of the bus or how long the tin has =
been missing. It is cheap enough that if the engine was bad it would =
still be worth the money, but if I can't get the tin I am going to pass =
on the bus, because I am not going to mess with switching it back to a =
type 4.

Thanks,
Rob Henley
