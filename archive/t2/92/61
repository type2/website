Subject: [T2} Getting rid of the shell

Volks,
This is the first time I have stripped a westy. Stripped to the bone.  I now need to dispose of the shell. Anybody have any "free" methods? I doubt any charity will want it as it is just a steel frame (with several panels cut out at that).  I need to dump it PRONTO so the neighbors don't get too excited. 
In other news... Anybody need a '78 westy interior? Lime green plaid, not bad condition. Washington DC area.
Peace,
Howie '77 Westy "Loveboat"
