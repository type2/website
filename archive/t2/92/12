>1) I have a '70 westy

Simple- trade it in for a Porsche 8^P

>2) It can be difficult to shift into first

Shifter plate adjustment per Bentley
Check shift linkage / bushings
Replace 1st gear syncro ring and operating sleeve, adj. shift forks

>3) There is a god awful rattling through certain RPMs - sometimes

Engine / trans rubber mounts
Check shift linkage / bushings
Engine tin, loose shock bushings
muffler rubbing on body
loose junk under Z-bed

>4) When I disengage the clutch (regardless of gear, even neutral) the rattling will stop (mostly - the humming part)

When you remove your foot from the clutch ? I don't think so.

Check engine / trans rubber mounts
Check shift linkage / bushings
Is the shifter vibrating ?
Where does the rattling noise seem to be coming from ?
It could be loose hardware in the spare tire location.
