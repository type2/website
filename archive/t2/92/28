Subject: tire sidewall question

hello all,

now, how do i tell if a tire has re-enforced
sidewalls? i am currently looking at new tires for my
76 Westy. i'm interested in either the Bf Goodrich
allterrain T/As or goodyear ultra grips. anyone know
anything about either one of these. at any rate, i
need to know if they have re-enforced sidewalls, dont
have em now and can feel it when driving, makes me
nervous. any help will be greatly appreciated as
always. thanks much.

Matty
76 Westy "Cleopatra"
81 Diesel Rabbit  (soon)
