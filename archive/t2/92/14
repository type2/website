  Hi, I’m Carl. I have a 69 and a 63 Lets talk about my 69. I just put in a
1900 stroker. I am overheating. Never more than 260 but that is too hot. I
am wondering about oil coolers. Will just any kit fit on my bus or is it
different because of the rear mount? What are you guys using?

  Also I am looking for a good heater setup. We are considering moving to
Alaska so I mean a really good setup. Your thoughts?

Thanks,
Carl
