Mike,

The gas heaters used in buses separate combustion air from heated air,
just like the furnace in your house.  There is a flame chamber and a heat
exchanger that transfers the heat of combustion to the interior air pumped
thru it.  Cumbustion air and exhaust both use external air.  Heated air
may be from outside or may be recirculated (depends on installation)  The
CO meter is still a good idea, tho, in case there is a fault in this
separation.  The faults in separation are as rare in the Eberspachers and
Stewart-Warners as they are in home furnaces (and a CO meter in your
house, near the furnace is also a good idea!)
