Subject: Singlecab Sighting

I watched the DVD of Pleasantville and in one of the first scenes in Don 
Knott as a TV repairman with a fantastic Singlecab. It really drives. Does 
anyone know whose it is? It id pale brown with a hardtop back instead of a 
tilt & bows.

PS how do you get a digital picture off a DVD?
I could put the telly into pause & take a picture of the screen but that does 
not sound too good!
