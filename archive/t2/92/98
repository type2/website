Subject: Re: [T2] rear hatch window installation

Joel:

For the rear hatch glass, you definitely need someone on the outside pushing the glass in.  The front windshield can be installed solo, but the rear hatch glass is inset from the surface of the hatch.  As for whether to start from the bottom or top, it doesn't really matter, as long as your pushing partner keeps even pressure on the glass.
