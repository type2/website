Subject: Fuel filter

I'm unhappy with the filters that are recommended for a Type IV engine, so I
thought I'd plumb in a metal line, and use the same big canister that my
Chevy Silverado uses.

Questions:  Will this create too much drag for the basic-type electric fuel
pump with presumed 5-10 psi?  Optimal place for a filter before or after the
pump(yes I know I asked this question before but I forgot the answer)?

This is for a 76 2.0liter with 2bbl carb.  Presently doesn't have a filter.

Thanks.
