Subject: Re: [T2] Rattle and Hum

I had a similar rattling/shifting problem, very audible throught the
shift lever (feel it- can you get the rattle into your hand?)  Does
pushing the lever slightly to the right or left diminish the rattle? 
Remove the cover under your feet and have someone shift while you lie
down and look at the linkage from shift lever to the shift rod- chances
are the nylon bushing the bottom of the shift lever rides in is all worn
out.  Easy to replace, but remember to know where the shift plate was
when you unbolt it from up above!  There are bushings in the shift rod
tunnel in the back which were missing in mine, but I didn't feel like
removing the shift rod to replace those.  First/second gear and the
noise improved dramatically.
