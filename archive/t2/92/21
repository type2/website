Subject: 78 gas tank job pics now up

Folks,

The pictures of the gas tank removal job I did yesterday on my 78
are now up.

http://www.shockwaverider.com/78bustankjob/index.html

To all of those that replied with hints about this job thanks!
To all of those that warned me when I got this bus and it had 
been sitting for 8 years, and said pull the tank first, my apologies.

I should have done it last summer....let that be a warning to the rest
of you....look at picture #12 to see part of what was in the tank.
This one apparently had a full tank of gas when it was parked.  What you
see is what happens to gas after sitting for 8 years.  The tank looks
"ok" inside except that there is still a lot of this stuck to it inside.
This is *after* it sat for 3 weeks last summer with a gallon of lacquer
thinner in it....and it still looked like this.


several questions...

Picture #2 shows the mustache bar support on the passenger side.
It looks like the bar is too short, but the bracket appears to be
factory...why would they do this?

Pic #3 shows a ball bearing that was just laying where you see it...any
ideas where it came from??

Sorry about the size of the pictures, but I squeezed them in half...tried
to keep the quality good, and the size reasonable.

Now to find someone to "boil" the tank out and recoat it inside.  I know
when I'm "beat" on this deal...it's time for the "pro's" on this
one.  Anyone had any good luck with this sort of thing at the radiator
shops?....What kind of cost?  Did they do a good job?

Cheers, dave
