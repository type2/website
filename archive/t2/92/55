78 westy standard 23-25  mpg stock FI pertronix ignitor ignition module flame thrower coil and wires - i credit this with a 1-2 mpg increase at least and dramatic increase in power.  72-74 heat exchangers and VERY crappy pacesetter muffler, would like to try and retrofit cat and also considering going to CIS because

that is mixed mpg, about 50 50 highway and city.  lowest mpg i have gotten is about 22 and best was a tad better than 25
