I guess I'll jump in here... Max, let's eliminate
everything but one item: the coil. Remove the wires
attached to the coil primary (the small wires). Leave
the secondary wire in the coil but remove it from the
distributor. Using clothespins or tape or whatever,
arrange the end of that wire so it's about an eighth
inch from a good clean ground surface (NOT the fuel
line!)Now, attach a length of wire about the same
gauge as the primary wires, to the (-) side of the
coil. Now attach a like wire to the (+) side of the
coil, having this wire long enough to reach the
battery (+) terminal. Double check your high tension
wire end so its still where you put it. Now attach the
jumper to the (+) battery terminal and touch the wire
you attached to the (-) coil terminal to a ground
surface for a second and snap it away. You will get a
fat blue spark at the coil wire if the coil is good.
Unhook the wire from the batt and widen your gap to
just over a quarter inch. Repeat procedure. Fat blue
spark should jump over a half inch using this test, if
coil is good.

Once you have confirmed that the coil is good, go on
to the next tests... Currently you're all over the
place without confirming the one item that is used in
all your other tests! Hope this helps.-BaH
