I just think the PO is such a super nice guy that he thinks all others are
nice guys as well- NOT! I suppose he is young and gullible, and an "old man
that has worked on VW's for years" gives him a quote on unacceptable work he
says is reasonable, and the PO is trusting enough to believe him. The
darning should be directed at the so-called mechanic who screwed him over. I
am still satisfied with the purchase though. It is just not as good of a
deal as I had thought. I only drove it up the drive under the carport, and
had a stupid grin plastered on my face the whole way...
