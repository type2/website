Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor Question

From Joe Bartoli:

I've been driving my '69 Westy for a few weeks, and I've noticed that it just doesn't seem as "powerful" as it
should.  I hear others talk about being able to hit 65 MPH in 4th, but I can't seem to get much past 3400 RPM
(around 55 MPH) no matter what (even full throttle, stock 1600sp).

 I was checking on a few things this afternoon to see if anything obvious stood out.  The dwell was OK (51
degrees (-at-) 900 RPM), so I went to check the timing.  I pulled and plugged the vacuum line and got out the
timing gun.  At 900 RPM, the TDC marker was showing up about 1/2" to the right of the crankcase parting line,
so I reset it to the parting line.  I re-attached the vacuum line to the carb (Brosol H30/31, using the
fitting near the base at a 60 degree angle) and rev'd the engine to check the advance.  Very little to
nothing.  The TDC marker moved slightly to the left, maybe 5 degrees or so.  I plumbed my MityVac into the
vacuum canister and gave it a few pumps.
 The distributor plate would move, but would spring right back (ie, not hold a vacuum).

 I'm thinking this is my issue:  not enough spark advance.  Some searching in the archives leads me to believe
that's what I have, but I'd like some second opinions.

 My distributor is 113-905-205T, which according to the list at oldvolkshome.com, is correct.  The info for
this distributor says vacuum can, Bosch p/n 07 024, is what I need.  A Google search found this place,
http://www.sherco-auto.com/bosch1, which has the part for $40 minus 25%.  Has
anyone dealt with these guys?  Would a local FLAPS be able to order parts by the Bosch number?

And this is why the Screamer Kit came out......

Up the end of 1970, SP engines with the 30 carb only had vacuum-only distributors. As soon as the diaphragm
ruptured, you had no advance. Not knowing any better, people drove the vehicle and it was gutless with no
advance. Ah, but you put on a 009 [which was cheaper than a replacement vacuum unit] and now the engine
'screamed'!

That is a good price on that 07024 vac unit.  I have never dealt with them.
But if shipping does not cost an arm and leg, get it.
