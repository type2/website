Max,
the coil fires a spark when the points open after having been closed
for a duration determined by the dwell.

if points do not open, no spark. If points are dirty the current is
not interrupted abruptly meaning no or weak spark.

are you checking for spark right out of the coil by unplugging the big
wire ? You should see a nice spark there.
Is the spring in the points strong ? i.e. it should hurt if you lift
it with the tip of a nail.

do yourself a favor, remove the distributor cap and make sure the
distributor shaft is tight and well inserted in the gear. When it
isn't the shaft jumps around and one gets really crazy behaviors
because timing is all around the place.

Let's get you on the road so you can enjoy camping !
