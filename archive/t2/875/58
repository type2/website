Do what Arnaud said.

Also, inspect the ground strap inside the distributor for the advance plate.
Make sure it's not cracked or loose. If that doesn't resolve it, run a
jumper from the battery + terminal to the coil + terminal. I had the exact
same symptoms on the GWB. When the jumper worked, I installed a relay using
the original 12v line to the coil as the trigger and a nice fat wire from
the positive battery terminal through the relay to the coil. Problem solved.
