Subject: Buses Of the Corn 2006 * August 18th - 20th * Brooklin, Ontario

Hi Volks,

Just a reminder that Buses Of The Corn is coming up in just three  
months from now... August 18th to 20th; just east of Toronto.

Buses from early splits through to Eurovans will be gathering in  
Brooklin for a schedule of activities that has something for  
everyone: It starts with Breakfast Burritos and goes on to include  
Tie-Dye Workshop - Swap Meet - Frisbee Golf - Bocce Ball - Bus  
Driver's Challenge - Corn Roast  until we bring it to an end at the  
Group Campfire.

Heber Down Conservation Area has room for plenty of buses... last  
year we saw sixty buses attend and there was still plenty of room for  
more. There is plenty to do and see in the Greater Toronto Area,  
visit the "Local Information" link on the website for just a few of  
the local attractions.

A NOTE TO OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS:
You are still welcome to enter Canada by vehicle without a passport.  
The law proposed to change this does not come into effect until  
December 31st, 2007. Although you do require a passport to enter  
Canada by air or sea, there is currently no requirement for a  
passport at vehicle crossings for Canadian or US citizens.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
