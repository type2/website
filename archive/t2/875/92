Subject: The Bopmobile gets paint...

Hey, guys.  I had a pretty good day.  I got my shipment of  POR-15 in from BD.  Went to Hong Kong Harbor Freight and found a  nice hand-held orbital sander (5") on sale for $19.95.  Heck, it's  worth that if it only lasts long enough to do what I need to do right  now.  The Makita at Sears is $89.95.  It's probably made in  China too but with a better warranty.  
  
  I started sanding the rust spots on the front with 150 grain paper.  That El Cheapo sander does an amazing job!  Got it right down to  the bare metal.  I'll go over it with finer paper before I apply  the POR-15.  But I'm very pleased with the results.  I didn't  do very much as it's supposed to rain later today.  But when I see  the weather is going to be clear, I'm on it.  I can probably do  the whole bus in a day.  
  
  The POR-15 instructions say that you need to top coat it with something  to prevent UV problems.  I wonder, should I just clear coat it or  do I need to use some kind of primer.  I don't know exactly when  I'll be able to have it painted.  Hopefully by the end of the  summer.  
  
  I have to go cut some pieces off of  a donor bus and get a friend  of mine to weld them on.  Then I have to pull the cabinets so the  body shop can easily get to the windows.  They're going to pull  the windows and paint it.  I got a pretty good deal on that but I  don't trust them to do the rust-proofing.  I'm going to do all of  that myself.  The other issue is time.  They said that if the  bus is ready to paint except for sanding and priming, I should be able  to get it back in a week.  So I'm going to do as much as I can  myself.  But I can't weld, paint or use a cutting torch.  Or  do any serious body work.  I'd screw that up for sure.    
  
  I'll let you know how it turns out.  Any advice would be appreciated.  Cheers...KR
