Subject: No start after running

My engine during diagnosis is always well maintained and on a regular
maintenance schedule. The point gap was a perfect .016 and after
adjusting the timing to 00 TDC I still got the continuous cranking.

I smelled the dipstick as per Jules suggestion and did get the smell of
fuel. I am going on a trip tomorrow and will run some carb/fi cleaner
through it to see if that helps unstuck the needle in the carb. If that
doesn't work I will try my hand at rebuilding the carb. It is a Brosol
30/31.

Thanks for the help,

Max

Should be 00 TDC, at the pulley mark. That will
make a big difference. Set point gap to 0.016.
Sounds like the dizzy slipped. Not unusual with
the usual case of the clamp being over tightened
way too much way too many times.
