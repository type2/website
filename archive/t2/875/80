Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor Question

I checked around town for a new vacuum canister.  The local FLAPS had it listed in his price book,
but he wasn't sure he could get it.  A list member suggested part number RV1001 at AutoZone, which
looked to be the right one, but the local store didn't have any, and the website says it's out of
stock (everywhere, apparently).  NAPA can also cross reference the vacuum advance, but I've had
bad luck special ordering parts with them as of late.

I ordered the new canister from Sherco Auto.  I'll post again when it arrives.

But in the meantime... I came home from work today and remembered that I have an old 009 floating
around from one of my Bugs.  I've had bad luck with the 009 in the past (flat spots), so I wasn't
too crazy about trying it, but I figured what the heck (I don't want to drive the Bus anymore with
the bad vacuum advance; it's just too flat and seems to be running way hot).

I installed it, set the dwell to 50 degrees, and timed it to max out at 30 degrees advance (love
the timing gun with the dial!).  I took the Bus for a drive and was really surprised.  I could
hold 55 MPH pretty easily, and could actually accelerate past 55 MPH (no flat spots, either).  The
engine had a more throaty "rumble" to it, and didn't backfire while coasting to a stop in gear.  

Is this what a Bus is *supposed* to feel like?  Have I been living with a bum distributor for the
past 13 years I've been messing with this Bus?  I'm still planning on switching back to the vacuum
advance distributor once it's fixed; can I expect similar peformance with the advance working
correctly?
