Subject: [T2] New Air-Cooled VW Forums

I'm not trying to start a new thread... but perhaps like others on this List, I 
own some American iron as well as a Volksie Type 2.  Is anyone aware of a forum 
for Dodge vans?  Thanks!  Glenn

It's another community, not another forum/site/etc.
..Where there's cool stuff in one community, it'll echo to the other
communities...
