Max,
do you have an alternate distributor to swap in?  I had similar symptoms 
from . . . broken/awol fiber washer in the dist. base shims, it made 
spark erratic and one day, no go.  drive gear would not engage the dog.

verify that your dist. rotor turns when you turn the engine over by hand 
AND with someone else cranking it via the key.  if it does and 
everything else checks out, you should get spark at the coil.  I assume 
you've replaced the condensor also.

good luck,
Will A.
