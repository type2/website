Subject: How do I pick a car storage place?

Hey all. 

Well, due to space constrictions, I'm considering
moving our 72 Westy to a storage facility to free-up
some room in our garage for projects and (sigh) our
regular cars.

We live in los Angeles, I'm looking for a
reasonable,(preferrably covered) storage place. Has
anyone used these places before? Is there anything I
should look out for? Good or bad?
Has anyone had experience with car storage? 
I'd want to be able to access the car whenever I 'd
need to. I'd probably drive it all summer then store
it October thru May.
tips?
Thanks
Jason
