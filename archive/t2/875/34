I have exclusively used Crane systems for the past 30+ years (back into the
days when they were known as the Allison) on any VW originally equipped with
points (and one Toyota PU too).  Installation is easy and straight forward.
I have also tried the Pertronix, Compu-Fire and Accu-Fire, but I never was
happy with their lack of reliability, so I've stuck with the Crane,
something that works and works very well.
