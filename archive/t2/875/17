Subject: 1971 VW engine/transmission mechanical drawings?

looking for :

engine drawing (including flywheel to bolt-up face distance)
transmission drawing...

the goal:

transplant 1.8liter subaru into 71 bus (or maybe 72 or 73 bus)

Anyone have the drawings for subaru engines?

I found a document in the archives (by ?mark chambers?) but
it has no drawings.
