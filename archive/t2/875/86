Subject: Rear heater system for '76 Bay

Just a few photos of additional heater vents I fitted to keep the rear of the Poptop warm.  They exit just in front of the seat & provide great heat around the feet.  They have improved the overall heat in the van 100% without any apparent loss of heat in the front.  The grills in the vents are formed down rather than being raised so that you don't catch your feet on the grill or squash the slats by standing on them.  Made huge difference to the overall heat on cold triips.
