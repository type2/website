This exact thing happened to me about 10 years ago.  I don't remember  
the exact details, but basically it was a bad ground for the backup/ 
turn-signal/brake light cluster.  When the brake was applied and turn- 
signal on it would ground through the backup light.  When the brake  
wasn't on, the turn-signal would work just fine.
