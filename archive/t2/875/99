not supposed to touch the "Wet" end. the handle is fine.

older "type I" style engines did stay cool(er) because the fan wasn't
right on the engine and it was thin tin.  the "type IV" engine fan is
right on the end of the engine and above the muffler it gets considerably
warmer, not hot but a lot warmer than the older style fan.

the excitement, of the trip, as you get to know your bus you will "bond"
with it and know what is normal and what needs to be checed,

remember the old "$5,000" rule.   when buying a bus it will cost you
$5,000 to get it reliable either up front or in repairs.

enjoy the ride
