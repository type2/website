Subject: To trim the belt or not

Hey folks,

I am coming around the bend on the rust resto on my '72 deluxe.  It  
has been quite a bit of work, my friends.  I will put  some more pics  
up later, almost done with the welding.

I need to decide if I want  to weld up the screw holes where the  
beltline trim clips were located, or to leave them be and reattach  
the trim.  Asthetically, the trim did nothing for me, and it is a  
site of rust promotion, so I will probably eliminate them.

Is it a sin to eliminate this?  Anyone struggle with this decision?   
What did you do?  I have the complete set of trim pieces, sans about  
2/3 of the clips.  I will act on this tomorrow.

Bob H.
