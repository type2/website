well finally had a decent day and put the timing gun on it????  timing is
way off no I mean WAY off like 120 degrees off.??  WTF??  did a lot of
stupid things that made it run worse until I realized somewhere along the
line I put the fan on the crank 120 degrees off or one bolt hold off.  but
how did I get the fan on with the woodruff key.   Then it dawns on me, I
haven't had the timing gun on it since the fan fell off last winter,  well
it was about 15 degrees and I was on the side of I-70 in Western Maryland
and just put the thing back on......must have spun off the key and not
realized it when I put the fan back on..

so figure out where TDC is (using old tried and true pencil system) put a
new mark on the fan and retimed it..... well not perfect but way better
than it was.....

sometimes it is the "Strangest" things that drive you wackoo...


Thanks for the ideas

Bob
