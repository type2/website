Subject: No spark at coil WAS "No start after running"

Hi list,



This is a continuation of my previous problem of the bus not starting
after sitting for a while. Now it will hardly ever start and I know I am
getting fuel and I have determined that the engine is not being flooded.
I figured it must be electrical as my coil was on the engine when I
bought it three years ago. I bought a new coil and installed it, turned
the key, bus chugged a bit but eventually fired up. I let it run for a
while then turned it off, tried to start it again, but nothing, just the
constant starter turning. I went through the Muir procedure's for
determining why my engine will not start and I end up with no spark from
the coil, but the coil is getting juice from the ignition. The first
part of  http://www.type2.com/archive/type2/046874.html (until The Long
story is this) references the exact same problem I have, in an excellent
write-up, but I cannot find an answer in the archives. What could make a
coil work; but most of the time not. I cannot find any wires grounding,
I even disconnected the automatic choke wire in case that was the
problem. I want to go camping tomorrow evening. Who has some ideas?



Thank you,



Max Bronsema
