Subject: Fuel Injectors

I'm looking at purchasing new fuel injectors to replace
my 27 year old one. My local FLAPS can get me new ones
for $62/injector. My question is, should I replace my
series resistor too?  I would hate to screw up new
injectors if the resistors fail. I don't know what the
failure rate is. Obviously, mine has lasted 27 years
so far..same with my relay.  I plan on keeping my old
injectors and having them cleaned and use as a backup
set.
