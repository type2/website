Subject: Re: [T2] vw beach towel target

I saw your post and immediately jumped in the bus.  I've been  looking for a beach towel with busses on it for a long time.   Luckily my local Tarzhay had it. 12 bucks.   I like it so well I  think I'll buy another one before they discontinue them.   Thanks!   KR
