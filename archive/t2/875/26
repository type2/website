Hi to all,

I have a 1970 Westy with a 1641 motor, stock carb, Engle 100 cam, 009 dizzy and a stock exhaust from a 1600 bug. I've seen several electronic ignition systems advertised and was thinking about upgrading. 

Is the deluxe Compufire with the coil packs for each cylinder worth the $225 price? Would the Pertronix system work as well given my engines' state of tune? Anyone have any experience with the Crane system sold by Bus Depot?

This list is a great service a big "THANKS" to all who make it possible.
