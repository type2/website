We do not do disc brake kits for the wide 5 bolt pattern here. You will need 
to give CSP a call, their number is (626)445-0108. The calipers that we are 
using are the Wilwood 4 piston calipers and those are for our Porsche disc 
brake kits only.

Thank you,
Franklin's VW Werks

   Hello there,

   I am looking for a disk brake kit for my '70 baywindow bus.  I want to
   retain the wide 5 bolt pattern, but upgrade to the 911 calipers.  Do you
   have a kit for such an application?  What do you recommend for a master
   cylinder in these cases?  Thanks!
