Subject: Hydraulic lifters and Webcam 107i

I am discovering some issues with this set-up.
I have about 750 miles on the engine with the new webcam and webcam 
lifters in place.  I followed the Boston Bob regime to break in the 
cam/lifter combo and followed his advice for initial adjustment.

The problem is that if I have the lifters adjusted for zero (or.006) 
lash the engine idles well, but if I turn in the adjustors one or 1 1/2 
turns to actually make the hydraulics work the idle deteriorates and it 
wants to die on me (but it is nice and quiet!).  I can bring the idle 
back up by adding more initial ignition advance but I don't understand why.

Anybody have any idea what is happening here?

I understand adding the initial advance also adds advance on the other 
end of the scale and that too much is a bad thing.  It could also affect 
my ability to hot-start if the engine is fighting advance.  Once I 
switch the megasquirt on to controlling the ignition advance I will have 
full control over the advance curve so that can be controlled nicely.
