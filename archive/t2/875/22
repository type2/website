Hi Bill,

The Buses By the Beach group would love to see you guys this weekend. You
should swing by Grand Rapids, MI on your way to Ypsilanti. There are a lot
of buses that are coming to hang out Friday and Saturday in Grand Rapids, MI
and then traveling to the MVVC Show on Sunday morning. What ever works best
for you guys but it would be great to see everyone. If you came up I would
have cold beers, food, fun, and good friends waiting to greet you! 

 

In case I don't see you, have a great time on the cruise!

 

Wishing you many miles of smiles!

Todd Olson

Hi all,

 

I just got off the phone with them and the Berg Cruise just left Junction
City, Kansas for St. Louis tonight.  Evey VW is running strong, with the
only problem being a "hot-start" issue in someone's car (big

deal!) They are cruising at about 63-65 mph on average. 

 

They said they love to meet any local VW folks, so drive on over to the Best
Western Collinsville Inn in Collinsville, Il after about 6pm tonight to
see/meet these VW long-distance Tour freaks!  I'm joining onto the Tour to
Michigan Thursday morning in my '55 Oval.
