This FLAPS is not an AdvanceAuto/O'Reilly/AutoZone place. They specialize
in import parts. I get my Mann oil filters and other German parts there
too. I also have a 944S. He told me the new injectors are Bosch. Are you
saying that even new Bosch injectors are not going to be the same? He had
the same part number I had (0280150114).

He can get rebuilt ones for $44. I have heard (read in the archives) that
you can't really thoroughly clean/rebuild injectors because of some of
the internal parts.
