Subject: Filmore

Disney is putting out a line of slightly-larger-than-Matchbox cars from the 
movie "Cars".  I saw them in Wally Mart tonight.  Cost $3.17 US each.

Filmore the splittie is one of the ones available.  I saw three at the store 
tonight, bought two.  One for myself and one to eBarf, sell or something.

Opened mine, the other one's staying mint.
