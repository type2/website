Subject: Re: [T2] Help in Livermore. -clutchless driving

Is it just the clutch cable (pedal droped to floor or has lots of play 
as cable stretches if cable broke), or is the release mechanism in the 
trans to engine?  If the latter, the cable will still seem tight.  I had 
a clutch disk come apart, got stuck at the edges, and gives similar 
symptoms to release gone).  You can drive it without a tow-but need good 
battery as you must start in first from stop with key off (or do a 
Little Miss Sunshine with a push), then ease it into second when the 
rpms drop enough to feel your way in.  Same with third- I've done it. To 
down shift,  drop into neutral, rev the engine, and feel your way into 
the gear it takes a feel of the shift lever letting you knmow what the 
gears are doing. I drove 25 miles with a broken cable this way.
