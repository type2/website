Subject: Re: [T2] Weird Stalling Problem

Hi Ted,

I'd suspect the ignition switch. If possible, the next time it quits on
you coast to a safe stop without touching anything and check for voltage
at the coil. A check on fuel pressure at that point would also be
helpful, if you have (or can insta fuel pressure gauge on the rail.

No voltage:
Problem in circuit between batter to ignition switch to coil.

No fuel pressure:
Problem in double relay, pump, pump wiring, or AFM.


Happy Trails,
