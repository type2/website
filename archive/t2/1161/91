Subject: Straight pipes for a '78 engine

Hi all,

Thanks for the suggestions I got concerning the battery tray.

I talked to Gary LeBlanc over the weekend and he suggested that I replace my
stock heater boxes with straight pipes and add a header to accept a new
muffler. The heater boxes are brand new, never been used and were painted
with Por 15 high heat silver. Does anyone know where I can get the straight
pipes and associated parts. I would like to trade them for the new heater
boxes, even swap or partial payment.

Gary also suggested that I replace the inspection plate with one that will
accept an oil temperature sensor. Does anyone know where I can find one of
these. I accept all suggestions on how to keep my engine cool and increase
the HP.

Thanks again for all of everyone's suggestions and help over the past year
or so. I really do appreciate it.
