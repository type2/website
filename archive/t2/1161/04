Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper over riders

I took the "bumper riders" off of the bumpers on my '74, because I
didn't like how they look.

I realize I may have traded down my safety in the name of looks, and
that is probably stupid, but hey, I'm not putting them back on.

Karma will probably have me get mildly get bumped into, leaving a bent
bumper when I would otherwise have a bent "rider".

Any real serious impacts, and having "riders" or not is probably
academic. Anybody got any credible info on that?
