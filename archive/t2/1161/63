Courtney,
This is a very, very,very common area for rust and one of VWs design flaws.
I do the repair frequently. Depending on how far the rust has creeped, it is
easily repaired. I do not believe BustedBus generally cuts out small rust
repair sections but you could always ask Chris.

The repair procedure is to drill out/cut out the anchor underneath the
mounting location, remove the rusted sheetmetal, patch the underlying sheet
metal with heavy gauge sheetmetal, drill a new hole for the seatbelt bolt,
line up the anchor plate, then re-weld on the anchor plate from below.

I rust prime the anchor plate area then liberally apply seam sealer to the
anchor plate to keep water from creeping in from the front tires.
