Subject: Heat Exchanger Flaps

Can some one tell me the purpose of the flaps that go between the fan
schroud and the heat exchanger?

I can't figure out how they would effect the cooling or heat.  If the
engine is on, the fan would be blowing air and the flaps would open.
Correct? So when and why would they closed?

Are they to prevent hot air from entering from the heat exchangers
once the engine is off?

Mine are pretty mangled around the hinge area and I am wondering how
hard I should try to straighten them out and install them.
