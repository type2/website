Thank you!

I have a 20 ton press... I'll let you know how it goes... Couldn't 
remember if it was so simple. When you pressed the new balljoint back in 
- did you press directly on the stud or around it?

Yes, I know - stupid questions. ;)

I figure the boot will slide off allowing me to pressure around the stud.
