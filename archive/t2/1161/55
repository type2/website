Subject: Re:  Ball joint removal

This past winter, I replaced the ball joints on my '79 bus.  I think  
the Bentley manual says you need a 15 ton press, but I couldn't get it  
done with a 20 ton press.  At the advice of a former VW dealer  
mechanic, I wound up burning them out with a cutting torch.  He said  
that that is how the did all their ball joints at the dealer and never  
had a problem.  I sandblasted and painted the torsion arms afterward  
and so far have had no problems.
