Subject: Picture of late Bob Hoover's Bus?

Hi Volks,

I just had an idea to make a little model scene in remembrance
of the late great Bob Hoover, which (if I ever indeed actually
build it) will feature his Bus.  (The one of his many buses that
he used as his main vehicle, anyway.)  I seem to remember it
was a relatively late-model Splitty, white or light grey in
colour.  Anyone have any photos of that one?  I'd appreciate
any hints.  (But no huge photos directly to my inbox please!
I'm wirelessly online, and reception isn't great everywhere.
Mail me if you do want to mail me a picture, so I can find a
way.)

Thank you.

Airhowlingly yours,
    Ermel.
