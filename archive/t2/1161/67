Subject: trouble fitting passenger side battery tray

            Hi all,

 

I'm having problems getting the new passenger battery tray to snug up
against the inside of the new rear quarter. The old one was toast when I got
the bus. The driver's side fits like a glove. When I compare the right to
the left, they are both the same side. I double checked with the Bus Depot
to make sure I got the right part. IT matches the photo on the website. Any
suggestions? I really don't want to waste a great three day week end
fighting with something that is not going to fit anyway.

 

Bob
