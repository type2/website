Subject: Re: [T2] trouble fitting passenger side battery tray

Bob what do you mean by "both the same side" as literally the same stamping so
on one the flange will be up and on one it would be down, with the
indentations in the tray all reversed as well?  That would not be
ideal/correct, though it would fit.  Is the 1/4 already on in place?  Should 
jig it in with the tray all together before welding either.  I certainly
wouldn't say that any SA sourced pan I ever installed "fit like a glove" as
the flange always required persuasion with grinder and hammer.  Back in the
day German bits fit better in factory original 1/4 metal before things rusted
out so far, but if many pieces are being installed tolerance stack up always
gets you in the end.  The "glove" side probably got pretty lucky.  And in the
end, the seams need an adequate coating of seam sealer anyway, top and bottom
(and came that way new) so get it close, burn it in, seam seal and live happy.

I'm having problems getting the new passenger battery tray to snug up
against
the inside of the new rear quarter. The old one was toast when I got
the bus.
The driver's side fits like a glove. When I compare the right to
the left,
they are both the same side. I double checked with the Bus Depot
to make sure
I got the right part. IT matches the photo on the website. Any
suggestions? I
really don't want to waste a great three day week end
fighting with something
that is not going to fit anyway.
