Subject: Schofield piece or ?? for 77 Westy front drivers side seatbelt

Does anyone know where this piece or a suitable replacement piece can be bought? I checked out busdepot, but didn't see it listed ? I guess I could find a donor bus piece. Does bustedbus do cut-out pieces like this for my 77 Bay?
Thanks,
Courtney
