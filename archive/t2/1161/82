Subject: Gearing question, quite technical

Hi,

As long as I had the rear end of my bus up in the air, I decided to see what 
the 4th gear ratio is to the wheels. I have one wheel free and the other is 
still on the ground. Does the spider gear do something that will screw up my 
measurement? I have 743 crank shaft degrees to make one full revolution of 
the wheel.

My trans should have .82 4th, 3.875 r&p and 1.26 reductiongear box for a 
ratio of 4.00365:1. So I should really see 4 engine turns to 1 wheel turn.

BTW, the brake shoe broke free after a few good clutch poppings in both 1st 
and reverse. I also got the nut loose with the help of a friend and BFH.

TIA
Chris
