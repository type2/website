I peeled the braking material off of the shoes of a Eurovan rocking the 
vehicle back and forth. They actually came off about 10 miles later and 
locked up that wheel. Rocked it back and forth again with the 
transmission and got the wheel unstuck and drove home. New brake shoes...

Do you worry the WD-40 might contaminate the brake linings?

Seems like I recall somebody suggesting alot of heat from a torch one time.

I no longer park using my parking brake long term if I can help it. I 
use blocks around the tires and leave the vehicle in gear.

Metal particles in the shoe material rusting to the drum? Is that the 
cause?
