Subject: Help in Livermore.

Hey Guys:

I need help: a place to work and some tools,jack blocks.  I am losing my
clutch. I have gotten the master and slave cylinders.  I m stuck in 1st
Safeway parking lot in Livermore.  I do not have funds to pay mechanic.  I
have left a message with AIRS Sean in Livermore but no call back.  I would
prefer not to try a install in the parking lot.  Im not being hassle here yet
but did have a strange guy follow me the other night.   I could really use
some help. I do have a towing service to get the van to the location.

 I need to get to gigs I have lined up starting Sat in Marin County.  Im in a
Catch 22 do not have the cash now to fix and need the ride to make the cash.
I thought this was set up to help so no one gets harmed again but I haven't
ever had anyone come through.

Cheers
Janyce
