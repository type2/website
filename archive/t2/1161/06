Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper over riders

You haven't probably made much difference Scott.  I know that the '76 rear
bumper did not fare well despite the above mentioned overriders from JC
Whitless.  Of course again they were aftermarket, and thinner than the OEM
ones I have seen.  And it suffered several end/corner impacts that obviously
they would not help with.  However I do recall when I removed the bumper and
replaced it before selling that van 20 years back now, that they had taken
some rear head on impacts (might have got bumper tapped, more likely mom
backed into a wall) and that they had spread/splayed some but still dented in
the bumper beneath them pretty significantly.
 
YMMV.

I realize I may have traded
down my safety in the name of looks, and
that is probably stupid, but hey, I'm
not putting them back on.

Karma will probably have me get mildly get bumped
into, leaving a bent
bumper when I would otherwise have a bent "rider".

Any
real serious impacts, and having "riders" or not is probably
academic. Anybody
got any credible info on that?
