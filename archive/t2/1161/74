Thanks All,

My big worry is simply breaking it loose so I can get the drum off. I'll try 
jacking up with my big hydraulic and backing sloowwllyy out of the garage 
and then see if forward and back motion will do the trick. Once that's over 
I'm sure the nut will come off. It's been off before and should have some 
anti-sneeze on the threads.

I'll post back with the results.

Chris
