Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper over riders

They might be to protect what you hit more so than the bumper itself.  
Like backing up against another bumper.  Or pushing another car or, more 
probably, being pushed yourself.  Or maybe not.  I've lost two of mine 
and I do like the looks of them so I'm looking for two more.
