Thanks Greg thats a good idea. So next time it happens let it stall and coast to the side of the road. Do not turn off the key, go back and look for current at the + side of the coil? Makes sense. Need to get a Fuel Pressure guage to install on a T off the main rail. Isnt there a schrader valve on the drivers side rail that I could leave a gauge attached to or do I need to T one into the line? Im at work trying to think about this now...

Hi Ted,

I'd suspect the ignition switch. If possible, the next time it quits on
you coast to a safe stop without touching anything and check for voltage
at the coil. A check on fuel pressure at that point would also be
helpful, if you have (or can insta fuel pressure gauge on the rail.

No voltage:
Problem in circuit between batter to ignition switch to coil.

No fuel pressure:
Problem in double relay, pump, pump wiring, or AFM.


Happy Trails,
