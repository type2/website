Thanks for the discount code!

About how much "Alpha Damp" CLD does it take to do a Bay window bus?

Some research online indicates that it doesn't have to cover each
panel area completely, it just needs to break up the resonance.
It also appears that a good sound deadening job would have me cover
the CLD with some kind of Mass Loaded Vinyl product.
