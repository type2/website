Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper over riders

Bob they were VW acessory, even to the later years.  Sets even NOS do pop up
on samba now and then (though it seems more often for the early bumpers) but
I've never so much liked the look so haven't ever gotten a set.  I do like the
rubber impact strips that came on Champagne editions and stole a set of them
off a Champagne I had to put on my '77 Westy.  BD had them new at some time. 
Oddly I recall back in the day you could even get overriders aftermarket, as
dad ordered a set for the '76 out of JC Whitless, sometime in the early 80's,
but the quality wasn't near an OEM set, but of course neither was the price. 
Wait and look then is my best advice.

Hi all,

I received a rear bumper from a '79 bay window that
had over riders on it.
They were in really tough shape. I could probably
replace the rusted out
centers of them, but I'd like to buy a set of used/new
non-chromed ones. I
can't seem to find them anywhere. Were these over riders
available to the
'79? Or were they from another year. I like the looks of
them.

Thanks in advance for the help/suggestions.

Bob Pratt
