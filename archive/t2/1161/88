Maybe the sisops can chime in on this. Isn't that Troy W. and maybe David R?
It's only a minor annoyance. I don't see any harm for now.

Without knowing specifically what has happened, in general this means
that someone is using your email address as the return address for
mail addressed to an unknown address at the 55mail.jp email service.

So either a spammer has gotten our names and is using them as fake
senders for spam, or all of us that are experiencing this have had our
computers hijacked as spambots for spam campaigns.

Since my address is a web-based email service rather than an email
program running on my computer, the latter is not likely. Though it is
also possible that a bot has harvested our data from our computers.
This is also less likely if security software is up-to-date and
running properly.

So most likely someone has harvested our addresses from somewhere and
is impersonating us as senders.
