Chris, boot ease depends on style, older OEM has a multi time around flat
circlip, and is a bit of a PITA to remove, though some do just slip on.  I
have a little mandrel I spun out to press on the circumference, don't know if
pushing on the stud would work well or not.  Some American vehicle type ball
joints have plastic "self adjusting" seats and would be ruined.  All the bus
ones I've done have been steel through, so probably OK as long as you have it
very stable to get a direct press on it.  I've done all mine on a press frame
with a 30 ton bottle in it, never had an issue, never had to resort to
anything but the press.  I did once try them in my prior home made press with
a 12 ton bottle, and it wouldn't cut it for removal at least.

I have a 20 ton press... I'll let you know how it goes... Couldn't remember if
it was so simple. When you pressed the new balljoint back in - did you press
directly on the stud or around it?

Yes, I know - stupid questions. ;)

I
figure the boot will slide off allowing me to pressure around the stud.
