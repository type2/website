Subject: Re: [T2] Weird Stalling Problem

'78 won't have an ISV, not even in CA I think, but I won't swear to that.  I
agree with HTS, but it has to be pretty much failed, you can check resistance
at ambient temp for an idea, and in a pot of boiling oil if you like, many
years ago I posted some averaged values for new and used sensors.  John is
definitely right as is the OP about this being most likely electrical in
nature, due to the sudden nature and re-correction of the failure.  I'd think
fuel issues would sputter out a bit.  On early water cooled Vanagon's this is
always ground related, and it might well be on an air cooled as well.  For
this as always, I'd rec going through each connection, contact by contact,
inspecting, cleaning with your favorite cleaner (at least WD-40) giving each a
little re-tension squeeze on the spades, and replacing any looking marginal. 
As I've detailed I'd go so far as to dissasemble each FI connector (including
the entire ECU connector if it takes it)
 with my handy "free" dremel made tool, running a bit of cleaner soaked card
stock between each connector pin and reassembling.  Will take a solid 1-2
hours to do an entire harness not including removal from the car but can make
a lot of problems that a harness gets replaced for dissapear.  Well worth the
time and effort.

Frequently this problem comes from the idle stabilizer
module.
Disconnect the two plugs and plug them into each other to bypass it.
Another popular candidate is the head temp sensor. This can also be
bypassed
by disconnecting it from the wiring harness and grounding the
harness wire.
Doing this will make it difficult to start when cold,
but it will keep you
going in an emergency.
