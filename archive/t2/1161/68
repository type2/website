Yes, it will be very bouncy on that side, and handling will be quite off, but
it won't damage anything strictly.  You've probably seen/followed someone with
a rear shock out at some point where one rear tire was bouncing frantically
around over every surface change without really contacting the road much, with
no damping of its undulations.  Idiot's drive thousands of miles that way, a
couple, carefully, at a low traffic time of day, probably won't kill you.
YMMV of course.
