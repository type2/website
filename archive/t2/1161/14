Sami is of course correct here for an FI car, but I'd also wager you get more
false unmetered air from the oil filler at the aged plastic clamp joint, and
all those fittings attached to the S hose and intake runners than from hard
dry valve cover gaskets.  Then there is blowby as a source as well back into
the breather, but I guess it is actually in bulk metered when one thinks about
it perhaps??  The only silicone valve cover gaskets I've ever seen were for
aftermarket aluminum covers that used to be sold.  And they didn't fit stock
steel covers.  Not exactly much of a market for them today to make of course. 
There is wildly varying quality of valve cover gaskets however, with good ole
German NOS being the best of course.  Felpro sets (about all one can find
locally) are a nice material, but thinner than OEM and with a well aged bale,
can spell oil leaks if not air.
 
YMMV

That's actually not the case on fuel-injected models, where the oil
breather feeds straight into the S-shaped hose, after the AFM.
