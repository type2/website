I've run Dell DRLA 36mm on my Beetle's Type IV. I had to tweak the carbs 
a bit as they were junkyard finds from an Alfa Romeo Alfasud.

Ahnendorp-BAS has pictures of the carbs, air cleaners, linkage and 
manifolds I bought. Well, okay, I bought stock K&N air cleaners from a 
local shop, the cabs i took off a junk car. All my purchases were in the 
mid-90s.

Note that if you run open air cleaners (as opposed to an air filter box) 
you might notice higher than usual interior noise levels. I loved the 
noises my Beetle made but on a daily basis or over long distances it 
would get old. BAS also has that solved too with a central air cleaner box.
