Subject: Re: [T2] 1978 Westfalia project restarted. A few questions: 

Same here. The stock Westy stove portion eats up too much space for us. 
I'll save it in dry storage but probably try to build an interior like 
RVTEC's with some custom adjustments for our needs. Don't really need to 
cook or wash much but the option would be nice for a bit of coffee or to 
rise something off.

No top rear cabinet needed for example and mine is toast. Stock Westy 
rear seat.

Is the cooler they show one of those peltier coolers or is it just an 
icebox? I'm leaning towards just using the stock Westy fridge in the 
stock location and just making the side cabinet taller and full length 
below the windows. Need to test it first though.
