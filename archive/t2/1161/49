Subject: Re: [T2] baby seat lower anchors

Just look at the stock anchors. It's a hole though the sheet metal to an 
anchor on the outside spot welded in place. I've seen these kinds of 
things at JC Whitless and other websites.

I just did a Google search for seat belt anchors and several websites 
popped up. The first place had anchors in their hardware kits.

Wesco Performance is the name of the outfit. I know nothing about them 
otherwise.

I'd be concerned about a narrow mount tearing through for an adult. I 
would hold the mount in place with a bolt and spot weld it in position 
along the outside edges. Then wire brush and paint everything so if 
doesn't rust. The welds might help resist tearing in a crash.

I've got to do the outer cab seatbelt mounts on our Westy. The steel 
rusted between the floor and the mount so there is very little strength 
left. My bus is safe though since it's undriveable...

I'll be buying new belts from one of our list parts suppliers before I 
start driving our bus again. Am worried about dry rot and 33 year old 
seat belts.
