The shock are actually damper - all the suspension is provided by the 
torsion bars. As John says, the wheel will be a bit bouncier but you may 
well not notice if you are driving on Tarmac. I had the top bolt shear off 
years ago and didn't notice until the MOT but I don't drive fast of 
off-road.

Get it fixed but it's certainly not the end of the world. The van is still 
mobile enough to get to the garage.
