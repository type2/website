Chris,

If you find those shock bushings, please let us all know your source.
I've got a set of konis  still attached to a removed set of torsion
arms because the bushings just wanted to pull out, and without a
replacement source I am hesitant to do anything with them... but I do
hate to have a set of konis on the garage floor instead of installed
on a running bus.

peace
