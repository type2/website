Subject: Re: [T2] modern VW Factory

I haven't been through it yet but the new factory here in Chattanooga is 
supposed to be state-of-the-art.  But not transparent like that one.  
:)   The new car is a new design but stilled called the Passat.  Many 
people are very disappointed with that choice.  It is not the same as 
last year's Passat and it is more affordable.  I think it starts around 
$20,000.  I rather like the looks of it.  They must be expecting to sell 
a bunch as they have been going full ahead with investment, hiring, 
building, etc.  And the cars are starting to roll off the line.  I'll 
let you guys know more when I have a chance to investigate.  I've been 
home about 6 weeks and working my tail off at a new job.  No more 
cruising the world playing music for me.  I haven't even had time to 
work on the Bopmobile which needs my new (old) baby Dels installed.  The 
Weber gave up the ghost.  Have a great weekend everybody.  Ciao....KR
