Will do. Sounds like a great opportunity for one of our list VW 
suppliers...

I think we can buy bushings from the hot rod mag advertisers and custom 
car mag advertisers but I really don't want nylon bushings that creak 
and squeak on bumpy roads. I'm always seeing advertisements for 
suspension bushings in those mags.
