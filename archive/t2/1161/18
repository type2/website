Subject: RE:Heat Exchanger Flaps

I'm not sure which flaps you are referring to. There are the flaps at the
bottom of the fan shroud. The opening and closing of these should be
controlled by a thermostat. When the engine is warming up, the air from the
fan is not directed over the heads. This helps the engine warm up quicker.
Once the engine warms up, the thermostat expands, causing the flaps to open,
and thereby the air moved by the fan is blown over the heads to help cool
them off.

 

The other flap on the front of the heater boxes is used to control the
amount of air that is blown thru the heat exchangers and towards the
interior(front) of the bus. With the flap closed, the air does not blow into
the cabin, with it open, air blows into the cabin.
