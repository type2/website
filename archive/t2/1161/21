Subject: Re: [T2] Weird Stalling Problem

Frequently this problem comes from the idle stabilizer module.
Disconnect the two plugs and plug them into each other to bypass it.

Another popular candidate is the head temp sensor. This can also be
bypassed by disconnecting it from the wiring harness and grounding the
harness wire. Doing this will make it difficult to start when cold,
but it will keep you going in an emergency.
