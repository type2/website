My 84 Rabbit did the same thing at least 5 times over two years, and the 
critical step was taking off the wheel and using a 5 pound sledge to bang 
the heck out of the drum. Really SHARP whacks, repeated all around the 
outer circumference. This is not "tapping." I used a two foot swing and got 
a loud clang. Repeat maybe 20 times until it breaks loose. Nothing ever 
broke or bent and it helped to inject just a few drops of WD40/Whatever 
around the outer edge of the backing plate after about 10 hard whacks. Then 
I put the wheel back on and rocked the vehicle back and forth until it 
broke loose and turned freely.
