Here's a diagram of the heating/cooling system, which clearly shows
the non-return flaps you mention

(The diagram also includes a BA6 stationary heater, which you can ignore.)

My *guess* is that at idle or low rpm, the pressure from the electric
heater fan can exceed the pressure at the engine fan to heat exchanger
ports. In which case the electric heater fan feeds the engine and not
the cabin.
