Subject: Weird Stalling Problem

'78 Westy 2.0 FI stock motor. I have a weird stalling problem. It does not happen all the time and seems to maybe be more frequent when low on gas but also can occur when tank is full. Engine starts fine and runs well but will randomly just die like someone just shut it off. I can immediately restart and it fires right back up and will run fine maybe for the rest of the day. It will happen while driving. I'll be driving along and all of a sudden the engine just quits, I turn off the key then restart and its fine, often dont even lose much speed in the process. Wondering areas to check. Maybe its a fuel pump relay going bad? It doesnt happen all the time but it does seem to be more prevalent when the tank is low and less prevalent when the tank is full. Could it be something in the tank that is blocking the pick up? Such that when it dies the pick up gets clear and allows a restart? When it dies though its not like a gradual loss of power it just quits
 instantly.
