Subject: Re: [T2] Weird Stalling Problem

  I had a very similar problem recently with my '81 Westy. It turned  
out to be a faulty electrical sensor which governs idling of the fuel  
injection system.  The sensor is about the size of a cell phone,  
smaller actually, and is mounted with screws and fully visible next  
to or near the coil. You can either replace it or, I am told,  
disconnect it and simply bypass it. I am hoping one of the mechanics  
here will recognize this description and identify the name of the  
sensor and otherwise spell it out for you. In my case, it was  
replaced, and the problem ended. Art
