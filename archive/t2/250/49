Two things come to mind. Are the rear brakes seized???
Otherwise, if one of the shift forks broke or slipped (lock nut/bolt 
loose), you could end up with 2 gears engaged at once, causing lockup of 
the main shaft. In fact, standard procedure to tighten nuts on manual 
tranny shafts is to engage 2 gears to lock the shafts. Any two will do. 
Fork adjustment is critical.

I don't recall at this point for Bus trannies, but some forks are locked in 
position by a roll pin. If that was sheared or fell out it would allow the 
fork to slip on the selector shaft, thus allowing 2 gears engaged 
simultaneously.
