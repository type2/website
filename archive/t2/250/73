Yes, this is normal for a single-action oil shock. They only dampen spring
travel on the down stroke.

Double-action shocks dampen travel in both directions. But I don't know of any
being made.....

Correct operating procedure for a gas filled shock.

No, they work as designed. If they were bad, they would not extend.

No, they work as designed.

You are comparing 2 different types of shocks. Gas filled shocks are usually
more bouncey.
