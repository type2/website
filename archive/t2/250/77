Thanks everybody.

I went out and spent less than thirty minutes checking every vacuum hose I
had, including the one to the brake booster, and lo and behold, I found the
culprit. A hose had slipped off in a dark and secluded place.

An old clamp had failed. Unheard of, right? Nah.

I had already put clamps on all of those hoses, to make sure they
don't "jiggle" loose.

I put a new clamp on, I checked the temp sensor II wire and it looked a bit
flaky, so I replaced the connector just for fun, and I found a small hole
in my heater paper tube front the heater blower, and patched it up.

It runs like a new one, now.

Thanks again. You saved me money and time. And time is getting more pricey
than cash around here.  This list is the greatest time save I have ever
seen. Great folks. Single minded. Nice to know you all.
