Subject: Shocks

Volks,

I recently bought two BOGE OEM (rear) shocks for my 78 Westy.
I've never replaced
shocks before.  I have no idea when the current shocks were
installed; there was a fair
amount of bouncy-bouncy in the rear.  Current shocks are NAPA HD
Gas.

I researched the library and archive and discovered that oil
shocks need "pumping".  I
have pushed & pulled through the stroke on each shock at least
thirty times now, and
there seems only to be resistance on the DOWN stroke, almost
*none* on the UP stroke.
Is this normal???

I pulled one of the NAPA HD gas shocks, and checked its stroke:
solid compression up
*and* down - in fact, the thing self-extends to top once I've
pushed it to the bottom.

Are the NAPA shocks bad?  Are my BOGE replacement shocks bad?

Cheers!
