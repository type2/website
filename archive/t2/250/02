Subject: Re: [T2] Idle problem goes beserk

since this is a FI bus. I would also test the temp sensor II located
on the drivers side head. This little piece of magic seems to cause
strange things in the world of FI. This little bugger would be my only
complaint about FI. Good thing is it's pretty cheap & very easy to
replace. My local VWFLAPS got $18 for one from me a few months ago. If
it checks out per bentley, I might go ahead & replace it anyway. But
also check for any vacuum leaks.
