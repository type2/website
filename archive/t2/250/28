Is this a big hole or a small hole. The late baywindow engines have a plug 
in them where the oil pressure relief valve (I think) was once located.

This could be fixed in place.

If this is a dime or larger size - consult a welder and see if they can 
weld you a small piece of metal back in.

Rolling back the clock to 1992 and I was waiting for my turn with the 
resident welder at a local shop in Naples, Italy. I was being patient b/c 
they were TIG welding the top of a Caribinieri Police car's engine back 
together. Big Frankenstein welds. They told me they either overheated the 
head or something like that... This was a 2.0 Alfa Romeo engine - all 
aluminum just like our VW's.

Caribineri are Italian State Troopers. Always cool characters, dressed to 
the sky.
