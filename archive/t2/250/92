My local FLAPS (Pep Boyz) carries Wheelskins, and I've used them on all my
vehicles for years.  I like the Wheelskins better than any of the other
steering wheel covers, as they don't twist around and they last forever.
Unfortunatley, the bus steering wheel is too large for the standard size
Wheelskin to fit, so I had to buy the one for my bus from a specialist
(might have been Wolfsburge West) to get the right size.  Whe I installed
the Wheelskin, I laid a strip of cotton batting (available at any fabric
store) under the 'skin, which makes the skin tighter and provides some
cushion.

 Long ago, my steering wheel went sticky.  I got used to use it and cleaned
it once in a while which helped a little but I can't get the stickyness to
go away completely no matter what I use as a cleaner.

I've been considering wrapping the steering wheel and I came across this
item at GoWesty!:

I usually shy away from autostore "accessories" but I'm wondering if anyone
has tried this leather wrap and can comment on it.
