Subject: Jalousie windows in a '80 Vanagon

Has anyone seen jalousie windows in, like, an '80 Vanagon camper??

I looked at the archives, and this does not seem to be the case.

On Saturday, I came across (again) an '80 Vanagon with  jalousie windows 
installed.  Not really great windows, the passenger side jalousie fairly 
well beat up.

But these were not screwed in like the bay window jalousie, but had a black 
rubber seal.  I had to look twice because the seal did look savable.

I just thought they might be a rarity.
