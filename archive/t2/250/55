Knob(S) plural? Do you have more than one? One is the knob that, when pulled
out, re-directs your heat into the rear cabin area. The vent comes out on the
floor right where the walk through passage ends. If there are more than this
one, then I have no idea! Unless you are talking about the big wheel-type knob
that is actually attached to the bottom of the seat itself, then that is for
seat back adjustment.
