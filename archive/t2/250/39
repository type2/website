Subject: sticky steering wheel

 Long ago, my steering wheel went sticky.  I got used to use it and cleaned it once in a while which helped a little but I can't get the stickyness to go away completely no matter what I use as a cleaner.

I've been considering wrapping the steering wheel and I came across this item at GoWesty!:

I usually shy away from autostore "accessories" but I'm wondering if anyone has tried this leather wrap and can comment on it.
