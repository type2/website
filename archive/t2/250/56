If you cannot seal the leak - just keep a case of oil with you and keep 
feeding the engine. I came back from VA to TN in my Type IV powered Beetle 
and I was missing the bolt for the thermostat cable pulley. That is a whole 
bolt hole leaking oil. Never could find the leak.

Used a case and a half I think of oil.
