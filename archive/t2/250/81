Checked TDC on #1 and when moving 10+ degrees in either direction, the
valves do not move at all.

Hi Troy,

Are you sure the distributor is pointing at the correct cylinder?

Go to TDC at #1. Check to see that the valves are both closed. Now move 
the engine maybe 10 degrees or so off centre. Either way, doesn't 
matter. If one of the valves  has moved, then that means that the dizzy 
isn't pointed at the right cylinder. Probably it's 180 degrees out.  Get

a flashlight and look down the dizzy hole to make sure it gets put back 
in proper alignment.

Have  a look, and tell us what you see.

Happy trails,
