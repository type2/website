The efficiency is dependent the temperature differential. With a 40
degree temperature differential the efficiency is less than 25%. So to
move 1 watt of heat you have to supply 4 watts of electricity.

Not sure how much AC a bus requires but let's start with the size of a
single room home unit. They are about 5000 BTU/Hr, which is equal to
about 1500 watts of heat removal. So with the 25% efficiency the
thermoelectric module would require 6000 watts (12V at 500Amps) to cool
as much as a home unit using only using about 500 watts.

I would like to mount one of those small Honda generators (EU1000) in
the engine compartment with a custom add-on electric start and connected
to the buses fuel system to run a small RV roof mounted AC unit. AC
without loading or even running the engine, that would be the life.
Since I will be moving to AZ next year I might just have to make this
happen.
