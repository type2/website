Subject: cover over distributor?

Hi all-

Does anyone out there know what this thing is - I was recently speaking to 
someone, who said years ago he took a cover/shroud of some sort off a 
circa-'73 VW to put on his own Bug.  Apparently this thing fitted over the 
distributor cap, and the plug wires go out the sides.  He doesn't remember 
what it's called, or whether it was a stock VW or a custom item.  Try as I 
might, I can't figure out what this thing is, or where to find one.  Anyone 
have some advice?

P.S. - Finally got my '71 Bus licensed, insured, and on the road.  So far it 
runs perfect, and I'm going to start doing bodywork in the next few weeks.
