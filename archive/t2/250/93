Subject: [T2] Cover for a Westy

Since my bus (71 Westy) lives outside all year, I keep it covered when not
in use.  My current cover is from Wolfsburg West.  It is well made with the
Evolution 4 fabric, but it doesn't quite fit my Westy, leaving the bumpers
and lower extremities uncovered.  I'm sure it would fit a regular bus just
fine.  Wolfsburg West says that they don't sell a special Westy cover.  I
saw that GoWesty sells what they say is a Westy cover, but at a rather steep
price if you want other than the basic tyvec fabric.  Are there any other
choices listies could recommend, and/or any comments on the GoWesty cover?
