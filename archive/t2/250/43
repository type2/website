OK, the story so far... '72 Westy with 1700 engine, stock tranny. The bus is 
stuck in place and will not move. No matter what I do, the transmission will 
not go into gear, nor will it roll in neutral or with the clutch engaged. The 
clutch action feels normal, and I have adjusted the clutch cable both ways to 
make sure that wasn't it. Other things that I have looked at are: front shift 
plate, front shifter coupling, rear shifter coupling, and I even pulled the 
nosecone off (as far is it comes off) and checked the shift lever and made 
sure that the pin holding it in the bracket was not slipping. Just to make 
sure, I knurled the end of the pin and press fitted it back in. I may go 
ahead and open the nosecone again, just to make sure that I got the shift 
lever in the right place, but it was doing this before I checked it. Any 
further suggestions?
