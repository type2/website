Subject: Drag Day Bay Window

The coolest thing today was seeing a 'full-dress' (awning on the side and
everything) bay window Westy clickking off 11.70's in the 1/8th mile strip,
and beating all comers, i.e. 9-second turbo sedans, 48 IDA'd monsters,
stripped down sedans.  Way to go!!!  Gotta love bracket racing.

Possibly a listee, maybe?  I was the one in the Savannah Beige bus near the
big end cheering you on for every round!

Later,
