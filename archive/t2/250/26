Depends on weather you are attached to aircooled engines or not.

Aircooled options: Corvair, Porsche, Raby Big Type IV, Tatra V-8.

Watercooled options: Subbie, Wasserboxer (bet you could find a Subbie 
conversion person and get a Wasserboxer cheap), anything you could imagine. 
Plus you get real heat.

My Opinion: I LOVE the Porsche but I needed to be realistic. I could not 
afford the engine to begin with and I certainly could not afford to rebuild 
it as they cost about the same as my bus did. Still much cheaper than a New 
Eurovan Winnie.

The backup - and much more affordable - was the Corvair 2.7. With some 
clearance mods you can slip in stock Type IV 2.0 jugs (94mm) and get 3.1 
liters. These engines are good - much better than the general opinion of 
them - most of which I have heard from folks that never had one - just 
people who knew someone who had one. Join the Corvair list and they will 
show you how to correct some of the factory manufacturing sloppiness. These 
engines commonly run 160K miles or more between rebuilds. With modern FI 
(3.1 GM junkyard fuel injection for less than $100) you get a nice combo. 
The automatic powerglide was tough but only 2 speeds and slow. They came 
with 4 different 4 speeds. You can also bolt them to a Porsche 901 5 speed 
tranny if you can afford one of those.

In short: Got after that Porsche - the bigger the better. They are 
expensive but very, very nice.

I got my Corvair engine+transaxle and half another engine for $150. 
Conversion kit goes for $650 but I got a NOS attic queen for $150. Rebuilds 
are about the same as a Type IV cost wise.
