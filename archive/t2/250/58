Subject: Help - Clutch won't disengage

Camped out in my bus and parked it on a slight hill,
my parking brake probably failed and left the tranny
doing some of the braking.  Driving it back, at first
I had trouble getting it into some of the gears.  Did
an adjustment to the tranny and it shifted good for a
couple of shifts.  Got it on the highway and drove for
a couple of hours, when I got back home it was really
hard to get into gear and once in 1st I could no
longer disengage the clutch.  What has broken or needs
an adjustment?
