Subject: Re: sticky steering wheel

Richard,
    I installed the Wheelskins leather steering wheel cover, purchased
through GoWesty and think it is great. The wrap was a custom size, and it
fit perfectly for me. The installation took me more like 1 1/2 hours instead
of the 1/2 hour the instructions stated. I too got tired of my sticky
steering wheel as well. 

You could buy from Wheelskins, but I think you need to be careful about the
exact size required, which GoWesty has already figured out for you.
