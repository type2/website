Troy,
    You said...."I can get it to start for about 1 second with full
throttle.  Then it backfires and wont start again like that unless I
let it sit for a minute."...

When we used to have a '77 sometimes a vacuum hose would come off and
cause the same symptoms.  Certainly quick and esay to check.
