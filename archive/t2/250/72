Subject: Speed bleeders

Folks,

That's for all the steering wheel replies.

I'm going to bleed the brakes soon and I was wondering if anyone had
installed speed bleeder valves? I've seen these for 914's and other cars.

Any directions to a supplier with a fitting part would be appreciated if you
recommend using them.
