Got it. I will get under the hood tomorrow morning.

I gave it a cursory check and found nothing, but I did not check the temp
sensor II.... I can dig out some diagnostic equipment if it isn't
something obvious.

It went to hell really quickly, like in less than 100 miles, so it
probably is some loose hose...

thanks
Chuck
