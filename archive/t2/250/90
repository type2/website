I have taken note from the type 2 vintage crowd, and I like the idea of 
using roofing tar for the instalation. You dilute it slightly then put it on 
the sealing surface. Roofing tar melts in the summer, making it get into 
more places, and repels water. It wont wear out. Seems awesome to me!

Stops leaks cold.....or so Im told...
