It only really matters if the insides are dirty and that requires sonic
cleaning.

Just clean the outside enough so the small seals make perfect contact. Use a
soft cloth and some carb cleaner. Clean the part of the intake manifold
where the injectors seat.

No (022 133 201 D right, 022 133 202 D left). You'll know early on when
you've mixed them up.

Remove the rust/sludge build-up from inside the intake manifolds if any.
Replace the 4 intake runner hoses.
Replace the hoses on the injectors.
Replace the 2 intake manifold gaskets if necessary.
