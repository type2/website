Only after you visit several shops and get quotes will you get get an idea
of the labor involved. You really need a shopping list to spell out exactly
what you need done or you will end up paying a lot more. It's only a quote.

For my bus which requires work very similar to your requirements, it's been
estimated out close to 100 hours several times.

From there multiply by the shop rate for a rough estimate. The prices that
people quote on the list vary so wildly based simply on the fact that the
shop rate can vary from $30 or less to $75 or more per hour. Almost all of
the labor is in the prep.

If you have a shop that has experience shooting different paints then expect
to pay an extra $500 (maybe more) to upgrade to an excellent paint like
Glasurit or Sikkens. Since the state of the body and finish factor so
greatly into the value of the vehicle, an exceptional paint is a worthwhile
investment IMHO.

Take my bus: in great shape, low mileage, original engine, clean, almost
mint interior but the outside has totally oxidized so it's almost worthless
to insurance companies and prospective buyers.

Everyone has a different budget but when it costs several thousands of
dollars and considering the improvement in paint technology, you should
expect it to look better than when it came from the factory.
