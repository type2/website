Subject: RE: [T2] Restomotive "Metal Ready"

This is a phosphoric acid soultion.  The residue should be removed with
water and dried thoroughly before priming.  Metal Ready leaves a zinc
phosphate residue that may appear white where the rust was.  Good product
although it's pricey.  I've had equally good results with industrial toilet
cleaner.
