Subject: New Problem

Hi again all,
Here is my new problem. This just started the other day.
When I let up on the gas pedal and depress the clutch I hear a 'click'. It
seems to be coming from the area of the right front wheel.
Now this only happens when shifting for 1st to 2nd, and 2nd to 3rd.  It
doesnt happen downshifting at all.
Any thoughts on this one?
Its kind of scary hearing that noise.
