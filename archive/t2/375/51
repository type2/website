Subject: gas pedal

One of the more robust systems on a VW bus has to be
the gas pedal. It is in constant use. I was wondering
if anyone out there has ever rehabed/replaced this
assembly (I'm sure someone has). Mine is getting a tad
sloppy and
I have been thinking about some PM work on it. Any
suggestions/warnings? I know it is a simple system but
Murphy is always on the job sooooo. Thought I would
ask
as I have hosed simpler tasks! ;-)

TIA
