Yes, you should be able to see the valve when looking down the spark plug
hole.  Does sound like a recessed valve.  I guess if I had to drive it
anyway I'd screw the adjusting screw down until it just touched the stem and
then only a 1/4 turn more, just enough so the stem isn't hitting the end of
the rocker arm.
