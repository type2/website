Wow.  $$

To each his own, but I painted my bus with rattle cans, brush, and 
roller for well under $100, thinking I'd at least cover the primer with 
something more presentable and weatherproof -- but I get so many 
compliments (and surprised grins when I tell 'em how) that I doubt I'll 
ever even spring for one of those pricey Maaco jobs. :-)  For my 
purposes, it's good enough.  If I dropped $5k or more on a paint job 
I'd be in a fender bender inside 24 hours, guaranteed.
