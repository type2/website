Subject: cleaning injectors?

I have them out of the tubes laying on the work bench.  They look gummy.  I
have the new O rings.  should these be cleaned before installing?  Forgive my
stupidity....  If they should be cleaned up.... what and how would one do
that?  Carb cleaner?  brushed off with a wire brush?...Sanded? polished?  they
were working fine when removed.

are the tubes from the air body to the injectors interchangeable from side to
side?

any thing else I should know or do before reassembling the injector
assemblies?

thanks
