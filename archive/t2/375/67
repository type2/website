Subject: valve trouble

I may have just confirmed my worst suspicions about the intake valve in 
my 80 Vanagon. Ran a compression test right after I got the vanagon and 
cyl. #2 was low, about 60 psi. The P.O. had warned me that his mechanic 
said the compression was low on one of the cylinders. Tried to adjust 
valves today and the intake valve in #2 would not loosen up. turned the 
adjusting screw out until it turned freely. Still could not feel any gap 
between valve stem and rocker.:-( Looked down the spark plug hole and I 
could not see the head of the valve. It's as if it is recessed into the 
head. If I remember right; on my 75 the valve head protrudes slightly 
into the combustion chamber when it is resting on the seat. Im I 
remembering correctly?

I have turned the adjuster till I feel it touch the valve stem. Then 
turned it 2 turns tighter. Shined flashlight to see if I have gap 
between rocker and valve spring retainer, I do. Do I dare start this 
engine again before replacing or repairing the head?

Does anyone have a usable head from an 80 vanagon they would be willing 
to part with or should I just save up for a freshly rebuilt set? I was 
hoping to keep the cost to a minimum on this Vanagon till I got the 75 
finished but I may need to change plans in mid stream.
Thanks for listening.
Tom
