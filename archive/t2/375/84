dan - the first thing that comes to my mind is the spongy foam, custom
shaped rectangle that lives between the opening for the gas line(s) and the
tank itself. its about 3" by 5", maybe a half inch thick. otherwise, i've
seen gas tanks have one inch strips of padding from the factory that seem
to keep the tank from scraping metal-to-metal with the ledge upon which the
tank sits.  - steve
