1972 Volkswagon Squareback - $500
Automatic, dual carbs, body okay. Needs new battery and starter for sure.
Been sitting since the starter went out in around '99 but it ran great until
then. You tow. Must sell ASAP.

I'm finally ready to let her go.
1978 2 liter passenger van - type II
It's in need of mechanical help...it will run, but poorly...missing or low
power and lOUD! It needs someone with Volkswagon skills or someone who has
others and can use this for parts. If you have a motor, drop it in and go!
The body is quite straight...doors windows etc. all not too bad. It's the
two tone brown color scheme. The interior is pretty bare..no rear seats...I
built a kinda half platform thing. The tires are mismatched but alright..the
transmission and clutch had some work done on it recently and are pretty
good. It's been sitting for a long time it's a tow away deal.
If you don't wanna pay full price make an offer or trade for it...it's time
for it to go and I'd like to see it go to a good home
