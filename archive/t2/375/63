Subject: Fw: [BP] my carb problems.

I am hving trouble getting my bus running after putting a new carb top on my driver side carb (Solex).
I have a 2 litre carberated engine, with an electric fuel pump.
 I took the top of my left carb off and the bowl was very low. This is after sitting all night so I do
not know whether it happened over time or has not been full enough all along. So I am thinking it is
not getting enough gas. Trying to diagnose that now. Any ideas?
