Well I got brave and went back outside and did a little more work on it. 
after adjusting the valve I turned the motor over by hand while looking 
down the spark plug hole as best I could. I watched the movement of the 
valve and could see it was in fact recessed into the head when in the 
closed position. Can't tell how far it is going in and I guess it 
doesn't matter. ran a compression check and fount it improved to 85 psi. 
Didn't hear any nasty noises during the compression test so I put the 
plugs back in and started it. Seems to run a little better, somewhat 
smoother I would say. Heard an occasional clicking sound, maybe the 
valve seat is loose? I guess I'll find out when I pull the engine out 
and take the heads off. I'll keep you posted on the progress but it's 
going to take a while.
