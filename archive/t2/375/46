Subject: Restomotive "Metal Ready"

Has anyone used Restomotive Labs Metal Ready? I've got some and have used it to 
convert some light rust on bare metal and it seems to work great for that but I 
was wondering about surface prep after applying this product and allowing it to 
dry. Do I need to go over the surface with a scotch brite pad to then again 
clean the surface before applying primer/paint? The metal seems pretty clean 
just a little tacky.
