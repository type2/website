Subject: Alt Boot needed

Working on a 79 2.0L...
Does anyone have a extra Alternator Boot for sale?
I am looking for the rubber boot that fits between the
cooling shroud and attaches to the alternator to
direct the cooling air to the alternator.

Can anyone help with either a good boot -or- has
anyone come up with an alternative??


Thanks in advance
