All "buses" are known as Type 2's. Within this body type, an early pre-1967 
bus is know as a T1; a 68 - 79 bus is a T2; a 80 - up vanagon is a T3; a 
eurovan is a T4.

The early US T3 "Vanagon" had 2 engine styles; either an aircooled engine 
that originally came in the Type 4 "411" or an inline 4 cylinder watercooled 
diesel engine originally found in the A1 "Rabbit"..

I personally would pull the engine.  Its much easier to work on; you are more 
likely to identify all problems do a more thourough, careful job of the 
replacement.
