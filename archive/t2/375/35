Subject: Swapping a pancake engine for an upright engine.

Hi List,

Does anyone have any experience swapping out a pancake engine for an upright 
engine?  I have a bus dated 9/71 (title says 72) bus that the pancake engine 
went south.  The current pancake engine is has a dual carb setup and not 
Fuel Injection.  I am not a big fan of the pancake engine and would really 
like to put in a 1600cc stock upright engine.  Any help would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks
Mike
