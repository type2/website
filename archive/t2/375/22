Subject: Locking handle for engine lid needed

Hello all

Does any one have a locking engine lid handle they want to sell??    I have a
non-locking which is how my 67 came and I am starting to think I should have
one that locks.

If so, please contact me off line at bobgthomas(-at-)earthlink.net

Thanks!!

Bob T
