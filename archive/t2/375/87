Subject: mystery wire?  

78 westy......  There is a wire attached to the front of the motor above the
tin on the passenger side. It goes through the case right behind the flywheel.
It has about 18" of wire on it and a three pronged plug attached to the end.
What is this?  what does it do?  Can I remove it?

thanks
