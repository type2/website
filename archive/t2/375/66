Is your fuel pump running?  could be: Bad pump, no power to pump and your
running on gravity feed , plugged tank, plugged filter....

is the pump delivering enough fuel? 
 I think you need 5psi and 400ml per 30 seconds

it is easy to use a 1 liter water bottle to collect gas for 30 seconds and see
that you get at least half full,,,,
you need a combo vac/fuel gauge,, maybe you can borrow one at CTC? They lend
tools.

is the needle and seat opening and allowing enough fuel into the carb bowl?
the gasket might be restricting the float movement,, and holding it partially
closed..

I would start at the tank,, and make sure it POURS fuel out into a bottle,, then
try it after the filter,, then after the pump..... then after the needle valve
with the carb top off over a catch basin.

in all places you need at least 400ml in 30 seconds,, and you really should
check with a gauge for 5psi

Fuel in a carb will not evaporate that much over night at this temperatures.

Hope that helps....
call me if you still need a hand.
