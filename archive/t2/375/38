IIRC, on later models (cylindrical canister behind battery) the top one goes
to the EEC valve on the air cleaner. The bottom one goes to a port on the
engine tin beside the air flap to allow air from the fan to blow air through
the canister. This port is on the right hand side just behind the fan shroud
by cylinder #2.

On earlier models (oval canister on firewall) the port is on the left side
behind the coil and connects to the left side of the canister. The right
side goes to the air cleaner.

72-77 models have a tee that connects the small hose on the canister to the
fuel vapor breather lines in the back. It was unavailable for a long time
but now a reproduction is available. 211 201 405.

The two large vinyl hoses are 12mm x 3.5mm.
