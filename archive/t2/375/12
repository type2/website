Good thing to do is add all the panels to your bus and also make sure
you have a good thick pad in the rear over your engine compartment.
Also, a good carpet on the floor with light padding will greatly reduce
engine noise inside your bus. If your headliner is gone to, replace it
as sound bounce off the roof and carry it along the whole bus.

I don't have a Splitty, but my 1971 bus still has the same engine
(1600DP) and the noise use to be so loud, but now that I have all my
panels, carpet, roof liner, and engine tuned right I can even listen to
classical music in my bus doing 55-60 mph and even enjoy the flute and
violin parts.

I hope this helps and would recommend it as it helps the looks but also
the sanity of the driver and bus.
