In the late 80's I did just this to a Porsche with no rust, two dented 
corners requiring metal work, full disassembly to bare metal to the door 
jambs, lids and doors and bumpers and glass all removed, and repaint with 
the high quality original 2 part Glasurit paint and primer system. I hired 
the crew by reputation, not by price.

I asked an insurance adjuster which was considered the best body and paint 
shop in the area. I went and looked at the cars recently fixed and saw fine 
work, no over spray, no masking lines, no runs or drips, no thinning at 
edges. I spoke with the supervisor. Very impressive background, trained at 
the Glasurit factory in Sweden. 5 key people at the shop had been under his 
supervision for 15 years and he and them had been hired as a team by the 
car dealership they currently operated out of.

About $5000 then for nice factory finish restoration including 5 steel 
wheels. 14 years later it is still beautiful when buffed, no wax. For 
similar real quality work today for a Bus, I would expect $7000 to $10,000. 
Compromises to skills or procedures are the only thing that can account for 
lower priced work. For sure, you will never get good quality from the 
lowest bidder, never. And the only way not to risk paying enough for good 
work and getting poor is to seek those reputed to provide high quality 
work, then pay them their price for the better proven skills.

And what I also found when I hired the best was, when they lost a piece of 
trim, they replaced it at their cost, no argument. They do right without 
prodding as a part of their nature.
