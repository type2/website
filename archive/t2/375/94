Hiya Tony,

The problem is that I simply don't have a brand name for you.  I bought my 
"stock" of reticulated foam from a foam retailer (yeah, there are such 
businesses) here in Portland.  It was in a bulk roll.  He just cut off a 
couple of feet for me.  But he did give me an education (and a couple of 
demonstrations) concerning foam and its application in automobiles.  Seems he 
had been an auto upholsterer in a former life.  In any event, the stuff is 
pretty easy to tell from most other foam.  It has something of a "wiry" feel 
and construction.  It is full of open air pockets.  Cut thinly enough, one 
can see through it.
