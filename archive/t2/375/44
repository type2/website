Greg,

The one I cut off of my 78 Champagne Edition last year is marked

Dayco 15465  and is a little over 46 1/4" long about 1176mm.

Beware that it may have stretched some and also be aware that
different A/C manufacturers may have compressor mounts that
would actually change the length required.

My unit was a DPD overhead unit with a york compressor.

Cheers, dave
