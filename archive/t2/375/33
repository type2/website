You are still sane. Rocky Mountain Motorworks has these parts. Here is the
link http://motorworks.com/search2_description.asp?ITEMNO=211%20609%20601B

The part number for the anchor pin is 211 609 601b
The horseshoe clip is part number 211 609 619

Do a part number search on Bus Depot. They have them also.
pin-$2.29
clip-$0.25
