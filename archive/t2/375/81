Subject: 1970 bus for sale

I have a 1970 bus for sale, but this is not just an ordinary bus, its CRAZY!

The GOOD:

- slammed nearly 5 inches
- sports Scirocco front seats
- has a partial westy interior
- 14" beetle rims with Pirelli rubber
- runs perfect

The BAD:

- slammed nearly 5 inches
- paint is *ahem* real, well, ugly....(mint with white ruber)
- rust on the doglegs and wheelwells
- gastank under rear seat ???
- needs brake work to drive safely ( although I have driven it)

This bus is AS IS, no warranty. It is a running bus, needs TLC. I have replaced
the rear taillight. It RUNS!

$1500 CDN. Buyer arranges shipping.
