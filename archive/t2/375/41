Hey all--
I just wanted to share my lasted poject with you, and I was reflecting
on more than several postings on this painting of any Vanagon or type 2
Bus--Be it a Westy--or just a Transporter--

I'm in the process of restoring another of my John Deere garden
Tractors--this one is a 1973 140-- H-3 hydro tractor--not huge as an ag
tractor--but good sized for a lawn and garden tractor--

And thus far---( and I now I'll have to buy one more quart to finish the
hood ) 
I have spent $575.00, for acid etch primer, high fill primer, and 2
quarts of PPG's Concept urethane--1 quart JD green, and one quart JD
yellow, and I am going to require one more quart of green to get the job
done--so figure another $102.50

And this is not figuring the 80,180, 320. 1500, and 2000 sand paper (
which I have in stock at all times ) masking tape--or my labor.

So as I keep buying and applying paint--I laugh at the thought of some
of prior postings on getting a Bus or Van refinished---at some of the
quoted prices on any list---$275.00, $500.00, even a grand---when I can
hardley get a lawn mower painted for $700.00--plus a who cares it's mine
labor figure--

Just some food for thought--on what is possible for the costs
quoted---and that in fact it really can't be really too much of a paint
job----not for the prices quoted---



Later,
