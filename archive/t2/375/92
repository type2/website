Subject: Re: [T2] foam under gas tank?

Hiya Dan,

I know absolutely nothing about foam under tanks.  But Richard makes a good 
point when he mentions that putting foam in this spot may trap moisture and 
lead to rust.  However, you can (and should) use reticulated foam in most 
automotive applications.  This stuff is resistant to moisture and will allow 
any moisture to pass right through it.  Absolutely perfect for use in doors 
(like behind the interior door latch handles) and I imagine it would fit the 
bill for your application should you decide to go that way.  And it's 
available in Portland.
