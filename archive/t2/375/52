Now that Pumpkin II is running again, I'm thinking a couple years down the
road...So what is a good round dollar figure for getting a Westy
professionally preserved and painted?

Assumptions:
1. I remove all mechanicals, wiring, and furnishings.
2. I tow/transport the body to the shop.
3. I want a serious preservation job prior to painting (POR-15, etc)
4. Minimal rust: Windshield, battery box, front cab door steps

Does anyone have a ballpark guess, or experience with this?  I don't have
the facilities (or patience) to do major body work myself, so that's
probably out.
