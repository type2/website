Joe--

Lose all them negative vibrations--!!

But I know how you are thinking--
Do something good--spend a coulple of bucks to make your vehicle look
super nice-and ever fool and his brother will find you and your
vehicle--especially the door swinging barbarian apes in a parking lot--

BANG--"Oh I am so sorry"--

As you would like to choke them for 5 miutes--:>)

Later,

Terry

Wow. $$ 
To each his own, but I painted my bus with rattle cans, brush, and
roller for well under $100, thinking I'd at least cover the primer with
something more presentable and weatherproof -- but I get so many
compliments (and surprised grins when I tell 'em how) that I doubt I'll
ever even spring for one of those pricey Maaco jobs. :-) For my
purposes, it's good enough. If I dropped $5k or more on a paint job I'd
be in a fender bender inside 24 hours, guaranteed.
