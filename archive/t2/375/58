Subject: Couple of ETKA questions

Hi all:

The other day somebody asked about the O-ring that helps secure the sump
cover plate in an air-cooled Vanagon engine.  In the post they provided the
part number, so I fired up ETKA and did a search on the part number -  021
101 269 A - but the program reported back that the part number was unknown.
Looking through the parts diagrams I found the O-ring and ETKA showed it as
* 021 101 269 A.

I've noticed the parts listing sometimes has the part number with an
asterisk in front, but I don't know what that's signifying.  Does anybody
know?

I tried doing a parts search again with the asterisk in front of the rest of
the "regular" parts number but the program still reported the parts number
was unknown.  Does anybody know how to make the search function work here?

TIA.
