Subject: Westy Rear Speaker Location

I'm just looking for good ideas on where I could move my rear speakers.
When I purchased the bus they were placed in the area under the rear sear
where the door would be.  I still have the door and would like to put it
back in where it goes.  I read in the archives where someone had mounted
speakers where the hand straps are above the rear seat.  This sounds fairly
intriguing, but there were no photos.
 
Anyone else have any cool ideas?
