anyone who was at Everybus may have seen mine, it needed wash and wax job
but the paint job was a 10 year old rattle can paint job.

now it was good quality auto paint on a decent undercoat (from a can) this
wasn't my first choice for painting but was the result of neccesity.  so
yes you can get an acceptable 20/20 paint job out of a can and it will
keep the rust at bay until you have time to do it more correctly.

20/20 paint job is "looks good at 20feet or 20MPH"
