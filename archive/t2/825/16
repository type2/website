Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder head temp?

Phil,
for instance by putting the sensor in the oven, next to a turkey thermometer
and an oven thermometer (to have a solid reference)

try to heat the oven to 250F, 300F, 350F, 400F and 450F and post your
results to the list.

Is is a VDO gauge? You can read quite a bit about those in the archives
