Subject: Shifting

I've been putting up with my boss complaining about how I over-rev my '77
when I shift.  I've been using the Muir pattern, 15-30-45.  I tried shifting
at lower speeds this morning, 15-25-30, on my way home from dropping my son
off at school, but it seemed a bit sluggish or "slow".

But then I realized that I no longer have the original 2.0L.  I had it
replaced by a rebuilt 1.8L.

Am I shifting at the right speeds?
