Subject: Re: [T2] Heat Exchanger Quality

<<<I purchased a left side OEM VW heat exchanger from Bus Depot for my
79 FI engine and a Dansk right side replacement. Heavy Duty they (Dansk)
claim! The difference in materials, design and build quality is amazing.
Made me want to puke. 

What a piece of crap and it was damaged in shipping! 
I should return it and look for a good used one for the right side.>>

 

Rick,

You should return the piece of junk--

(Did it have any gold, small, oval "Made in China" sticker's on it ?)

The problem is when ole Ronnie gets done with you in his restocking
fee's, plus whtit has already cost yo for shipping one way ( did he get
you for his expedited shipping fee's ?) plus it'll cost you to get it
back to Podunk Pa.

Your almost doomed to use it , and forget about the BD.
( or you could sell it over at E-Bay and hope for the best)


Good Luck,
