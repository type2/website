This is a real hole in the market for aftermarket stuff for our buses, 
and one that's not likely to be filled -- ever.

Replacement HEs should have heavier sheet metal than OEM, not lighter, 
and should have screws and captured nuts (assemble with anti-sieze!) 
and a gasket so that they can be taken apart every couple of years, 
cleaned out, and painted if necessary.

The only good alternative to this is to retrofit the 74-75 set up that 
Ron sells.

The market problem is that:

1. Baywindow owners are kind of cheap (and that includes me);

2. We tend to have low expectations for the heating system (even though 
they work really well when correct)
