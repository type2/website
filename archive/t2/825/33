Phil,

Why not get an accurate Dakota digital gauge? This gauge/sender
combo compensates for ambient temperatures. I have one installed
and I trust it's accuracy. In the morning, when I turn my key
to the on position, the gauge will tell me pretty much the current
outside temperature (when engine temp = ambient temp).

I tend to disagree with some folks that say, know what is normal
for your bus and if the temps fall outside of that norm, track
down the problem. Well, what if you "norm" is too high? Then
you wind up doing nothing about your engine because 475F is
"normal" for your bus. Get an accurate CHT gauge.
