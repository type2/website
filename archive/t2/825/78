Anything than can be said has been said about the vendors on this list and
this list has often reached a consensus that the vendors who contribute are a
valued (necessary) part of our community.

There is a much more mature view of bus-driving, and the world in general,
here than on the Samba, where slammin' your ride and 009's are the soup
d'jour. The symbiosis between BD and ourselves is understood, quirks and all.

No one's interested in hashing BD over a forgotten grommet, and there's
nothing you or anyone can add that's not in the archives x 10.
