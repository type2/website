How about tap washers (do you guys call them "faucet
washers" over here?). If one isn't thick enough, maybe
you can stack them

I'd also be tempted to look round the local home
improvement store (I love any excuse to do that :-)
Those places usually have an assortment of rubber
washers in various sizes - maybe in the plumbing
department

Good luck!
