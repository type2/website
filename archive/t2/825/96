Something made me feel uneasy about this discussion thread since 
it started and it finally came to me. While we congratulate 
ourselves on being the more mature, patient and tolerant of the 
VW and type 2 discussion lists, our record has not been that 
good during the two years I've been on the list.  I believe that 
we may also be prone to 'flaming' one another, periodically.  We 
chased Jake Raby off our list and nearly chased John Connelly 
away.  Ron Salmon, like several of our list members, is a 
professional who provides us (the type 2 community) a valuable 
service and has, not only the right but also the duty to make 
his business profitable.  He, like several other pros, also 
provides advice, observations and comments on many of our 
threads.  These comments from the pros may frequently be 
opinionated but isn't that why we all join the list...to get 
second and third opinions?  Of course Rons comments are 
frequently biased toward his business and his products.  Hes 
been doing this for quite some time and seems to be pretty 
thorough about his research.  I read his posts and frequently 
buy parts from his business.  I dont always agree with him and 
I dont always buy from him but Im grateful that hes a part of 
our community.
