Subject: Cylinder head temp?

I am driving a 1980 westy, engine 4000 since a
complete overhaul. all the cooling tin is on and
sealed, fuel injected, timing correct, hi-test gas.
the running temp on the head at 60MPH is around
425-450, if I pull a light hill the temp will go to
500-550 and higher if I pushed it instead of backing
off, if this temp was correct I should have dropped a
valve by now, what could be wrong with the system to
cause such temps. Phil
