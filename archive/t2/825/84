I think what's vital to understand here, and what's missing from your
explanation, is whose fault was it that you received the wrong part.

I've received the wrong part 3 or 4 times from Bus Depot. Each time they
took the part back on their nickel as I was able to convince them - via
no-cost email - that the reason I got the wrong part was the fault of Bus
Depot, not mine. With one of these parts I had to argue a little bit when my
claim was initially rejected (a second no-cost email to Bus Depot) but they
agreed with my reasoning and paid for return freight with a full refund of
my purchase price. If I would get the wrong part because I ordered the wrong
part - and the part was clearly and properly described on the web site -
then I'd expect I'd have to bear the cost of return, and I would.

Bus Depot has instituted a "800" number for parts ordering by number only.
That's fully disclosed on the web site so I can't see any reason for taking
umbrage, particularly when they're pretty darn good at promptly answering
email.
