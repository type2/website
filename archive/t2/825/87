I had a slightly different version of that same exhaust system on my '79 bus.
That cheap, Chinese POS lasted maybe 9,000 miles before it fell apart. It
literally came apart and fell off the bus twenty miles from home on the tail
end of a 5,000 mile journey to Vancouver, BC and back.. I'd even repaired the
cracks in it with a gas welder before starting off on the trip.

I replaced it with this one:

which has performed flawlessly for about six years now - quietly and without
leaks. It's German and looks like stock, but has no provision for EGR or cat.
It's also much lighter than the Chinese extractor exhaust system.

I'd like to see an aftermarket complete exhaust system like this German one,
but one which has provision for a 3-way catalytic converter.

I have a 1976 Transporter.  The recent discussions about Heat Exchangers
on the bay windows is really "hitting close to home".

When I bought my bus, just a few months ago, I suspected that I was
having exhaust leaks due to some backfiring problems.  I replaced my
muffler with an aftermarket setup from CIP.

Unfortunately, about a month ago I sprung an oil leak around my valve
cover and the main bearing went out so now I am looking at an engine
rebuild. While I was taking the engine out, sure enough, more cracks
could be seen in my Heat Exchangers.

Here is my dilemma...  Should I just get my welding friend to try to
seal up the existing Heat Exchangers or should I look at converting the
entire system?

Advice?  Suggestions?

Thanks,
