True. Unfortunately all I have in German are left side 72-74 heat
exchangers. VW stopped making their own heater boxes years ago, and in fact
started buying  replacements from Dansk (who is the only remaining supplier)
for their own dealer network. It's been so long since VW made them that most
busses out there probably have Dansks on them whether the owner realizes it
or not. Of course the difference becomes obvious if you are lucky enough to
have an N.O.S. German one next to a Dansk to compare it to!  The '72-74 left
ones I have were discovered in one of VW's warehouses, where they apparantly
had been sitting overlooked for more than a decade. I don't expect to ever
see them again once they're gone, or find any others like that (although I'd
love to be proven wrong!). Meanwhile, the best bet is to get one German and
one Danish heat exchanger, as you did, which will still produce more heat
than a pair of Danish ones. (And besides my price on the German ones is $50
cheaper than the Danish ones, making it a double bargain.)  Another option,
of course, is to find used ones, but depending on their condition (rusting
out from the inside, or caked with oil inside that dripped from the engine)
this can be worse than using a new Dansk.

That said, I haven't heard anything about Dansk moving production to China
or further reducing their quality. I'd guess that the link you provided
stating that "heat exchangers" will be made in China probably refers to
heater cores for watercooled vehicles, not aircooled heater boxes. The term
"heat exchanger" is used in the automotive trade to refer to a heater core.
That factory will probably be making heater cores for modern Chinese-market
(or other) VW's, hence terms like "using the latest technology" in the
article.

As for the Dansk heat exchangers having minor dings or dents, Dansk
considers these to be an exhaust part with no intrinsic cosmetic value, and
often ships them from Denmark to their U.S. distributors in huge crates with
no packing material. (Same with most mufflers, by the way.) Then when they
reach the U.S., the Dansk distributors often ship them to us in the same
manner. Therefore, many have minor dings, or bends at the heater output tube
that may need to be smoothed out with a pair of pliers. (The German heater
boxes are less prone to this, since they are a bit more robust to begin
with.) Since more are like this than not, there really isn't much of a
solution, as the next one you got could actually be worse. We do try to
refuse any that reach us badly dented, of course (particularly at a seam).
However, that is actually pretty rare; while many look a bit "well
traveled," the dings are usually quite minor and functionally insignificant.
