Subject: Re: Cylinder head temp?

 >the running temp on the head at 60MPH is around
425-450, if I pull a light hill the temp will go to
500-550 and higher if I pushed it instead of backing
off,

My concern is that even if the absolute temperatures are incorrect, a rise 
of > 100 degrees is still potentially a problem. Of course, this could be 
wrong as well!

Cheers,

Martin.
