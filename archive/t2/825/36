Bob,

Use the por-15/fiberglass/por-15 sandwich  combo.

You really are goingto need to pull that windshield and check....might
use the combo above without resorting to welding.

It would be lots easier that way...I used the por-patch and por-15 when I 
first did mine...before I could afford to have it painted.


Cheers, dave
