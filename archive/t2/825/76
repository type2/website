Agreed!

But really - Type 1 engines (71 and earlier) can handle high rpms much
better than Type 4 engines (72 and up). I have seen WAAAAY to many T4
engines with the rod blown through the top of the case - mostly due to
downshifting to 3rd to soon or revving it to high. T4 engines also have a
lot more torque than a stock T1, so they don't need to be revved high to get
the power.

However - as we are talking about shifting speeds - first gear is normally a
get her rollin' gear (15-20) my second gear has been whining (time for a new
tranny) so I have been going easy and only staying in 2nd til 35-40 but
Third is my strong gear and when merging on the freeway i shift at 65
(4,000rpm) unless I really want to get going - shift at 70. However - if I
am just idling I can shift into third at 35....I really don't watch the
speedometer much when I am shifting, usually looking at who I have to go
around - or the oil pressure gauge.

So I agree with Phil, shifting is an art - the zen of shifting a vw bus :)
listen to your engine, turn your music down (a little) :) I can usually feel
the rpms through the shifter and the engine telling me when to shift (is it
working hard, or does she have plenty power left), when you are accelerating
does she feel like she is "topping out" or plenty of throttle left, the
condition of your engine plays an important role when deciding when to
shift....

just my .02 cents :)

Happy bussing,
