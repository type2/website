Engineering isn't a democracy or a popularity contest.  I've watched fads
come and go, some lasting for decades, where the "common
wisdom" didn't really produce any performance gains.

Years ago, Smokey Yunick was running stock cars.  His cars had a tiny
hole in the exhaust manifolds just after the first bend from the cylinder.
Others saw this and decided to try drilling their own manifolds.  Some
were claiming significant performance gains from this modification, with
elaborate explanations of how it changed the sonic velocity through the
headers, relieved pressure spikes, etc.

Turned out that Smokey's "secret holes" were there simply to provide
access for a thermocouple so he could measure exhaust gas temperature!

Same thing with painting engines black, 009 distributors, etc.

Drilled rotors are an effective way of channeling water away from the
disk surface. I've no argument with that.  However, they also tend to
cause uneven disk wear and may increase the possiblity of disk failure.
VW didn't design bus disks to be drilled.

Unfortunately for the aftermarket industry, stock parts can be pretty
darned good.  In order to provide some difference between the trick
aftermaket parts and the mundane stock parts, many of the aftermarket
manufacturers have resorted to questionable engineering.  Drilled rotors
are an example of this.  For a racing application in wet conditions they
are great, but for dry use the holes aren't needed.
