Subject: Re: Cylinder head temp?

Phil:

I have a stock '79 westy with square port heads, and stock CA emissions 
setup.  I also have FI, proper 7.3 : 1 compression ratio, all stock tin 
and seals, verified proper timing, verified proper A/F ratio, and 
verified no vacuum leaks.  I see pretty much the same temps you are 
seeing.  It freaks me out, but I've learned to live with it.  I believe 
that there is a problem with the VDO CHT set-up I'm using.  
Fortunately, the ring underneath #3 plug broke off the sender wire 
during my last compression test, so now I'm not as freaked :).
