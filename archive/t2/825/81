Billy,
        I am not here to totally slam BD and say to never buy from them 
again. Nor did I ever mention anything about vendors not being valued by the 
community. My complaints about BD are NOT even about a missing part. It is what they 
did to me when I did receive a wrong part.  I nor anyone else should have to 
call a long distance number for a problem. I paid for the order to be correct 
the first time and we'll leave it at that.  I guess I should have been a 
mature Bus driver and just kept my opinion to myself. And yes, I did take the 
complaint up with Ron. Lets just say, he was well rehearsed.  

And Billy, I don't have a slammed Bus with a 009 dizzy. I have a 2000cc, Dual 
40mm Kadrons, and a SVDA dizzy. So, can I play too?

Whether it is right or wrong, everyone is entitled to express their opinions.
