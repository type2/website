Subject: Heat Exchanger Quality

Does this mean that the already pathetic quality of Dansk replacement
heat exchangers will continue to erode?

I guess that they'll be making them out of wood and aluminum foil

I purchased a left side OEM VW heat exchanger from Bus Depot for my 79
FI engine and a Dansk right side replacement.  Heavy Duty they (Dansk)
claim! The difference in materials, design and build quality is
amazing.  Made me want to puke. The VW model has a good casting for
the fins (Many fins!) inside and insulation on the exterior. The
sheetmetal exterior is sturdy, I guess it's about 22 gage metal. The
Dansk POS has fins resembling the back of an alligator, no insulation,
poor fit (air leaks) around the exhaust manifold piping inside the
exchanger. sheetmetal exterior, which is maybe 26 gage thickness.

What a piece of crap and it was damaged in shipping!

I should return it and look for a good used one for the right side.
