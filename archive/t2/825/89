Just to add to this discussion, albeit late; when I was line driving "big 
wheels", you put your FINGERS on the shifter, and "felt" the correct time to 
move it, gently, since "it" knew where to go, and just needed time, not 
direction by force, the same way I drive my Westy. That to me is more Zen, 
and you lock out everything else.  The other point, is that in the mountains 
around here, (Vancouver Island), I have found that the 3rd gear will operate 
from 7kmh to 50, and is astonishingly flexible!  Love that kind of 
Engineering "forgiveness"!
