Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder head temp?

Thanks to everyone for the info on the cylinder head
temp issue, I'll be checking it out with a lot of
ideas from all of you and will get back to you with
the results, it's going to take a little time to check
all of them out. thanks  Phil   (P.S. I am also
considering the "Dakota Digital" as a fix for a little
later on.)
