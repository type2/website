What I can't understand there Don, why in the heck you just don't cut a
deal with the management agency for additional parking ----drop some
cash in their hands and they'll look the other way for awhile.

That's rule #1

Lesson #2.
There must be a gas statiion, service joint, warehouse, empty something
you could rent for the winter--or until you found something else.

This last minute stuff really blows, I know---

But a Ben or two talks---screwing around till your booted out walks---

Be american--drop some green under the table.
