Shifting is a art, learn to feel your engine and it
will tell you when to shift, Shifting is always
different take off going down hill, level or uphill,
the range of shift will be different for each one.  I
was always told that first gear was just to get you
moving so you could use the other gears to the best of
their abilities.  Phil
