Subject: 76 Heat Exchanger

I have a 1976 Transporter.  The recent discussions about Heat Exchangers
on the bay windows is really "hitting close to home".

When I bought my bus, just a few months ago, I suspected that I was
having exhaust leaks due to some backfiring problems.  I replaced my
muffler with an aftermarket setup from CIP.

Unfortunately, about a month ago I sprung an oil leak around my valve
cover and the main bearing went out so now I am looking at an engine
rebuild. While I was taking the engine out, sure enough, more cracks
could be seen in my Heat Exchangers.

Here is my dilemma...  Should I just get my welding friend to try to
seal up the existing Heat Exchangers or should I look at converting the
entire system?

Advice?  Suggestions?

Thanks,
