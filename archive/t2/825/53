Subject: Re: [T2] removing dash

Richard,

I was thinking of the "screws" that hold the metal-upper dash to the front of
the bus.
The ones you're referencing are "nuts/studs" that hold the two pieces of the
dash together.
These are harder to access, and I don't know if Bob would need to, unless he
wanted to completely remove the upper portion of the dash.
