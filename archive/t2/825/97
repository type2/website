It's good to hear that volks are having better luck with BD. Their customer 
service would have wrecked the business if it continued the path it was going a 
couple years ago. I'm glad that Ron decided to make some changes to better 
his business and to better serve the VW community. It may bring some confidence 
to try them again.
