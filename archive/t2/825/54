Hey All,
I admit that I don't know a whole lot about the
pancake bus engine, 98% of my engine experience is
with upright motors.  So I am working on a 72 westy
right now, I always thought that the oil cooler on a
TypeIV engine was located under the bulbous piece of
tin just above and to the right of the cooling fan,
however, when pulling the engine I discovered what
appears to be an oil cooler to the left lower rear
area of the engine, under all the tin. So where is the
TypeIV oil cooler supposed to be and if it is where I
though it was, then what is this cooler in the other
pic?? Extra oil cooler???
Please see pix:
