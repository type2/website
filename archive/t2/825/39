Subject: Re: [T2] removing dash

Bob,

With the windshield out, it's real easy to undo the 5 or 6 screws that hold
the upper, metal portion of the dash to the front sheet metal of the bus.
After this, loosen the two big phillips screws on each of the door posts
(might need impact driver) and the whole thing flops around pretty well.
Enough, I would say, for you to put some insulation between the plastic and
the metal you're working on.
