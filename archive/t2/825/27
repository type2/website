Subject: Small part request, fasteners for rear bumper corner and apron

I know I know I am a stickler, I want the correct bolts for the corners of
the rear bumper to body for a 1970, I got saggasge on my driver side from
some dumbass kid that stood on my bumper, and now it rattles, so I need to
bend it up with wood and a jack and screw it down correctly.
also the correct screws/fasteners to secure the arpon INSIDE the engine bay,
I have the long bolts already. Sick of seeing chepa chrome phillips head
screws doing this job.
Thanks,
AL
