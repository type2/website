Subject: Re: Fair price vs. good price

One person's fair price is another's good price.

It's all about what one's willing to pay. Demand and availablilty.Do
you need the gauge cluster or just want it? Regardless of condition?
If you needed it, $100 would be a fair price. If you just wanted it
(to resell?), $15 might be considered more reasonable.

I don't need a gauge cluster, so $15 is overpriced. However, if I
wanted one to frame over my mantel...
