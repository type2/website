I'm using Google mail (Gmail) for my T2 mail. I had one junk mail and
forwarded it to Google. None since. I don't do any mailings except to
the list and only receive from the list and list members.

It's mid 90's here today and the fish aren't bitin' but when we popped
up the top on the Westy and unzipped the screens, it cooled right down
inside. The reflective Heat Shield in the bay window works great! If I
didn't keep up the bug screen in the rear (it's like sleeping outside
with the hatch up! ;-) most of the time, I'd consider getting a Heat
Shield for the rear window too! Just might anyway.
