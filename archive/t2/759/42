Subject: Post Fuel Line Blues

Hiya all,

I got the fuel lines all in, all new hoses on the EFI rails and to
the pump, and tank as well as a new fuel filter.

Its all back to toghter and now the bus wont idle.  It starts ok, and
as long as i have my foot on the pedal it stays running, but when i
release it to let it idle down, it just stalls out.

Is there an accumulation point that needs to be primed?  Or is the
pump bad now?

Help =)

Thanks again,

David.
