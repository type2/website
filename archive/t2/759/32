Subject: CV joints / Engine Rebuild

I have decided to rebuild my engine. I have plenty of
time so I can take it slowly. I was investigating
manuals to help assist me.  I was looking at Bentley
becasue everybody else says so, but I came across a
rebuild manual from Tom Wilson.  It is half the price,
but I wanted to know if anyone has an opinion about
it.  I can't seem to remember any comments about it in
previous engine rebuild posts.

Second.  I was starting the engine removal and noticed
an oil like fluid on the CV boots near the tire.  I
know that brake fluid could be leaking, but I was
wondering if it could be the actual grease breaking
down in the Texas heat?  And if so how can it get on
the ourside of the boot.  It is a new boot.

Thanks,
cp
