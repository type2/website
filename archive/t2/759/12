Subject: Re: [T2] Front drum brakes

Brian asked:

Is there a trick to removing the drums in front I have a 69.  Do I need a
 special tool or willa really big hammer work?  I need new shoes and would like to replace the wheel cylinders

 I have search the archives, but came up empty handed.

The drum comes off with the hub. You need to remove the nut holding the wheel bearing on.
