I found a great place to buy used engines and since i was looking i decided
 to just go all out and put in a subaru engine. I have a 79 bus. Does anybody
 out there recommend any. Im thinking a 1800 turbo. but im not sure if it will fit or not. Any advice is 
appriciated.

Anything will fit if you have money and tools :)

But where are you going put the radiator?
