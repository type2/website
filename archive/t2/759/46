Hi,
Just replaced the vacuum advance as well as the following...Westy  performing 
perfectly.  This is the one that was driven for 7000 miles with  the vacuum 
advanced way too much    Now it is at 5 degrees  ATDC.  With the new 
retard/advance vacuum thingy it is running  perfect    new factory oem bosch plugs, new  
auto tranny  fluid change, recent cv joint service, running 20 50 Valvoline 
Synthetic without  any leaks, tires 9,000 miles on them.  Should I replace the 
oil  cooler before my trip or is it necessary?  Any other suggestions for  my 
trip?
Chuck
