Subject: Shock absorbers

Hi,

I am looking to replace my shock absorbers as they are worn and give a
very bumpy ride. I have read Richard Atwell's aticle and wondered if
anyone had any experience of the shocks made by Alko Suspension from
the Busdepot. Any other comments / experiences are most welcome on the
subject of shock absorbers !

yours

Charles
