Subject: Ham Radio with a Westie

Hi,

I just operated Field Day and am wondering what antenna solutions people 
are coming up with for operating out of a westie?

I started off with a conventional dipole that just did not work very 
well, so I grabbed some electric fencing for horses, the thin 
yellow/black stuff and a piece of 14 gauge solid from a pile on the 
farm. I stuffed the fence wire into my main radiator on my little KX1 4 
Watt morse code set. I strung the fencing up to a power pole, through a 
swimming noodle to keep it from shorting to the body of my van via the 
hole where the power plug lives.

The ground/counterpoise wire was laid on the ground in the opposite 
direction.

At the beginning of the contest I was the only person making contacts 
while the guys inside with 100 Watts and 50 foot tall massive antennas 
were screaming into microphones and getting nowhere. ;-)

The shortwave bands were very bad this last weekend with heavy fading of 
everything down to nothing and then they would get strong for minutes at 
a time, this was when I would be able to contact the guys that just sat 
on one frequency and banged off the contacts. Sometimes I had to wait up 
to 1/2 hour for one person.

Best 73
and I hope to hear back from another ham who owns a Westie.
