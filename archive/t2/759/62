A computer fan does not circulate much air. I put one inline in the engine 
heater duct that runs from the heat exchangers to the front of my 72. With 
the engine running, it adds nothing noticeable to the air flow. With the 
engine off there's less. And that's just with the engine fan -- I have no 
heater fan -- so there's not much there to begin with.
