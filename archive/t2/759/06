Subject: new door seals, '71

I'm ordering new seals for both front, side slider, and engine compartment doors.
The best that Bus Depot has to offer.
I'm not finding any write ups re installation, can anyone point me to something already published??
If not, is it just a simple remove/install??
Anything needed other than the seals?? adhesive, etc??
Thanks
Denny Johnson
