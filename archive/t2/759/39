Subject: Bolts for plate?

Hi,

What kind of bolts or screws are used for attaching the cover plate that
protects the master brake cilinder from the underside? On my bus this plate
was absent, I recently found one so can anyone point me out which bolts to
buy tomorrow before I get under the bus?

I am talking about a '69 bay window...
