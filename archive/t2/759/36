Subject: Re: [T2] CV joints / Engine Rebuild

I have never heard anything but praise for Tom Wilson's book. I used it and 
my factory manual to rebuild my 70 motor last year.

I have decided to rebuild my engine. I have plenty of
 time so I can take it slowly. I was investigating
 manuals to help assist me.  I was looking at Bentley
 becasue everybody else says so, but I came across a
 rebuild manual from Tom Wilson.  It is half the price,
 but I wanted to know if anyone has an opinion about
 it.  I can't seem to remember any comments about it in
 previous engine rebuild posts.
 Thanks,
