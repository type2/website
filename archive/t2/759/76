Subject: KONI Shock Group Buy - They're In!

For those who got in on the last Koni shock group buy, I have good news -
they have come in!  While Koni had previously told me that fronts and rears
would arrive separately, they all came in at once.

I will be sending each of you a direct email to confirm your order. If you
do not get that email, or if there are any changes (i.e. you have moved,
have a different credit card number, etc.), it is important that you get
back to me within the next 24 HOURS. Otherwise I will assume that your order
is good to go as it stands, and will bill/ship it on Wednesday.  Again, it
is only necessary to email me if you do NOT get my email by the end of the
day today, or if something on your order has changed.

As for those who missed the group buy, Koni has promised to send me a small
additional quantity on an as-yet-undisclosed future date (at least a month
from now, I'd guess). They will probably be the last ones we'll ever see, as
Koni has changed their policy on custom runs, and we just got in "under the
wire" on this last one. I am not going to do a group buy for these, since an
exact date and quantity are not completely confirmed and I don't want to
make the mistake of promising any more than it turns out I can deliver.
Instead I will post here when they arrive, and will offer them on a
first-come basis at that time.

For those who don't want to wait for possible future Konis, we do have
special pricing on AlKo's and Boges at the moment, starting at under $20
each:
