Subject: Re: [T2] Saturday parts delivery?

<As it turns out, my package accidentally got lumped in with a corporate delivery and by sheer luck I happen to work at the same company. The guys at the receiving dock, signed for all 50 packages at once, looked me up in the company directory and sent it internal mail to my building.>

Yeah the USPS is pretty cool. In 1994 I ordered the full 911 replica cooling system from BAS (www.ahnendorp.com) Germany directly - in German! Back then with no internet, I had to rely on magazines for info. Had it shipped via UPS and when it arrived in VA where I was stationed on a ship, the postal service guys stuck it into the regular mail shipment and I took delivery of it at Gitmo, Cuba! Cool, 'cept could you postal guys send me the engine too so I have something to work on? It's located across the street from the base in storage unit A-6.... I'll also need my tools, and grab that Bentley manual while you're there.... <grin!>
