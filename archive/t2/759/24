I can't remember who recently reccomended this unit, but it's great!  I 
bought one.  So far I've only checked tach and dwell with it, but it was 
easy and informative.  WELL worth the $20 after shipping.

Any info on other stuff I can check out with it?  I know it does other stuff 
too.  Can I use it like a voltmeter?  Geeky I guess, but it's fun to be able 
to measure all kinds of stuff.  I like knowing my dwell is spot on.
