Subject: Are all clutches the same?

Hey there everyone,
 
Well that is kind of a dumb question I know... of course they are not all the same.  Anyway I am leaving Portland tomorrow to go to Eugene and get my bus, and have it towed to the mechanic.  I am having the engine rebuilt, so I am questioning whether to replace the clutch or not.  
 
The problem is that I had the pressure plate, disk, and throwout bearing replaced in 97, and then in 2000 the throw out bearing went out (about 25,000 miles later).  Well my engine wasn't sounding too good at that point, so my Dad (aka personal mechanic) said to wait until I had the money to do the engine, and clutch.  Well I never did save the money for the engine, and in 2001 my Dad said he would pull the engine and replace the clutch.  He did and about 500 miles later the engine went.  It's been sitting ever since.  So I know that the clutch should be good at this point, but I bought my throw out bearing from the same place (Brooks in Eugene) both times and I am worried that maybe the parts are just crap, and it may go out again in a short amount of time.  So I guess my question is it worth it to get a different clutch all together?  Is there a big difference in quality from one to the other?  If so, what is good, what is bad?  Could the first one have just been a bad one? I
 called Springfield German Import, who said they would get it from Halsey (in PTLD).  Anybody know the quality of a clutch coming from there?  
 
Thanks for the help,
Tamarah
