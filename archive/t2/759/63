Subject: SWR meter - how to?

So ... I have an older CB - Cobra 21 LTD Classic with weather stns etc. ... 
a 102" Shakespeare Antenna - 18' of cable - and this 
http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=5783955280&category=48699

(not advertising it just using it for the picture)  ... Anyone know how to 
use the Land Matic LM-50 ... it was pretty cheap like $16.00 Cdn I think - I 
got it new but it didn't have any instructions - I don't even know the 
wattage I should be setting it on.  I'm assuming that the antenna goes into 
the back on the side with ANT and the radio goes into the side marked 
TRANS - but I'm not sure - does anyone know of any webpages that provide 
some sort of instructions on how to use SWR meters?

TIA
