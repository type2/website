Richard's comment applies to most busses, however your vacuum reading 
will also depend upon where you have your engine timed.  If you have a 
distributor with a vacuum retard (DVDA) , and you time it to the stock 
specification of 5 degrees ATDC you will get 11 to 12 inches.  I chased 
my tail for a couple of months trying to get 15 to 18 inches before I 
discovered this.

I was able to prove this by disconnecting my vacuum retard, re-timing 
to 7.5 degrees BTDC, adjusting the idle to 850 and voila; I had a solid 
17 inches vacuum.
