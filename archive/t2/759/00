Subject: steering column - safety question

Hi guys ,

The upper steering column (Flange) is poorly engage (assembling) in the 
lower column ,  I think it is very scary!  The previous owner used some 
extra clips to add space in the plastic ring (the one which end the 
column tube and goes to the lower column bracket).  I don't like it , I 
want to do it right  ? ,
I basically need to higher the upper column to remove the gap between 
the lower  and upper steering column junction.
I gain some fitting by putting the Column tube the higher I could , but 
that's not enough , I am wondering if the flange is the original one and 
if not too long. There is also one spacer in the column , can I play on 
this to higher the upper column ?

Thanks
