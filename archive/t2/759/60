Glenn,

Yes, it was a sanden 508.  I have lots of pics of it that I will post as 
soon as I get a free moment.  I have NAPA part number for the connectors 
that I used and will post them at the same time.

The sanden should have a certain type of "head" on it in order to fit 
under the tin, but you should be able to purchase one that way....maybe 
Ron at BD has the "more" correct ones now.

Honest guys, I am trying...other cars just  seems to be getting in the 
way!

Cheers, dave
