Subject: Saturday parts delivery?

Folks(and Vendors!),

I recently received two "parts" shipments on Saturday via FEDEX *ground*.

I didn't ask for special treatment for Saturday delivery, and I asked the 
delivery driver about it and he said that they delivered to residences 
on Saturday as a normal course of business...WOW!

It was really nice to get parts on a Saturday morning while I was working 
on a vw.

Any one else experience this?  Vendors?...is it really the same price?

Cheers, dave
