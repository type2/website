Hello Richard  That is the hard way to do this job. A tap will work better 
and cheaper .  I use these  type of blind bearing pullers to remove pilot 
bearings except I have mine mounted to a slide hammer . Also works to remove the 
wrist pins on Wasserboxers and SabuIE ENGINES REAL WELL  . Later and have fun
