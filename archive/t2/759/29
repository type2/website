Hey Brian,
            On my 69 the front drums didn't want to come off at first.  I made 
sure I had run the adjusters IN as far as possible (by looking with a 
flashlight through the access holes) and satisfying myself that the drums could 
rotate very freely.  A few rubber-mallet whacks helped.  Then I used a wheel 
puller very gently, pulling the drum out just a bit until it would not rotate 
freely.  Mallet action again... the shoes were catching an unworn ridge on the 
very inside of the drum.  If you are not careful with the puller, you may of 
course trash the adjusters and/or the pistons.  The secret is to be sure the 
shoes clear the unworn ridge...... clear enough??

Is there a trick to removing the drums in front I have a 69.  Do I need a 
special tool or willa really big hammer work?  I need new shoes and would like 
to replace the wheel cylinders
