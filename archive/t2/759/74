Subject: RE: [T2] CHT Install

Wayne, my rebuilt engine came to me without a hole for the CHT (temp
sensor II).  My local mechanic drilled and tapped the hole for me with
the engine in the bus, so it is possible.  I do not know the details of
how, but he did it.

How does one (can one) install a CHT sender without removing the motor?
