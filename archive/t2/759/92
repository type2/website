Subject: need new engine

I found a great place to buy used engines and since i was looking i decided 
to just go all out and put in a subaru engine. I have a 79 bus. Does anybody 
out there recommend any. Im thinking a 1800 turbo. but im not sure if it will 
fit or not. Any advice is appriciated.
                                                                            
thanks in advance,
                                                                              
                          Dave
