Subject: CHT Temps - Comparisons

I had my bus out on a family outing to the beach yesterday - 1975 Westy 1.8
Weber sing Prog

Fully packed - 2 adults and 4 kids  - all the camping equipment food water
roof rack packed

It was about 90 degrees outside - at 30 mph I had head temps of 300-325 at 50
mph - 350-375 at 60mph they were reading 400-425
are these high or inline considering outside air temps and the weight packed
in
Any comparison advice will be great

Thanks
Eric
