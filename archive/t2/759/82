What's neat about USPS Priority Mail is that they deliver 6 days a
week and I can count on one hand the number of problems I've had with
it in the past 10 years.

A number of years ago, I received a call on a Monday morning from a
customer in Wisconsin.  His words were "You have humbled a UPS Driver"
 I asked him to elaborate and discovered that a package I had mailed
Priority Mail from Redding, CA on Thursday (4:30pm) arrived at his
house that following Saturday morning, apparently catching him quite
off-guard with such fast service (of which he promptly and happily
fixed his Bus that day).

It's nice to see that Fedex will deliver on Saturdays as well.  Not
sure about the "No Monday Delivery" though myself.
