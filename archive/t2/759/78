1977 VW Bus Free to Good Home
This bus is yellow and white, has a fairly straight body and a 10.5 sq. 
ft. sunroof. Unfortunately the engine needs an overhaul; it has bottom-end 
noise and low compression. However, the braking system was overhauled and 
is solid, the electrical system is stable and the dash is mostly complete. 
The tires have air and the wheels have original hubcaps. Interior includes 
all door/wall panels (insulated) with recently replaced black carpet, but 
needs a headliner and upholstery on seats. It's not perfect but its free. 
If you can wrench on a motor this is the bus for you!
