Well, I have a deluxe, not a westie, but I have operated portable from it.

I have a lashed-up antenna support structure consisting of a 2-section
extension ladder and two pieces of PVC pipe nested one within the other.
The whole thing is assembled in an extended position on the ground and
tilted upright by two people.  The ladder is guyed by four ropes to stakes
in the ground.  This gets the antennas about 40 feet in the air.

I pull the dipoles up to the top of this setup with a cord and pulley
setup.  I use broadband coaxial dipoles (sometimes called "Double
Bazookas")  These are good for an entire band without a tuner. I feen them
with an Icom 751A. I have one for each band 10-80m

I used this setup a couple of years ago for a special event station (W7V)
at BBB in Havasu.  Didn't have a lot of time to work, but made contacts
all over the US and as far away as Japan.

For field day operations, my club's specialty is a 1/4 wave vertical on
160m!  This is done with 135 feet of copper wire, some trash bags, and a
cylinder of hydrogen!  It works pretty well even though the top band is
not very active on field day.  We make a few contacts and then reel in
half the antenna to put it on 80m

For mobile use, I use an Icom 706mkIIG with an Icom AH-4 tuner driving a
stainless CB whip.  The tuner and whip are mounted on the luggage rack
with the whip canted back 45 degrees to keep it under the height limit.
This setup will tune the whip from 6m to 80m with the push of a button.
It isn't as efficient as a screwdriver or bugcatcher, but it gets out
pretty well.
