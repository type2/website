Subject: '74 automatic flex plate needed

Dear List,

Well, my flex plate for my '74 automatic disintegrated whilst driving some
time back and I'm finally getting around to getting it fixed.  I think I
recall someone here on the list having the same problem and I'm wondering
where I might be able to locate the flex plate for this?  Also, will the later
version automatic flex plates work with my '74?  If anyone on the list here
has one, PM me and we can work out a deal.

Thanks,
