Subject: Re: [T2] I popped out a CV Joint

Hi Arnaud -

The CV joints are relatively easy to remove, disassemble, and reassemble.  The
only trick is having that 12-point star tool.  I'm no expert on CV joints, but
my guess is that if you were able to pop one out just by pulling on the
driveshaft, then it might have been excessively worn anyway.  Those things are
SO solid, I can't imagine one coming apart by accident like that.. and if
that's the case, be glad that it broke in your garage and not, e.g., on a
pothole or something.

Cheers!

- Miles
