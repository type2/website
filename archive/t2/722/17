yeah, I've considered making a small trailer, Greg's trailer is pretty
good design, I think I would make it a little taller. but weight is always
an issue, the other thing I considered was to leave the engine
compartment and fuel tank and put a  generator in the engine compartment,
using the fuel tank as a fuel tank. there would probably still be a fair
amount of room in there after SIGNIFICANT soundproofing.  but I don't have
anyplace to store the trailer even if I built it...
