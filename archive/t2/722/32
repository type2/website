Hmmm... Put crap washer of correct size on a bolt. Carefully wind
solid copper wire as tightly in one layer as possible. Place a second
crap washer on bolt. Put nut on bolt. Tighten pretty tight. Heat with
propane torch. Tighten again. Repeat until the copper starts squeezing
out from between the washers. Trim copper. Cool. Remove nut, bolt, and
crap washers.

I wonder if that would work?
