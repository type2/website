<My plastic washer has deteriorated and cracked, hence the need for a replacement.>

You are forgiven... <griN!> 

I have met folks who replace it whether it leaks or not. Nothing bad about this, just seems unecessary. 

I replaced one on a motorcycle once. Was out for a ride and the whole plug and waher fell out... And all the oil. Luckily no problems, killed the engine before it was harmed. Don't know why it fell out, I am careful to tighten it up.
