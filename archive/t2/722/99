I checked and my drain plug is 12mm (at least it takes a 12mm socket to
remove it).
Now I just need to find someone who stocks the washer.

Thanks
Eric

If memory serves:

N138051 for models w/12mm Thread Drain Plug (12x18, DIN 7603)
N138152 for models w/14mm Thread Drain Plug (14x20, DIN 7603)

"Crush Type" Copper Washers, as stated in VW's Standard Parts/Hardware
table fiche.

They're still available AFAIK.  I might even have some stashed away in
my "hardware" box.  I'll have to check when I get back in town next
week.
