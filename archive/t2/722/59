Subject: new tire inflation question

Hi,

I am confused here and forgive me if this is a silly question but....My
new tires will be spec'd with a max inflation 65psi. The current
Continentals on my bus are max 40psi. So is this correct that no matter
what the new tire max inflation of 65psi do I still use 30psi on front
and 37-40psi on rear? How will this affect the wear of the tire and are
they considered under inflated then?

Meg
