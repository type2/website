Subject: Re: [T2]  oil drain plug washer

My plastic washer has deteriorated and cracked, hence the need for a replacement. Its causing a very minor drip, but why have a drip when its not necessary.  :-)

 I have never understood the need to replace any oil drain plug or the washer. In 25 cars I have replaced maybe 2, and never replaced the washer for any particular reason. 

 I've got 105K on my Honda with the factory washer and plug, put 30K on my VW Westy with the same VW plug...
