Subject: Re: [T2] T2 4 Wheel Trailer

I love the full sized VW van/trailer concept. For smaller cargo needs I plan to build a replica Westfalia utility trailer based on a Harbor Freight/Northern Tool 3x4 trailer chassis. 

Ought to be perfect for hauling our gifts, luggage, tools, and/or a bicycle or two on top for all weather comfort. Will be perfect towed behind the Westy. Cabrio, Beetle or even the CR-V. It could be pulled by a motorcycle too if need be.
