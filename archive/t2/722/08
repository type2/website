Subject: T2 4 Wheel Trailer

I recently aquired a 78 Baywindow hulk (green and all) from a fellow
list memeber (thanks Mark), and was thinking about making it a 4
wheeled trailer.

My question is this, does anyone have any resources for a steering
setup for somthing like this? I dont see a great deal of those
running around.

Thanks in advance,

David.
