All engines depend.

Buy Solex jets for your Brosol.. I agree 65s are often too rich.

I agree to insure ignition is correct and timed, and that vac/SVDA is
better for advance under load/partial load. Bad plugs with poor
burn/gap must be eliminated also. You can jet it right with a right on
009, although it might be still be flat at low RPM for advance until
the vacuum arrives.

16-17 in town on a camper with hills to deal with isn't the worst, I
think, but it depends on the hills and your gear loaded up.
