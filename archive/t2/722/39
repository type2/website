Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator/Charging Circuit Problems --> D+ shorted to

You have one of 2 things bad:

1) The alternator. The Bosch alternator has 9 diodes in it. [unlike almost all others the use 6]
You have the usual 3 neg and 3 pos for the rectifier bridge and you have 3 more for the field circuit.
One or more is shorted.   [this is where the alternator testers at Kragens, Pep Boys, Smucks etc fail to test
and then they give you a passing grade because the tester full fields the alt and it works.....]

2) The harness behind the tin cover on the back the alt has shorted to itself. You have the big batt wire and
the 3 wire regulator harness there and an extra black wire off stator output if you have a Westy. Or it
shorted to itself where it goes up thru the upper tin hole.

Either way, you will need to remove the alternator. Inspect the harness from end to end. If it appears intact,
then you will need to have the alt properly tested by a real shop that understands
Bosch alternators.

From Derwood:

After some poking found that 2.3A is going to the alternator's voltage
regulator.  Thought that was it, got a new regulator, but the current draw
persisted (not the regulator).  Discovered same current going into D+ terminal
of the regulator was leaving DF terminal.  This I guess is the excitation
current for the alternator field.  I guess the regulator passes this current
from D+ to DF to allow for field excitation (and during steady state I guess
it will regulate the voltage by controlling the field current).

 Measured the DF to D- resistance (field winding resistance).  ~5Ohms.  My
service manual says this is the ballpark for this alternator.  Also, 12V/5Ohm
= 2.4A is right on the current draw I am measuring.

Consulted some other references (including this archive, great btw) and
determined that the D+ line (output of the alternator, input to the regulator)
connects with a wire that runs to the front of the bus and connects to the
charging bulb.  My bulb IS showing problems by the way.

 So I have gathered that this connection to D+ is to allow for switched battery
to excite the alternator field when the ignition switch is turned to ON.  Thus
the field is only excited (and drawing 2.4A) when the key is turned.

But in MY case, somehow the D+ line is shorted to the battery.  It may be
shorted to the B+ terminal of the alternator, which is direct connect to the
battery for charging.  Either way, I have 12V on the D+ terminal when the
ignition switch is OFF.  I disconnected the wire to the front (bulb) and the
12V persisted.  As far as I can tell, I've isolated the D+ wire so it only
connnects to the alternator and the regulator.  And I still have 12V.

 Questions:
Am I right in that the D+ line of the alternator should only be connected to
SWITCHED battery?  I.e. Ignition switch 0FF --> D+ line is no voltage.
Ignition switch ON --> D+ is 12V.

If this is right, why am I seeing 12V on D+ all the time?  Note I have
disconnected the line to the bulb in the front.

If there is a short between battery 12V (B+) and the D+ line, would there be a
good place to look?  I am hesitant to rip out the alternator.  Does anyone
know if the B+ wiring and D+ wiring run in parallel outside the alternator?
Is it more likely the short comes from some failure internal to the
alternator?  What type of failure (diode, brushes, ect.)
