Subject: [Fwd: Bad ignition switch?? Please help diagnose.]

I've got a problem I need some help with please. I went to drive my 1970
Westy after it has sat for a month or so. Started her up and took a spin
around the neighborhood, ran well and I was heading for home. When I was
like 6 houses away it died on me. I went to start her back up and here's
what happened: Turned key and idiot lights come on and fuel gauge
springs to life. Turn key to next notch and all goes dead. I hear a
click from the rear of the bus.

I've checked all the connections at the starter. Ignition switch is less
than a year old so is starter. I didn't bridge the solenoid connections
to see if the starter turned cause I didn't think of it at the time. But
that wouldn't cause my power to kill would it. Later when I tried again,
it sounded like juice was trying to get to the starter, but couldn't
Please help diagnose. I'd rather not give Ron another $30 for an
ignition switch if I don't need too. :)

Also, since about 3 weeks after I put in the ignition switch, the key
doesn't spring back when I let go when starting. This action is in the
switch right??

TIA
Zach 1970 Westy
