Subject: [T2] compufire - was The factory's official take on

My Compufire went bad under warranty. It was in a Type IV engine and they
refused to warranty it.
They don't make a unit for a type IV distributor but when I called the first
day I bought it and said it didn't fit they sent me an adapter
................
Confusing when they don't make a unit but they offer an adapter that tells
me different.
I'd run from Compufire.
