Subject: FedEx/UPS deliveries

A bit off-topic, but funny...

Guess who I just caught kanoodling in the parking lot of the Gas N Sip 
next door?

Our UPS driver, and a new FedEx driver!

Seriously.

I was expecting a much-needed delivery from FedEx, and we had just 
gotten a UPS package from Linda (our regular UPS driver) and I wondered 
what was going on when I saw the FedEx truck pull in and park next to 
the other brown truck. So, 45 minutes after our UPS delivery I saw the 
FedEx and UPS trucks still parked next to each other, but no one in the 
cabs.

Up I walk, and then the FedEx door slides open and the two drivers come 
out...and see me...and turn BEET RED.

It gets better.

The FedEx driver was woman as well.

FedEx/UPS love?

What a fascinating day.
