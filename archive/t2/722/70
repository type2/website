lilmatt,

You need to see what circuit the pump is powered from....it should 
definitely come on with the engine and not at any other time.

Generally they are connected in with the power to the coil.

If you are worried about it being on in an accident, go to the junkyard 
and find a late model ford and get the "accident" shutoff switch out of 
it.  Numerous references to where and how on the net.

Just google       fuel pump shut off ford

Cheers, dave

 The electrical pump is often loud (tickatickatickaticka), and when I 
 need my headlights on but not the engine, I don't like how the fuel 
 pump just sits there running
. Not to mention what could happen in an 
 accident. So considering all that, I'm considering getting a mechanical 
 fuel pump, gasket, and push rod, and ditching the electric.
