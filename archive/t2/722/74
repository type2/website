Don't have the number, but should be listed...

Steve Reed in Hays, Kansas.  Just call him and ask him for 
recomendations...he may work on VW's for a living, but not sure.

He helped me out year before last by going and looking at a Puma that I 
was interested in buying that was in Hays.  He was in the middle of a 
early model Porsche Spyder restore.

Oh, here is the listing from switchboard.

1626 Mount Pleasant Rd
Hays,  KS  67601-9534
(785) 623-4281 


Cheers, dave
