Subject: We're on our way to EveryBus 2005

Woohoo.... The summer bus camping season just officially opened. The 
Potts's are
on their way to EB!!!

The westfakia and westrailer are packed up full to the gunwhales but ready to
roll. My parents are on a different sort of bus, riding a grayhound overnight
to West Virginia where they've arranged the purchase of a 1985 Vanagon Westy
with AC, AT, PS and heat.

If you're coming to EveryBus, be sure to drop in and say "Hi" at the Canadian
Pavilion. If not, well then I guess we'll see you on the road some time.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
