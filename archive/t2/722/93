Subject: Re: [T2] new tire inflation question

One inflates tires so as they will wear evenly, presenting an ideal 
footprint on the road..   Front tires take less than the rear for this 
reason.  If you put 30,000 mi on the bus and notice the tread is more 
worn in the center then you have been overinflating them.  If more worn 
on each side, they are underinflated.  In my experience, 28-30 fr and 35 
rear is good.  Carry a bus full of books and you will have to add more air.
One can only add up to the maX.  Reinforced tires can take more weight 
and inflation.  They are also stiffer so you don't wander all over the 
road in cross winds.
