Hi group,

I'm new to the list.

I am 25 from near sacramento, california.
I've worked on aircooled VW's for about 20
years.  My dad used to have me hand him
wrenches and hold the light (hold it so **I**
can see...shudder)

I just wrecked a 71 bus, I swerved to avoid
a head on collision with someone driving
in the wrong lane.

We cut up the old one and took it to the
dump.  Put the good engine and tranny
in a 71 thats been sitting here for 20 years.
I figure that makes it a 91.  :-)  I now drive
a 91 aircooled bus.

The buzzer (key in ignition) and interior
lights work!

I need to grease everything, steering is a
bit rough, hesitant to move.

I am experienced in just about every
aspect of VW repair on aircooled.  Engine,
tuning, tear down, head replacement,
starter rebuilds, carb rebuilds, electrical
problems, wiring.  I have rewired several
bus's and bugs, got everything working.

I've got a GPS hooked to a cheap laptop
that I run through DC/AC inverter.  Map
software so I know where I am going :-)

If anyone near me wants help wiring
or other VW related, will work for food!

I have some VW parts for sale, 71 bus
windows (everything but windshield
and driver/passenger door windows),
some good weber carbs.

I am looking for 71 bus windshield.  any
leads on a cheap one?  also looking for:
interior lights, headlight.
