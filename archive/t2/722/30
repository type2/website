Subject: Re: [T2] T2 4 Wheel Trailer

I saw this guy on a Harley in Niagara Falls last year at a car wash.  He had
a trailer that was a home made deal with ... spooked motor cycle wheels and
an ash frame. It was pretty small of course but it was the coolest trailer I
have ever seen.  It was actually kinda old but had been restored.  The
spooked wheels were just so cool.  I'd love to have a trailer like that to
tow behind my 60.

IMO - unless you are traveling with a few kids then a motor cycle trailer is
the ideal size - unfortunately all the ones I've looked at cost more than my 
old bus when I bought it.
