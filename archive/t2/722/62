Subject: Fuel pumps

All,
In learning more about our Bus, I've found I have an electrical fuel 
pump, and it looks as if the mechanical fuel pump location was blocked 
off by a flat plate.
The electrical pump is often loud (tickatickatickaticka), and when I 
need my headlights on but not the engine, I don't like how the fuel 
pump just sits there running. Not to mention what could happen in an 
accident. So considering all that, I'm considering getting a mechanical 
fuel pump, gasket, and push rod, and ditching the electric.

Other than the obligatory "the PO probably did it for a reason" 
comments, what are the pros and cons of reverting?

Thanks
