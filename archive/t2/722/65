Meg,

Do not inflate your tires beyond the max inflation value printed on the tire.
Bravo to you for selecting a new tire that suits the application. 
Tires of the correct rating should be inflated to the specs in your owner's manual or on the driver's door jamb. If your tires deviate from the specifications, inflation values should be adjusted accordingly. Check this post: http://www.type2.com/archive/type2/132437.html for more info.

So is this correct that no matter
what the new tire max inflation of 65psi do I still use 30psi on front
and 37-40psi on rear?
