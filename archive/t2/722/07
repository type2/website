Subject: 1971 VW bus shift lever difficulties

Hello,

I am restoring a 71 bus.  I put a good engine and trans in
it.  The bus has sat here for approx 20 years.

While sitting in the yard, we noticed that the shift
lever was messed up.  You tried to shift and
the lever would float.  You could spin it around
in circles, and only two gears seemed to engage.

The ball at the end of the shift lever had popped out
of the receiver in the shift linkage.

We removed the lever, put the ball back in the
receiver, and tightened the two bolts.  We hadn't 
read the manual, and did not push the aligner
plate with a screwdriver.

I took the bus out for a test drive and 1st, 2nd,
reverse worked fine.  I decided to get some speed,
put it in 3rd gear.

It went into 3rd, but the ball popped out of the
receiver again.  I had to drive it home in 3rd
gear (lucky most was down hill)

Is this just an alignment plate problem?

I notice in the VW manual that the shift
lever + "alignment pin" are one piece.  I have
two shift levers here and both allow the pin
to come out, and a spring pushes the pin
back (towards rear of van) into the ball.

I also see that the receiver pin that the
shift linkage slides onto (under the floorboard,
in front of the shift lever) is bent slightly downward.

The ball is either 1)allowed to come UP (twds roof)
or 2)alignment plate is not aligned correctly, allowing
me to move lever at an angle which allows ball
to pop out.

Any suggestions on what to check?  How to fix?

Rich
