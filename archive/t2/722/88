If memory serves:

N138051 for models w/12mm Thread Drain Plug (12x18, DIN 7603)
N138152 for models w/14mm Thread Drain Plug (14x20, DIN 7603)

"Crush Type" Copper Washers, as stated in VW's Standard Parts/Hardware
table fiche.

They're still available AFAIK.  I might even have some stashed away in
my "hardware" box.  I'll have to check when I get back in town next
week.

My ex73 Panel 1700 and my Ex80 Vanagon 2000 were 14mm, but I've seen a
few that were 12mm.  My current Wasser is 14mm and I use the N138152
with no leaks, even tho the factory calls for a flat copper washer
(N138141[or 2], 14x18).
