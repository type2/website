Y'know, the saddest part of this post is the assumption that the washer
is plastic.  That washer is SUPPOSED to be copper, wrung copper, and soft
enough to bend between three fingers.  Alas, that washer is truly NLA and
all that you can get is the washer that Jamie mentioned.  Yes, it will
work, and it is what I use, but I certainly remember that wrung copper
washer that never leaked, that never split, that never cracked and that
never needed more than 5 ft/lbs to accomplish its intended task :-(

OOK!
