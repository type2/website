Subject: 69 Bug For Sale

Hi folks, Shawn here.  I've been off the list for awhile.
My girl Andrea is selling her beloved bug.   Kind of hard to transport 
two big dogs in it and keep it in good condition.
We'd love to see it go to someone who can appreciate it.
The ad is up in the mechanic's shop as of now.
For listmembers we'll accept offers.  It is in very good mechanical and 
body condition.
The only problem is of course the floor.  We also have the replacement 
floor panels.
The pass side is still good and if someone wanted to patch the dr. side 
it would also do.
I'm just too busy to tackle this on my own time.
We also still have Daisy, the green '76 Westy.  So we'll not be dealing 
too much w/ VW withdrawl...
