It "could" work with a set of european tin, a few other items and some
effort but you dont want to do it. trust me.

My advice is to first evaluate what you have. it is possible that you just
have a dropped valve seat or valve train issue on #3.

Where are you located?
Try to find someone in your area with actual experience with ACVWs,
preferably with the pancake motors.
maybe you can invite a listee to come over and think with you.

You could use a 914 engine but it they are not really set up to drive such
a heavy vehicle with the drive train the bus has.

I cant imagine what this is supposed to mean. A 76 doesnt have king pins.
I agree maybe they mean the center pin aka swing lever pin.

> Suspension: "lower ball joints poor"

The most reasonable DIY way to do it is to get rebuilt  arms with the ball
joints already done. Like you said.
bus boys does them, bus-boys.com. i dont know who else.


yes you will want a bentley.

If the body is in half decent shape and you have a fairly complete bus I
agree you got a good deal.


good luck
