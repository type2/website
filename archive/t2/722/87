Subject: rear matttress

Hi Guys.  I thought I had this taken care of but my
source backed out of the deal.  I need a sage green
rear mattress for my 76 Campmobile.  It has the
beleved edges on the RH side.  I could also use the
cloth off of a good top mattress as I need to do my
front seats also.  Can anyone oblige at a reasonable
rate?  Thanks...KR
