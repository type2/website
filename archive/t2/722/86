Subject: problems with rebuilt engine

Trying to get off to EB05.  Just installed a rebuilt engine in my 71 bus 
today.  It started, runs and idles good, but driving down the road, has 
almost no acceleration.  1st and 2nd are not too bad, but when shifting into 
4th, it starts loosing speed quickly.  Any ideas would be appreciated.
Thanks
