Subject: I popped out a CV Joint

Hi folks,
While under the bus with both wheels off the ground I grabbed a CV
driveshaft in each hand to lift my body and creep. Unfortunately I
seem to have popped one out by doing so. Now the the tranny side can
spin without driving the shaft. The shaft is clearly off center also.

Is there a way to pop the shaft back in the cage without opening the
CV joint ? I guess not since the balls are likely all over the place
in the CV joint now. I am kind of running out of steam after an
intense ten day session on the bus and a quick fix would come handy.

Aside from that my first engine pulling and pushing went good. I
installed an unplugged heat riser, torqued the heads, built an adapter
to hook up the controls of my bug's heater boxes, changed the fuel
lines and filters, cleaned carb, installed a stock muffler, changed
tranny oil, ground strap, installed a thermostat and rod and
cleaned/painted a bunch of parts.

The 41$ pep boys motorcycle jack did a good job at lifting the engine.
Now Cycle Gear sells the same jack for 99$.

Oh yeah, the spinning cable with the the heat riser in the car trick
never worked for me. I used at least 20 feet of steel cable, 5 hours
and a new power drill trying. In addition to being a waste of time it
was a really dirty job.

This week end we go camping !
