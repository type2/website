Rich,

Welcome to the list! 

Best bet for a windshield is to just go buy a new one....generally about 
$140 or so + install if you want someone else to do it....from most of the 
major glass suppliers....check around for the best prices...

Old ones are not going to be in very good shape and transporting them is a 
pain.

Lots of suff in the archives on this....

Cheers, dave
