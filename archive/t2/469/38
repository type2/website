1.8    93mm      92.4(-at-)3000  (decent increase in bore size, decent increase 
in torque)

2.0    94mm      105(-at-)2800    (Small increase bore; large increase torque)

I thought torque was related to bore size (Harley Davidson = large bore = 
large torque.  Same for farm tractors)

How come 2.0 has such a large increase in torque from a 1.8 with a small 
increase in bore?? >>

My guess would be how the engine is set up by the factory (timing, cam, etc.).
Notice how the higher torque #'s come in at lower RPM's. Your example of
Harley is a good one...H-D's are heavier bikes than the crotch rockets and
need the torque to get them off the line...A high winding engine "might" bog
down when trying to move either a Bus or a Fat Bob...
