Hey guys;
Can you help me identify a heater?  Is this stock? or did someone add this
later?  I have no literature on this.
My van is a '78 west conversion.  see:

It is connected to the LP tank.  I've never used used it. I just wonder if
anyone has seen such a beastie and has any stores about one.

Second;
My cables that connect to the heater boxes & heat/defrost-vent are
disconnected.   I needed and got some replacement cables to the heater
boxes, but I can't figure out how they connect.  The previous owner wired
them together.  Could one of you guys take a pic of the cables all connected
behind the instrument cluster & either post it or send it to me?  thanks.

Third;
You know that rubberized plastic edging - "T" shaped that runs around all
the edges of the camper wooden interior.  the part of the "T" inserts into
the slotted wood to hold it in.   Mine has hardened and shrank over the
years.  Looks funky, is wavy & the closet is hard to close.  Anybody know
where to find replacement edge covers?

I thank you & Maynard thanks you.
-Brian
