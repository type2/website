Use 94mm P&C's and the 77 bottom and build a 2 litre motor. There is no
opening up needed, it will all fit.  Make sure to use a new cam and lifters,
preferably web cam.

Like I said, there is no fly cut, no open case, it all fits. The heads
should be rebuilt in any case.

Keep the 1.7 for the 72.

I am not a fan of those carbs on a 2 litre motor, but you might be able to
make them work. Try to get a working FI system. You might still have tin
issues with all this mixing and matching, so be prepared for that.
