meaning simply better protection.  In oil, SG was
better than SF which was
better than SE.  Simple!

Correct, but...... 20/50 oil is still 20/50 oil. The
weight or blend has not changed. The only difference
between one brand of 20/50 and another is the base
stock where it came from. The SJ, SG, SF rating is
ONLY pertaining to the additive package.

When people say 'the muti-grade oil made today is
better than it was 20 years ago', that is wrong. The
oil still uses the same plastic polymers. The only
different is the additives. 

This is referring to dyno oil, not synthetic.
