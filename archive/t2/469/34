Kabayo,

Where did you see this?  I would love to have a printed page to show
customers as I hear "But it never needs changing" way too much.
Interestingly with average yearly milages varying from 10-15,000 a two
year change cycle would be every 20-30,000 miles.  Since the brake system
needs flushing at that interval as well I am now more confident than ever
that combining the tasks is a valid strategy.

Certainly there is no harm in this if you are doing it yourself but it
seems excessive if you are paying for the change.

                             OOK!
