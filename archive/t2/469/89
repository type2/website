I am missing the heating ducts that run across the front doors of my bus. 
I was given a pair that are incompatible with my year.  I need 1968 ones,
they are open on each end.  If anyone knows where I might obtain them
please let me know.  I wrote to bustedbus but have not received a reply
from them yet.

Thanks,

Jennifer
