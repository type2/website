Subject: Re: [T2] The Mechanics of Cooling (flaps)

If that cable slips down below the shrouding you have a fun time getting
it back through- in checking my daughter's flaps I thought they were
binding- Where-ever I pushed the rod to, they stayed- but to check, I
disconnected the thermostat at the bottom (easy compared to readjusting
the cable)) and the flaps sprung open- turns out the spring is pretty
wound and just balances the thermostat pull, so it feels bound.

   "If you release the cable from the attachment to the flaps and rotate
it by
hand you can tell if the spring is working and the joints are free.  the
thermostat attachment should be rotated away from you toward the front
of
the bus when the engine is cold and should be vertical when the engine
is
warm.
