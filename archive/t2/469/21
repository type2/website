Subject: oil froth / question

I'm on the road (of course) and noticed something as I was filling up with 
Fuel
and checking the oil.  I have sorta seen this in the past but never really 
felt it was
significant.

The oil in the 78 bus  has a white frothy appearance only at the top of the 
dipstick
and at the top of the tube where you add oil to the engine. It is not down 
near the
level indicator of the dip stick.

Since I am still new to the aircooled classic that I own I am sorta stumped.
It doesn't have watercooling so it can't be something like a cracked head 
which
I would question. Although as mentioned before the oil down in the case 
isn't
frothy. It kinda reminds me of a beer.. has a head ;)

Whats shaking... any ideas?

Just to help out. I just drove 600 km and had no issues to note. Good power 
(1700 fi engine)
, No weird noises, farts, burps or hiccups.  Exhaust sounds good etc etc. 
Power is good
to excellent.

Should I worry about it?  I was thinking maybe it picked up some moisture in 
the air
through the airbox and simply pushed it up to the top or something.  It's 
about 1 degree
celcius outside (driving it in the nice fresh air) and everything is good.

I will be putting another 800 km on the bus in the next day and a half. It 
could use an oil
change but not imperative as far as use has been.  I was planning on 
changing when I get
home and winterizing it.

Thanks
