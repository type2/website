I have driven a bus with a cylinder head temp (CHT) gauge, an oil
temperature (OT) gauge and an oil pressure (OP) gauge.  The CHT rises
quickly with load and falls quickly when the load is removed.  OP follows
it with significant damping and OT lags OP very significantly.  The lag
between OP and OT may be a function of sensor placement.  The OP sender is
located right after the pump and reacts almost instantly to changes in
pump efficiency whereas the OT sender is located in the sump and has to
wait until the cooler oil reaches and mixes with the reserve oil in the
sump.
