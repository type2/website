Subject: 68 Baywindow: Yikes! Hardship Trek

Hello Folks,

  Been driving the bus almost exclusively and have racked up a lot of
happy and uneventful miles.  We have had an unfortunate diagnosis within
the family and will be making a very long trek.  We only have the bus to
take us and I am doing my best to prepare her for the rigors of the
drive from South Carolina to New York in December.  Would like to have
any input or advice anyone is willing to impart.

  I searched the archives and found a list of stuff to take on a rescue
mission.  I submitted a form to AIRS a week or so ago and plan to
compile a list of those that may be near our intended route.

  I am worried that I cannot get any grease into the center of the front
axil.  I removed the zerk and it is not stopped up.  How can I force
grease into this area?

  The engine was just rebuilt, I am having it removed next week by the
rebuilder to replace the throw-out bearing that is seriously ruining my
farfignugin.

  The oil light quit working, I will see if it is only the bulb tomorrow. 
I hope it is that simple.

  I need to adjust my valves very soon and I am looking for a go-nogo set
of feeler gauges.  Any preferences?

  Will be adding 90 weight to my steering box tomorrow and checking the
transmission's oil level.  Might drain it and fill it anew.

  Aside from needing to drive wearing a down sleeping bag with leg holes,
what urgent or glaring items would YOU jump on to get ready?

Thank You Thank You Thank You,

Jennifer
