Jennifer, Sorry about the purpose of your trip.  NC is not that far from
NY, we just drove to Savannah Ga and back, but it was in the 94
minivan.  I am more concerned about the drivers on the road; on Rt 95
south after DC we witnessed a horrific crash that would have involved us
had we been 3 cars closer; apparently the driver fell asleep and then
weaved suddenly to the left; then he weaved to the right along the
shoulder and crashed into a parked car on the shoulder, sending him back
into the road and involving other cars.  We JUST got by it and observed
the truck  behind us had stoped to alert traffic and help.  We left NJ
10 PM to avoid the Baltimore-DC traffic; had we left one minute later,
we may have had over an hour delay; had we left 4 sec later we might be
dead!
    The moral here is that you are driving a SLOW vehicle compared to
the current traffic with also a greater probability of breakdown, and we
do not think it is safe to be driving 20 mph slower when drivers on the
road are tired and have less visibility- as exampled by that truck that
crashed into the splitty towing a splitty-and Bob (Access Systems) in
the Balt. area can tell you about tired truck drivers.  Drive in the
daytime if possible! Also carry what will make you very visible, such as
flares, triangle, and I like the c-battery strobes you can get from RS;
we sagged an 18-25mph bike rider all across Pa in a race that ran til
midnight; a few of these in the back made us VERY visible.  If you must
stop, try to get off the shoulder; with a flat we once rolled with it
until an exit on ramp made the road edge very deep.
     Get the oil light replaced or replace the sender-it is just a
grounding switch- I trust someone checked the engine ground; ie, is the
trans grounding strap intact!  I assume the bus is tuned, but a recent
rebuild must be babied a bit and have its oil/strainer changed at about
a 400 mi interval-ie, a stready driving does not allow proper ring
seating, and thus consider back roads to vary the speed.  Going the
Bay-Bridge route on up to Delaware allows a pleasant stop by the shore
and an easy ride up to the turnpike to avoid rt 95.   The tightening of
valves can be checked in a hurry; I could FEEL the right gap just by
wiggling the rockers.  Have extra valve cover gaskets; if you use
permatex between the cover and gasket, it can be reused if nice and
smooth. 
   Re the greasing of the center swing lever bushing, make sure the
wheels are hanging, and try having someone spin the steering back and
forth as you pump.  It helps to have a well fitting pump tip and nice
round zerk.  Try wiring the tip in place by wrapping some turns behind
its edge and then behind the torsion tube.   Based on my welding strips
over the housing once, a torch applied to each side may loosen/soften
old grease.
   Re trans oil, make sure it is GL4 compliant and use multiweight if
you plan on traveling in any cold for the next 30,000 mi!  If being warm
enough can not be solved in time by checking the path from your heater
boxes, try the small 12v electric blankets available at truck stops;
even your generator can handle two of these; about $30.  We use those in
the middle of winter (sit on it and wrap your legs in it).  Driving in
the day when it is sunny makes for a warmer trip with solar radiation if
you open curtains.  Good luck, and also have the AIRS list- we are in
central NJ and see the sig for a phone #.
