Subject: Re: [T2] GL4 vs. GL5

I haven't even owned a VW but when I see they say It is unnecessary to
change the oil on a 1970 and later vehicle I have to wonder if they were
considering people would still be driving these disposable people movers
some 30+ years on after they were filled up at the factory...

Just a thought, I don't have any detailed knowledge of oil specificationsb
but if your vw hasnt had the tranny fluid changed in thirty years, unless
its been sitting in a climate controled meusem it's time to change the
fluid. It doesnt matter what the oil specs or manufacturer says. Just fill
it up with the correct stuff.
