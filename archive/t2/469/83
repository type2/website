VW states in the owners manual, "We recommend more frequent oil changes if
you drive your car only short distances during the winter months". I think
this is a good idea. I also believe in changing the filter every time but
that's another debate.

I've found that by having the proper gasket under the oil filler cap you can
seal it off better and reduce the foam.

Any foam collecting where the dipstick goes should probably be deal with by
getting another one. Mine is a tight seal and I've never seen foam there.

Air (O2 + N + trace elements) is the first reactant not pure oxygen. The
combustion by-products are:

= H20 + N + CO2 + HC + CO + NOx

Whatever collected in the oil breather tube or oil filler spout before the
oil temperature reaches 212F usually remains in my experience.

Some blow-by happens regardless of engine age. New vehicles still have PCV
valves and if it didn't the piston/cylinder wear would be considerable.
