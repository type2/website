I believe this froth is due to condensation from moist air mixing with the
oil. I see this is my newly rebuilt engine (< 5000 miles). It always
occurs when the ambient air temperature is cold and the engine doesnt come
up to operating temperature. Not necessarily due to improperly functioning
flaps, but could be due to numerous short trips. I never see this froth in
the summer, only winter. I try to take the long way home from work at
least once a week during the cold months to make sure my engine reaches
operating temps and drives off this excess moisture.

Try driving your bus until the engine comes up to temp for awhile and see
if it goes away.
