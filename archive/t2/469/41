Subject: Re: [T2] Torque

Actually take a coffee can piston of a Minneapolis Moline U, or a John
Deere A or G, and attach it to a 3 ft. long rod, which will act as a
lever to the crank--this is where torque is amplified--the bore and the
stroke multiply this--

Take a IH 806 diesel for instance--no torque to speak of because of the
short stroke, small bore--
IH combatted this situation with a torque amplifier prior to the trans
and rear end trans---more countershafts, and planetary gears--more
torque amplification.

Mack Trucks does the same thing--with a big bore--long stroke--low
RPM's, and with triple counter rotating lay shafts in the trans----which
amplifies the engines torque to the back wheels--

Torque isn't always just due to the length of the stroke, but for
simplification purposes--this is correct--the size of the bore
helps--but not without long stroke--
