Subject: Business case decision - 1.7 -> 1.8 -> 2.0 ??

Sorry.  Kind of long.  I seek technical advice on what to do.


(1) I have a  low mileage 1.7 engine in a '72    The engine needs both head 
work (#2 cyl - probably just burnt valve) and ring work (low compression in 
one cyl that comes up with oil spritz).  Bottom end is sound

(2) I came across a decent 1.8 engine (1974 model).  I covet the heads - 
this is the start of the dilemma

(3) I believe I can get a decent bottom end 1977 engine, no heads .

My rebuilder will include whatever size new P&C I want at one price, and can 
do all but bore allign a Type IV case, i. e., open the heads; open the case. 
  He sends out the crank to the mid west somewhere.

He is more interested in doing a good job than making money.  Over 28 years 
rebuilding VW engines and still not rich.

Costs:

What ever way I go, the rebuild price is $1,150 plus a small extra for fly 
cut, open case, open heads. Includes new valves, guides, and new P&C


The 1.7 is in my garage.  Cost zero.  The kicker:  the wife wants me to get 
the '72 1.7 running and sell it.  I can do that for about $100.

The 1.8 will cost $150, but I get decent heat exchangers and muffler setup, 
but no carbs [I have two sets of 32 - 34 PDSIT 2/3].    No chance to get 
just the heads (sorry Steve)

The 2.0 bottom end will be about $50.


What do I do??  I want to do it right, even for the next owner.

And I will trade cash for experience
