Redline makes a synthetic gear oil called MT-90 that is compatible with
the GL-4 spec.

Their web site:

http://www.redlineoil.com/frames/mtlti.htm

has a good technical description, and from the looks of it they are quite
aware of the concerns over synchro friction and corrosion.

I'm using it in a transmission built by the infamous Todd Hill.
It has been working OK.  Of course, transmissions last a long time with
conventional lubricants, so it's very hard to tell if synthetics are
increasing the life at all.
