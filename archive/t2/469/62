Subject: 79 Bus Rear End Noise

Hi Folks,

I've been dealing with a strange rear end noise on my Bus, and am tearing my 
hear out trying to figure out what it is.  Symptoms: 
Rumble-rumble-squeak-squeak noise over level ground, clunk-clunk over bumps; 
noise only on driver's side rear.  So far, I have replaced the wheel 
bearings and both CVs on that side, but the noise is still there.  I've 
checked the shock mounts and all the suspension fittings, and all are tight. 
  I have not checked the torsion bar, but there is no grease leaking out of 
any place near it.  The rear wheel does not have any play in it (wiggled 
side-to-side, up-and-down), the brake shoes are adjusted correctly, and the 
axle nut is on tight.  Bentley does not help much with troubleshooting this 
sort of thing, and I've already replaced the parts than Muir suggests.

I'd really hate to have to bend over and take it to a mechanic, but I'm at 
my wits' end.  Any help from The List?

Thanks in advance....
