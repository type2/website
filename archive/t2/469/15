Subject: Can someone help Chris Renz?

Hey folks... I'm posting this on behalf of Chris Renz ("aircooled 
chris").

As you may remember, the sale of Chris's yellow '76 Westy (with a dead 
engine) fell through, and he was stuck with it 1 week before he moved 
to Minnesota.  He found a used engine on the cheap, and towed the lot 
over to Buslab in an attempt to get it running well enough to drive to 
Wisconsin, where he could store it at his folks' place.

I just spoke with him on the phone, and got this update on his Bus:

The engine idles and runs, but leaks oil badly.  It also smokes out the 
tailpipe badly.  Maybe rings are shot.  Shop checked out a few things, 
noted that lower head bolts were a little loose, re-torqued them.  
Upper bolts might still be loose.

...and how his appeal for help.  He has to leave again Monday, so he 
has just a couple of days to do SOMETHING with this Bus, either a 
last-ditch attempt to get it running (anyone out there in SFBA who is a 
good mechanic willing to lend a hand?), or sell it quickly (at a huge 
loss).

If there is anyone in the San Francisco Bay Area who can help Chris 
out, please call him on his cell phone at +1 415 706 7825.
