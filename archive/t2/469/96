They would probably stick their pressure-lube gizmo into the drain
opening, block the rest of the hole with their fingers, blast away until
the dial says that something like the proper amount of lube has gone
through the nozzle, and the jam the drain plug back in place before too
much of the fluid drains back out.  Never mind the fluid that dripped into
the drain pan during the process!

That "technician" has to move 20 cars through the place in an hour.  He's
not going to take an extra minute to find a special tool.
