There was a heater--just sold on E-Bay--that looked very much the
same--and was mounted pretty neatly--

Whatever it is--wherever it came from--it looks like it would work
well---
Buy big--and be able to the option of cranking it down--
Buy small and cheap-- and wish you had a bigger capacity heater----

This is definitely a catalyt heater and not stock. To my opinion it's
oversize for a van. Go to an RV or camping supplier and they should be
able to help you. Is there a company name on the sticker, and can you
contact them?

Hey guys; 
Can you help me identify a heater? Is this stock? or did someone add
this later? I have no literature on this. 
My van is a '78 west conversion. see:
