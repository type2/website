Subject: Re: [T2] Wal Mart oil change (was Re: [T2] GL4 vs. GL5)

Better Story--on the same subject---

Across the street from my first location of my shop--just south of
O'hare field--was a jiffy lube---
And one afternoon  an old friend--and not involved in trucks at
all---just stopped in with his 3 month old Mercury Cougar---
He finally wound up asking me about some oil leaking problems he had
developed with his new car---
It seems that two days prior, he had been
across the street--a spontaneous thing--and got his oil changed.
It had been dripping since then.
I crawled under the front end--with wrench in hand--and the plug
spun---hmm---

I jacked the front end up--wanted to get a closer look--
Somehow--the goofs at Jiffy Lube screwed down the plug so tight ( I
still can't believe anyone is this stupid ) that the spot welds inside
the pan broke loose--and the plug was just spinning in circles--

I told him--get back over there with the receipt and tell them to
replace the pan---
Phooey--what a crummy job--the engine had to either be jacked up a
foot--or the engine yanked---

These places never cease to amaze the heck out of me--how do they stay
in business??

The tale of all tales is the new bugs require 15 / 50---or 15 / 40.
The idiots that buy them don't read the book--take the car to an oil
change specialist--and get 10/30--
The first thing they do is bring the car back to VW and want to know why
their engine is rattling---VW service writer first thing asked them if
they had their oil just changed somewhere --besides there.

The resolve is simple--

Don't these places know??
Or have a book of recommended oils for different vehicles??

Crazy Stuff--
