Saw a Peugeot once with a brand new cast allow oil pan and yes, the brand 
new drain plug threads stressed and have to be turned out all the way with 
a wrench. And yes, with the appropriate new bright slices around the head 
of the new drain plug from the Vise Grips from the first install, but it 
only cost $19.95 so is was cheap, thank God for small favors.
