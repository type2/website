Jason,

The design is that they should fail open.  IF the spring is in place and
not broken.  IF the joints the flaps hinge on are not rusted.

If you release the cable from the attachment to the flaps and rotate it by
hand you can tell if the spring is working and the joints are free.  the
thermostat attachment should be rotated away from you toward the front of
the bus when the engine is cold and should be vertical when the engine is
warm.

Before you reattach the cable look at the thermostat cartridge under and
between cylinders one and two.  It should be pulled up tight closed when
the engine is cold.  I have seen many cables stretched to the cold
position and attached on buses with defective thermostats.  This means the
flaps are closed all the time and the engine temps are very high.
Replacing the cartridge will restore thermostat function.  The original
bus cartridge is not available but a bug cartridge can be adapted.

                             OOK!
