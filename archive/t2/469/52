***************************************************

I pulled out my original 1979 'Warranty & Maintenance"
booklet for the 79 Bus.
The booklet covers the:

Beetle
Convertible
Type2
Campmobile

The book shows that at 45,000 miles to "check manual
trans fluid" and to check every 15,000 miles
thereafter. Never in all of the scheduled intervals
does the booklet say to change the trans fluid. 
After 60,000 miles the book just repeats at 15,000
intervals and still says to just check the fluid
level.

This is the official VW Warranty & Maintenance book
that came with the Bus in 1979.

Bently may recommends changing at 30,000 miles...but
VW did not.
