Ring....Ring, "Doktor Tim, how can I help you?"

Quicky Lube, "High Doktor, this is Fergus at Quicky lube. We got a VW here 
cause you told the owner the lube was foul in the tranny and needed 
changing so I found the drain plug and finally got it out with the Vice 
Grips. I finally found the fill plug but I can't get the Vice Grips on it 
so can we borrow your spezial tool."

DT "Did you check the Bentley??"

QL "No, it's a VW."

DT "Don't you have any manuals??"

QL "Well, they don't go back this far."

DT "Why did you agree to service a vehicle you are unequipped to do properly??"

QL "Hey, I did a thousand oil changes last month what do you mean I am 
unequipped??"

DT "Thank you for calling." CLICK!!

This happens several times per year. Shops call me for free advise and free 
tool rental so they can break my rice bowl at my expense.
