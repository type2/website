Hi Volks,

The European 12V socket is used in a wide range of accesories. Things like
accesorie lights, refrigerators, recharging for cell phones and other
appliances, air pumps, walkman, electric heaters and many more things can be
plugged in.

Where do you Americans plug in your appliances while in your car? Or don't
you ever charge your cell phone while driving or need an extra light in the
car ever?

 Hi Frank,

 Quarter inch aperature approximately centered under the glove box,
 right?

 That's a european 12V accessory outlet.  I'm told higher-end BMW
 touring motorcycles share the same system. Jamie Rivers has a original
 Coleman 12V air compressor that plugs into it, it's the only accessory
 I have ever seen for that plug.

 Happy trails,
