If it looks milky it's contaminated with water.
If it looks dark it's contaminated by cooked hydrocarbons.
If it feels thin it's contaminated with sheared polymers.
If it smells different than new it's contaminated by strange substances 
formed by breakdown of the lube.
It it's leaking like a sieve the seals have been worn by contamination.

Clean SPEC lube at all times will double and triple the life compared to 
once per decade changes.
