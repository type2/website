Boy, talk about cheap. That's $15 for the lube, $5 for equipment financing, 
$5 for rent and utilities, and $5 for the mechanic and owner to share. What 
assholes they are to not go bankrupt so you won't call them rip offs. If 
you had a reasonable equipped shop to service T-II's properly, how much 
would you charge??? How much extra if the baby needs new shoes, too, over 
and above the business overhead???

That's fine until Wal-Mart moves in next door and only charges $20... ;-(
