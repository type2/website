Subject: VW Compressor made by HATLAPA

they don't make compressors any more, but made VW powered compressors 
for a long time.
I know of another one on a trailer.
Nowadays they are no longer used because they are too noisy.

See pictures at "The Samba" under "Other VW"

Pictures also show my 77 crew cab (bought last december with an original 
12000 miles on it).

I have VW engines out of fire pumps, harvesters, generators and also 
know of one in a high pressure pump for filling gas botlles for diving.
I am always on the lookout.
