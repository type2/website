Subject: VW Sighting !! Food Workers Union Applaud !!

I cut this out of the paper the second day the food
workers decided to go on strike..

I think its great they can applaud a VW Thing, after
being on strike and all.. LOL

To me the only thing that interested me was to see a
VW owner just gracefully passing by..
