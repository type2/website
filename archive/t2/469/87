Jennifer,

Oil light fixed is primary importance.  

Working *new* windshield wipers...bus might run good, but if you
can't see where you are going...well...really bad.

Check all brake/turn signal lights....ya want the other guys to see you as 
well...

It would be nice if the heater worked!

It's always the little things that make the trip nicer....

Cheers, dave
