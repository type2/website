No, the engine is stuck with the limitations of the size of the cooling
passages.  The fan is putting out as much as they can take at middle RPM.
More than that and the fan spins faster, but can't push air through the
passages.

The resaon for this is that the engine needs maximum cooling over a range
of engine speeds, so the engineers overdesigned the fan so that it could
provide cooling at all RPMS and then choke off the flow with flaps or the
engine passages themselves as needed.  When you choke off the flow, the
power requirements of the fan actually decrease, so there is no power
penalty for overdesigning the fan.
