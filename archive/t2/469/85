From my brief observations of VW engines I've noticed:

- they produce maximum torque around 3,000rpm but don't sustain it for very
long
- they don't rev very high
- they have ignition systems that generate weak spark at high rpm

It seems that the maximum torque is at the point where the engine is
breathing the best. It's drawing the maximum amount of air into each
cylinder.

Increasing bore will increase the HP. The 1700, 1800 and 2000cc engines all
have the same basic HP, have 94mm pistons and bear this out.
