This is interesting.  Since nasty effects like stud pulling are a function
of CHT, it looks like driving by the oil temperature might yield a
situation where you could have the heads at dangerous temperatures before
the temp rise shows up on the oil temp gauge.  Looks like a CHT gauge is a
pretty important thing to have if you push the limits.
