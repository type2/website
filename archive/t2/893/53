I've decided not to go in Radio Shack again unless absolutely in an  emergency.  You used to be able to get all kinds of small parts  there.  Now their selection is awful.  They are trying to  compete with the cell phone companies and could care less about  hobbyists anymore.  They've lost their core comepetency and won't  survive IMHO.  Digikey is cool. And I like Parts Express.    Cheers...KR

They're about $3, but Radio Shack is overpriced imo.
