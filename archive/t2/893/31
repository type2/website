They are hard to find in the US, I brought tons of them from my trip in 
France, if you go to home depot , you may find some equivalent but with 
one end only.

>Hey, guys.  I've found something better than splicing or  crimping.  NAPA sells these nice connectors.  You put a wire  in each end and it has a screw that runs down and tightens each of them  to a  center post.  Works great.  I think they're two or  three bucks for a pair.  But I was really pleased with them.   It makes a good conection and it's hard to pull them apart.  I  tried!  I may never crimp again.   Might try a couple and see  if you like them.  Cheers....KR
