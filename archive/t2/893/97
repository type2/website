	If it's tolerable to mention French cars to some extent  ...  ;-)   -
that same friend who'd seized the Splittie in Ghana bought in mid-'64 
a brand-new 403   -  a tax-waiver perk for Yanks returning home from 
Peace Corps service.  He'd stopped in Paris on the way home, gone 
into a main Peugeot showroom, and been proudly offered the 
much-trumpeted just-unveiled new model 404.  "Forget it  -  I want 
the proven 403 which impressed me in Africa" he said.  "But look at 
these Pinin Farina tailfins, sir" the salesmen gushed.  "Unproven  - 
get me a new 403" insisted this unusually far-sighted Yank.  They 
wrote him off as a nutter, and with some difficulty found the last 
new 403 which he'd just got off the ship when I met him.
	If you had the new VW water-cooled bus pushed at you in 1983 
and replied "no, I want the culmination of 4 decades of air-cooled 
development  -  get me the old model", would that be so crazy?  Well 
anyhow it may qualify as bus content  :-)
