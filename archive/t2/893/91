Subject: [T2] Bay Windshield crack while washing

Grrrrr.  Was washing my 78 VW T2 ASI/Riviera today in
the sun.  Temp 88 where I was.  Soaped the windshield,
and then started rinsing it when...PINK.  I could hear
the sound of the crack over the flow of water, and
immediately noticed the new vertical line.
   
Is this common?  This windshield was one of the first
fixes I did to this T2 7 years ago.  New window rubber
from West Coast Metrics.  Two of us installed it.  We
did have some rust prep to perform after the old
windshield was removed, but I helped sand the primer
myself.  I am certain we did not leave any `fragments`
for the glass or rubber to lean against.  Perhaps the
windshield had a hairline crack or chip.
