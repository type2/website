Subject: '78 sliding door rubber question.

I have a relatively intact seal around my sliding door, however there is a
terrible draft that comes in from the bottom.  The part of the seal that is
mounted to the body seems to be intact and in good shape.

 

My question is, is there a corresponding piece that mounts to the bottom of
the sliding door?  It looks as though something used to be there as there
appears to be some remnants of rubber and glue but I don't want to order a
whole kit for the slider if I don't need the whole thing.

 

Any info?

 

Cheers,

Duke
