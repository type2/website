Hey, guys.  I've found something better than splicing or  crimping.  NAPA sells these nice connectors.  You put a wire  in each end and it has a screw that runs down and tightens each of them  to a  center post.  Works great.  I think they're two or  three bucks for a pair.  But I was really pleased with them.   It makes a good conection and it's hard to pull them apart.  I  tried!  I may never crimp again.   Might try a couple and see  if you like them.  Cheers....KR


   Can I splice the
wires?  If not, how do we redo the stereo wiring all the way to the back of
the bus?  We've never done any wiring work before.  Best left to a pro?
