Remember to disconnect the battery when you rewire the + wire or .... 
you'll remember the 4th of July !!! (well I did the mistake .... )
If you change the radio with a modern one , the speakers has 4 wires ( 2 
+ and  2-).  I don't know if its your case , but in my 81 Vanagon with 
the original radio setup, they were only 3 wires (2 + and  1 -) , 3 
wires are not going to work with a modern radios which required an 
independent - wire. You may need to add an addition wire to your speakers.
Also new radio/cd comes with a harness  which should be long enough to 
be attach to your old wires (the ones they cut). Actually I won't crimps 
them , I would sold them and protect the junction with those heat shrink 
wrap tube to protect the sold. Most harness could be plug/unplug to the 
back of the radio.
