while this is in the archives, someone may as well come out and say it 
right away:

they look great, do it.

but, watch out for too much powdercoating where your lugs hold onto the 
wheel, as ive heard that with too much extra powdercoating here your 
lugs can back off/loosen while driving.

I think others have mentioned just drilling that powdercoating off when 
you get them back, just to clean up where they fit snug against the wheel.

YMMV
