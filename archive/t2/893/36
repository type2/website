Hi Frank,

Isn't Dixie Bus also the same weekend as the Dan Emmet Festival this  
year?  I was impressed by the COVW vent in 2004 but last year decided  
to give Mt Vernon a look-see and my family much enjoyed the music and  
arts festival. It was a slice of pure Americana that we don't get to  
experience all that often. (Whereas my family will tell you that we  
go to PLENTY enough VW shows.)
