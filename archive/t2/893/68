Subject: No more AM radio

 Thanks for all of your input, guys.  I think I'm going to go with Darren's idea and stick the stereo in the glove box (I don't use it anyway) and then I can use any stereo I want (namely Josh's Sirius Radio so I can set it to radio margaritaville).  I think we'll convert the old slot into, I dunno.  A tissue box holder?  I don't need more gauges.  They just give more reason to worry.  
  Also, we just saw our first bus since moving to South Carolina.  It was driving down Old Trolley Road in Summerville.  We got really excited and honked and waved like crazy, but ended up just freaking out the teenage kid driving it.  Bright yellow/gold.  Belong to any of you??
