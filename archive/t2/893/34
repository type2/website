My '73  Devon has a carb with no significant markings except a

hello R???      That would be the brazilian weber  , I have a shelf full of 
those things. when they got wore out they were just  wore out , You probably 
would be better off replacing with a solex,    you will need to see if it is 
dual port or single port and I am assuming that  this is a type 1 motor  later
