Didn't someone recently post on the Samba about providing the wrong M-code
to them and getting an inaccurate birth certificate?

To me, if I have to provide the info, it's a little silly and pointless. I
want them to tell ME something.

"Yes, Doctor, I know my new baby is blond and blue, but please put brown
hair and eyes down on the birth certificate."

It just doesn't seem right.
