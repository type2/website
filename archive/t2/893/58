Doesn't look so bad right now (at 4:20pm in CA). heehee

I'm thinking I won't be using the 91 after all. 57 to the 10 should do it.
That'll save some time.

Update on my trip:
My son wants to come along! He's 15 and our interests have diverged quite a
bit the past few years. I'm really surprised he's willing to spend a couple
days of just the two of us. I'm stoked!

Of course, it's purely for selfish reasons he wants to go... He'll get to
spend a couple weeks hanging out with the friends he left behind when we
moved to Colorado. But I'll forget about that for now.... =)
