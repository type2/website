Did you do this check cylinder #1?

Since the piston comes to the top twice you have to check the valves to see if they are both closed (about to start the power stroke).

If it's 180 degrees out, then the drive gear at the bottom can have been assembled backwards. It's it's some other amount, no.

Also, if you have a beetle dizzy the mark on the distributor body will not be in the right spot for a Type 4 engine.

If you want to rely on the rotor to indicate TDC you should assembly all the parts properly.

The engine runs better with the vacuum can but it will still run 85% (plucked from the air) as well without it.
