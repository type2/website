Several years ago I had a Vons market discount card.
I used an old phone number and the name 'Ben Pon'.
Around two(?) years ago Vons/Albertsons/Ralphs employees
went on strike.  I quit shopping at those stores then.

The only thing I miss about that is the cashier saying,
"Thank you Mr.Pon; you saved $2.47 today."     :-)
