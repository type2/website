Since it's Friday....

There is one RS I won't go into anymore. I went in to buy something, they
didnt have it, so I thought I would go ahead and get some replacement
batteries so I didnt have to make another stop. I'm holding a $5 bill
in my hand. The clerk/jerk/manager asks for my phone number.

Me:  "It's unlisted."
Her: "Could I have your address?"
Me:  "Why do you need my address for a cash transaction?"
Her: "Our computer system is down and we just need that information for
      receipt purposes in case you need to make a return."
Me:  "Why do you need my address for a cash transaction?"
Her: "Sir, we just need that information."
Me:  "Ok. 123 ANY STREET"
Her: "Sir, we need your REAL address."
Me:  "That IS my real address."
Her: "No, it's not."
Me:  "You know, I can get these batteries and Wal-Mart for cheaper and
      THEY don't need to know my address!"
Her: "Well, I suggest you go to Wal-Mart then."
Me:  "Fine!"

And I left the batteries on the counter and walked out.
The batteries were a LOT cheaper at Wal-Mart too.
Unbelievable that they turned down a CASH sale over an address.

Bus content: I removed my barely working tape deck in my bus.
             I'm going to use the opening for more gauges in
             the future. The next nice radio I install, I will
             mount in my glove box so it is out of sight. I dont
             remember where I was someone do that, but I liked
             the idea. Most theives wont want what they cant see.
