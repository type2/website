Actually, it is on early engines.  Late distributors have #3 the same as
the others.

Not a problem.  The SVDA has no #3 retard, so you just rearrange the plug
wires so that the rotor is pointing at the correct cylinder when it in
firing position.  The orientation of the drive won't make any difference.

The tiny downside to this is that the rotor won't point to the notch on
the distributor body when #1 is in firing position for valve adjustment.
I never open the distributor for this anyway.  I just rotate the engine to
TDC and wiggle the #1 rockers.  If they don't wiggle, I rotate the engine
once and they will be in position for adjustment.
