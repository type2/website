Problem solved! I actually tried to nurse the bus home. I made it half
way before the engine died...coasted into a parking lot. Sat for about
an hour fuming. Decided to start tinkering.  Pulled bulb, nothing wrong.
Pulled every fuse, cause one of them when blown makes the battery light
come on. All fuses ok. Looked at the voltage regulator, pulled the plug
connector off, inspected, reinstalled.   Now the battery light and EGR
light come on. Got the bus push started and everything seems ok. Slow
charging the battery now. One of those wires on the plug is blue and
must be the same blue wire that connects to the battery light bulb.
Somehow moving that wire/plug got me juice again.
