I don't know about that.  I don't like the idea of having to open the glove box to change stations.
Theivery is not so much a problem around here.  And how many guages does a man need??  Cheers...KR

"I removed my barely working tape deck in my bus.
I'm going to use the opening for more gauges in
the future. The next nice radio I install, I will
mount in my glove box so it is out of sight. I dont
remember where I was someone do that, but I liked
the idea. Most theives wont want what they cant see."
