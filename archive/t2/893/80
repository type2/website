Subject: part # 022131519

working on my 75 FI type IV engine code ED and came across this part #
022131519.  (-at-) the top it says MHO 3900060530.  the last 0 is a maybe can't
tell if is real or just a bit of alumium.  anyone know what this part is or
does?  it's two what look like vacuum nipples where not attached to
anything.  it is/was located top of the block partially hidden under the
intake runners.


TIA,
jeremiah
