Subject: still with a dizzy problem

hi ther again
i have a 78 transporter 2.0 FI and i have the  dizzy drive gear out of the
engine and i believe i have found TDC on the engine and if i were to put the
drive gear in at the proper 12 degrees to the case line, the rotor will
still not line up with the notch on the distributor if the notch is
postioned correctly at 4:00.  is it possible that the distributor was taken
apart and  put together wrong too? is it even nessesacry that the dirive
gear be put in exactly that way.  could i just put it in to where the notch
would be at 4:00 and line the rotor up with the notch. i do not have any
vaccum device on the dizzy either.  i dunno if i should or  shouldn't?     i
could really use some advice and help.   thanks.
