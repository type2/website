Thanks for the link.  After my own desert trip description, I now see
how a narrative should be written.
IIRC, he gave Peregrine away.  Its only after reading this story that I
really understand how hard that was for him.  I hope he finds a new bay
where he moved (New England?) and reappears on list.
