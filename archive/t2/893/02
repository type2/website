Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor...backwards

I looked around on the 'net (google), and found several additional
discussions of this.

There are only really two possible problems (and one benefit) to having
the dist. mounted off 180 degrees:

Problem 1: I had thought Cyl 3 was retarded (advanced?) a few degrees to
make it run cooler. This might only be on later engines, thought. This is
a '65.

Problem 2: No room for the vacuum unit if I want to put in a SVDA (which I
do...I hate the hesitation with this $#(-at-)$#(-at-) 009 dist)

Benefit 1: The condensor and screw is very easy to access. ;)

You can see the dist. in this somewhat dated picture of the engine:
