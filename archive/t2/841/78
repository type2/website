horse hair repro cushions from WW, I've been able to drive 750 mile, 13
hr. days with ZERO leg/back fatigue. VW designed those seats just right
and all they need is a little rebuild if the cushions have disintegrated.

I recall an interesting quote in a VW history book.  VW was contemplating
opening a factory in the US to build aircooled bugs.  They sought out
suppliers for various components.  One seat manufacturer declined to bid
on building seats to the VW design, stating "You guys don't have seats in
your cars, you have *furniture*!"

I agree that a properly rebuilt VW seat is very comfy.  I used foam in
place of horsehair, but the thing that really makes it nice is the springs
underneath.  They provide far better suspension than any other seats I've
had.
