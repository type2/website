Hi Mike.  OK, explain this free stuff to  someone who hasn't ever used a satellite dish.  Do you mean  absolutely free or free once you pay somebody some basic fee?  I  didn't know you could tap into any satellite networks for free anymore  like you once could with the big dishes.  If so, I may have to  pick up one of those babies.  Cheers...KR

  BTW, you can still take your receiver out on the road and get 
  everthing but national networks for free, and not buy a fancy portable 
  dish- got a dish with LNB and post arm (easily adaptable to a ground 
  plate) for $15 on *-bay.
