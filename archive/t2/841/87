ok,

I've had enough<grin>.  Terry, I suspect that you(like me) are not that 
young and can remember when products from Japan were regarded in the same 
way as a lot of products coming in from China now.

What China needs is Dr. W. Edwards Deming, the man that taught the 
Japanese how to make better products than in the U.S.....so that now we 
have *lots* of Japanese cars that rival the best that the "former" big 3 can do.
Quality *and* cheap(relatively).  


People pick the corporate survivors with their wallets.

(bus content)
Why can't I still buy a 1978 VW bus for $20,000(2005 dollars)?  Because of 
two things...the  U.S. guys figured out how to make them better, and #2 
because the power plants were legislated out of exsistence by the clean 
air act....skip the numerous other reasons, those are the main two that 
strike me as being most probable.

Remember the comment from Detroit when they took new bugs apart every year 
and marveled at the production tolerances?  See the reference to Deming 
above.

It's what we in the U.S. did to thousands(if not millions) of products 
from other countries over the years....make them better and ****cheaper****.
Sometimes they weren't necessarily better, but they did start out cheaper.

So here is one to ponder....why don't the Chinese make light bulbs and 
sell them to us?...and why are they still so expensive?  Because the light 
bulb factory has one guy on the factory floor with a bicycle who waits for
a red light to go off which indicates that a robotic manufacturing cell 
has a problem....he gets on his bicycle and goes and fixes it....so the 
same question...why are they still so expensive?...

<sigh> lots more to it than that, so no replies expected....just earlt 
morning coffee ramblings.

Cheers, dave
(who bought a "japanese" car last year for the first time 
ever....instead of a Ford)

This all happened for one reason, prior to NAFTA
 
 Labor unions high wages, and low labor rates in third world Japan at the
 time.  
 
 Then it the labor force got smart (er) in other mud holes.
