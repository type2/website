If you're looking for a split window bus that would be through '67, not
'69. '68 on up are the Bay Window buses.

If you're just looking to stay with the type-1 motor then it would be
through '71 (and '71 is quite often considered to be the "best of both
worlds -- with the type-1 motor plus power assist front disc brakes). '68
to '71 are Bay Window with Type-1 motor. '72 - '79 are Bay Window with
type-4 motor.
