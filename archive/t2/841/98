Hey Nemo, I can confirm that the later driver seats
will indeed slide right into the rails on your 70. I
have 78 front seats installed in my 71. However, what
won't work is the release mechanism that allows the
seat to slide back and forth.  You actually have to
bend down the little "tabs" on the rail which accept
the "teeth" on the release mechanism on the bottom of
the seat. What you end up with is a seat that slides
forward and back but has no stop to keep the seat from
sliding when you don't it to. I just put the seat
where I wanted it, and screwed a bolt through the rail
to keep it from sliding.
As for the passenger side, as stated, there are no
rails. So I just cut out the part of the metal seat
pedestal from the parts 78 that has the rails. Then I
took that metal piece and drilled and bolted it on
right on top of the 71 seat pedestal (I had to cut off
the little "tabs" which held the back bar on the
original seat.) So, the passenger seat actually slide
forward back and stops just as it was supposed to.
