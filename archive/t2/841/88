Subject: O2 Sensor  82 Westy

Just so you know.  My wrench told me that the O2 sensor had nothing to  do 
with fuel economy and not to bother to change it or test it to see if it was  
working.   WRONG!! I failed a smog test with NOX emissions to the  moon.  The 
place was going to charge me 90 bucks to scope it out and  determine why.  I 
said  O2 sensor?  They said $50 bucks plus 40  to install.   So I went to NAPA 
and got a Bosch universal sensor?for  $21, screwed it in and guess what.  I 
passed like a champ.  Now I am  seeing if it will improve my 13mpg to something 
closer to 16 or 17..  Duh,  you live and learn.
