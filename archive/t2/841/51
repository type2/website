Subject: RE: [T2] South Carolina, and California vehicle plates

If you get a bus w/ CA plates and current
registration, you should be able to drive with the POs
registration for 30 days or so if you have the title
and bill of sale. If you try to register it in your
name in CA, they'll probably want smog...
