Subject: South Carolina, and California vehicle plates

I am interested in buying a vehicle in SC and or Calif.... I am wondering 
about a temporary plate. 

Is there a plate/ permit that allows me to hop in a drive it home? 

Where do I ask about the requirements of such? 

What is it called as I couldn't find it on the dmv site
