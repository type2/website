Subject: Re: [T2] My First Oil Change

    No Flame War was intended. Please forgive my spelling short comings, and
although my 20 year old jacks may be out dated. They were top of the line
when I built my shop and bought them. I have now retired, but the jacks are
still going strong, the result of buying quality first. I can even remember
when RCA meant USA. Hello can you say NAFTA?
    I do wish the spirit of my post would be kept in mind. "Safety first,
always"! Level ground, Brand X Taiwan jacks and stands not withstanding.
