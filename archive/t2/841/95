Hi Ray,

IIRC there are no "rails" on the Pre-74 passenger seat. Just a set of  
slots that the base notches into.

Tonight's "Franklin Night".... we're hoping to get the engine more or  
less done. Only thing we don't have ready to go is an exhaust; we're  
planning on using a bastardized 75-78 with the mufflers attached  
directly to the exhaust manifolds (no heater boxes, but we do have a  
BA-6 heater).

TTYL,

</Greg>
