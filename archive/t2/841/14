He must have been talking about a splitty driving on the highway. :-)

Inexpensive yes but I wouldn't call them cheap. After installing the horse hair repro cushions from WW, I've been able to drive 750 mile, 13 hr. days with ZERO leg/back fatigue. VW designed those seats just right and all they need is a little rebuild if the cushions have disintegrated.

Splits are indeed cool but even out here is smog exempt, mostly rust-free california they are virtually extinct like dinosaurs so I have to enjoy them at the car shows. Every year btw, it's the same owners with same vehicles.

Apart from being impractical to drive every day in stock form, I also think they are overpriced both as rust buckets and restored vehicles.

If popularity is any measure, the baywindow group on Samba is just as popular as the split and beetle groups thanks due in part to the accessibility and enjoyability of the baywindow bus. It's a great time to own one.
