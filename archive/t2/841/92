Hey guys  I had a late vanagon towed in last week that the dealer said needed 
an air flow and O2 sensor. This thing was running so rich it fouled the plugs 
and oil.  I replaced the O2 sensor and plugs and it cured it's problem.   
There wasn't anything wrong with the air flow. later and have fun  mark Dearing
