Subject: Re: [T2] South Carolina, and California vehicle plates

Jamie, is it unregistered?  This "keep your plates" nonsense is new to 
me - there was some list talk awhile back on that...  As far as I know 
CA has no such caveat - so if it's registered, just go.  If it's not 
registered, with title you can get a one day "moving permit" - BUT they 
might have some issue if you're not the registered owner with id - so 
you might need the aid of the owner and if the title is not clean and 
current or properly non-opped, they'll undoubtedly want any back fees to 
be paid.

You want to fly low, I wouldn't mention it's goin' out of state, DMV is 
such a pain and if you're outa here why worry about what CA ultimately 
wants?  If you're in CA, a stop at a podunk DMV with no lines is the way 
to go to fish for info.  The 800 lines are a forever wait and then I can 
never seem to get an answer without pulling teeth on "theoretical" 
question when trying to figure out how best to achieve my goal legally 
and with the least expense/hassle.  These days I tend to keep it simple 
for the good folks - "This vehicle is non-opped but I need to move it on 
such and such a day".  No extra info, and keep the eh's down.  ;-)
