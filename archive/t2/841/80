I can't find it on the CA DMV site either.  I do know that they issue such
a thing and it's called something like a "temporary transportation
permit" or something similar.  The requirement is probably insurance.  No
smog on '74 or earlier vehicles, and a temporary permit probably doesn't
require it.
