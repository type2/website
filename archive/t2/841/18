Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Vacuum Hose

John,

Go to a place that has truck parts (big-rigs). Ask for 15/32" vacuum
line. They probably won't have it but 1/2" works OK. Measure what you
need before you go and get a few feet extra just in case. (Or you can
check the archives for the exact length you'll need) You'll most
likely need new clamps too. Since the line and the engine are out too,
you might as well check the one way valve is working correctly
(attempt to blow through it in both directions, air should only pass
one way - in the direction of the arrow), and replace if necessary.

hope that helps
peace
