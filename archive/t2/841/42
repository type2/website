Subject: Re: [T2] My First Oil Change

If you have no reason to spin the rear wheels and live on a hill, get a 
pair of ramps (I like the plastic waffle ramps (Wallymart), don't rust 
and won't dig into blacktop like the U-shaped steel ramps, park up hill, 
set the ramps in the rear and drive back onto them.  Block the front 
wheels.  Then your bus will be more level for the oil change, and you 
can do other stuff like adjust the clutch, check the heater flaps 
operation, or clean the battery to starte terminal..

  with Dual Carbs.... Where should I jack the rear end up at? I
  have a hydraulic floor jack and my drive way is on a hill so I
  have to jack the rear end up to even get my arm under the
  exhaust."
