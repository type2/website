Hey Dave  I dont agree with that :)    Better brakes OK but only on 71 and up 
with disc, more power, well that can be fixed at cheaper cost than a bay on a 
splittie.  Now tell her about the rust on bays   They get it just as bad or 
worse,  you ever see the center pivot rust off the front axle, I have many 
times, never on a splittie.  how about ball joints breaking , doesn;t happen on 
splitties  unless some dummie has put a bay front axle on it. They all have 
their pros and cons . I personally don't own a bay I just work on them :) I do own 
7 splitties and 2  WBX vanagons,one westy,and a sycro .   Bays ride better 
but only if you fix the seats , the splitties are way cooler and are for the 
most part easier to work on.   To each his own  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
