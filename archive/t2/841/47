I've not been on the AAC board. I'm active (somewhat) on the DAC board. The
DAC board has an "Austin Gang" section (and sections for the other gangs as
well).

The DAC board can be ... rough ... at times. Keep your kids out of the
"unrated" section. I keep forgetting to ask Mike (the board 'god') if he
can restrict access to it based on "group" membership so it's viewable only
by those who request access. There's no X-rated stuff but the language and
innuendo are very adult.

The rest of the board is great. For sale section, problem help section,
show your ride section, etc. Plus a separate section for each of the AC
'Gangs" to post region specific stuff.

I'm not a big fan of forums in general, but some don't do email lists at
all and I like to keep in touch with both groups.
