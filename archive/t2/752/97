Hey Guys   I have spent this week helping bus people going to Booneroo   You 
couldnt pay me enough to get in that mess I guess I'm getting old and I hope 
smarter  I saw a little of everything  1st a water pump on a vanagon, then a CV 
repair on another, yesterday 3 guys from Conn. towed in with a 74 westy that 
made the god awfulest noise   no pilot bearing bad clutch and for toppers the 
guy walks in and hands me what was left of a valve spring and valve .  So this 
guy drops the motor and removes the head so that I can replace the guide and 
valve for him.  I left yesterday at 9 with him buttoning it up. They were gone 
this morning . I hope they make it .   Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
