Subject: Re: [T2] Automatic Transmission Leak

Oh my, I got the leak fixed a few days ago and everything was kosher. 
Karl sent me the info below (thanks again) and it all seemed to go 
perfectly... today, however, my van decided to get stuck in first gear 
(this was over 100 miles after the repair). I drove about ten miles at 
ten mph (yes, it took an hour!) on Route 66 in a terrential downpour 
and dropped the rig back off at the mechanic who replaced the seals.

Does anyone know what the second gear brake piston does? And if you do 
know, could it have been damaged or misplaced during the replacement of 
the seals? Do I have an unrelated transmission problem? Will I someday 
drive a domestic minivan?

Thanks in advance. I'm eternally grateful to Type2.com.

Herb.
