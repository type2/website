It's fact. Synthetic gets out places dino oil doesn't. Also, it
doesn't appear to "scab" (gunk up) at openings like dino oil does.

I ran 1000 miles with Castrol's synthetic blend and developed a leak
at the rear main seal that wasn't there before.

However, I think the benefits are worth the risk. After all, if the
synthetic found a hole, that hole would have soon enough started
letting dino oil out as well. Just a matter of "when".
