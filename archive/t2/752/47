Subject: T4 Engine pull tips

List,

Doing my first type 4 pull and replant this weekend.  I've pulled/installed
type 1's by myself before.

I gave my Bentley to a needy youth earlier, so will not have that, but I will
check archives for already posted "lists".

Just scrounging for anyone's website, link to a post or good wishes.

79 Cal engine with aftermarket muffler welded on to stock 79 exhaust.

Thanks,

Billy
Visalia Ca, to M'Boro, TN in 7 days.
79 deluxe passenger (the future)
76 weekender (to yard if no one wants body)
