Subject: Timing and Dwell Questions

Hi,

I've driven my bus about 400 miles now. Loving every minute of it. It
has quickly become my daily driver.

Went out today to do some basic maintenance - take a good look at the
plugs for fouling, check dwell, timing, etc.

Plugs looked good, clean, dry, slightly grey but I don't think I'm running
lean.

I've found that my dwell has changed from 44 to 52. What would this
change indicate - rubbing block wear? Yes, I did lube the distributor
shaft.

A change in dwell changes timing, correct? Is there any formula to
translate change in dwell to change in timing. I was timed at 7.5 BTDC
previously. I'm wondering if I can determine what my timing's going to
be now that the dwell has changed.

Thanks
peace!
