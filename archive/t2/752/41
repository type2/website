Well, the only "seal" in a bleed screw is the tapered seat at its tip, and
this is only sealed when the screw is tightened.

The only thing keeping the fluid from leaking past the treads is the
labyrinth effect of the threads.  This is higly dependent upon the
clearance of the threads.  If the fit is very close, leakage will be
minimal, while looser tolerances will yield more leakage.  Considering
that modern parts tend to have looser tolerances, they would leak more
past the threads.  It doesn't have anything to do with the number of
bleeders, though.

How to reduce leakage?  Heavy grease in the threads is the only thing I
can think of.  Keep in mind that petroleum grease and oils are absolute
no-nos within the brake system.  Technically the threads of the bleeder
screws are outside the system, but they are awfully close to it.  I'd feel
more comfortable if the grease used on the threads was brake grease, but I
haven't seen that in quite a while.  I don't pressure-bleed my brakes but
I do use a bit of anti-sieze on the threads of the bleeder screws just to
keep them from rusting.  Never had a problem doing this, but I am careful
to keep the stuff away from the tip of the bleeder.
