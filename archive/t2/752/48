Zach,

Classified as a "hazardus" waste material by virtually the entire world.

Your city or county trash/recycle guys will have a solution for 
you....they may have special days where they will pick up used oil and 
stuff, or like where I live, we have a hazardus waste recycling 
center(county) where I take things like that about every 6 months.

I live in the country, so if it goes on the ground, I end up with it in my 
well water later....not good at all!

Cheers, dave
