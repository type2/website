Subject: Re sealing ripped boots- any movie makeup people out there?

Got a variety of questions about wrapping my ball joints to keep out 
water and grease in.  Duct tape falls apart and lets water in. Poly tape 
is a 2" wide clear tape that is used to seal ducts; it is milky in its 
transparency and much more flexible/stretchy than package wrapping tape, 
more like electric tape.
  I got it from Sears but H.D. should have it?  The poly I first wrapped 
the joint in was heavy duty stuff left over from pouring concrete slabs.
Used Moly grease to slather over everything before wrapping.  The tape 
holds the wrapping tight, and is done to allow the rotating steering arm 
beneath the joint to continue rotating.  Yes, water could get in from 
below, but I just keep adding grease inside of the wrapping to 
discourage this.
As for silicone wraps, these just peel off as it flexes.  I suppose if 
one could get the tear clean enough, a bicycle patch with vulcanizing 
glue may work- depends how much stress it is under.  one method may be 
to put a layer of silicone over the entire joint up to the bottom 
steering arm location; let it harden, and then use a grease needle from 
below.  Anyone in the movie industry?  I always wondered if using the 
mask/makeup foam rubber material that cures like epoxy could be used- is 
it resistant to grease?
