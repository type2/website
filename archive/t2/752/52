Subject: Greetings & Oil...

Hello all,

My name is Charles, I live in Beaverton, OR., and have been lurking for 
a couple of weeks.  I have a yellow/orange '76 Westy named Whirligig 
which is fixing to become my daily driver.  I'm collecting tools & 
gaskets & such and preparing to do my first full tune-up by myself.

I'm sure I'll have many other questions, and I'm sure this question has 
been asked umpteen times, but what's the best oil I should put in it 
when I'm done?  Whirli has the original 2000cc engine w' fuel injection, 
with about 30k on it since it was rebuilt.

I've been digging through the archives, and it seems like the Castrol 
semi-synthetic 20w50 is my best bet, at least for the summer.  Would 
that be a decent choice, or should I use the high-mileage oil?  If I ate 
the extra $$ and put in full synthetic, do I need to adjust the valves 
differently or anything?  Would full synthetic be just a waste of money?

Thank you for any input,
-Charles
