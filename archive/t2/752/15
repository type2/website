Subject: Re: [T2] Automatic Transmission Leak

The transmission shifts into P, R, N, and drive. When in drive only 
first gear will engage. I thought I heard a strange rattling noise 
before the failure, but it could've been one of the million pieces of 
car junk bouncing around the cab. The fluid doesn't smell, but it was 
extremely rainy today and I couldn't inspect anything, and also the 
fluid has been changed twice in the last month. The first time I 
changed it there was a good amount of sparkly metal in the drain pan. 
It was strangely beautiful.

The leak was an ongoing problem and the fluid was often times low. I 
hate to be suspicious of my mechanic. It was the first time I ever used 
him and he seems knowlegable. But this did occur within a hundred miles 
of him servicing the transmission. I'll talk with him first thing in 
the morning.

I appreciate any other information to troubleshoot this problem. And 
yes, I will buy the big Bentley book someday.

Be well- Herb.
