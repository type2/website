You might want to do lots of archive-reading on this issue, as it's been
hashed over very thoroughly.  I use Mobil 1.  For summer I'd likely use
straight 30 if I couldn't afford full synthetic, but then I make mostly long
trips... it's all so subjective!

You may discover some new oil leaks if you fill up with synthetic.  Be sure to
do a leak check: start the engine, verify that you have oil pressure, let it
warm up, rev it a few times, look underneath while it's running and verify
nothing's dripping.

Cheers,
