David,
Here is everything you need to know:

http://www.ratwell.com/technical/FuelHoses.html

I have a 78 and I found every hose on the diagram towards the bottom of
Richard's page.  I used FI and clamps at every single junction.

Change every single hose or your bus will BURN!... really ;)

enjoy,
Mike
