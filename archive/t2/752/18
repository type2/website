Subject: Re: [T2] Ball joint boots only?

Wish I had done this. Replacing just the boot was a PITA. Wonder if you 
could clean the boot enough to brush a coating of silicon over it and have 
it stick?

I greased the boot tear with a needle tip, as well as through the top
plug.
Then wrapped polyethylene over and around the arm, followed by poly tape
criss-crossed to allow movement but keep out water and keep grease in.
 Think that was over 50K mi ago.
