I just purchased the Gilmore kit and will be installing it in the
next few weeks=2E  From the sound of it, it could very well take a
week or two as well.  I'll post pictures and a small write up of the
install if anyone is interested=2E  The kit was a bit expensive at
$1500 plus shipping, but from what I understand its worth it.

In speaking with the owner, they are supposed to be about ready with
an entirely new site as well.  coming soon.  lol
