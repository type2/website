Subject: A small success story

We need to hear good things sometimes too right? Not just problems.

Anyway my 78 Transporter is my daily driver and dreading the hot Vegas
summer coming, I was stressed about
my bus not starting when it's hot. I found out about the WR1 hard start
relay. I bought it and installed it last night. (pretty much
just a plug and play install) I just drove accross town and back, it's about
85 degrees outside, when I pulled in, I shut off
the engine and just to test the new relay, I tried to restart it. She fired
right up. That made me smile.

My 69 westy is still in the garage. No success there, but I just wanted
share my delight with you all on my 78.

Have a GREAT day!
