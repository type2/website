Subject: Re: [T2] Ball joint boots only?

Haven't done it yet, but I also bought the boots.  It
has to be much simpler than pressing out the
balljoints, which everyone says is a major league
PITA.   I think I got them from bus-boys.com.   From
what I hear, it's a good move.  Keep in touch on this.
 Thanks...KR
