Subject: [T2] Cross Lists; Champoeg 9-17 Oregon; T2 mech maint

I`m coordinating a campout for September 17, 2005
(Saturday night) with WetWesties.  (-at-) Champoeg Park
near Portland, Oregon.  But I suggest the T2 list
consider a T2 membership Roundtable on that Saturday
Afternoon in the RV Loop Meeting hall.  
   
This E-mail is not a formal announcement.  This
E-mail is a request for T2 acceptance and feedback.  I
propose a couple-of-hour get-together after 4:00 PM
the day of the WetWesties campout.
   
My Agenda?  (1) PDX area T2 members meet one another
face-to-face.  (2) T2 members discuss maintenance
issues.  (3) Improve my understanding of maintenance
of my T2.   I for one have some problems to point-out,
and talk about what other members did to fix them.
   
What are your thoughts, PDX T2 members?
   
I suggest calling this thread [T2] Champoeg PDX Mech
Maint Roundtable....
