I would like to highly recommend the fuel line replacement
kit from germansupply.com. Has everything you need to replace
all the fuel lines starting from the tank outlet to fuel pump
to fuel rail to fuel pressure regulator back to tank. I think
they now include new injector seals too.

..just a satisfied customer...
