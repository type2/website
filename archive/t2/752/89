Subject: Bonaroo

I'm a musician (jazz saxphone player) and I don't know
how this Bonaroo thing happened.  It happens very near
me.  I'm glad for it, but I don't get it.  It's the
Woodstock of our time.  So why didn't somebody in
Woodstock think of this?  I'm befuddled about the
whole thing.  But we know that VW busses are "all the
rage" at hippie gatherings like Bonaroo.  Lots of
people (lots!) camp out (and don't bathe) all weekend.
 And have lots of sex!  Sounds like fun, but is it
worth it?  Long traffic lines, no amenities, etc.  Oh
to be 18 again!  Thoughts?....KR
