hello type2 listees well on Sat i put  engine in the
back of my moms jeep liberty at 11:45 i pulled into
Bob Donalds house in Wayland Ma. I backed up my moms
jeep next to his shop and  we introduce ourselves very
nice guy. at that time  he did not have any room in
his garage since he was moving in from his other shop.
So he hooked up a trailor to the back of 1 of the 3
vanagons he ownes and he  put it onto that for now.
Update as of today Thrusday I talked briefly to Bob on
the phone and as of tomorrow he should of  pulled my
engine apart and in 2 weeks i am hopping for a
completely engine. What my engine is going to have
when finished from Bob    www.bostonengine.com

of course  2 liter
hydrolic lifters
square port heads like the vanagon style exhaust which
he thinks and i hink is a better setup rather than the
stock round port he  polishes and does his thing which
he is known for  and i am sending him a Vdo oil
sending unit to tap in the block for me 

What i have done since i am waiting for the bus i have

sanblasted anbd podercoated the rims and got new tires

sandblasted and podercoated the engine tin

my engine bay i am going to prime it and re paint it

about that again
