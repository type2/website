Yep.

However, the boots I put on there are already disintegrated. They had
no name brand, just in plastic bags. I've got a set of Empi's that
probably aren't any better that I'm going to put on... Stupid CV bolts
are already all gunked up. Look just like they did before. Probably
the road salt from Feb, March, and April.
