re: ball joint boots.

One problem is that the boots are almost as expensive at the complete ball
joint! And the quality of the ones I have seen is poor, the rubber is really
thin. Maybe there are some other boots on the market I have not seen.

Starting next month we will be offering the complete reconditioned torsion
arms with new ball joints.

For anyone who is local to us, we will also press your ball joints into the
arms for 10.00 each.
