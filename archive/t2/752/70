My 1981 Honda motorcycle did leak more with syth. Why? Dunno if the seals shrank or the engine was really washed out taking oil deposits with it. My VW leaked more too. In both cases I think the engine was just REALLY cleaner than before and old gaskets were leaking. My low mile new engines did not leak. 

Figure $5 a quart and see how many quarts of oil you want to buy between oil changes. It's up to you.
