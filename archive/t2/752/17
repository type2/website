Subject: Re: [T2] Ball joint boots only?

I replaced just the boot on one of the ball joints on my 70 bus. It was 
quite a bit of work. Just separating the tie rod from the ball joint took a 
lot of pressure. I used a 20 ton press and the noise when the tie rod let go 
scared me.

Since them I took advantage of a Bus Boys sale and got 4 rebuilt torsion 
arms with new ball joints for $170. No cores required.

My ball joints are also pretty tight but have about 152,000 original miles 
on them.

Now if I can get the energy to install the torsion arms.

 If I might resurrect this year-old thread, while I was replacing brake 
hoses I
discovered that my left lower ball joint boot is torn.

 The ball joints themselves are still tight.

 The full ball joint repair procedure sounds horrific.  I don't have a clear
 sense, though, of how little or how much I'd have to tear apart just to
 replace one boot.

 Does anyone know?

 Thanks,
