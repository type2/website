Subject: Re: [T2] Should caliper bleed screw leak?

That sounds fine.  I doubt the threads are worn out because most likely 
they haven't been turned more than a few times in the lifetime of the bus.

Plus, when you open it, you only open it enough to let the fluid out. 
Whether it comes out through the threads or through the nipple, it 
doesn't really matter - the fluid's coming out and that's what you want. 
  You just want to make dang sure that there is no fluid coming out 
while it's tight!!
