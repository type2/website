I do remember. That was last year, when we had some Sandens at half price
that we'd bought on closeout from an A/C parts supplier. It turned out that
the heads on some of those units didn't fit properly when used in this
particular application due to the way the fittings protruded (so we had to
send another head). However, the Sandens we have now come with a different
head.
