Corbett,

Great pics on their site!  Gives everyone with a t1 engine a good idea of 
where it goes....however....

Looks like not enough "belt wrap" on everything to me.
I prefer adding a belt and pulley to the original setup.

And, there is no reason that they could not have tilted the mount on the 
Sanden's a little and used some different hose mounts so that you didn't 
have to change the air outlet on the 3/4 side.  Haven't seen one in a long 
time tho, so I could be really wrong about that.

Looks to me like the compressor on the bus pic is beefier than the KG one.

Cheers, dave
