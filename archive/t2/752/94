From ye olde 1973 dated Factory Parts book, the following engine
number data is provided:

021 119 159  Thermostat originally fit:
1700 MT  CB 0000001 (72) to CB 0070064 (Mid 73)
1700 AT  CB 0000001 (73) to CD 0000045 (Early 73)
(Wow - a whopping 45 engines on the Automatics!)
This was also used on the CA and CE motors sold outside North America
thru Mid 73 as well.

021 119 159A Thermostat originally fit:
1700 MT CB 0070065 on
1700 AT  CD 0000046 on
As well as the usual AW (1800), ED (1800 FI), GD (2000 solid lifter),
GE (2000 Hyd Lifter to 79) and the Vanagon 2.0 (CV).

I'd have to dig into my "ancient" Obsolete Parts fiches to see if an
obsolete/supersession date exists.  Ahh, another maddening journey of
exploration.  Richard, you really know how to come up with these
"nuggets" of exploratory trivia.  Gotta luv it!!

And no, I have never seen the earlier thermostat myself :-)
