heres' what the auto tranny book says about not shifting into 2nd or 3rd

. govenor dirty
. govenor drive defective
. govenor improperly assembled
. accumulator cover plate loose
. valve body dirty

the above can be repaired without removing the tranny

.  1-2 shift valve sticking
.  2nd gear brake band burnt or wornp

the second gear brake piston operates the 2nd gear brake band, it is very
possible that the piston did not fully engage and allowed the band to slip
and finally wore to the point of no longer engaging...


can you get into reverse??
does the tranny fluid smell burnt??

I hope that is not what happened because a worn or burned brake band is a
major drop the tranny open it up by someone who knows what thier doing and
lots of $$$$$

check the govenor it is cheap and easy to clean/fix

> drive a domestic minivan?

I hope not

good luck
