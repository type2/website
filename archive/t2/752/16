Subject: Re: [T2] Ball joint boots only?

Mike,

Sounds great!  Can you tell me more about the polyethylene material & poly
tape that you used to repair the torn ball joint boot?  Must be different from
the three varieties of PE that are commonly used in plastic containers.  Where
do you buy it?

Many thanks!
