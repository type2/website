I'm just curious. I know folks say you will see oil leaks if you
switch to synthetic. Do some of you have first hand experience with
seeing this?  Or is this just rumor?

Seems like a small..and I mean small...oil leak with synthetic would
be acceptable to take advantage of the positive points on using that type
of oil.

Let's not start a synth vs dino oil debate.
