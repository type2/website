Subject: cv boots...lazy way

Folks,

When I was at the local flaps yesterday, I noticed that they had "colored" 
cv boot replacements(for the ricers I'm sure).

They were split and had clamps....might be the lazy man's way to fix a 
torn boot on our cv joints.

Didja hear that Don!  Might have been an quicker temporary fix for when 
you had to move your bus!...think it was Don anyway<grin>.

They looked like they might fit well...and then again, I didn't look 
really close....

YMMV

Cheers, dave
