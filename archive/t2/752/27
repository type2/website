I have not followed this entire thread, but from reading that past few emails
it looks like a fair amount of work. Have you contacted anyone about another
kit? Check out http://www.gilmore-enterprises.com/ Their site is not great,
but it does have a few pics. Email them, they can tell you more about their
setups. They just finished one for the Type 4 engine. Entire kit including the
underdash blower for $1300. Expensive, but they do sell it in pieces, so you
might be able to get a kit to mount the compressor.
