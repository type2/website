I'm assuming you've tried the other positions with no different results..

"strange" noises are always ominous until determined to me inert.  have
heard many noises from tranny but not a rattling.

might want to drop it again, the tiny bits of sparkly metal are not
usually a problem.  look for bits and pieces.  maybe strain your tranny
fluid. the stuff that doesn't strain would be the problems.   an old piece
of window screen makes a good strain for this.

low fluid means no go, usually will stop going before damage

I might trust 5 people in the country with an auto tranny, and I haven't
found 4 of them. and not sure of the 5th.   Doc Tim says he knows someone
and I trust much of what Doc Tim says but he is in Washington state.

the service manual says of the problem.  probable cause.

"2nd gear brake - piston seal damaged"

??? I would suspect a link..

by the big Bentley book yesterday, but most of the stuff I'm telling you
about the tranny isn't in the green Bentley book, I have the VW trouble
shooting manual and the orange service manual.  (bus Depot "might" have
the trouble shooting manual, he had a couple but I don't think they were
on his web site.  RON??)  the green Bentley covers the 003 tranny but the
late buses had the 010 tranny

good luck
