Hi.
I'm not going to quote you an exact web page, because I want you to explore
Richard Atwell's very comprehensive web site, ratwell.com. I must say it is
more comprehensive than any web site I have seen on any subject. There is a
lot of very valuable information, knowledge and experience floating around
in our community. Most of us gladly share on the list, but for the most part
we lack either the knowledge, experience, time, resource, or drive to
compile it. Richard has done this all for us. We have all contributed, but
it is Richard who has taken the time and initiative to put it all together
in one easy to navigate site.

Anyway, visit his site and do a search for thermostat. Be sure you choose
the "search site" rather than "search the web" button (you'll see what I
mean), and you'll find the answer you seek.

Thanks again, Richard. Great job.
