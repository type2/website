Subject: Re: [T2] any tips on sealing my existing manifold

ok, Forgot to add what i have done.. Got metal/tin or whatever gaskets  
from Buggcraft.. plus put yamabond on both sides, installed manifold..  
started and ran great... at idle.. but at least all 4 cyls.. but open  
the throttle up a ways.. pa pa pa.. ok.. i though.. put yamabond..  
metal gasket... yamabond... paper gasket... manifold.. put all  
together.. same results... i spray carb cleaner down onto manifold..  
rpms change...  jbweld??? though that stuff would melt or whatever  
under the heat..
