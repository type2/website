Subject: Electric fuel pump shutoff

Hi, I have installed a "FUEL FLO" electric fuel pump to run the twin Del 40s
on my 'warmed up', 1800.  After looking through the archives, I am led to
believe that you can use the wire from oil pressure sender, (I have a VDO dual
exit one), to feed the pump hot, or use a VW rabitt style fuel pump relay.
Which is better, for safety, and where can I get a wiring diagram and
necessary parts?  Wreckers, auto parts store, VW?  Any input would be
appreciated.  Cheers.
Syd
