Subject: bastard distributor setup

i have a 75 FI engine with the stock distributor.  the can has two
nipples as it is a brand new beetle vacuum can.  obviously this causes
some issues with the distributor seating properly and still having the
correct timing.  to set the timing correctly my engine rebuilder, an
air cooled porsche shop, capped off both the advance and retard of the
vacuum can.  there are no vacuum lines going to the distributor.  the
bus runs great.  she has not yet been on the highway and has only been
up to 40-45mph max.

what are the pro's and con's to this setup?  this shop that i used for
the rebuild is good but used to working with air-cooled porsches and
guys with a lot more money than i have.  i assume they left off the
vacuum lines in order to get proper timing at idle and proper advance
at high rpm?

thanks,

jeremiah
