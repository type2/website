I will repeat my assertion that it is not a vacuum leak (this includes
a throttle shaft leak).


The condition you describe sounds like a lean condition to me.B  First
thing I would do is disconnect the linkage at one carb and open the
throttle on each carb separately.B  Just to verify that the popping is
really coming from both carbs.B  Next, I'm going to ask what jets and
venturis are in those carbs.B  If you don't know, then you don't
*really* know that they are set up correctly.


Another possibility is that you have the wrong hose hooked up to your
dizzy so that instead of getting vacuum advance when you open the
throttle, you are getting vacuum retard.
