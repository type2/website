Subject: Camper parts up for grab (Seattle)

I removed the graywater tank and bracket, and the propane tank and  
stove from my 77 Riveria.  If anyone in the area wants them, ping me  
and we'll arrange when you can come over and pick them up.

I also have the front "luggage" top that was over the cab if anyone  
wants that.

All free! Priority to the person who can take all. I might even be  
convinced to throw in the water tank, pump, and sink if you can  
really use it.
