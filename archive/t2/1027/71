Subject: New Alloy Wheels for 71-up Bus! 

Just a note that I now have a small quantity of newly designed Alloy Wheels
in stock from Just Kampers in England, for 1971-79 Buses. Unlike most
aftermarket wheels, these are specifically designed for a Bus. They can
handle its weight, have the correct offset, and do not require you to modify
or machine them to fit the hub.     

These wheels pair well with our excellent Hankook 185R14 tires, which of
course are also properly rated for Bus use. (Or, of course, you can use your
existing tires.) It is easier and cheaper to find 14" LT (light truck) rated
tires than in larger sizes, so 14" is the most economical way to go if you
are upgrading to alloys. (VW does not recommend using standard passenger car
tires on the vans, in any size.)

The price is $169 each.  I have only a few sets available. Once they're gone
I won't have more until June (and the price may be higher depending on how
much weaker the dollar gets). Here are the links, with pics:
