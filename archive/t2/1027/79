Subject: Re: [T2] ok..

Dave, I see what you mean, but i pull the arms off the carbs and open  
em up... bout half way or so.. pop pop out of the Carb.. either side.  
I am assuming they are jetted fine as i passed emissions within proper  
specs.. and it ran great... and i mean really well with them for  
months... nice power and throttle response.. it was not running lean  
before.. so i would not think it was now.. and the correct hose is  
hooked up to the dizzy, with timing light it does advance, and when i  
suck on the hose it is moving.. does anyone think i should try one of  
the 009's i have laying around?? what is wierd with the 009 is that  
when i put it in i have to move my spark plugs wires all around to  
make it run.. are they really that different? lol.. All wires are  
hooked up correct right now and firing on all four..
