Well ,, it isn't possible to get the proper settings if you don't connect
the proper vac lines to the proper vac can.

I would guess that the most advance you would get is about 25 deg on top of
the setting your using..  stock is 5 deg after.. so your max advance is
about 20 deg...  not very much..  engine would lack power in the 2500 rpm
and up ....

why don't you set it up correctly
