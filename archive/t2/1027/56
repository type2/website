Unless you are running a high lift cam or heavy valve springs you probably
won't see any difference.

The idea of the swivel foot adjuster is to prevent wear or damage to the
valve stem from the hammering action of the rocker.

I've found that they make valve adjustments a bit more difficult, as they
introduce another gap into the valve train.  Others have mentioned the
mods required to run them.
