Andy,

I would advise new drums, never used.

I'm assuming you need the drum?

If you are looking for a '68 backing plate, it is a one-year-only part. If
the complete rear braking system is too worn, consider updating it to a
late-'68-'70 system. BustedBus should have all the mounting pieces, but
doesn't sell used drums, calipers, pads or brake lines if I remember right.

You can also bolt up a '71-'79 rear brake system, but you will need the
entire hub assembly. Someone on the list correct me if this is wrong.

over the years the face where it rides the hub has slowly worn down and
now its to the point where one of them has
started to rub on the backing plate.
i sent an email to busted bus but maybe someone has a drum or 2 they
wouldnt mind moving out of their pile?

thanks
andy
