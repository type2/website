Subject: Re: [T2] New Tires

Those details will come later - after all the comments
about not being adequate due to not having reinforced
sidewalls, not being load range 'C' or 'D' rated and
even probably the wrong offset on the rims!

BTW - what rims did you use? The loadrange seems more
than adequate but doesn't address the cantilever
effect in dips and cornering. I personally would give
it a try but won't recommend it to others just because
if anything at all tire related goes wrong and
somebody gets hurt or killed, it's gonna be because of
the "wrong" tires regardless of the relevant facts.

Someone else on the list was running "P" tires that
were way beyond the loadrange rating for our buses -
who is that?

I'll just sit back now and read the "opinions!" -BaH
