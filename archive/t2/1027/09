Subject: turn signal anomaly fixed

per the lists' advice i checked the ground and other connections at
the turn signal housing.  my six yr. old daughter and i were able to
clean the connections and get everything working as it should.  thanks
everyone.

now next item.  someone suggested that my brights might not be staying
on when i hit the switch because of a voltage drop.  is this an easy
fix for someone with little to no electrical experience?  were should
i look first?  this is a 77 baywindow.  would a 8 amp fuse instead of
a 16 cause this?  or the other way around, a 16 instead of an 8?


thanks, again.

jeremiah
