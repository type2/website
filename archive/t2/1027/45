Scott & others interested, the main reason for trying water injection  
was to
help lower the engine temps & increase fuel economy.

At this stage I cannot comment on either as I have not done  
insufficient kms
to test them.  I have noticed however, an increase in power.  The  
increase
is seat of the pants testing only but on a trip onto a freeway today  
I felt an
increase in acceleration from 70 to 110 km/hour in 3rd & 4th.  Again,  
I don't
have any hard facts to back this impression up.

Will do a run into town next week (25 kms) & see how it goes.  There  
is a
steep hill on the way out of town that normally knocks the speed down  
from
110 to about 80 km/hour.  If my initial impressions are real I hope  
to see a
slight improvement in that.

Have to go to Launceston for a wedding at the end of the month so will
take the bus.  That will be a 400 km round trip, so hopefully fuel  
consumption
& oil temps will show an improvement there as well.

Don't have any photos yet but will let you know when I get around to  
taking
some that are meaningful.
