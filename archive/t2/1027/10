Subject: West Marine Catalog is free:

I get notices from a boating supply store: West Marine; their 2008 paper 
catalog is free- can go the http://www.westmarine.com
Useful for things like Caframo fans (no cage), I stick mine to the 
windshield) and sundry stuff for Campers like bulk butane for your 
refillable grill lighters. Also got river tubes from them when on sale.
