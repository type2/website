<<I was advised against using it after a VW owner told me it left a
salty residue inside his vehicle. I suppose being a salt, this is more
of a problem for exposed metal.>>

Rich,

Just for grins, may I ask who advised you against possibly the easiest
method to extract moisture outa the air, inside of your parked Van?

Second, what kinda exposed metal do you have inside your Vanagon?

Mine are all either painted, covered with some sort of material, covered
in plastic or plated.
I can't find anything exposed.

Third, you not supoosed to let the moisture that's collected slop all
over the floor of the Van.
I lay a an old cottage cheese or butter dish full of the calcium
chloride inside of a Sara Lee aluminum pan to catch any over flow of
absorbed condensation.

Right off the top of my head I can come up with at least 50 boat owner's
in my Marina that use the stuff , every winter, down below , inside the
cabin, & up on the covered up deck area to retard humidity collecting.

No body I know of has any of these  interior corrosion problems you got
warned about from somebody---

Who is this somebody anyway?
I always wanted to meet this guy that folks happen to mention from time
to time.--~ 8 )-

The stuff works beyond your comprehension--and it's a simple water
absorbing concept--and not expensive at all.

Plus it's a much better deal than that heated gizmo you bought, or the
golden rod humidity eater that doesn't work very well at all.

Here's another concept that I know of, that one captain uses below
decks, that really works well.

He places two electric space heater's in the cabins ,and has them on
timer's---they go on & off three times a day.

Works good, but he has to pay the marina $300.00 more for the winter
electrical hookup--

Try that---it works but sucks up plenty of energy---
