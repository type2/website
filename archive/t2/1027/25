Thanks for the links and explanation.? I have forwarded them to the guy who was asking me about it.? He was under the impression that it was a legit crash test, and was wondering if he would ever drive his single cab again.
Now he understands that it was not really an accurate representation of a crash.? 
Thanks again,
Greg
