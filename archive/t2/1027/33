Subject: Re: [T2] 911 porsche valve adjusters

911 Adjusters WILL FAIL on a hydraulic engine, do not use them.

On a solid lifter engine they are worthwhile, ASSUMING they are properly 
installed (which is time consuming, back cutting the rocker arms). Just 
screwing out the old adjusters and screwing in the 911 adjusters is 
incorrect. So I guess it depends if the Engine Builder actually knows this 
(many do not).
