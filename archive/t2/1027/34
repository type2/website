John,

Haven't followed all of this string but  a few years ago I rebuilt the 
engine in my 70 bus (owned since new). I took the 1970 set of CB swivel foot 
adjusting screws off my shelf and tried fitting them and quickly saw that 
the geometry was way off.

Can you refer me to an article that tells how to do this - "cutting back the 
rocker arms", etc.?
Or is this worthwhile for a seldom driven vehicle - 160,000 miles in 38 
years?
