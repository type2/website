Happich made a lot of rubber items for VW and is listed on the OEM  
vendor fiche:

I've been looking for the OEM that made the rubber stops on the  
dropgates for my late model doublecab. Unfortunately there are no  
markings on those rubbers and the sizes don't match anything in the  
Happich catalogs.

Does anyone have any leads?

The listing also says:

S.U. 100 St. (St. is an abbr. for Stueck which means units so I think  
there will be a 100 unit order minimum)
