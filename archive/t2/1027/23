Subject: Re: [T2] West Marine Catalog is free:

A simple $4.00 5 lbs. bag of calcium chloride bought at HD or Menard's
in a plastic dish would absorb all of the moisture inside your stored
vehicle during the lay up months.
 
I know West Marine has a similar product in a small 8oz. container for
about 5 bucks.

It's simple, and it does work--in my stored boat cabin, as well as
inside of my  Westfaila too----

The product you mentioned as well as a "Goldn Rod" small tubular heater/
humdity eliminator isn't the answer for warding off inside moisture
inside your stored Van--
