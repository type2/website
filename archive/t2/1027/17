Subject: removing the regulator from an alternator

My vehicle is a '79 Type I.  Looking at the Orange and Green Bentleys 
suggests that the problem is identical to the Type 2; hence a post to 
this list.

I'm trying to remove the internal regulator from the alternator 
without removing the alternator from the engine.  Evidently, it is 
held by two small screws and by the alternator strap. I removed the 
screws and loosened the strap enough to push it out of the way. The 
assembly now moves around but won't lift out. It seems to be caught 
up on something inside the alternator.

Has anyone done this job?

Is is true that the brushes are part of the assembly?
Are there any internal wires to disconnect?
What do I need to do to withdraw this assembly?
Thanks
