Subject: Wont stay running...

Thinking out loud....
'79 2.0L. I had the engine out and replaced a head, put the engine 
back. As part of that I did take the starter off and put it back on.
Now I go to start it, turn the key and it fires off, I let go of the 
key and it dies...
Found a fuel leak and fixed it (can't find 7mm fuel hose in the 3 
parts stores in my town).
Turn the key and it fires, let go of the key and it dies.
Hmmm... Turn the key, it fires, hold the key and it keeps running, 
let go of the key and it dies.
Go back and check the wires, all looks good on the coil. I see that 
now the vacuum line to the oil breather (?) is disconnected and there 
is another vacuum line just sitting there. It comes off a "Y" on the 
intake (the other end of the "Y" goes to the decel valve).
Time to go back and see if I can't find out where the vacuum lines 
are supposed to be hooked up.
