Subject: Doublecab crash video explanation wanted (again)

Someone was asking if I had seen the 'crash test' video of the vw vanagon style doublecab getting absolutely squashed.? 
I remember reading an explanation of what that was, which if I remember correctly was not a crash test at all, and it was a really rusty truck to boot.? 
I have looked and I cant find the post in the archives, and I'd like for them to see the explanation.? If anyone remembers, please let me know so I can set them straight.
Thanks,
Greg
