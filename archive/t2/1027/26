Subject: ok.. think i found it

ok, i think i found the source of high rpm vacuum leak.. i plugged up  
the vacuum ports for the brakes.. took a drive with manual brakes..  
ran way better.. .so what do u think.. check valve? i know my master  
cyl is leaky and needs to be replaced asap.. but.. if i replace the  
hoses and check valve.. that should probably fix it right? then next  
payday i can replace the master cyl..
