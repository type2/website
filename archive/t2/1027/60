It was vacuum lines, it runs now. Smoked a lot while it idled and for 
the first trip around the block, runs clear now. I brought it home on 
a flat bed with brake, linkage and valve problems. The gears are 
still sloppy but I CAN find reverse.

I'd like to thank the folks on the list for helping me get to this point.
