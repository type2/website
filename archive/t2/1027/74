Thanks for the kind words Andy.

When I started the website it was simply a page of photos to share  
with my dad. I was living far away in Texas and this was the way I  
chose to keep him up to date on the progress I was making  
resurrecting the family bus.

I had joined Type2 in Jan '02 and my webpage sprang up shortly  
afterwards. At that time, there was a lot of great advice on the  
list, in the archives and in the library but few photos. I began  
posting photos as answers to common questions and so began the task  
of documenting everything I did which turned into 2500+ photos.

I started writing technical articles the following year starting with  
Fuel Task Restoration. Heavily read, many non-VW car clubs on the  
internet frequently reference this article. I've written 78 articles  
since then trying not to duplicate information already well documented.

In '04 I realized there was essentially no FAQ for Baywindow Buses.  
Watching this list and Samba daily, as common questions arose, I  
began writing. That quickly turned in 180 entries.

I've taken a Google approach to keep the website simply and  
accessible. Pretty much the order of things, is the order in which I  
discovered them for the first time which I think is welcomed by new  
owners.

Despite its popularity, keeping it a free service has been a priority  
in order to give back to the community that helped me out when my bus  
needed help the most.
