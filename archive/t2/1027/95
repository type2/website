Subject: Re: [T2] thermostat failed closed

I was a bit surprised too, since the thing was airtight, and it did expand a small amount when dunked in boiling water, but not much.

As to the stock opening temperature, ours has 85deg/90deg stamped into it, so now it'll probably open a bit sooner.

I also don't know which concentration we used, as the bottle was years old. I suspect it would work with a lower concentration too.
The alcohol would just boil out of solution, perhaps a bit later than 82C, but that's actually closer to stock...

also, here's a link to the photo, hopefully it works

I  wonder  why  the  thermostat  failed  closed?   The  only  way  I  can  think  of
this  happening  is  if  no  alcohol  was  in  the  thermostat  to  begin  with,  since
the  thermostat  "relaxes"  to  the  open  position.   It  would  never  have
worked.

Isopropyl  has  a  boiling  point  of  82C,  so  that  would  result  in  a  thermostat
open  temperature  of  about  80C.   I  thought  that  stock  was  70C,  but  I  might
be  mistaken.   to  open  at  a  lower  temperature,  you  could  use  methanol.

BTW,  isopropyl  comes  in  various  dilutions,  70%,  90%,  and  the  hard-to-find
99%.   99%  is  definitely  better  for  this  application.   If  you  cannot  find
the  99%  stuff,  you  can  easily  distill  the  watered-down  version  to  the
purer  concentrations  in  the  small  quantities  required.
