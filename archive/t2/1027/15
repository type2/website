Subject: Electric fuel pump shutoff

I think I've posted this before but since it's a very important safety issue
I'll post it again.  You don't want to be slumped unconscious over the
steering wheel after having run off the road and crashed into a tree while
the engine has stalled with the key on,  and the fuel pump is pumping fuel
out of a torn fuel line onto a hot engine!

I went to the auto wrecking yard and found some older ford taurus sedans.
In the trunk, near the drivers side rear tail lights, you'll find a small
black cube about and inch on a side (with 2 wires coming out of it) with a
big red button on top of it, screwed to the body metal.  That is the safety
shut off for the electric fuel pump.  It contains a steel ball bearing,
sitting in a plastic funnel.  When any sudden jolt occurs, the ball bearing
jumps up to the top of the funnel and activates a shut off switch.  This
ensures your electric fuel pump will shut off in the event of an accident.
If you jump your bus over a large log or hump in the road and it stops, get
out and press the red button on the top of the safety shut off and you're
good to go.

No matter how you wire your electric fuel pump up, I believe you should
include this "trauma switch" in series with the hot wire going to your fuel
pump as a secondary safety device.  I paid $5 for mine, cheap at 10 times
the price.  (and it'll never wear out!)
