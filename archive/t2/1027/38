Subject: ok, I need a part somone..

ok somebody help.. i need an intake manifold.. my cracked one is not  
helping me any with my vacuum leak issues... my passenger side  
manifold is cracked off where the (-at-)2 outside nut goes.. originally i  
had been using a washer and the original piece of the manifold and it  
was keeping vacuum.. but after having the head redone etc.. and  
putting everything together.. my vacuum leak is stemming from the  
manifold to the head mating surface.. i am hoping somone on the list  
has a type 2 manifold for a 1.7-2.0 engine. I have the 1972 setup for  
my bus... so the manifold should only have a nipple for the brake  
booster system on the outer side and on the inner side.. a nipple for  
the balance tube... no crazy bolt on bits for emissions etc.. does  
somone have one of these?? I am happy to take pictures if i have to  
but i need to get my bus on the road asap.. and all its going to take  
is getting rid of this leak.. i have finally got it running on all  
cyls.. except when opening throttle much more that puttering through  
town.. please someone can you give/sell me a passenger side manifold  
cheap.. i have like 20 bucks to my name.. until friday but would  
happily paypal it to you for a manifold :) just let me know on a  
price, i am sure i can figure something out,


Jason
