Subject: Re: [T2] bastard distributor setup

i would like to set it up properly but will probably wait until after
the 500 miles are up and they change the oil and give it a full
warranty.  i will most likely just give them my extra distributor with
the electronic ignition and single nippled vacuum can and have them
drop that one in.

thanks
