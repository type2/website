That's the one.  It is a toggle relay, in that a voltage applied to the
"change" terminal swithes the relay from high to low or vice versa.

If the lights react instantly when the lever is lifted, but don't stay
unless the arm is held in place I'd suspect the relay.  If the lights
don't respond until a couple of seconds after the arm is lifted then I'd
say it is 50/50 that the relay is the problem.  The other possibility is
that the contacts on the turn signal arm are corroded and not making
contact until they are held together for some time.
