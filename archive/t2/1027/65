Subject: thermostat failed closed

Hi all,

My dad and I have got the engine out and apart, and decided to test the thermostat. It only expanded 2-3 mm in boiling water, but was otherwise air-tight.

We opened it up, poured in 2ml of isopropyl alcohol and soldered it back shut and it works again! Thanks to Richard Atwell.

I have some pictures showing the thermostat in boiling water expanded to about 37 mm. I can send them out if you want proof.
