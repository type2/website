I appreciate the help, I didnt think to look at McMaster-Carr. I checked out
what they had, and its close, but not the original part. I decided to dig a
little more, and I found the exact part from the original manufacturer.

GHE stands for "Group Happich Ellamp"
They supplied more than a few parts for VW, such as catches and other rubber
products.
They have an english website; http://www.ghegroup.com/en/sitemap.php
And within one of their catalogs, they have the original part;

470 0057 Round Buffer
I grabbed a pic of the original part for comparison;

I'll send them an email to see how many of these things I need to buy to get
them over here (they are located in Wuppertal Germany). If any of our vendors
(BusDepot, German Supply, etc) have accounts with GHE, or have ordered from
them in the past, please let me know, I should have an order for you :)
