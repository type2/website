Wow. You read my mind. I'm hoping to get a lot of discussion going about
wheel size. I have always thought ours were too small.

The nail in the coffin was when Bridgestone quit making my favorite tire,
the the Dueller AT, in 195/75-14.

I wanted an AT type tire, but there was nothing available in 14" that suited
me, so I started looking for anything that was a close size overall. I found
this tire from Firestone (Bridgestone's sister) and had a wheel made to
suit. It is a genuine VW center with a 15" rim welded on. The offset results
in a wheel/tire combo where the center of the tire is very close to spec. My
biggest concern was rotational mass vs. braking effort, but I am still very
confident in this area after driving a few hundred miles on bay area
freeways.
