Subject: [T2] Doublecab crash video explanation wanted (again)

If I remember correctly the test wasn't to gauge the crash worthiness of the
vehicle but to show off the new hydraulic vehicle crashing system.

The van was old, rusty and loaded with 1000lbs of concrete to show how
powerful the equipment was.

On the other hand IF you drive around in an old van with a ton of stuff in
the back AND plan on heading into an concrete blocks at 70mph then be
warned, bad things will happen.

Someone was asking if I had seen the 'crash test' video of the vw vanagon
style doublecab getting absolutely squashed.?
I remember reading an explanation of what that was, which if I remember
correctly was not a crash test at all, and it was a really rusty truck to
boot.?
I have looked and I cant find the post in the archives, and I'd like for
them to see the explanation.? If anyone remembers, please let me know so I
can set them straight.
