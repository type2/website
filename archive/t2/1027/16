Subject: I think all my worry's are now over!!

Ok guys.. First and formost i have to thank all of you for all of your  
advice and help.. kudos to you all!!! Ok, I ended up taking my 72 bus  
2.0 solid lifters/cam.. t3 carbs, over to Bugg Craft here in ogden..  
very knowledagble mechanic named kerry that has worked there since i  
was a kid worked on it for me.. found a BENT PUSHROD TUBE!!! Making  
that valve on #2 not work, It was bent so that it put pressure on the  
pushrod and it would pop in and out of the seat on the lifter and be  
useless way too much play.. but he fixed it, threw a new tube in for  
me etc.. still having the issue, found a leak at the manifold like all  
of you said.. i had put new metal gaskets in etc.. i had thought i got  
all of the old paper gasket material out.. but i hadnt.. i had to  
literally use a knife to get the gasket out.. very slow process  
hunched inside a 72 engine bay.. but i got it out.. and per kerry i  
put yamabond || metal Gasket || Yamabond in there.. torqued it down..  
im letting it sit overnight to cure.. I will then throw my carb on  
there and should be good to go!! He used propane to find the leak.. as  
soon as he put propane in there... cyl started firing.. so thank you  
all.. thanks mr. atwell and all you great folks... Richard..  your  
website is awesome.. Love all the t4 info you have in there....


I cant thank you all enough.

                               Jason
