> Hey, is anyone going to the Sonntag Treffen up in Murphys this
> Sunday?

If'n y'all get up there - I HIGHLY recommend the fish taco plate at
Firewood - rice (tho' I skip this and get all BLACK beans, YUM!), beans
and 2 li'l scrumptious tacos for $5. All their stuff is GREAT - but the 
taco plate is a real bargain.  I've been gone from there about 3 years 
and not a week goes by I don't miss 'em.  THE best place to munch in 
Murphys unless you want to spend lotsa bread.

The cuisine in the coos bay area leaves much to be desired.  I think 
fondly of my fav cali eateries...  Lately I've been missing Frankie, 
Johnnie & Luigi in Mountain View.  Hey, Richard, go have the some 
eggplant parmagiana and sauteed mushrooms for me, willya?  ;-)  And pour 
the whole shaker of that fresh parmesano reggiano on the shrooms...

Burp.

Teri
