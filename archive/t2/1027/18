Subject: [T2] RPM for 1600 dp

I have a 71 Westy and I have no qualms about driving down the highway  
at about 4000 RPM.  My speedometer shows 75 MPH, but I know that's  
bullshit.

My CHT gauge will hold at about 350 and my oil temp will be around  
200.  Pulling hills will send the CHT up and faster RPMs will send  
the oil temp up.
