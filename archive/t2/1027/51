Subject: Re: [T2] any tips on sealing my existing manifold

If it is not missing at idle, then any minor vacuum leak you have will 
not be affecting the engine under load.  You have another problem that 
is causing the "pa pa pa".

For what it's worth, when I was running those metal gaskets, the RPM 
would change when I sprayed carb cleaner on the junctions no matter what 
I did, yet the bus still seemed to run fine.  I think the leak was so 
small that it didn't really affect the running of the engine.  I finally 
got rid of the "leak" by polishing the cylinder head surface where the 
manifold seats to a high gloss with very fine sandpaper and metal polish.
