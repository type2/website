Hey Rob, Good to hear you got it running.
Here's the method I use to adjust the shifer, if yer
interested:
I put it in 2nd gear.
I loosen the 2 bolts holding the shift lever housing
to the floor just barely - not actually loose, but
still snug.
Next I sit in the drivers seat and take a hammer and
tap the shift lever housing fore or aft until 2nd gear
position is where I want it. If need be, I snug up the
bolts just a tad more, then take a big thick flatblade
screwdriver and, from the passenger side floorboard, I
tap the "ski-jump" plate as far toward the drivers
side as I can.
I tighten up the 2 bolts and then get in and check
that 2nd is still where I want it. All gears should be
properly aligned now - if there are still issues, it
is likely the front shift rod bushing (right below
where you were just working) and/or the coupler in the
back.

Hope this helps. - BaH
