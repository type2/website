Subject: high-beams

accidently discovered last night that my high-beams do work.  for some
reason i held the switch up in place a couple of seconds longer and
the high-beams stayed on when i released the switch.  played with this
a little more and they worked everytime i held the switch in place for
one or two seconds then released it.  the non-acvw shop that did the
safety inspection could have discovered this i suppose.  just goes to
show that no matter how good a shop is if they don't specialise in
acvw then don't take your acvw to them.

oh,well,  have so far fixed all the safety issues except the brake
hoses which i will be getting to shortly.


thanks everyone.
