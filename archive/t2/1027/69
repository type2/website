Hmmm, interesting fix!

I wonder why the thermostat failed closed?  The only way I can think of
this happening is if no alcohol was in the thermostat to begin with, since
the thermostat "relaxes" to the open position.  It would never have
worked.

Isopropyl has a boiling point of 82C, so that would result in a thermostat
open temperature of about 80C.  I thought that stock was 70C, but I might
be mistaken.  to open at a lower temperature, you could use methanol.

BTW, isopropyl comes in various dilutions, 70%, 90%, and the hard-to-find
99%.  99% is definitely better for this application.  If you cannot find
the 99% stuff, you can easily distill the watered-down version to the
purer concentrations in the small quantities required.
