Subject: ok..

ok guys.. 72, 2.0 solid lifters etc.. type 3 carbs jetted correctly..  
ok, got valve work done at a shop.. seem a little noisy.. taking it  
back tomorrow after i put a known good manifold on.. but i was bored  
so i flattened the surfaces on the head lots of old gasket on there  
causing a leak and to run on 3 cyls.. my existing problem was it fell  
on its face when ya tried to revv up higher. like in first to get  
going well. So now.. it is running on all 4 cyls.. thats awesome...  
and problem is still there... not as bad of course.. i can revv it  
higher now.. so its gotten better.. but i try to open it up all the  
way.. and pop pop pop out of both carbs.. after about 3/4 the way  
open.. before it was more pronounced.. and i can douse the manifolds  
with carb cleaner and no change so i believe i have a good seal... no  
leak.. carbs are rebuilt and should be working properly.. new plugs  
and points. runs smooth as butter at idle... so now what?? I mean i am  
taking it to the shop tomorrow.. we will see what they say.. but i am  
at a loss.. does it no matter where i set the timing.. so unless i  
have another bent pushrod tube down there somewhere... but he has been  
working on vee dubs for a reallllly long time.. so i am hoping he can  
find the issue for me.. but i am open to suggestions.. got any??
