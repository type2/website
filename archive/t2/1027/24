Subject: ok.. just got home.. results..

ok guys, just got home..results are somewhat hopeful.. I am now firing  
on all four cyls.. but... when i revv up.. I am still either losing  
spark or something.. maybe i need to take it back and have them check  
the valve job... right side valves seem a bit noisy.. and at idle..  
through short range on accel.. good spark sounds awesome.. but.. when  
i try to open her up... ahh ahh ahh ahh out of that carb again dang  
it.. im pretty sure the manifold has no leaks.. could the braking  
system do this?? check valve maybe?? I hope to sleep for a few hours  
then see whats up.. i will hope for some insightful e-mails.. home  
stretch is almost here..

Thanks in advance
Jason
