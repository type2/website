Subject: possible oops

ok, i may have made a mistake. i took the drive shaft off to get to the
rear wheel bearings (70 westy) and since it is out, i thought i would
repack them with new grease. i also have to replace one of the boots, but
not both. i forgot that the new CV boot came with a tube of grease, so
when i was cleaning the joint that didnt need a new boot, i started
packing it with grease... just not the stuff that came with the other
boot. this stuff is blue and it is for bearings. do i need a special kind
of grease for the CVs or is this grease ok?

thanks, and feelin like a dumb girl,
chris
