Subject: RE: water cooled in bay window

At Busses Nowhere Near the Arch, Darrell Boeller had his watercooled bay 
window with an Audi I-5 installed.  It was a sweet installation.  He used a 
Lincoln radiator mounted flat under the middle of the van, with a large loop 
of copper tubing to aid cooling.  I would think he could give you some ideas 
concerning the cooling issues he solved.  I would think that the Subaru 
cooling could be accomplished with the same techniques he used.
