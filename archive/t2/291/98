I never said one side couldn't be done, just that it was more difficult.

If you remove the cylinders.  It's coming back to me now - I didn't want to have to reinstall the rings since damaging them was a real risk (this was 14 years ago).  I was raising the cylinder up enough to get at the piston pin so that the piston and cylinder could be kept together.  With this method it is not possible to remove the pins towards the center.  Sorry for the confusion.
