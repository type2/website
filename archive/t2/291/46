Sometimes it pulls right off.  You can easily make a tool with a stiff
piece of steel (bar or angle) and a couple of bolts.  Drill holes in the
bar to match the pulley, bolt the bar to the pulley, then back out the
pulley bolt.  It pushes against the bar and pushes the pulley out.

Do not pry on the pulley.  A broken hub will be a bear to remove!
