Subject: Re: [T2] Ebay: the polls are in!

I agree with Maui Haui, I think that if we say no adverting, we need to have 
it no advertising. I do not see how there is any difference between a post 
about a bus on e-bay and discussing what is "in" at bus depot.

We need to treat ALL of the list members the same, and not have two different 
sets of standards.
