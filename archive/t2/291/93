Ronnie, 
I'd venture a guess that alot of these people found
you on the internet - 
People who work with computers typically use the
internet more for what is was intended to be -a source
for hard to find information or other people who have
it, know where to get it or are also looking.
When someone who knows how to use the internet gets a
bus - they find people like you...

When someone who doesn't know how to use the internet
gets a bus, they find people like "Smokin Joe's Hot
Rod Buggies" locally and then $4k and no running bus
later, end up finally getting on the internet...and
finding someone like you...or Ron Salmon...or this
list.

Really - Thanks.

-clark gordon -who would not have a running bus if it
weren't for the list.

It seems that
