Subject: wire size

Hey everyone,

I know that a 12 gauge wire will have less resistance than an 18 gauge 
wire, so my question is this: if I put 12 gauges wire in my bus, 
replacing old and smaller wire, could or would I harm the stuff I rewire 
- i.e. the radio, the lights, etc.

I know that I can put 12 gauge wire on the ground side of things and not 
harm anything - this is my weekend project, but wanted feedback on 
rewiring the hot side.

Thanks,

Bradley
