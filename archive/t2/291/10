The idea that the list has a "no advertising" rule seems to have taken
root.  Let me clarify this:

THERE IS _NO_ "NO ADVERTISING" RULE!!

Sorry for shouting, but I'm a teacher and I yell because I care.

If you read the charter (that means you actually read all the words and
understand what they mean) you will see that the _only_ prohibition on
advertising is the advertising of _auctions_.

Vendors can advertise items for sale directly to the list as long as they
are bus-related and kept to a reasonable level.

Anyone can advertise items for sale directly to the list as long as they
are bus-related and kept to a reasonable level.

I hope this clarifies the issue.

rules.
