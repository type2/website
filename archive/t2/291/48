wow, sometimes you can't get a non smartass response out of the list, sorry 
about that.


lower your bus, customize the heck out of it if you want to, just *use* it. 
some of the old farts on the list need to relax the attitude sometimes, even 
if they have a wealth of knowledge on repair issues when ohers need it. ;p

now im off to tint my windows, crank up the stereo, drive 75mph, and put big 
porsche rims on my bus. heh
