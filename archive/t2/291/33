Thanks for this link!  I went and checked it out last night.  It turns out
that their listing does NOT have the two dizzy as compatible.  They have a
very similar part number with the only difference being those pesky letters
at the end!  I figure it's in my best interest (and the best interest of my
love life!) to just put this on the back burner for awhile.

I will throw some of the part numbers out there just to see if anyone has
any input.  These are the Bosch part #s:
Current dizzy: 0231 178 009
Closest # for '71 Bug: 0231 176 028
Closest # for '71 Bus: 0231 176 033

Do these mean anything to anyone as far as compatibility is concerned?  I
forgot to mention this earlier: both are running 34pict3 carbs.

It did make me wonder though, is the difference between these the advance
curve in relationship to the gearing ratio of the transmission?

 Thanks everyone!
