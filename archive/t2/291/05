I was going to reply to this earlier, but I'm in digest mode :(

GE engines can be found in BOTH CA and FEDERAL 1979 buses.

The problem with the GE engine confusion is that the listing in Bentley is
WRONG. The list in the library http://type2.com/bartnik/enginecodes.htm was
probably compiled using the list from bentley so it's deceiving too.
http://www.tunacan.net/t4/reference/case.htm also incorrectly lists the GE
engine as a California only crankcase.

http://www.type2.com/library/identifi/boxeng2.htm list the GE as 08/'75>04/'79
(I don't know whats up with that).

My 79 Fed (49 state) Bus has the original GE engine. It is NOT a CA model, but
has a GE engine (w/ square port heads). Karl and I, went thru this conversation
awhile back, but I think the discussion might have been offlist, so it won't be
in the archives.

I'm not sure about the 78's w/ the GE engine (w/ round port heads), but vw has
shown from past history that sometimes they just use the parts they have on
hand (mid year changes). Maybe the last of the 78's were built w/ the GE block
with the round port heads.

Later...
