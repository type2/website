My '73 has one of those drain hoses.  It's a two-part assembly,
which may become two separate pieces and a puddle of water. :-(
To access this hose, remove the left side kick panel in the
cockpit.  One end's in front of the heater duct 'stove pipe'
and the other end is below the left headlamp bucket... IIRC.
Good luck,
