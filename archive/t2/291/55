This one seems to be popular.

I've seen a radiator in the left side of the engine compartment with an
electric fan.  The most important thing is to prevent recirculation of
cooling air.  I've seen a couple of nice installations with huge
radiators that still overheated because there was no attention to
recirculation.

Another possible mounting point is at an angle between the frame rails,
boxing in the frame rails to provide a duct long enough to prevent
recirculation.

The problem with using the stock ducts is that you are dependent upon the
cooling fans pretty much all the time.  There isn't much "ram air" effect
from the stock intakes.  If you look at them you'll see they point mostly
sideways!

Of course, you could go with a later model 2.5l engine and get 165HP!  :)
