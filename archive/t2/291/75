I would love to do that instead of being stuck in a noisy cubicle, but wireless networks are verboten at our company so my bus-computing is limited to watching DVDs on the laptop during camping trips (after all the fun stuff like campfires and socializing are over with of course) and internet access on the road via cellphone, which (as I think Unca Jerry says) is a VWonderful thing!!!  Even at 14.4.
