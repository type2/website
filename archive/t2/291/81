I agree with Daniel, The real Geeks have the slammed 55 westies. I also work
on my
laptop - but I prefer to sit surrounded by cases and heads in my garage with
the rich smell
of old transmission fluid wafting in the air, I usually only sit in the bus
for conference calls
or to drive to the airport. My computer job allows me to afford my $500 72
rust rocket, which I had
to replace the drive train on - hardly geek material!!!
