I hafta disagree with you Bob.  The 3/4 side is harder because of the oil cooler mount.  The alternator is removeable, the oil cooler mount is not.  You might respond that it doesn't make much difference for pulling the cyliner head, which is true.  But if you pull the head and then find that the piston needs to be changed too, you will be in a pickle because on the 3/4 side the oil cooler mount prevents you from removing the piston pin from the rear and the bellhousing prevents removal from the front.  I had this problem back in 1988 and ended up notching my bellhousing for clearance to get the pin out (the bellhousing was already damaged anyway) but I wouldn't want to have to do it again.

Bottom line - it can be done in a pinch, but unless there was no practical way to do it I would drop the engine for this repair.
