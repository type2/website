Subject: VW MK2  1.8   8 VALVE ENGINE IN BAY CAMPER

Hi List,

Similar to the recent Alfa engine transplant info request, I am looking for
information on how to install a 1.8 MK 2  8 valve engine into a 76 bay camper,
and recommendation re rad placement and other tech items to consider or if
others have gone before me with less than positive results, all responses are
appreciated,

thanks,
Gary
