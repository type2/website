Subject: Re: [T2] Ebay: the polls are in!

Hey! That's not fair, I didn't vote. Didn't even know about it.

All right, I admit, I read only intermittently. Perhaps the voting
period should be 1 week and should cover a weekend, when some of us
will have the time to go through all the emails.

I vote YES for posts like "btw, I saw this nice bus on ebay..." but NO
for posts like "FA: 1978 Bus..."

A question : what if I have some left over stuff that I want to sell
off, how do I propose to other list members? Or is that "illegal" too?
