If you're thinking of a Beetlemex engine, you shoud also consider buying
the engine from Old Volks Home.  There are subtle differences in the
"brand new engines" sold by various vendors.  I have two engines from
Ronnie.

If you buy out of state, the sales tax pays for a lot of the shipping,
BTW.

For some reason they don't provide this.  You just pull the old one out of
the other engine and put it into the new one.  Don't forget the washer.
You will probably be happier if you get the special tool to pull this
gear.

You will also have to replace one stud on the top of the engine to accept
the dual-port manifold.  The mustache bar holes come threaded, but you
will have to thread the thermostat stud hole if you run a thermostat.
