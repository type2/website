In order to block glare for oncoming drivers, these "eyebrows" would
have to extend several feet in front of the light, as the oncoming driver
is only a couple of degrees from the central axis of the beam.  The
truckers may have claimed that the eyebrows reduced glare, but the fact
is that they were decorative.

Off-roaders with roof mounted lights put long shields on the bottom of
their roof-mounted lights to prevent the lights from illuminating the
hood.  The hood is at a much larger angle from the axis of the light
beam, but they still need a foot or two of light shield to do the job.
