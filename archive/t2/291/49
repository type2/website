Not so George--not just Kewl--but when used in Semis ( this is where
they originated back in the 50's) they kept the light down on the road
instead of in oncoming automobile motorist's faces a night.

Seen many a westcoast Freighliner / Pete/ KW with these on them way back
when.

Then the on the ground, flamed, and chopped top guy's caught on--just to
be cool--:>)

Later,
