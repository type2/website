Gary,

I can't speak specifically to a '77 but I'm assuming it is similar to my
'70. If so you should find a hose running from the air intake area to a
drain toward the left. This hose is flimsy and can crack over time allowing
water into the trough area. This may be the source of your problem.
I replaced mine with a radiator hose from a local FLAPS.

Cheers,

John Rogers
