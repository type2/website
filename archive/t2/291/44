I've seen them both ways.  some are part of the ring, some just clamp
underneath.

They've been around for years.  Probably started in the 50s or earlier.
They became popular with the lowrider homeboys and seem to have crossed
over to the VW crowd.  I don't think that any vehicles came stock with
them.

They tend to draw the attention of law enforcement.  Be warned.

Just about any VW chrome provider.
