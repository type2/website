George--

You have to take this into consideration though--

I'm talking 6 volt reverse positve ground, 50's kerosine lamp days
buddy---not the halogen stuff we have today.
Them laps on them Freightliner cab over's were so high up on the bodies
of the cabs, they did blind the on coming driver's--

I am not saying this was the total solution-but it helped---
They do reflect the top half of the beam down on the road instead of in
somebodies face.
How do I know this??--
I was one of the guys doin the blinding---:>)

( not in the 50's, but in the 70's--)

Later,

In order to block glare for oncoming drivers, these "eyebrows" would
have to extend several feet in front of the light, as the oncoming
driver is only a couple of degrees from the central axis of the beam.
The truckers may have claimed that the eyebrows reduced glare, but the
fact is that they were decorative. 
Off-roaders with roof mounted lights put long shields on the bottom of
their roof-mounted lights to prevent the lights from illuminating the
hood. The hood is at a much larger angle from the axis of the light
beam, but they still need a foot or two of light shield to do the job.
