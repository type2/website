I don't find the post rude at all.

However, I agree that the issue should have been resolved first and
then, if the person is still incensed, summarized e.g. with a preamble
like "Gripe: <vendor/product name>" which can also be used for people
complaining about bad engines and the like :-)

Nothing like a good venting of coolant.

Oh, I forgot, we don't need coolant, do we?

People who are offended by complaints can then tune out via the delete
key or email filter.

Or do we need a vote for that?  :-)
