Well, it has to go through the switch on the faucet, of course, or else it
will be running all the time. So basically you can go from any constant 12
volt source (always hot, so you don't have to turn on the ignition to use
your sink), to the switch, and from the switch to the pump. (Use a fuse, of
course.) Depending on which end came off, you may still have 12 volts at the
switch, in which case you can simply run a new lead from the other side of
the switch to your pump.
