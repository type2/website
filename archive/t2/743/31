Subject: Should the idle speed be related to operating temp?

Having some issues with my 81 Vanagon.
 
When it's warmed up, it idles real high.  I don't think the idle speed should change as the engine temp changes.  Should it?
 
After doing some reading, I'm thinking it might be the Auxillary Air Regulator.
 
I would appreciate your thoughts -
 
Thanks as always -
