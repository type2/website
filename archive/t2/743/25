Subject: Re: [T2] timing

No distributor in my listings shows that any of 'em has to be timed at
10 degrees AFTER Top Dead Center (TDC).  Dual Diaphragm (Push-Pull
Models) generally required 5 degrees AFTER TDC.  Single Vacuum models,
depending on the distributor casing number could be 0 degrees, 7.5
degrees BEFORE TDC or even 10 degrees BEFORE TDC.  Gotta have that
number!

Jason I need the numbers off the distributor casing, both Bosch (0231)
and the VW.  Then tell me what yer running - 1600, 1700, 2000, Carbs
(Stock [30PICT?/34PICT?] or Fancy Duals, Fuel Injection, etc.).  What
year is the beast yer running this setup in?  Can't give info unless
I've got info :-)

Thanks
