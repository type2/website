That's a good suggestion. It makes a tankful of water last much longer, you
still get plenty of flow, and you don't splash your clothes every time you
wash a dish. I did the "rig job" version of this on my '77 once, using a
hose clamp to somewhat constrict the water hose leading from the pump to the
faucet. I was a bit concerned that this might harm the pump, but I figured
pumps weren't all that expensive so I'd take my chances with the two-minute
fix. I can't say whether the pump's lifespan was shortened over the long
haul, but it was still working fine two years later when I sold the bus. (Of
course YMMV.)
