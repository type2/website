Hello Phil  I have seen these tubes pinch the rings on the piston before and 
have seen the pecking marks on a bunch of pistons also.  have never seen one 
mess up a valve before  but I have seen them cause a miss for a while when they 
go thur the intake valve and probably by the time the piston gets thur with 
them they are smaller and mangled going out .  Later and have fun  mark dearing
