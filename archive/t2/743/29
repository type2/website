Subject: Re: [T2] Update on reparing my stripped exhaust studs

Some guys like to leave the exhaust manifolds on during this process.
The reasoning is that the manifold flanges will help guide the drill
(and tap) straight.

I probably will do it this way if I ever manage to get the old stud
out. Big if...
