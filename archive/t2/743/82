Subject: Water Pump Wiring

Hi, after searching through the archives, library, manuels and various 
websites, I have reached the conclusion that I have to post. I ran across 
one guy in a 2003 archive post who said that he recieved lots of help from 
the list, but I can't find the help he got!

Can someone tell me how to simplest wire up my water pump for the sink my 78 
westy, Kermit? The hot wire pulled loose, and for the life of me, I can't 
find the other end..... I don't want to cut any more holes in the back of 
the cabinet searching.

Gracias!!

George
