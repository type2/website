Hey jantova ??      the problem with running without these tubes is that it 
will pump more gas than is needed and the gas will not vaporise as well 
causeing a rich running condition, Also can cause a hesition on take off ,  these 
tubes are a major problem with those solex carbs , the fact that they come out 
and I think they are NLA now    Later and have fun  mark dearing
