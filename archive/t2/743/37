Subject: No one replied-why no volume control valve in hydr. engine?

I asked a while ago why the hydraulic lifter engine has no secondary 
volume control relief valve for excess oil pressure; and what does this 
matter if one puts hydraulics in say, a 75 engine?

"Hmmm- why does the hydraulic lifter engine lack the volume control 
valve?  I thought this was put in to prevent excessive oil pressure when 
cold?  Might explain why in my aged 78 engine, where I use 30 wt oil in 
summer, I appear to have blown the oil cooler seals when it was an 
unusually cold day in fall and I had not switched to 10-40 yet? (Drips 
when cold, does NOT when warmed up.)
    Also, when one switches to hydraulics as on daughter's 75, what are 
the ramifications of it being there on the hydraulic lifter function????"

  The solid lifter cases are dual relief, hydraulic lifter are single.

  The one by the oil filter is the oil pressure relief valve. The one on the
  other side of the case is the oil control valve:
