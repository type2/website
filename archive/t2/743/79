Subject: accelerator pump tube

Phil and list,

  I think i am for sure missing the accelerator pump
tube on the right side.  All i have is the big
aluminum tube in the carb.  The left carb has both the
brass accelerator pump tube and the aluminum big tube.
 I did a compression test and it seems fine.  Would
missing this tube cause the backfiring and black
smoke?

Anybody know where i can get an accerlator pump tube
for 34 pdist 3 carb?

jason
