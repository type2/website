<Folks,  isn't this the one that Don or Cris or someone drooled over and 
couldn't figure out how it looked so good on the showroom floor?>

Well, I'm really a more late-bay kind of guy but this bus is really nice. I was ready to pick up the phone and buy it <not!> until he described it as "bad ass". Seems sort of wrong... <grin!> He better not be driving it at 95 mph all day long. If he is the engine isn't going to be a very lived one... And he might be the first person to crash it. 

"THE" bus that I drooled over was the one that was in Nashville with very, very low miles. Was a late-Bay too. Pea soup green. Had I $20K I'd prob go buy a nice Eurovan Weekender and have it share bus duty with our '78 Westy.
