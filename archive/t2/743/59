Is there a formula to convert the compression measured with a
compression gauge into the CR ? It looks like 175 psi ~ 8.0 CR and
120psi ~ 7.0CR

Here is one formula that does not work :-(
At sea level air pressure is ~ 14.7 psi.
With CR 8, one expects 14.7psi * 8CR = 117.6 psi

Looks like the air dynamics matters. Prof.George Lyle ?
