From the tunacan site.  http://www.tunacan.net/t4/tech/cr.htm

Compression plays a large factor in the resulting combustion chamber 
temperature. A really low compression ratio, like 7.0:1 for a Type 4 
engine, will generate less heat in the combustion chamber and accordingly 
in the head and oil. Other factors also determine how much heat is 
produced, but with everything else being identical, the higher the 
compression ratio, the higher the resulting temperature at the head.

Less CR in a hi load, long trip bus(DC) would be good.

good luck Tom!
