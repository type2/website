You can end up with a motor that runs hotter this way too, believe it or
not.

If you raise your deckheight more than .060", you start loosing the benefit
of the squish factor. After your deckheight is much over .100", it's all but
gone.

The ideal way to do it is to keep the deck height between .040" and .060"
and open the combustion chamber a bit to gain the extra cc's IMHO.

My 63 drag bug (12.2:1 CR)  has a deck height of .043" and can run on 91
octane without pinging. If I did nothing more than open the deckheight up
with some spacers to lower the compression, it would start pinging like a
mad-man.
