Subject: Need Westfalia table top

Hello everybody,

Just wondering if anyone has an extra table top for a swivel table and could
bring it to Buses'n Boats. I forgot my table top in Germany when I shipped
my bus over 3 years ago and have been table-less less since then ...

This is for a European '74 interior, but any 75-79 swivel table top should
work. I have the leg - just need the top.

I am hitting the road soon, so I may or may not have internet access. If you
have an extra table top and are attending Buses'n Boats, please just bring
it along. I am in white '74 Camper with German tags showing under Maryland
tags.

Thanks,
Marcus
