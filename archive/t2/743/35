Subject: Re: [T2] timing

Jim,
Are you really sure you want to change this??

68 - 79 Bentley, section 5, page 72. Table 1, 73/74 manual trans, dual carb, CB, AW, or ED engines =  10
degrees AFTER.

Where are you getting 5 AFTER from?  The auto trans 73/74 was 5 after.

The yellow VW type2 manual shows the ED engine as 5 after, but that is the FI engine with the 021AB or 022AB
dist. Same as the 68-79 Bentley.

From: "Old Volks Home":

This has been fixed - I have some other updates I've been wanting to
get up on the site anyway, but my spare time has been short as of late
(see sig below).  It was uploaded 5 minutes ago (It's 5:45pm)

It should now read 5 degrees AFTER TDC.

Thanks Karl :-)
