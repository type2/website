Subject: Re: [T2] Brake booster tube?

This has come up many, many times on the list.

The two most useful answers are:
(1) Buy new reinforced vacuum hose at a TRUCK (not car) parts store.
(2) Replace the old hose with a heavy-duty hydraulic line of identical inside
diameter, available at a hydraulic/heavy-equipment parts dealer.

For more, check the archives!

Cheers,
