Subject: T2, finals and procrastination

Well I am writing finals and of course the Westie is the perfect source
for procrastination. Some may remember my 78 hardtop that I redid
the roof panelling in with translucent panels and neon lights.

The yellow rubberduckie has been rustired.
So I figured that I would move some stuff over to the poptop.
The little 12v interior light thats about 12" long has been gutted
now and two neon blue lights installed inside it. Seemless and
unknown to the outside viewer. Controllable from the front
light switch or from the back.  Two neon circular tubes (white)
have beenblended into the rear white plastic cover for the rear
hatch hinges (red and blue). A soft purple neon hides above the
rear right cabinent to throw a gentle light for romantic evening
interludes.  At night, turn them on and there is more light using
less juice than ever, enough to read by easily actually.

I also picked up a coleman grill/stove to replace the stove I took
out since I wanted to replace the fridge/stove with a seat for the
kids.  Underneath it lurks a koolatron electric cooler.. much more
efficient than the old fridge that would kill a battery in no time.

Also stuck new seat covers/pads on the front seats.. wisest and
most comfy thing I could ever spend money on.

The KYB shocks in the rear are doing wonderful.

If there is interest I will post some night pictures
Oh, and the Finals are doing good too ;)
