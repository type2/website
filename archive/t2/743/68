Yes.

Yes. I would simply crimp the terminal to the wire.

Hard to locate. I can sell you one if you can't find any. I have or or two left.

That probably will work but I haven't tried it. k-type termocouple wire which is what the DD gauge uses is color coded red/yellow according to a standard. What color is the VDO harness?

The voltage produced by the wire is very small in the mV range. If you mix and match k-type and j-type you upset the reading. Seebeck's law governs thermocouples:

You can spice in wire as long as both ends of the wire are at the same temperature...
