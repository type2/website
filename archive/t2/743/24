Subject: Re: [T2] oil filter not cooler in engine bay

Craig,

Thanks for pointing out an error in my post wherein I stated "..the cooler 
hangs from the top of the engine bay". I meant to say the "oil filter hangs 
from the top of the engine bay." Not the best location even for a filter but 
it's been that way for 30 years or so although a location outside the engine 
bay is on my list.

....  which brings us back to coolers: the poster who stated his cooler is
 'hanging from the top of the engine compartment' and still gets too
 hot  - bingo. this  is like running a hair dryer at 1500 watts in
 there; ......
