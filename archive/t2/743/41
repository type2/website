Googling "devil-dog northwest-electric" reveals (barely) that it's some sort
of antique car alarm.

Googling "devil-dog alarm" reveals further that:
(1) It uses a basic motion sensor to detect attempts at "theft"
(2) It apparently uses the vehicle's horn as the alarm "siren"
(3) It was standard equipment on the Plymouth Roadrunner in the late 1960s

So, anyway, there you have it...
