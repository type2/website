Subject: Re: [T2] accelerator pump tube

I believe that you can run without the accel pump tube without much 
problem - I do.  If you find another, it will possibly, maybe likely, 
just fall out, and into the engine, too.

Your black smoke and backfiring is normal for the 3/2 PDSIT (kidding).  
They are a bit of a challenge to tune properly.
