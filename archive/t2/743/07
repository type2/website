I am the one who posted the 9.1 c. ratio & you are exactly right in
assessing the credentials of my engine builder, respected, expensive,
obsessive comp. Gene Berg protigi, bug racing motor guy.

My criteria to him for this bus engine was "BOMBPROOF" engine for long road
trips to shows, etc.  It runs well around town & has great torque on
hills-can go over 7000 ft elev. passes in 4th gear which I was in 2nd or 2rd
on before, but does get to 230 + when driving over 55 mph for over 15-20
minutes in warm, dry weather. I have 6000 miles on the engine ($2800) & need
for it to last.

But I am questioning the wisdom of this engine in a DC w/ tilt  & roof rack
also!
