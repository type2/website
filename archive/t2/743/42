Subject: Re: [T2] oil coolers, heat and etc

I was wondering about my CR. I didn't know about it when I built my
1776 in my 62. I have stock dual port heads, and I believe the deck
height was set to standard height. Any idea what my CR is?

 what is your compression ratio? i saw someone (gns?) was
 running 9:1 in a 1776 - WAAAAY too high for a bus motor in my
 opinion. i know, all the bug guys will tell you they build motors
 (sorry, engines) like that all day long w/ no problems, but how long
 do they last?  do they put them in  a bus? do the ones in their bugs
 need external coolers?  i would say 7.5:1 is as high as i would go in
 a bus - but that's me. i run 7.0:1. YMMV. But if you have that high a
 CR and you run hot, i'd say you need to examine the logic behind
 those numbers.
