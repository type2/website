That is the accelerator pump tube, if missing it has
most likley been ate by the engine, if you are lucky
it missed the intake valve on the way in the cylinder
and missed the exhaust valve on the way out, if
pinched by one of the valves you might get a burnt
valve out of it or it might not hurt anything, have
you done a compression test on that side of the engine
to see if you have any valve damage from the tube
going through. Phil
