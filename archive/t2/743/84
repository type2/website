Hi,

Friday subject i suppose.

Bus has been running great for the past few days, still stumbles and
drops to a low idle when I'm coming to a stop, often stalling, but I
can seem to get it idling that low while I'm under the hatch.

A fellow air colled fellow folled me to my house a few minutes ago to
let me know I had a brake light out. Don't know what kind of car it
was, don't know too much about vw's beside busses, but it had air
intakes and engine in the rear.

How nice of him.

peace
jules
