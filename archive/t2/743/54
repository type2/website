Subject: RE: [T2] VDO Oil Temp Sender

     This is where I mounted mine on the engine that was in my 74.  
Clearance with the oil dipstick was tight (that's where it ends up).  If you 
can get it in there just right it seems to work fine though.  The risk is 
that you mess up the placement and it doesn't let you put the dipstick in 
all the way. As I recal you want to place it toward the front of the plate.  
This seems to connect to the rest of the sump area so It should mantain 
similar temps, and all I use those guages for are trends and general info 
anyway.
