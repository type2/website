Dear list,

   Well since I am thouroughly discouraged with
workinging on my bus. I guess I am going to stop for a
while.  

  One thing i happened to notice is that on the left
carb 32pdist3  has a small brass tub where the gas
comes out when the accelerator is pressed.  The right
carb however doesn't have this small brass tube.  The
gass seems to trickle out from somewhere.  I can see
the gas trickling over where the top airflow jet is. 
This doesn't seem right?

Is there supposed to be a small brass tube where the
gas comes out?

Where did it go if there is?

jason
