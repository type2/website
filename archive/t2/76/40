Subject: Re: [T2] Westy interior panel patterns

Russell,

Thanks for making the patterns. I don't mind adding the files to my website
and since I work here at home on Autocad I can plot the drawings and mail
them to people too.

I have learned a lot from making my website, but I am not sure the best way
to make a download of these files available from my website. If anybody has
advice on how to do that I can have the drawings available in no time!

(Russell send me the files in ACAD14 format)
