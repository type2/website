"CV grease is the only type of grease that will

grease all the way throught the CV by hand."

I haven't done quite as many CV joints as Rick, but I do have a nifty little 
trick for doing the actual greasing of CV joints.  Place your new (or 
absolutely clean old) CV on a piece of plastic wrap.  Just the usual kitchen 
variety plastic wrap (like Saran wrap).  You should have enough plastic wrap 
(about a foot of it) to completly bundle up the CV joint.  Then add a big 
dollop of moly (CV) grease and close up the plastic wrap around the CV joint. 
 Secure with a rubber band.  THEN work the grease through the joint.  You'll 
find that you can actually get "pressure " on the grease and force it into 
all the little cavities between the balls.  It makes for a much better job 
than doing it "freehand".  What's more you keep your hands clean in the 
process.
