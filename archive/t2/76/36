Subject: [T2] Westy interior panel patterns

I've completed and checked patterns for the sliding door and rear hatch
panels.  These are based on my 71 Westy, and, I expect, will be applicable
for 68 thru 72, and possibly others as well.  So now I need someone to step
forward and provide space on their webpage to load these files so list
members can access them. Perhaps the Type2.com page can accomodate this.
These pattern files are presently in AutoCad 2000 .dwg format, but I can
convert to AutoCad 14 .dwg and/or .dxf - whatever the consensus determines
to be the most desireable format.

Hal will be tracing additional panels and sending them to me in the future,
so, before too long I expect there will be a complete set of patterns
available.
