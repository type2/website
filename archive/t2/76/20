Although I have gotten fair results on a 1.7 and a 2.0 liter with a 
009 the vac dizzy is preferable. The 009 does not advance early 
enough or far enough for a really smooth pass through rpm range. In a 
pinch it will do well enough to get you home. BTW, the closest thing 
to chrome on any of my buses is duct tape :)
