Next time mine are out I'll put together a full description.  For those 
who cannot wait, just get a piece of cardboard and make a pattern to 
meet your needs.  I used 1/4 masonite for the shelves with a 1/2 x 1 
inch pine strip as the lip.  Cover with naugahyde or whatever you 
please.  The shelves are mirror-images of each other, so once you get 
one done (I suggest you start with the driver's side) you can simply 
flip it over for the other side.

My "brackets" are simply hooks bent from 1/8 welding rod that attach to 
existing screws in the vent ducts and e-brake hanger.  The outboard aft 
hooks are simply double-ended hooks as there are no screws here, but 
there is a lip under the dash.
