Subject: Distributor saga report

Finally got the vacuum distributor on my 74
westy.  The dizzy is actually from a 73 manual,
but I checked the advance curves and there almost
the same.  It replaced a kewl-bitchin'-009.  The
009 was terrible.  Bad hesitation at low RPM
required really winding it up just to move even
on flat ground.  (Maybe the 009's only work if
you have the clear caps or sufficient chrome on
your engine.)

I also adjusted valves and checked plugs while I
was in there.  More to do, but I needed to get
the bus out of the garage for awhile so I can put
Christmas decorations back in the attic.  Also,
the kids are dying to sleep out again in the bus,
with an electric heater of course.  

The vacuum dizzy makes the bus run so much
better.  The hesitation is gone.  Hard to stall
the bus now and it pulls very well throughout the
RPMs.  Perhaps those VW engineers knew what they
were doing.  

Muchos gracias to Clark Grizwald Gordon for the
chance to rummage through his parts bin and to
Big Al Brase for his phone consult.  Youse guys
are da best!
