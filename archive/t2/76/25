Hi Volks,

Old cars? My 2001 *hevy Malibu had the ignition switch in the dash. The
brochure said it was a European influence.

It might be easiest for you to simply disable the steering lock and move the
ignition switch. That way you no longer have to turn the key at all.

Personally, I can't imagine a tilt wheel in a bus - I need that horizontal
axis to allow my arms to generate the torque to turn the wheel. When I drive
my Dad's Canagon westy I'm forever banging my elbows into the window.  Or
perhaps it's just that me front tires were under-inflated.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
