There is a nylon strap that goes through the loop on the wall, over the 
top of the tire, and through the center hole of the tire.  There is a 
plastic piece that protects the nylon from the center hole of the rim, 
and a metal buckle to tighten the whole thing down.  You could 
duplicate this setup functionally with common nylon webbing and a 
plastic buckle.
