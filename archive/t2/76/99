Subject: saggy back end

Just thought I might mention a minor advantage when having a 'saggy' back 
end on your bus.

Our back end sags....a bit, but when we are both sat in the front the bus 
runs level.

With the back end slightly lower the drive shafts are straighter which means 
less drive shaft wear. A minor point I know but significant.

I have seen buses running with a very high rear which, I would imagine will 
eventually result in CV's failing prematurely.

Personally, I amd quite happy with the slight sag and when I reassembled the 
rear suspension it was set up as per Bentley so the sag is definately down 
to tired torsion bars.

Maybe one day I'll put it up a degree.....one day....maybe.
