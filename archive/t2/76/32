Subject: Re: [T2] Spare tire hold down?

I believe the transporters came with the plastic tire cover and the Westy's
came with the gold vinyl tire cover, at least from 68-73. The vinyl tire
cover is harder to come by, but are sometimes found on Eb(-at-)y for about 15-25
bucks. I got sick of removing the tire everytime we went camping though. I
can't wait to add my Adventure top so I can hide the spare on the roof
(strapped down of course!)

The 73 front emblem is smaller than the 68-72 emblem and was the same from
73-79.

When you retro a spare tire holder onto the front of your bus  you drill out
the holes the emblem was attached to for the spare tire carrier.

The emblem had clips on the back to attach it. The po of my bus used little
screws drilled through the emblem (after bondoing the holes shut) and it
doesn't look too bad unless you get close.
