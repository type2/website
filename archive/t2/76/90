Subject: rear end hangs low! (no, not mine!)

hello,

when i bought my westy not too long ago, all four
shocks where beat. thus i had all four of them
replaced with KYB Gas-A-Just's. now however i see that
the rear end of my bus seems to ride lower than the
front. whats the deal? i had a local shop order and
install these, do you suppose they might have put
front shocks on the back? how would i check this? any
input will be greatly appreciated!
