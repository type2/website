It is on the bottom of the engine (right front) below tin level, which 
means (to me at least) that it is not "in the engine bay", but neither is 
it attached to the bulkhead.  It should have three hoses coming out of it 
(one is a small drain hose).

It shouldn't be very difficult at all.  Simply disconnect the hose at both 
ends and pull it through the front tin piece.  It goes through near where 
the tin meets the engine case on the right side (at least in US spec 
'74's).  There should be a grommet in the tin to protect the fuel line.
