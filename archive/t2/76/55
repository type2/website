Wishful thinking!

Speaking from experience of having survived three major accidents in bay
window busses (1. Hitting a cow 2. Complete rollover on a turn, and 3. A
rear end collision by a 1 ton truck)  What ever you are carrying (even if
its being held down securely) will be trying to get air borne, and possibly
make it through your windshield.
