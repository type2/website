Ah, Charlevoix.  Does that guy still have an Amphicar perchen on top of his
yatch?

Has anyone ever tried installing a non-VW steering column in their bus?  The
column in my 76 has a host of problems, some inflicted by me, others just
there.  I thought it would be nice to put in something different, tilt wheel
maybe!  Several reasons to do this.  I don't like where the key is.  My hand
is too fat to turn the key comfortably(I know, waaa).  I don't like the
placement of the wipers.  I need a new surround as I tore the other one off
not knowing how to get it off when I replaced the ignition switch.  And I
wasn't kidding about tilt wheel.  I saw it in a Corvair Greenbrier once, it
was a great idea.  So, any ideas?

Thanks.
