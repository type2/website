Subject: Spare tire hold down?

After sweating over body and painbt for several months, I decided to move my
spare off the nose, where is dented the sheet metal, and into its original
location.  I got the two little rubber bumpers that bolt to the wall, and
the plastic tire cover.  But isn't there something that holds the wheel up
against the wall?  I haven't seen anything in my hunting.

Regards,

Grant
