Guys,

I finally bought one of those "cheesy" looking bearing greasers
to try out.  You know, the ones that look like two small woks
mated to one another with a pressure fitting on one side.

When my son did his for his karman ghia, we tried the "greaser".

We looked the bearing over closely afterward and I thought it looked
pretty well "greased".  I think I paid all of $5.00 for it.

Just a thought.

Cheers, dave
