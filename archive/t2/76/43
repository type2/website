Any advice on this?

Also, when my windshield was replaced I was told there was a lot of rust in
the body.  I hear this is common.  Anyway, rain is starting to come into the
cab area and some rust is visible from under the seal.

At one of the on-line parts under I saw an "inner rust repair panel (pair)"
under a body-parts/windshield category.  What is this for?
