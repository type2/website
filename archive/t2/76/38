Subject: Yet another fuel hose question, for '74 Campmobile

'appy New Year to all,

Quick question to clarify a point that I can't be sure of from Bentley's, if
I may?

My '74 dual  carb Type 4 powered Campmobile ( 2L now, but still using the
1800 case, I believe ) recently started using more fuel & leaving a strong
petrol smell when I switch her off. As she's not the day-to-day
drive-to-work car, and I haven't had much chance to go anywhere OTHER than
work of late, she's hardly been run of late, and when I went down to start
her & give her a bit of a run tonight she started spewing petrol at an
alarming rate, but only when the engine's running.

Most of the fuel lines are dry & solid down to what I THOUGHT was the fuel
pump, on the front of the engine bulkhead, with one old & dodgy looking
hose, which appears to be leaking, going up & I presume into the engine bay.
Bentley's says the fuel pump is at the front right of the engine, which
SOUNDS like it should be in the engine bay, itself. Is the fuel pump what I
believe it to be (on the front of the engine bulkhead), or is it in the
engine bay itself?

Also, to replace the fuel hose from the pump (if I'm correct) up & into the
engine bay, are there any tricks to allow ordinary mortals to do it with the
engine intact, or do you have to be a contortionist, or remove some engine
parts to get in to replace the hose & hose clips?

Thanking you in anticipation.

Regards,
