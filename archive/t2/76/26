Subject: Re: [T2] Spare tire hold down?

Hiya Grant,

Like so many other parts on our Busses the particulars of your spare tire 
hold-down device will depend on the production year of your Bus.  

George sent you a description of the securing system for later Baywindows.  
In the earlier models (mine is a 70) the securing system consisits of two 
pieces.  One is a convoluted bolt which threads through a plate.  The plate 
holds the wheel in place while the bolt is run into the side of the body and 
screwed tight.

Truth be told, I've been operating without either the bolt or the plate and 
everything is just fine.  The tire does not wiggle around, make noise, or 
pose any threat of escaping.  And with the plastic cover in place, who will 
ever know?
