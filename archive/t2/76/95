Subject: VW welding:

How about a visit to your local friendly welding shop? Pay the nice man his
hourly rate for an hour lesson and any materials. Be sure and bring your own
hood, gloves, etc. Wear the right closes, hat, shoes, etc, Be totally
prepared, don't make him wait on you. Ask ahead of time what he would have
you bring, and be fifteen minuets early. In an hour you can get pretty good
with a MIG welder. Tell him what you plan to do with it, sheet metal (body
work) etc. and concentrate on that.
    Go back if necessary with each new piece of equipment you buy (cutting
torch, stick welder, TIG welder, etc.) if you need to. Just remember, the
key is practice, practice, practice! There are several good DIY books out
there (buy at welding supply houses).
    Good luck, and remember "A good weldor has a hot rod"! ;-)
