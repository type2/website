Subject: Re: [T2] Spare tire hold down?

Hi.
My 73 has the strap type hold down like the one George described.
While we're talking about this, I'm doing the same relocation of the spare.
The 73 doesn't have the hard plastic cover, but a vinyl covering, isn't that
correct? Are they available? And what type emblem, if any did the 73 Westy
have on the front? Did it use the same type of fasteners as the Bugs? I see
no provision for the emblem on the front of my bus.
Thanks,

Tom
