Subject: EveryBus 2002 volunteer needed

Over the last 3 years EveryBus has grown from a whimsical idea into 
one of the biggest bus events on the East Coast. Last years turnout 
was 121 buses. Who knows what EB02 will bring.  This year we may set 
up an overflow area in the group campground adjacent to the main 
loop. The combined facility should be able to accommodate 200 buses. 
The park staff we be stationing full time personal in the area to 
keep the trash cans empty and bathhouses in tip top shape.

Over the next eight weeks I will be sending out the call for 
volunteers to help with various pre-event work and on-site details. 
The first call is for someone with Adobe Acrobat that help put 
together a pdf file for an EveryBus flyer that can be downloaded from 
the web site. The purpose of the flyer is to allow web site visitors 
to print an event document that they use to distribute in their local 
area. If you have the software, the skills and the time please e-mail 
me.
