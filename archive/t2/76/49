This is the only good choice. Schofield in the UK
offers a repair panel for this area, or you may be
able to source one through Busted Bus, though I don't
know if they'll source used body panels. Yes, it's
harder to do and somewhat more costly, but your end
result will last longer and be stronger.

This is so untrue. I've seen huge numbers of bays with
rust only in this area, which are very worth saving.
This previous comment sounds to me like something I'd
hear from a splitty snob.

Please don't do this to your prized bus. Bondo has its
uses, but this isn't one of them. Go for the steel
fix, it's worth the effort.
