Excellent idea.  I've removed the snap ring without this tool, but not 
voluntarily.  another trick that I use is to use a small file to put a 
concave surface on the inner aspect of the split of the snapring to 
allow the snap ring pliars to push on them without slipping.  I stick a 
phillips screwdriver in the hole in the end of the axle to prevent the 
snapring from flying away if it slips.

I've found that the boot keeps the joints in line if you don't release 
the flange from the CV.  You have to turn the CV quite a ways to 
release the balls.  Putting a CV back together is not too difficult, 
but is probably not a puzzle one wants to attempt while trying to get a 
bus back on the road!

I don't do a complete cleaning unless the boot has a big tear in it.  
If I catch the boot failure when it is just weeping grease, I just wipe 
the grease out of the CV with a lot of clean paper towels and repack.  
I feel that I introduce more grunge with a complete cleaning than would 
remain without cleaning.

The best way I've found of doing a complete cleaning is to wipe 
everything clean with paper towels and then wash them with dish soap 
and warm water.  Rinse with hot water and dry right away.  Coat with a 
thin layer of CV grease before reassembling.  Surgical cleanliness is 
important during reassembly.

I've never had a problem with this, but I usually don't take them 
apart.  The manuals say that you shouldn't mix balls from CV to CV, but 
it may not be good to even move a ball from one groove to another.  One 
can keep track of the proper indexing of the outer race, hub, and 
balls, but it can get tricky.

Best advice before starting one's CV adventure:  Wear surgical gloves, 
and have several extra pair available.  You'll find this to be a 
greasy, greasy, job!
