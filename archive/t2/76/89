This is the best advise I have seen in a long time------
Figure out what the process takes first, then go on a buying spree----

Oxy-acet, with good old fashioned coat hanger is good, but warps
everything in sight------allot of wet rags are needed.

A Miller Matic mig welder is about the best bang for the buck------

Forget stick welding sheet metal-----big warpation---hole blowing is
part of the game----big pain.

I like the college schooling thing--you'll learn allot, without making
the misteaks on your own------

Later,

E-mail message From George=A0Lyle 

I need to fix some bondo spot and am looking at getting a welder for
X-mas. 
What is the difference between and arc welder and mig welder? 
arc welder takes skill, even I can use a mig welder ;8*} 

If you have to ask the question, you should run, not walk, to your local
community college and take an introductory welding course! Make your
mistakes on their equipment and figure out what you want before you drop
big bucks! 
George, who can gas weld OK, but hasn't tried any of the new-fangled
stuff.
