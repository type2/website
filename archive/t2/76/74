Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Oil light flickers on new rebuild. UPDATE

History: New rebuilt 1600 SP doghouse engine DR case.
Symptom: Poor oil pressure at idle once hot.

I think I have found the problem. I removed the NEW oil pump today to check
it and found three things.

1) The backlash was excessive. The Wilson book says there should be no
audible clicking between the gears when wiggled holding one gear stationary.
There was way too much motion. (crappy manufacture) I dug out the old oil
pump and checked, and it is much better with over 100,000 miles of use. I
wish I had saved the box to give you guys a heads up on the brand name.

2) The shaft for the driven gear should be slightly recessed. On this one,
there was actually a outward portion of metal remaining that was holding the
cover plate away from the housing. (crappy manufacture).

3) The gears measured 21mm! Two idiots involved: The flaps guy that sold me
the wrong part and the builder (me) who did not check. :-(

I ordered a standard 26mm pump from Clyde Berg today and really think this
will solve the problem. Fingers crossed. Thanks for all the help and input.
