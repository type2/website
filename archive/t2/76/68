Hello all,
I was planning on making my own Parcel Tray in my '72 Westy (can't =
afford $160 for a new set.=20
http://www.bus-boys.com/bbaccess.htm#parcel ) but I lack specific =
details on the making of said=20
tray.  More specifically, I need dimensions.  Width, length, length and =
placement of brackets,=20
that type of thing.  But if someone has detailed pictures or =
descriptions or even a copy of the=20
installation instructions, that would be helpful.=20
We recently had a discussion on interior panels and making a template =
using a CAD program. =20
Something like that would be great, though I lack the CAD skills.

Thanks,
-Paul
-'72 Westy
