I do the same thing with my CVs but using a large zip lock bag.
Drop the CV in
Drop the grease in
Seal up and squeeze away.
Also works good for storing a set of lubed up and ready to go CVs
Imagine the looks on my neighbors face when he picked up this HEAVY baggie full
of grease.
"What the heck is in that bag".
