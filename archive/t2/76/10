Thanks for the advice, George.  I certainly wouldn't feel confident enough
to go tapping into a carb, especially not two of them!  I'll call Topline
and see what the cost is to have it done, IF I do it at all.  It's running
great right now with the carbs properly adjusted, and the timing set
correctly.

Thanks,
