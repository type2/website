Subject: Re: [T2] Spare tire hold down?

Hiya All,

A little earlier in this thread I wrote.............

"Truth be told, I've been operating without either the bolt or the plate

and

everything is just fine.  The tire does not wiggle around, make noise, or

pose any threat of escaping."

Well, since then I've taken a few (very polite) hits from other list members 
concerning the obvious lack of safety considerations in my original reply.  
Guilty as charged!  I dunno what I was thinking.  Those of you who pointed 
out the obvious flaw in my reasoning are absolutely correct.  Anything as 
heavy and as potentially lethal as a spare tire definitely needs to be 
secured.  I'm already at work getting mine bolted in.

A little humbler but a little smarter,

Mike
