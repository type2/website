You may need to adjust the angle or bend of the bowden tube. This is
covered in Bentley...

All I can say is that every clutch cable I've used on my '73 (well, that's

it's no big deal since using every last thread seems to allow the proper
adjustment, but it is tiring turning that wing nut off and on that far.
