Subject: Odd rust-thru under front bumper tube, 78

While replacing the clutch cable, I noticed severe rust-through in a
hard to see area under the front shield- between the front floor and the
bumper "tube" that is welded to the main body side frame on each side.
It is an interim wall that is continuous with the cavity behind the
front kick panels, and has a 1" drain hose sticking out the center.  I
suspect water has been getting in somewhere and collecting in the
bottom- anyone see this occur? There is no rust visible under the
windshield seal, but even if it were bad, isn't there a lip that
wouldn't let water in??  May be it's getting in by the vent flaps?  Now
I gotta pull the kick panels (which have speakers and fiberglass batting
behind them) to see what's happening.
