Hi Ned,

I do have an Aux battery, but the reason I put the tank below the  
battery tray was GRAVITY. I wanted to be sure that when the engine  
was off the water would run back to the tank rather than get siphoned  
into the engine.

Happy Trails,

Greg,

Would love to see how you did it. I'm interested in knowing if the  
vacuum
line to the distributor will be the best place. I think last time this
thread was going around it was determined that the best place to put the
needle in would be around the throttle casing. Also, not sure if you  
have an
auxiliary battery. Would that be a suitable place for the tank?
