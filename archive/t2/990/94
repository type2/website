Subject: Re: [T2] Mind if I smoke?

I just took her fro a ride up into the mountains to run an errand - man that
steering and those shock make for a nicer drive. When I got her back down to
the office, there was no smoke at all, so I guess it all did burn off.

The only other thing that still is popping up us her inability to start
right up without a few more turns than necessary. She fired up and died this
morning, then fired and low idled, then the idle came up.

I can't help but wonder if there is still another vacuum leak that I can't
find.

Any thought?
