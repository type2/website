I don't know which bushings you guys are talking about (missed the
beginning of the thread)....  but I needed to get the metal spacers
out from a set of old shocks (the new shocks spacer's were's the
proper inner diameter)...  I made a "press" using threaded rod.  bent
the rod...

finally set the shocks down on the floor, and put the map gas torch on
them.  the rubber bushings that were holding the metal spacers in
burned...  they fell right out.

don't know if this helps...
