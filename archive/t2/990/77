Okay, WTH - I might as well say it: Is the ecu wire on
the correct coil terminal? -BaH

 the continuing saga of the 78 2liter FI engine.  I

 have gone thru the troubleshooting guide step by
 step
 (remember this was a working engine before putting a
 new long block in.)
 
 every step.
 
. test light at injector does not flicker weakly.
 
 . double relay works fine (35psi fuel presure)
 . trigger impulse is present at term #1 of control
 unit
 . correct voltage on pins # 10-5  10-16 and 10-17
 
 conclusion, control unit defective
 
 but I have several spares and have tried em, what
 are the odds of 6
 control units having the same defect???  I've never
 seen a bad control
 unit in almost 20 years of driving a FI VW....
 
 still at none of the injector plugs do I get the
 "weak flicker" and I've
 seen it often enough to know what it looks like...
 
 what else is left, nice fat spark, lots of presure,
 engine will start and
 run on ether, (for a moment or so)
 
 ????????
 
 thanks
