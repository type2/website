It might be nice to pull the plugs and squirt a little
oil in the cylinders - turn the engine by hand with
the plugs out - the first turn, then spin it with the
starter for a moment... put plugs back in and fire it
up. Warm it up, don't worry about the lifters making
noise, drive around the block a few times, then drain
and change oil, filter. -BaH

 Well, my daily driver, a '73 Safare w/ a 2L
 Hydraulic has sat quietly  
 unmoving in front of  my house while I've been
 traveling with work  
 for the last few months. It hasnt been started or
 anything in that  
 entire time. The battery seems to be fine all the
 lights come on etc  
 on dash, however I was wondering what protocol would
 be recommended  
 to make that first start the least painful for her.
 I'm going to assume the lifters will take a long
 time to pump up and  
 I dont want to have a particularly hard start.
 
 Any and all tips on what I should do before I start
 up my bus would  
be appreciated. You tell'em to me and I will make it
 happen ;) I was

 all my hoses  
were in good shape, should I do a cold oil change ?
 
 Thanks !
