Subject: Flatbed tower in the DC area?

Hello folks
  I've been keeping my bus at a friends house while I was rebuilding
the engine.  Now the engine is about ready to go back into the bus,
but I need to find a way to get the bus back to my house.  So can
anyone suggest someone who would be willing to tow the bus from
Brunswick Md to Washington DC?
Thanks in advance!
