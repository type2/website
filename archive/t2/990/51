Subject: Westy propane tank

Hi folks.

Thanks for the responses to my query about a propane
tank for my '74 Westy a while ago.

I ended up getting a nice used one from Busted Bus. The
mounting brackets on the tank don't line up with anything
on the  bus. I can easily make adapters to fit it but I wonder
if anyone has any pictures of the stock mounting. I'd like to
make mine look as stock as possible.

Thanks.
