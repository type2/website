won't fit thru the top, but you could use a crane to pull the engine and
lower it onto a dolly.

balance point is about where the 2&4 exhaust ports are. of course this is
affected by some things like the weight of the muffler or flywheel if one
or both are there.  also weather it is an automatic or a manual has a lot
to do with the angles and how far it has to go etc.

if the engine were on the ground (Type IV engine) you need about 6-8 more
inches so you only need to raise it that much plus the height of whatever
it is on top of. dolly/jack etc.
