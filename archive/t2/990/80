I am not sure how I ever kept my VW's running before there was the type 2
list.

  I took a deep breathe and slept on it, checked the wires to the various
plugs and found a bent contact in the CPU plug, straightened it out, and
swapped in a spare Resistor pack.

and she fired right up.  don't really think it was the resistors but I'm
putting my money on the bad connector because it was one of the key signal
wires.

in any case it is now running, on to tuning it and getting the glass fixed
so I can drive the bugger.....still don't think I will be able to make
Buses of the Corn, used all my vacation time getting it running now don't
have any to go anywhere with it

thanks again to all, this list is a blessing
