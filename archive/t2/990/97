Also a few things I shouldve noted to begin with.
1) The house where the bus resides is being sold so I need to get it
off that property soon
2)  The bus also needs several things replaced/repaired (tires,
gastank, brakes, etc) before it is road-worthy so bringing the engine
to the bus like many folks have suggested isn't going to work.  (Tho
it is a good idea)
Thanks again
