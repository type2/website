The answer is, frankly, no.  I live in a yuppie bedroom community with
thousands of young adults whose pockets are just bulging with disposable
income.  A couple of months after VW launched its "New Rabbit" our VW
dealer closed.  They said that they had only sold four cars in the
previous two months.  The space is a lot more profitable now as the
used-car branch of the adjacent Nissan dealership.  If a VW dealership
cannot survive in yuppieville, VW is doomed in the US.

Other than the New Beetle, what does VW offer to draw customers?  The
"quirky little car" market is already satisfied by the Mini and Scion xB.
A rebadged Chrysler minivan will hardly draw customers when the same
vehicle can be had cheaper down the street at the Chrysler dealer.  VW has
justifiably lost its reputation for quality, customer service, and
reliability.  Talk to anyone who owns a modern VW and you'll likely hear
a horror story of a car that let them down along with the nightmare of
trying to get their VW dealer to fix it.

I truly enjoy my vintage VWs, but I'd never buy a new VW.
