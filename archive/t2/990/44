Nice looking beads on top of the metal Jamie.

Your getting just about what one of them little mig buzz boxes produces.
Not much penetration top loaded beads.

Welding up them hitches is working that welder to it's max--and maybe
beyond it's capacity.

You have a tough time cooking them beads flat, and into the material.
