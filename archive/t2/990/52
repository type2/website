Amateur hour is next week... If your guys want to see pictures of how I
weld, we may be able to get Stiles to sell it as "abstract" art... VERY
abstract.

I agree with Don though. We got the pimp welders around here, but no real
display of how they use there skills to teach us rookies.

Common folks, we can't all rely on Ratwell to be the end-all of
information..

Who's with me?! AAARRRRRR!!!!!
