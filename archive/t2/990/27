That would make a good story at parties till someone tells you they have the
same bus they bought for $20,000 less! Maybe they gold-plated the muffler,
put in a velour headliner and it comes with your own mechanic.

After it sits on theSamba for 6 months the price may fall.

And it's had damage from the spare "repaired"? $25k?

Must be a Missouri thing... heh
