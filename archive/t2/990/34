Hi Ned,

I posted some pics of the WI setup here:

I think that putting the needle directly into the throttle body would  
be OK, but since this throttle body already has a vacuum port on it,  
it's working OK for me.


Happy Trails,

Greg,

Would love to see how you did it. I'm interested in knowing if the  
vacuum
line to the distributor will be the best place. I think last time this
thread was going around it was determined that the best place to put the
needle in would be around the throttle casing. Also, not sure if you  
have an
auxiliary battery. Would that be a suitable place for the tank?
