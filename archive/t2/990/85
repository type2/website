Keep in mind this bus hasn't been driven regularly in a LONG time. You
may just be burning off the crap that's collected over the years and
stuck to any oil film on the engine or exhaust. Particularly greasy
hand marks.

I'd not worry about it much until you've got a couple hundred miles on
the clock (always keeping an eye on oil levels of course).
