Hmm.  This is going to sound kinda off the wall..  Is there a way to 
check the signal to the injector further up the wiring harness?  Above a 
connector perhaps?  You've had engine out and in (yes I've been reading 
the saga and wishing I lived closer) several times and since you've put 
it in it's been giving you fits.  It might be that while the connectors 
were apart some corrosion has set in, a spider may have made it's home 
in a connector.  something is preventing signal from brain to injector.

6 control boxes in a row all exhibiting the same fault might be possible 
if you had a british somethingorother made by Lucas but bus FI systems 
seem a bit more robust.  If you followed the Bentley troubleshooting 
from go to whoa and everything checks out, yet still have no signal to 
the injectors I would start to suspect a wonky connector, probably 
upstream from any 1 or 2 injectors on a side, else you would get fuel on 
1 side or the other. 

Check the pins where the connectors go into the brain, making sure they 
are all straight and clean.  check the inside of the connector the pins 
go into.  check all the connectors from the brain to the injector.  I 
would start closest to the brain and go downstream from there.  Only 
other thing I can think of would be bad engine to chassis ground.

This is just a thought from far away, not being able to see, but with 
the advantage of an objective outlook.
