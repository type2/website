I didn't say anything about speed.  To put it another way, an excellent
craftsman can often work around the deficiences of inferior equipment and
produce decent results.  Give that inferior equipment to ordinary folks
and the results will be invariably bad.  Thus, it pays to buy good
equipment.

I think that a duty cycle of 20% is abysmally small.  Even an amateur will
spend more time than that actively welding.
