Subject: Mind if I smoke?

I have been so excited about getting my steering pin finished that I decided
to drive Zoey to work. It felt great to hear that engine hum at 80. Trudging
up hills, passing semis, it was wonderful.

Only one thing concerned me when I got to the office. When I parked, there
was a faint waft of smoke coming our both upper vents that strangely
resembled me trying to do my algebra homework in high school.

Now baring in mind that this is the first real "work" this engine has done
in some time (6 years at least), with all the vacuum leaks and what not, and
the fact that I did have a little oil leaking into the engine compartment
(not related to the engine oil at ALL). Could the smoke simply be oils that
has been in random places on the engine that has not had a chance to burn
off? You know, from work I have been doing and being sloppy?

It smelled like oil, I just have no idea why else the smoke would be coming
out.
