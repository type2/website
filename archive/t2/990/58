Hi, I put a tach in the hole for the clock, and under the radio, I put 
in an oil temp.gage, bat. level gage, and an oil pressure gauge.  The 
tach is one from Canadian tire, the other gages are VDO gages from 
California Imports.For the oil temp. gage I used a sending unit that 
replaces the oil drain plug. Very simple but effective. For the oil 
pressure gage I bought a rubber extension hose to get around the 
clearance problem for the sending unit. The best thing I ever did to 
keep track of the vitals.
