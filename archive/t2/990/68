Subject: Re: [T2] 'We're Missing the Funkiness' Can VW Finally Find Its 

I agree- We looked at the Toureg (a heavy "tank") and wanting a 4WD, 
bought a Subaru Forester for $24,000- liked the low horizontally apposed 
engine- sorry, VW!
Shoulda launched the Mew Microbus!  My daughter (the next generation, 
has a 75 bus) is sad they did not..........VW is not listening to its 
dealers

"Dealers think VW blew a golden opportunity when it chose not to 
introduce an updated version of the wildly popular Microbus from the 
'60s and '70s. Instead, the company is launching a repackaged, 
Volkswagen-branded, Chrysler minivan. Casey Gunther, VW's top-selling 
U.S. dealer, in Coconut Creek, Fla., is worried. "We're missing the 
funkiness" that U.S. buyers expect from VW, he says. "The Germans don't 
understand." And unlike in Europe, affluent buyers don't see VW as an 
aspirational brand."

   I live in a yuppie bedroom community with
  thousands of young adults whose pockets are just bulging with disposable
  income.  A couple of months after VW launched its "New Rabbit" our VW
  dealer closed.  They said that they had only sold four cars in the
  previous two months.  The space is a lot more profitable now as the
  used-car branch of the adjacent Nissan dealership.  If a VW dealership
  cannot survive in yuppieville, VW is doomed in the US.

Other than the New Beetle, what does VW offer to draw customers?  The
  "quirky little car" market is already satisfied by the Mini and Scion xB.
  A rebadged Chrysler minivan will hardly draw customers when the same
  vehicle can be had cheaper down the street at the Chrysler dealer.
