Nice pics, Bernie.........I'd like to use the same unit that you describe, 
to monitor my crankcase oil temp via the sender in the oil drain plug. The 
Canadian Tire web site won't allow me past the screen that asks for my 
postal zone. I tried using their "example" designation, and it was also 
blocked.

So far, I can't access their product listings and search for the same gauge 
you mentioned. I tried searching for similar generic gauges, and found one 
with an upper limit of 300 degrees.  I'd be happier with a top limit of 400 
degrees, or at least 350.

If possible, could you tell me the top limit of your gauge, and perhaps 
supply a manufacturer name and product number that would permit me to do a 
wider search for a source?  Your set up is already in a bus and it works. 
I'd like to build on that positive experience with my US bus.
