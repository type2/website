You can't get anywhere inside the case from the breather tower, it is
blocked off with only a circuitous route to the sump below.

The access to the shavings created would be through the inspection plate on
the bottom of the case. The location of the top-mounted disptick hole is
directly above the so-called "taco plate".

You could also use a type 1 dipstick adapter on the case filler hole if you
have room for it.
