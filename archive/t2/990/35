<<An excellent craftsman can produce good results with poor equipment,>>

Huh---
With not much more than a 20% duty cycle outa that low dollar mig welder
it'll take one heck of a Craftsman to get any decent results----
You'll be working all of 20 minutes out of an hour --and napping for 40.

So I would be good deal if you had a case of  narcelepsey along with
being good at welding.
