just that.. charging voltage is too low

Nope... it's just that the charge voltage is too low and isn't 
triggering my battery isolator circuit.  If I'm correct, the running 
voltage should be somewhere around 13.5v to 14v

Nope.  Just engine running.. no lights, no radio.

prolly around 12.3 or something like that.  The battery is good.. and 
new.  Second battery, so I doubt it's the battery.

they're definitely not showing 13.5-14, which is what I'm going for.

The voltage drops to something like 12.5 or something..

> Does it charge at 14v now?

Nope.. that's the problem.
