Kent is looking at a worldwide market, and yes there may be someone out 
there that wants to buy his bus at that price.  I just about gave away 
a rare German panel van on the Samba, and I just took the highest offer 
after 2 weeks.  I received a few emails that said I had it listed way 
too low.

Also it doesn't take much searching to find far more outrageously 
priced buses for sale there.
