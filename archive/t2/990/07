Subject: I'm on my way to Portland!

If there's anyone on the way, lemme know.  It would be fun to meet some
t2 listees!  It's noon right now in Grant's Pass so I'm guessing it'll
be about a 4-5hr drive up the 5 from here (with all my random little stops).

pmail me or call (or txt) 562-810-7117.

later!
Mike
