One hopefully final question about installation...

I am using a Febi pin kit and it has a white gasket inside of the box. This
gasket also fits snuggly into th cap that fits on top of the whole assembly.

The problem that I am having is that if I put the white gasket thing inside
the cap and try to cinch the whole thing down, it seems as if I need the
weight of a aircraft carrier to get the whole system tight enough to get
that linkage bolt in.

Is tha whitle gasket supposed to go into the cap and them cinch down on the
whole system, OR does it go around the sides of the bore (where the bushings
are) and the cap is THEN pulled down tight onto it?

It seems that the density of this gasket is enough that two separate
heavy-duty clamps could not get the whole thing down.

And for anyone about to ask - YES, I am making sure the top of the clamps
are not also pinching the top of the pin - in esscense squeezing the pin
from top to bottom.

For that matter, this is the order that I have put all the rings in.

1. Big washer - same thickness as the protrusion of the upper bushing.

2. Spring washer

3. Small rubber/plasticy washer (for holding the grease into the bore with
the pin and bushings I think)

4. Metal washer (same diameter as the the small runner/plasticy one)

5. White gasket (it is flanged on one side)

6. Cap

7. Steering linkage

Is that the correct order?
