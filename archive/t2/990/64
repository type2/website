Before you get all panicky, first make sure that the box is centered
properly.  All steering boxes are sloppy when off-center, but the caster
of the steering system stops them from wobbling.

Also, check the joints in the drag link between the box and the swing
lever.  I played all sorts of games trying to get play out of the steering
before I realized that the drag link was bad.
