Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum hose for brake booster

Because the original hose is wire-reinforced to prevent collapsing, the only
usual source has been the dealer at an obscene price and is sold per meter.

On Bay Windows I've owned in the past and on my current Vanagons, I chose to
use oil cooler pressure hose, 1/2" ID that is supplied by EMPI or Bugpack
(Dee Engineering).  This hose is heavily reinforced for high pressure use
and does not collapse.  Been working great for me for the past two decades
now. Check your local VW FLAPS.

YMMV
