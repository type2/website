they were only apart about a week, but your right it has to be something
like a connector....

my thoughts exactly, never have seen a totally botched brain box.

right, no signal at any injector, and if even one was getting a signal it
would sputter and try to start... a wonky connector may be the only
reasonably thing left.  the trigger signal gets to the brain, connector #1
shows a trigger signal to the brain.

good point, I have been sticking probes into those connectors.

that is not likely as I have redundant ground connections, the stock one
and a direct cable to the bolt that holds the coil tight.  all new marine
wire.

right now even subjective is help, I was laying on the deck over the
