Greg,

Would love to see how you did it. I'm interested in knowing if the vacuum
line to the distributor will be the best place. I think last time this
thread was going around it was determined that the best place to put the
needle in would be around the throttle casing. Also, not sure if you have an
auxiliary battery. Would that be a suitable place for the tank?
