Thanks for the epat-on-the-back. But like I said, I still think that the
steering is going to be sloppy due to the dead spots in the steering box.
For all I know, the steering box has been the culprit all along.

But as soon as I get done with the wedding I am going to today, I will
finish up, take it for a drive and let you all know if there is any
difference.

Now I just need to get that shift bushing and steering damper and I will at
least have one project (or rather 2) done.
