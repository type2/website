	You can slap a row of 3 x  2" guages on top of the dash, 
roughly above the clock position, in a small panel such as is 
commonly sold with such guages.  A slab of dark Corflute or similar, 
rising from the bottom of the windscreen over the top of this panel, 
prevents distracting reflections in the screen.
	The whole caboodle is lashed down with a 10" length of 
bicycle inner-tube knotted below heater slots in the top of the dash. 
Don't fix the position until you've minimised reflections in the 
windscreen by moving fore-&-aft and more importantly by slewing.

	Sorry I haven't a digital camera  -  yet.
