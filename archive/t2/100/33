Subject: What makes a wet Westie?

Hello list,

I have a small question. I own a standard 74 bus and
was wondering about pop-tops. What actually keeps the
water from comming through the opening in the roof? Is
it the canvas or is it that small rubber bead that
goes around the bottom edge of the pop-top? Do you
westie owners have any problems with water coming in
through this opening? I just wanted to see what the
fine people on the list knew.

Thanks again for all the help. I couldn't do it with
out you guys!

Have a great day!
