Hey Matty,
You might also want to check out the megasquirt.  It's a really cool DIY
EFI replacement and it's an open source project.  I think it'll probably
be a much better system than the stock VW EFI, because it's new, and
because it's fully customizable through a PC.

You may have to wait a while as the group-buy has already been
completed, but after the initial testing phase, there should be another
group buy for all the rest of the people that want to get in on it.  If
you're lucky, you may be able to find someone that's dropping out (like
I did).

There is also a mailing list...  if you're interested, sign up and read
some of the posts that are flying around.. interesting stuff!

later,
Mike
