I have a type 25, 2 litre air cooled with Solex carbs, which don't seem =
to work well.

A.  Has anyone got any wisdom for replacing them with Webers (either =
twin 40 or progressive)?

B.  Anyone got any wisdom on making them work better?  Idle is poor, hot =
starting poor, not very economical and not smooth around town - but OK =
cruising on a motorway.

I am in London - any local experts who could set them up or supply a =
service kit?

I have fitted 009 distributor (electronic ignition totally stuffed) - =
anyone know the optimum the contact gap setting, and how to keep it =
there?

Thanks=20


Dave
