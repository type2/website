Subject: NEED 40hp overbore ring set

Well somebody on here might have this, who knows.

I need an 83.0mm ring set for old school overbore 40hp
pistons to use on some NOS overbore pistons I bought
for my Scirocco.  Happen to be the same size (not by
accident) as the 40hp overbores.  Guy I bought the pistons
from unfortunately sold out all his rings long before his
pistons (this is old school mid 80's VW performance stuff to
match 90.5 cranks.)  Anyway Total Seal set will cost me
$120 but he says German or Japanese was always better
quality and I should look for a set of those, so by the odd,
odd chance anyone has these laying around, talk to me.

These are 83.0mm and 1.5, 1.5, 4.0 mm thick, STD size.

Thanks
