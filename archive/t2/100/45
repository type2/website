When I got my 72 Westy somebody had put the thin metal rod along the actual
door and not contoured to the sliding door track (I think they used one from
a rear hatch, because there is no sign of bending). This worked just find
and it would keep anyone from pulling on that bar, especially when the
sliding door is open. However that means you couldn't use your curtains when
the door was open. The curtain retainer strap was also mounted on the door.

 I have since acquired the contoured curtain rod and installed it with
screws. This "rod" utilizes little sliders that you sew into the curtain
fabric. GoWesty sells them:

And you should have a strap under where your seat belt hangs to retain it.
The original curtains had a little ring sewn into the corner and this ring
went on the hook on your cabinet door you always wondered about. :)

At the bottom of this page I added some pics of the sliding door curtain,
the rod and the hook:

Hope this helps!
