Subject: Re: [T2] head (gasket) question

There was  a vw tech article issued by vwoa about 10 years ago regarding
this...........it is the same tech article (bulletin) that describes
notching the con rods to throw more oil up on the cylinder wall.

The gist is NOT to use the head gaskets for they are prone to head
leaks........You use a barrel shim between the cylinder and case.  This
keeps the compression ratio the same and allows the head and cylinder to
meet flush without any other material prone to leaks.

Sure some people still use them, but they are the people that are not
familiar with the tech bulletin.
