Hi everyone,

I'm trying to figure out how to get the rubber liners around all of the =
holes in the Westy cabinets go back in their grooves. I have a '77 Westy =
if that makes a difference. Does anybody know how to do this? If there =
are archived posts about this, what do I search under? Do I have to/can =
I get replacements? Thanks for any info!
