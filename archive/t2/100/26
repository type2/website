Subject: Choke Valve Problems

I have a 79 Microbus that has twin carbs. The choke valves are not closing
at start up and it takes a while to start up. I recently had a mechanic look
at it and he said both carbs had to be overhauled. I was wondering is the
helpful people on the list could tell me if I need to do this to solve this
problem? If I do this will I need to replace the valves or just pull them
out clean them and put them back in? And finally, assuming I decide to do
all of this, how hard a task it is for someone who doesn't know a whole lot
a about mechanics?

Thanks in advance,
Nicholas
