Subject: sad end?

All,
Last weekend I came upon a VW shop w/hundreds of old Vdubs sitting around &
a big "commercial property for sale" sign out front. I wandered through the
yard, taking pictures. Looking at the pictures I can count 30 type IIs, from
splits to vanagons, 14 of them campers. The building is a huge rambling
affair, just chock full of partially finished  Vdubs & parts, mostly used.
I don't know what will happen to all this stuff when the property is sold,
but I have a bad feeling the crusher is waiting.
I have no connection to the place, I'm just a gear-head Vdub fan passing on
the info to anyone who might need parts or a project, while they are still
there.
