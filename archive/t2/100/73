the Yuasa "Starved electrolyte" battery is far better, but more expensive.
these are deep cycle batteries

a gel cell has about 1/3 less power as a lead acid battery of the same
size.  

they are certified for transport on aircraft

I have used the starved electrolyte batteries from Yuasa for years in
other (non bus) applications and they are excellent batteries.

however I still run twin Exide lead acid batteries in my bus


YMMV
