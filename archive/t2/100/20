Subject: mist valve


Hello folks,
Does anyone know were I can find the mist valve (the valve that screws to 
the wiper switch for the windshield washer fluid). Mine is shot. I've looked 
on the web but can't seem to find a source. The only catalog that even 
mentions it is Rocky Mountain Motor Works but they do not have any in stock. 
Thanks -Darin
