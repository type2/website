Subject: New Member finds part.

I was going to request info. on where I could find a salvage yard for the 
rear engine bearer for my 1970 bus and decided to go through your archives. 
I found a message from 1996 that mentioned a neat yard in IA. I just got 
off the phone and will get the engine bearer for $50.
