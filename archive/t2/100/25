Is it kind of a whitish-yellowish gunk? That's Castrol Mayonnaise.

It's caused when condensation forms on the inside of your engine, mixes with
oil vapors, gets whipped around by the moving parts in the engine and
emulsifies into a whitish-yellowish gunk.

I recommend not using this in your favorite recipes.
