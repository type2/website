Subject: Re: [T2] strange yellow gunk?

Well, since my first step was to search the archives & i didn't find
anything there, here is the answer for that particular question. Many
thanks to those who answered.

It's condensation & oil combined. Cause: not getting the engine hot
enough, for long enough.

What puzzles me is I drive 1 hour each way to work and back. 30
minutes interstate driving at 65-70. It has been cold here lately, but
I'm sure some of you laugh at what i call cold (10-25 degrees F). I
plan on checking the thermostat out. The flaps are set correctly and
it's a new t'stat, but it might not be totally usefull. I'll have to
check myself. Any other obvious thoughts on getting the temp up, or is
1 hour just not enough. TIA
