Subject: Loss of power

Hi Folks,
I noticed a loss of power on hills last week with my 1600. I had to fix an 
exhaust leak, so that what I thought was the problem. I fixed the leak 
(installed a new exhaust) and I still have now power. Think I lost 
compression in one of the cylinders? I have to check the compression tomorrow



Joy thru Air,
