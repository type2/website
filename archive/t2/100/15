I was recently in Mexico and happened to notice that the lamp
switches in my motel room looked exactly like the little push
button switches that are used on the interior camper light (the
one above the fold-up table) in my '71 camper.  I asked at the
desk where they got the switches.  They sent me to a little
hardware store next door where I promptly purchased all they
had (all 10 of them).  I have use for 2, if anyone on the list has=20
a need for one or two of these switches, p-mail me and let
me know.  I paid the equivalent of 70 cents apiece for them.
I think that little padded envelopes are about 60 cents apiece
and stamps will probably be about 75 cents, so how $2 for
one and $3 for two.  Not trying to make money on these things,
just want to cover my expenses.  They are so rare that I was
really surprised to find them and thought that others on the
list might need them too.  The switches in the motel were=20
on lamps with 60 watt light bulbs, so I feel sure they will=20
handle the current to the little interior lights.=20
