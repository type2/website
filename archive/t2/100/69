BTU stands for British Thermal Units.

I considered doing the RV furnace thing too. Make sure you get one that
exhausts outside the van, which means you have to cut a hole in the body
probably.

I went with the gas heater because they came on the buses and you can get
all the ducting to fit the bus correctly.

I would look for something around 10-16k BTU's. Thats what the gas heater
puts out (4k-16k) and should be all you need for your bus.
A ot of RV furnaces can put out 20k to 30k or more BTU's. However they are
expensive.


Good luck either way!!
