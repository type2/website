Subject: Ebay BN4 Heater Auction

Just thought I'd ask...

I won this auction for this heater a couple days ago and have emailed the seller 3 times and no response. I was really excited about it, as the pictures that used to show looked to be a really nice heater... Anybody know anything about this seller, the email address says happymo(-at-)mail.com. Its just frustrating. If anyone knows anything let me know please. The bus has been pretty cold this winter! :)
