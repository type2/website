You definitely need these. Without them the head/cylinder will definitely
leak, with old ones they will probably leak, with new ones they won't leak
provided your head and cylinder are healthy.
Bow Wow parts in Victoria BC is where I,ve always bought them.
Maybe posting an update on what you have tried/found so far would help the
list help you.
Sounds like the head may have been loose, causing the leak.
How did you find the leak? Compression test?
