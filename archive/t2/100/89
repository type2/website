Subject: Pop top Sealing

So I finally replaced the seal on my 78' westy pop top. Ripped out all the
rotten canvas and will get to that soon. I got the new seal from Bus Depot
and it went on without a problem. Then I lowered the top and noticed a 1/4"
or so gap between the seal along both sides. Not the whole length, just
maybe a 2 foot or so section. It seems as though the fiberglass top itself
is warped or something and doesnt seal. Has anyone seen this problem
before? Can the top be adjusted in any way to make this seal firmly? It
seals great aound the back just not on the sides. If I can't get it to seal
perhaps I will look a replacing the fiberglass from a junker but I don't
want to got that route and risk ending up where I started. Any help here is
always appreciated.
