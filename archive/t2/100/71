Subject: Gel Cel Battery

Some may find this battery to be of interest as to style, price, design, etc.

Won't leak.
At least that is a plus.
Has handles for lugging around and moving.
Has screw terminals for hooking up the wires of the item(s) you might 
desire to power.

It should charge just like a normal battery off of our VW charging systems.

I did not compare the physical size to normal lead-acid design automotive 
battery group sizings, so you may want to look at the dimensions a bit just 
to see if it fits in your bus where you want it to fit.

All rest as to pro-con evaluation is up to the buyer.
