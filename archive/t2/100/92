It's a genuine VW/Mexico brand new longblock.  Not rebuilt, but new.  The
only drawback is that VW doesn't warranty them other than against immediate
factory defects.  That said, I haven't had any fail.  In fact one of our
employees has one in his crew cab.  In fact I'd definately recommend it over
any rebuilt engine, as the quality of the cores has gotten to the point that
it's darn near impossible to find a good candidate anymore.
