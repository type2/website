Subject: Re: [T2] Engine to Tranny - 3 bolts?

Perhaps they meant to say held on with 3 studs, as there is 3 studs and 1
bolt. Yes, I'd use all four but have something welded to the starter bolt so
it wont turn or use a 'D' headed bolt, dum dum or whatever. Really helps to
clean the threads on both nut and bolt so they go on like butter until you
can torque it down. Just cuz it may come with 3 or 2 dont make it right,
think of all the other wrong things you find!
