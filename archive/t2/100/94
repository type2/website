Subject: Listee stickers

Hey everyone,
Thanks to everyone that got a sticker at OCTO.

We had a great time...good to meet new faces and see familiar ones.

For all of you that wanted a sticker and need them mailed to you then here is what to do.

I'm selling them for 4 bucks a piece.

Please send payment and a SASE and I will mail them out ASAP.

P-mail me for address...

Bay owners:  This is only for the split bus stickers at the moment..I will hopefully finalize the bay stickers this week and send an update to the type2 list.

Later,
Beto
