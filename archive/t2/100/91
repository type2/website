They look like part of the accordian tubes.

I'm not sure exactly what kind of metal it is.  It seems to me to be a 
low-grade aluminum that has some characteristics of pot-metal.  Yours is 
very heavily corroded.  I know from experience that you can get these to 
shine, but they will tarnish very quickly.  It will respond to aluminum 
polish but you will have to get rid of the corrosion first.  I'd remove it 
and use sandpaper to remove the corrosion.  Start with maybe 120 and go 
progressively finer up to 600.  Then use the metal polish and it will look 
great... for a few days.  Maybe you could clearcoat it?  I think powder 
coating would probably be best though.
