Subject: RE: [T2] Hot Start Relay Question

 I don't seem to have an issue hot or cold with starting. Without the relay
there is not even a click if it has sat for a week or a minute. With the
relay I get a fast start with the clicking sound. With a 7', 18 gauge wire I
get a perfect sounding start.
Any other opinions on the relay, if it could be opening and closing very
quick as suggested in the other post?
Would the lower amp relay fix this or be a fire hazard?
Should I just forget about starting my van with the key and run a wire into
the engine compartment since that works perfect?
Would the fact that I grounded the switch ground on the relay to the
solenoid itself have anything to do about the lack of voltage?
