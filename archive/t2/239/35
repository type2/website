It's not all-metal, but virtually all of the stressed parts are made of
metal.  For example, the triggers and levers you pull to open the doors
are metal on a bus, but plastic on modern vehicles.  Plastic works fine
when it is new and flexible, but later on it gets brittle and will break.
It's to the manufacturer's advantage to have lots of "nickel and dime"
parts fail after the vehicle is a decade old.  Promotes new car sales!
