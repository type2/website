Subject: Re: [T2] Running hot

It's tough to get reliable responses to "is my oil too hot" questions since
everybody drives with a different style, over varying terrains, using
different temp sensors located at different places on the engine.  The
closest "universal" test is the old "dipstick" test.  After a run go back
and pull the dipstick.  If it's too hot to handle, or you can just barely
handle it, then your oil is too hot.  By reference I can drive my '81 at
freeway speeds (65-70) for several hours and then *easily* handle the
dipstick - it's barely warm.

A rebuilt engine will probably run a little hotter than an engine that's
well broken in, so slightly higher temps on a new rebuild should be
expected.

If you did a comprehensive rebuild (including bottom end) then you shouldn't
be getting an oil light flicker at idle after 20 minutes, assuming your
sensor is OK.  Maybe first put a mechanical sensor on the engine and read
oil pressure from there.
