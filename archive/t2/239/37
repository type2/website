Actually if I knew it was a injection system problem, and beyond my 
tools/equip, I would have no problem with the dealer.  The injection 
system used on the buses is not very different from injection of the 
rabbits and early jetta I and two vehicles.  In fact i is easier to work 
on the older system like our buses because there is no fuel distributor 
in the line to really mess your mind up when troubleshooting.
