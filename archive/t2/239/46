Subject: Free 71' Baywindow Bus (San Francisco Bay Area)

List,

After 2 years of on and off restoration work, I've come to the conclusion t=
hat this is just too much to handle right now.  What I have to offer is a 7=
1' Bay window bus for "FREE" to whoever is willing to pick it up.  Currentl=
y it is a rolling body.  The fully functional engine and tranny were pulled=
 for cleaning and to make electrical restoration easier.  The taker will ha=
ve to either have it towed or hulled away on a flatbed truck as the steerin=
g coulomb is not currently installed.

What you get:
71' Bay Window rolling primer grey body (Completely stripped interior)
1600cc type1 engine (rebuilt 7 years ago, less than 5000 miles on it)
Functional tranny (never been rebuilt to my knowledge)
Just cleaned gas tank w/ new sensor (not installed)
Brand new main electrical harness (not installed)
Bentley and other important bus books.
Matched lock & ignition set ala Steve Sandlin (not installed)
Every other VW Bus related part and stuff I own.

What I get:
Use of my 2 car garage again.
My girlfriend off my back (asking when I'm going to get that bus out of the=
 garage)
Peace of mind that it's going to a good owner that will treat her right (th=
e bus, not the girlfriend). =
