Subject: main seal?


can one of you explan to me why the front seal only leaks when the engine is 
off. i have read in the archives that it is common for it only to leak like 
mine does, only a couple drops when sitting, a couple drops when running, 
and a little stream when you first turn it off. just thinkin about friday 
stuff. have a good weekend everyone!
