I have seen a couple of his engines and the work done on them.  
Excellant work.  However we are talking cadillac/lexus/mercedes vs good 
reliable transport.   Many companies make engines in that category as 
well as some others in the price range/quality of the RAT engines.  And 
as is known to this list there is always the "other list" of engine 
builders that are better used for something other than transport.  
Personal side here from me is that if i need a basic engine i will buy 
it from a reputable supplier that backs their product.  for high end, 
i'll build my own with the assistance of a local machine shop as i have 
done for years.  Then i only have one idiot builder to cuss out.
just my obnoxious opinion
