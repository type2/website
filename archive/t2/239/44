Subject: Re: [T2] Running hot

I, too, recently rebuilt my '79 Westy engine and it is also running hot.
You mentioned that your oil is 245F.  What is the ambient temperature
outside?  This has an affect on engine temps; the hotter it is outside,
the hotter your bus will run.  In the past, I've noticed my engine oil
would be about 200F in 60degree weather.  When it is hotter out, say
~80F, then the oil temp is typically 220-230F.

I have been trying to take the bus out during cool Berkeley evenings for
my test runs, and I am also seeing high temps, close to 250F.  It was
running even hotter before (but there were other issues at the time).
Also, my oil pressure drops quite low (50psi at startup down to <10psi
when hot) and I would sometime get the flicker as pressure dropped
further to about 5psi.

I am starting to think that this heat has something to do with the rings
breaking in and that once the rings have had some wear, there will be less
friction and thus less heat.  Mind you, I'm pulling this theory out of my
behind... this is my first rebuild and I'm no mechanic here.

One thing you may want to try... the Tom Wilson book I have recommends
this procedure for breaking in the engine (as I remember it):  Run the
bus through 5 or more of cycles of: from 20mph, accelerate to 50mph at
3/4 throttle, then decel back to 20mph.  Apparently, you don't want to do a
lot of driving at a constant velocity during the first few hundred miles
after a rebuild.  Not sure why... maybe some other listees can shed some
light on this.
