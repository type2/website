When I pulled my first motor (77 Standard) my workshop was the street and
the Cans of Gunk I
bought didn't seem to do the job without water. To solve the problem I
pulled the longblock
over to a hydrant and opened the hydrant right on it. Thoroughly soaked it
for about 10 minutes.
Most of the bmw and vw water-cooled wrenchers on the block thought it was
fine, but my mentor the
bug mechanic thought I was insane. I probably was but happy to report the
engine went in and ran fine after wiggling the afm plug and spark wires a
few times. So water alone won't necessarily kill your motor, just make sure
you plug the holes and dry it out when you're done.
