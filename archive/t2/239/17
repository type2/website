I was taught by an old antique car mechanic to adjust doors until a dollar 
bill will slide through with some resistance - enough that it requires a 
tug, not enough to tear the bill.

I would check this all around your door and around the vent window. You 
could install some temporary duct tape (or other type) to cover the door to 
body joint or roof to body joint in different places to see if the noise 
goes away.

I bought my pop-top seal from Bus Boys and it is very good quality.
