 =A0=A0 Motorcycle Oils vs. Automotive Oils

This is real good reading especially concerning air cooled engines and
oil--- 
It mentions the oil that I have been using in my 74 Westy as well as all
my air cooled and water buffaloes----Golden Spectro---a full multi
viscosity synthetic--- 

Check this out--it explains viscosity loss due to heat and mileage---and
shear values of the stuff you using. 

It'll change your mind about the stuff your using--- 

Later,
