The online places seem to carry plenty of 7mm fuel hose, 12mm vacuum hose,
3.5mm vacuum but that's it.

The rest you'll find at VWFLAPS and other import friendly places but it may
not be in stock. 99% chance that none of the major auto parts chains in town
carry anything for you. MB and VW dealers are helpful.

I remember your bus is 75 FI.

Original size (vs. More readily available next size up):

Dist. Vacuum to air-box to throttle body: 3mm (3.5mm)
Air dist. manifold to pressure regulator to decel. valve: 4mm (5mm)
S-boot to aux air regulator to air dist manifold: 14mm (12mm)
S-boot to oil breather: 22mm molded (NLA)
S-boot to decel. valve: 18mm molded (NLA)
Air dist. Manifold to brake booster (tee): bus-boys.com
Decel. valve to brake booster: 15mm

Vinyl hoses to evap. canister: 12mm?
Tank breather lines: 9mm (10mm)

Don't forget to various other seals, gaskets, and other rubber contribute to
the vacuum seal worthiness of the engine. I raised my vacuum by quite a bit
by replacing the original intake runner boots (loose), FI seals (all
cracked), intake runner gaskets (old). YMMV.

If you can't find the rubber you need on Continental Blvd you we are all in
trouble. ;-)
