One critical item in my westy is COFFEE.  I generally have about 2 
pounds on board at any given time.  I am working on a winter system to 
keep water in the van for coffee also.  Anybody have any ideas on that?  
The problem i am having is to keep the water in a liquid state  rather 
than the hard stuff.
