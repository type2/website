Re Fittings:
the 1/2 and 3/8 numbers are just that,,, numbers.  they refer to the Nominal
Pipe Thread size.

What you have to pay attention to is the inside size of the fitting,, That is
the part that passes the oil.  The oil passages in the block are probably 10mm ,
you want all the fittings and hoses to be at least that big,,, but as you add
line or bends, it makes restrictions,, and you need to increase the internal
size to compensate for the added length, bends etc.

If you restrict the oil with long lines , or inside diameter of the lines,, or
fittings, then you will not get the correct oil flow to the bearings. Flow is
the important thing ,, even though pressure seems to be the benchmark to tell if
an engine is getting enough oil.

Depending on the placement of your oil pressure gauge,, you might have great
pressure at the gauge,, but not at the bearings.  
Optimumly you want the bearings to be the only restrictions in the flow of
oil.... but turbulent flow in fittings and lengths of hoses adds restriction.

I recommend that you check you fittings and make sure that a 3/8" drill bit will
pass through the fitting,, if not,, drill it out using a 3/8" drill bit or
larger if you can.  I like to use fittings that a 1/2" drill bit will pass
through,,, but I think you will have adequate flow with 3/8" passages

I have seen many 3/8" fittings with less than 1/4" holes inside. 

Beware of Coolers that do not flow enough oil as they have small fittings to
connect them,, or they have small internal passages,, 

I know eurocampers.com sell a cooler with a fan, t/stat, and fittings that might
help you out. Steve has experience as he actually runs that set up on his Bus.

Hope that helps!
