Subject: OIL-Something new!!

Happy Friday to all the denizens of this list!

While listening to NPR today at work I heard something that absolutely
floored me! This was on the show
Talk of The Nation: Science Friday, which is usually pretty interesting.
Anyway, today one of the guests was J. F. Kenney from the Gas Resources
Corp. in Texas. Apparently he has worked for many years with the Russian
pertroleum industry developing oil and gas fields for production. The gist
of the story was that crude oil IS NOT ORGANIC IN ORIGIN. No dinosaur bits,
no prehistoric swamp flora or fauna. In fact, he states that oil is formed
at depths far below those at which organic molecules can survive, and that
the second law of thermodynamics makes it impossible for organic molecules
to break down into oil.
Apparently the idea of oil being organic in origin is from a Russian
geologist working in the late 18th century and was intended as a hypothesis,
not a final answer. Skip ahead to the 1940's and another Russian geologist
proposes the non-organic origins of oil. The Russians/Soviets then embarked
on a massive project to come up with some real answers, culminating with the
laboratory production of crude oil in the 1990's. They combined iron oxide,
calcium carbonate, and triple distilled water under massive pressures and
out came the oil.
I just thought this was very interesting. Don't take my word for it; got to
the NPR website at npr.org, select Talk of the Nation Science friday from
the 'Programming' drop down menu, then select today's show. The entire
interview is there in RA format.

Just something to thik about,
