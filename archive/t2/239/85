Subject: Early Westy Double Bed



       After seeing the rare and elusive upper double bed option for early
bay Westies,and trying to sleep comfortably in the upper cot, I gotta have
one.
So does anyone have one they would like to sell? The one I saw and need has
the mustard yellow cloth covering.
Any links on the web showing this bed?

Thanks
