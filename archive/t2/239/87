Subject: Re: [T2] OIL-Something new!!

the origins of oil were heavily debated even when i was in high school 
in the late sixties.  Deep bores (for that time) were already beyond any 
known organic levels.  Note that the russians had already started deep 
bores in the 40s when Hitler was threataning the oil fields in western 
russia.  Not much scientific info was coming out of russia in those days 
to be shared with anyone until recently.  Also drillings from different 
parts of the world in the 60's were turning up analysis that defied 
current definitions of organic composition as it was understood at that 
time(which the russians already knew).  The catch is that even though 
science itself was being updated and rewritten text books and info that 
is already published is very hard to get changed.  They even had a pbs 
program for a while just on "errors" of history and science that were in 
current belief and texts.  I just love reading some of the "urban myths" 
that abound.  Anyone in this group that is diabetic can definately 
relate to myths that abound in relation to actual science and how long 
it takes to get any written book and general practioner doctor updated 
(not the doctors fault by the way).
