$150 for an oil change and check up???

I spent $250 total in the first 50K miles on HONDA brand oil filters and 
synthetic oil in oil changes for my Honda. ($25 per oil change - my oil, my 
filter, my labor every 5K miles).

What did they do for you for $150????

Not trying to make you feel stupid - just trying to get the picture here. I 
have heard of alot of expensive dealer checks. I get 200K miles+ out of my 
cars and they never see a dealer. Just trying to understand the value....
