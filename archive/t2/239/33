===========================>
Another advantage of the hot start relay modification is that the ignition 
switch assembly is now activating a low current circuit (relay coil) as 
opposed to the original design higher current circuit.
I like knowing this each time I start up 'cuz I ain't too keen on wanting 
to ever change out that ignition switch assembly.
