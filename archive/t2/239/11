Subject: VW dealers: Dont get me started  RANT


So I went with a friend who wanted to buy a new car:

We have looked at this and that and went to the VW dealer. Of course I went 
to parts and had them look up all the stuff thats on their computer but cant 
possibly order! Oh well, thats ok, I let it slide....

SO I went out to the salesman. (He had no idea I was irritating the parts 
guys BTW)

I had my son with me. He's three and I dont test drive with him, so I say, 
as we are looking at a sporty new VW,  "I would test it, but my son is with 
me..." He says I can not test drive that car. I sit down inside it and 
laugh, well come back later to test it, it feels nice as I play with the 
gears and what not. He says, "No you cannot ever test drive this car, nobody 
is allowed to". I look at him like he's crazy, and say why not?
No test drives on this car only so many were made. WHAT? I cant test a car I 
might buy!?!?!? Are they insane?
I look at him and start to laugh.  A little, then more, because it's a damn 
VW for goodness sake.
NOPE no driving this car.
I then ask for specs. Then (I was with a friend whos dad is from Germany) I 
said well my bug out performs this car anyway. He is not happy about that, 
not at all. Then my freind goes off about how its a peoples car and how BMW 
or Mercedes wouldnt try this kind of crap at their showrooms.....

I had to agree, I have test driven 911's! Hell I learned how to drive 
switching between a 1964 Beetle and a 1979 Porche 928s directly imported 
from Germany (and I was 15!) The bus I owned was older then this salesman.

He stuck to his guns. "Only 1 car is allowed by the dealership and the rules 
are that no one gets to drive it".

OK Volkswagen. You win. You have insisted on copyrights to kill the 
aftermarket, and now you wont even let someone testdrive your cars.

I will buy a Toyota. Thank you for helping me make the decision.
