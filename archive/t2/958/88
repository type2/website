Subject: Re: [T2] S boot redesign

 The only "S" Boot that's been in prototyping stage so far is for the Vanagon 80-83 Air Cooled and eventually
the Wasserboxer Vanagons.  Airhead/VWG may look into doing the Bay Window "S: Boot eventually, but minimum
production runs (1000 pc minimum), material & tooling costs, the marketability and the
end cost to the consumer is what will make or break on doing this "S" Boot.
VW gets around $70 to $80 for a Wasserboxer "S" Boot and we feel that's way too high to begin with - we wanna
target around $40 to $50 tops.  I honestly don't think the average Bay Window Owner is gonna wanna shell out
$120.
Most Bay Window owners (and these are mostly off-list) I still encounter have ripped out their FI and moved
onto carbs or are resistant to spending more than what they can get away with in the "baling wire" department
to just get down the road.  I have to keep in mind that this List (as great and as "picky" as they are [and
rightly so]) is just a microcosm of Bay Window owners everywhere, thus reproduction of anything has to be
based on the
"bigger" picture of being able to do it and still stay in business (and pay my meager wage [remember, I'm just
a peon now, not an owner anymore], along with others).

I'll have to look in my stash to make sure, but I think I have a couple of nice used ones I've picked in my
travels - $35 including postage.  I might find another or more this weekend at the Hot VWs Drag Day Swap this
Sunday. I always keep my eyes peeled for these.

I think I gave you one for the pattern to make them :)

I have a bunch of good bay S hoses and a couple of Vanagon S hoses, but I no longer save them anymore.....  No
one seems to want them and I have to much crap to move 650 miles.
