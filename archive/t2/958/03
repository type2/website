Sounds exactly like Nyssa's 75 bus problems- great spark, all checked 
out (sensors, etc) but had to crank, crank, especially in the NJ cold 
after driving upf rom Savannah. she has/had 2 issues- figured out that 
the thermotime switch was not letting the cold start valve get juice for 
adding gas while cranking.  Easy to check with voltmeter.  Since the TTS 
is in an impossible spot, I bypassed the wiring to the coldstart valve 
and added a switch which acts like a mechanical choke- she turns on the 
key, presses the switch now in the wall of the steering housing for 
about 10 seconds, and starts the bus.
Another issue was that she had sticking weights in the distributor that 
really messed up the starting timing and rpms after being hot-(left too 
advanced)- figured this out with a timing light used AT STARTUP, and 
noticing it would not always drop after advancing- beat on the body of 
the distrib. and it drops back down.  Switched her distrib. with (Thanks 
Teddebare) the $5 one from Ted's bargain box.
