Subject: old gasoline

checked the archives and only found references to gasoline that was
8-10 yrs old and had gone bad and varnishy.  this didn't help me since
goethe's petrol has been sitting for 6-8 months.  put injector cleaner
and mystery marvel or is it marvel mystery oil in the full tank of
gas.  is my gasoline bad or still usable?


thanks,

jeremiah
