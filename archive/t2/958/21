Subject: RE:[T2] type2 mailing list source of spam?

Hi guys:

I work at a hospital behind a strong border firewall.  I get my Type 2 
posts just fine, but no SPAM.  I agree with George that you should grab 
a new account or check your fire wall and spam catching software.  I 
recommend Adaware for free Spam control and SOPHOS for the antivirus.

Good luck!

BEN
