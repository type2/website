	Let me point out the ambiguity in the term 'tow bar'.  In 
some parts of the world 'towbar' means a quasi-permanent addition to 
the frame offering a tow ball in the midline just outside the *rear* 
bumper, allowing you to tow a trailer.  The item shown at the above 
URL is to latch onto that, and fit onto the front of the towed 
vehicle.
