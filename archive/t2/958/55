How do you get almost (0 showing on your speedo with your tacho
only showing 4000 rpm???
What gearing, engine/tranny combo do you have.

For our van, 2.0l carb in a 76 camper by my calculatiions, 4000 rpm
would only equal 120 kph (75 mph)??
Do you have the 'Holy Grail' , a 5- speed box ???? (my wife just told  
me to stop
drooling on the key board)
