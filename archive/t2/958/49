	I can see where (as they say these days) you're COMING  FROM 
viz. well known underground methods for cooling of illicit smoke  ;-)

	Would the valve be better on the intake?

	I don't doubt this would work.  It shares with my system the 
virtue of having no moving parts.  However, it does require 
acquisition of a 'stone'  -  called by practical chemists a 'sparger' 
-  usually sintered glass.
	The medical stainless needles which I use will, I believe, 
vapourise the water thoroughly at the low water-feed rates ( c. 0.5 
L/h ) which are all you need.
	 The appealling notion that droplets of water are carried in 
and turn to steam is not right.  What water-injection does is humidfy 
the mixture, or for FI or diesel the air, heading into the combustion 
chambers.       
	I realise full well that there's no adequate theory for *how* 
it works.  Even more important as a barrier to its deployment is the 
fact that it seems too good to be true: improved cooling, power, 
economy & exhaust purity, all for negligible money.  We live in a 
world of lying hucksters & hypesters who falsely claim less than 
this, and ask bulk money for their swindles; here am I asking no 
money and claiming more benefits than most of the racketeers dare to. 
The cynical defensive mentality induced by modern & postmodern liars 
make it harder for simple honest helpful people to be believed. 
Well, after a couple decades testing of WI, I can only keep on urging 
folk to try it; and you may as well use the very simplest systems, 
which are even simpler than Mark's.  You can expect to
*  improve peak power slightly ;
*  run cooler, in given circumstances ;
*  roughly halve the CO & HCs in your exhaust ;
*  decrease NOx in exhaust that much, or more.
*  improve your fuel economy c.10% .
