I used to shift the "Big" 18 wheelers, like Kenworth, without the clutch, by
putting two fingers, very lightly, on the shift knob, and "waiting" for the
trans, to tell me when to shift, and I do the same with the Westy, which
prolly tells me why they have a "skinny" shift stick, rather than the one you
find on an "m-22" Muncie!

Ps Drove an Austin Healey 3000 Mk1, with a chev V/8 for two thousand miles
across parts of Canada, awesome, when the stock overdrive is engaged in 4th,
and every speck of debris, is being sucked out into the "airstream", as you do
100 plus, at 1800RPM, on a "break in" motor phase!
