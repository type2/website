Subject: Unofficial Everybus T shirts, 1 week left

This has been cross posted, I apologize if you get this message more than once...

Just a quick note to remind volks that the SDC EB07 Unofficial T pre-sale is only available for one more week. 

Pre-sale ends March 23. After that there *might* be a very limited number of the "Viva Bus" shirts available at the event.

Unfortunately there will not be any zip-hoodies, hats, or Red Star Ale wear available for sale at the event. 

Avoid disappointment, order now!

Also, to everyone who has already placed an order, thank you!! Orders placed by March 23rd with shipping requested will be shipped April 6, with hopes of arriving in time for wearing at Everybus!
