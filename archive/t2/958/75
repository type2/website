Subject: clutch cable snap

Hey volks.
My clutch cable broke on the drive to work this morning.  I thought I'd
send a reminder out to everyone that having a new clutch cable in your
on-board parts bin is a very good idea.  I had one, and I was able to
replace the old with the new on the side of the road by myself in less
than 2 hours.  Okay, some of you are saying "2 hours? what took so
long?" - it was my first clutch cable replacement, I had to change
in/out of nice threads and the Muir book was wrong about the process. 
Follow your Bentley (ch 5, section 15.5) and use the Muir for holding a
flashlight steady.
Also, I was very fortunate that I didn't lose the wingnut off the
cable.  I do not have a spare, though its something I'll be adding that
to my next order so its in my bin for next time.
