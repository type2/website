Superchargers work by increasing the amount of atmospheric oxygen
available per engine stroke.  The oxygen comes from the air, so that is
free.  However, the fuel is not.  You pay for the extra fuel burned.

In the case where you are splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen, you
are paying for the hydrogen and oxygen with the electrical energy you use
to run the device.  The electricity comes from the engine via the
alternator.  At most, you can recover the same energy when the hydrogen
and oxygen are recombined, but in fact you will recover far less because
of the 2nd law of thermo.

Now, if you could get that electrical energy back by regenerative braking
you could use this to generate hydrogen to burn in the engine.  This would
be subject to the same 40% efficiency.  It would be a lot more efficient
to charge a battery and drive a motor to return that energy to the
vehicle, but then again Toyota has already invented the Prius.
