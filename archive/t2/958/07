Subject: Splash panels for a 68 Bus

Hello.

I'm trying to find an online shop where I can get a pair of rear bumper splash
panels for my 68 bus.
I bought a brazilian made pair but they suck.
Here is a link to a portuguese forum where I've posted some pictures of them.
My project is a portuguese version of Greg Potts Westfakia...

All I was able to find will fit 59-67 buses. They look pretty similar but I
think there are some differences.
Did anyone in the list mount a pair like this or can anyone tell me where to
get a pair like my original ones?

Thanks a lot and best regards from Portugal.
