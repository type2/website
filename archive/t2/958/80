Subject: Re: [T2] clutch cable snap +Little MIss Sunshine

A vice grip has the added use of holding the clutch cable if you loose 
the wingnut- I would just drive it without a cable (Little Miss 
Sunshine, you got it wrong-the mechanic in the movie implies it's the 
cable with "Your clutch is gone" (or possibly throwout arm- but you only 
have to push it if starter is kaput or you have no battery power- 
otherwise just start it in first gear or 2nd if downhill..........8-)  I 
did see the DVD and heard the director/writer commentary- he actually 
had that happen to him and and to drive clutchless from New England to 
Va in a bus at each toll booth they drove right through and just threw 
the money at the booth guy!!
