That's why I posted the original gripe. OldVolks/Airhead's been
working on repro'ing lots of parts so why not this one? I've seen many
parts in odd shapes made out of silicone (for the ricer crowd) so it
shouldn't be too difficult to do our S-Boot.

It would be worth the $120-ish a silicone one would cost.

In the meantime, I've ordered one of the crappy repros from eBay and
will start investigating an off-the-shelf replacement since I doubt
that repro will last...
