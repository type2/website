	Teach it brthr!
	Teach's expositions of the 1st & 2nd Laws of Thermodynamics, 
along with my earlier versions when this concept came up some months 
ago, should (in all humility) serve.  It will definitely cost you 
more power to hydrolyse water on-board than you get back by burning 
it.  Yer karn't ween, as they say in Australia.  It is certainly not 
a way to get better mileage.
	The one variant I'm toying with is mixing of combustible gas 
from 'off board' into the mixture for brief spurts of power climbing 
hills, fighting off passing manoeuvres from 2.2-L Subaru-powered 
buses, etc.  In many ways the easier way than hydrogen to do this is 
CNG (compressed natural gas).  Vehicles powered by just this fuel 
have very special expensive heavy tanks (>3000 psi) just to attain 
c.120 mi range.  But some pressure an order of magnitude lower, c.300 
psi, will be easier to hold; slip it into a frame rail ?  ;-}   Then 
pull the Bowden cable or actuate the solenoid when you need a minute 
of extra power  ...   NG in the combustion air going into a FI engine 
may well give extra power, but I'm far less sure that a NG mixer 
after the carb will give us old-fashioneds any worthwhile extra power.
	In some USA industrial districts are NG mains with several 
atm pressure.  A cheap compressor can take this up to c.300 psi.
