Subject: Re: [T2] A question about my buses paint

Nate asked:


 My question is about the paint job on my bus. Whoever owned it before me did a really cheap job on it. I want
some tips on how to take off their paint job without disturbing the original(I should say what I believe to be
the original paint). I've included links to a couple of pictures I took. My plan is to remove the cheap paint
so I can focus in on the rusted areas.

I would get a steam cleaner/pressure washer!    It will blow that white paint right off and leave the faactory
baked-on paint alone.
