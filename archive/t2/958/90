Subject: Re: When oh WHEN is somebody gonna repro the S-Boot?

Just in case this tidbit is of use to anyone - I found that Loctite Black
Contact Adhesive worked really well for sealing up the cracks in my S-boot,
which, beforehand, had so many holes that it was reminiscent of a tea-bag.

I
got some with a pop-top seal kit, and had some left over, so thought I'd give
it a try. It was "the dog's"
