Subject: -clevis pin workarounds (was snapped clutch cable)

Since we have a camper, wire, hammer and assorted nails are always in 
camping odds and ends pail.  You can make temporary clevis pins and 
cotter pins from a nail (I keep 6-8-10 penny((and small washers if nail 
too small-in a pinch, small washers can be harvested from the tapered 
ones that hold panels or curtains or snap buttons).  Insert, then bend 
the nail with your vice grip.  I suppose if you have heavy wire, this 
could be used- try as many wraps as will fit.  Sure works for the heater 
box cable to flapper retaining pin, or axle nut cotter.
