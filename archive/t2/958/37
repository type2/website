Subject: The Power Loss Saga Continues

Every time I think I've got it licked, it sneaks back up on me.

This afternoon, for some reason, it started doing the "feels like the
key is off" power cutting out / bucking. Today it was very bad,
happening at any rpm, throttle position, even at idle.

Smack dab in the middle of one I pulled over and ran around the side
of the bus and pulled the gas cap off to listen for air sucking in.
But the exact opposite happened! It sprayed gas at me! I left it not
quite sealed and the problem stopped. In fact, I was jamming down the
freeway:

Somehow the tank pressurized. Definitely NOT what I expected!

The gas cap is a crappy AutoZone locking one that never did fit right,
but the smog place lost the original one that came on the Guac. Now to
find a used original one...

Karl? Chris?
