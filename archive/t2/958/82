Subject: A question about my buses paint

Hello,
     My name is Nate and I own a '78 Transporter. I was on this list for a
short time years ago. My bus has been sitting out back for awhile and
recently I decided to fix it up.
     My question is about the paint job on my bus. Whoever owned it before
me did a really cheap job on it. I want some tips on how to take off their
paint job without disturbing the original(I should say what I believe to be
the original paint). I've included links to a couple of pictures I took. My
plan is to remove the cheap paint so I can focus in on the rusted areas.
Thanks for your time.

-Nate
