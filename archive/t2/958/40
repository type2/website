	Good one Teach  -  you have seized the ineradicable title of 
First T2 Bod to Acknowledge WI.

	yes  -  but requires new machinery with some moving parts.
	My Nissan Vanette suddenly stumbled like a bastard while 
cruising at 60 mph  -  EGR flexipipe had broken  ...  no breakdown in 
WI will do that to you.

diesel.  One big (blood donor) needle in the narrowest part of the 
induction tract just after the air cleaner gives a handy water/fuel 
ratio.  Slightly more power; economy not yet measured.  This is a 
sufficient guide for FI-petrol victims
