 A pox on them and on those
>> stupid enough to respond to them.

And there is the crutch. Spam only exists because it pays, and pays well.
Which means there are a lot of _______ out there who respond to spam,
fueling the market. Maybe a new approach is required - make it illegal to
respond to internet solicitation. If the spam is illegal so should the
"consumption" of it. Isn't that the norm that both the producer and consumer
of illegal activity are held to task, because it effects far more people
than just themselves?
