Subject: Re: [T2] Silicone PRT Seals from CBPerformance

Jon, I want the PRT seals for a type IV engine, the 2.0 liter.

Although the picture is of the PRT seals (part #1945) for the type 1 engine,
they also list part #1949 as the PRT seals for the  type IV

So, anybody ordering from CBPerformance in the near future??
