Would  the valve be better on the intake?



hey Robt  You get better control of the process by having it on the  suction 
side . Air stones can be gotten at any pet store that sells fish  stuff. Nice 
thing about doing it this way is that you are turning the water into  a mist 
before putting into the intake . Again I ask have you tried it this way  just 
for comparisions sake? As in any test you need to do it in  more than  one 
way.In the Hooka system it isn't much more 8involved and I have a feeling it  will 
be even more effiecent . later  Mark D
