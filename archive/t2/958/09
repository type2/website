Subject: type2 mailing list source of spam?

  I wasn't getting much spam before i joined this list...  Maybe 5 a week.

  Since I joined the list, I get about 10 to 20 per day.

  Is someone harvesting addresses from the list?

  I get porn, pills, and software..  also "you won EURO lottery" and
"king hammurabi died and you're his heir"
