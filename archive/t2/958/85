I think the nearest wind tunnel might be most suitable to remove that paint job. :-)

Ideas:

- a powered buffer and some rubbing compound.
- some thinned down liquid stripping solution that dies quickly before it can soak/react with the underlayer.

What was the original paint formula? Enamel, acrylic, anyone?

That clue might help figure out how to strip it (using something that won't react with it if the top layer is different).
