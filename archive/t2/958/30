Hello Robt  Have you ever tried the way we use to do this. take a hard  
plastic bottle and make a hookar pipe system. one intake pipe with a small  filter 
on top that goes to the bottom of the bottle. on the bottom of this hose  
attact an air stone,like those used in fish tanks. the other outlet hose  just 
sticks barely into the top of the bottle, place a control valve in this  line 
between the bottle and intake. You can adjust the flow and vaporization by  the 
valve . tap just below the carb in the intake . Using this system the water  
will be in a vapor(mist) state and mix better. I never did run any test but it  
sure seemed to increase the power.  Later  Mark Dearing
