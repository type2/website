Subject: Re: [T2] S boot redesign

The only "S" Boot that's been in prototyping stage so far is for the Vanagon
80-83 Air Cooled and eventually the Wasserboxer Vanagons.  Airhead/VWG may
look into doing the Bay Window "S: Boot eventually, but minimum production
runs (1000 pc minimum), material & tooling costs, the marketability and the
end cost to the consumer is what will make or break on doing this "S" Boot.
VW gets around $70 to $80 for a Wasserboxer "S" Boot and we feel that's way
too high to begin with - we wanna target around $40 to $50 tops.  I honestly
don't think the average Bay Window Owner is gonna wanna shell out $120.
Most Bay Window owners (and these are mostly off-list) I still encounter
have ripped out their FI and moved onto carbs or are resistant to spending
more than what they can get away with in the "baling wire" department to
just get down the road.  I have to keep in mind that this List (as great and
as "picky" as they are [and rightly so]) is just a microcosm of Bay Window
owners everywhere, thus reproduction of anything has to be based on the
"bigger" picture of being able to do it and still stay in business (and pay
my meager wage [remember, I'm just a peon now, not an owner anymore], along
with others).

I'll have to look in my stash to make sure, but I think I have a couple of
nice used ones I've picked in my travels - $35 including postage.  I might
find another or more this weekend at the Hot VWs Drag Day Swap this Sunday.
I always keep my eyes peeled for these.
