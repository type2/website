Subject: Bleeding Lifters, without doing weird stuff!

Hey guys,

    I really appreciate all the advice that I've been given over the past few
days about bleeding the new lifters that I will be putting in my Bus!

I just came up with a way to bleed the lifters quite easily.

Basically this is what I did. I took an old coffee can (perfectly clean). I
put all 8 lifters in the bottom (face up). I then filled it with 5W-30 motor
oil, and then a half-quart of ATF (didn't want to waste more of my regular
oil! hah).

I then left it like that for a week. Basically, the majority of the air
bubbles that COULD come out, did, simply by bubbling up from the side hole,
and the top of the lifter.

THEN, I took an old Pushrod that I had laying around from the 1969 Olds 455
big block that I rebuilt. I cleaned it up really well, and used it as a
plunger on my lifter. I took a bunch of rags so as not to hurt my hand, and
continued to plunge the lifter in the can of oil, until all the bubbles came
out. I found that if I plunged it a little bit, and then HELD the pushrod down
into the lifter... I would see dozens of bubbles coming up through the side
hole. THEN, with the pushrod still compressed, I put my thumb on the opposing
hole of the pushrod, and slowly let up. I'm guessing this sucked fresh oil in
to replace the air that I had just pumped out. It's REALLY REALLY stiff now,
and I can't really compress the lifter much, if at all, which tells me that
it's 'primed'.


Maybe this was common sense? But if it helps anyone, then I'm glad I posted
it.


Thanks!

Todd
