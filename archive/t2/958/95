According to this site:		
  www.sandlizrd.baja.com/gears.htm

the gear ratio for 4th in a 76 on 2 litre is 0.88 with a final drive of
4.571, an overall ratio of 4.02.

That is the tallest gear ratio set installedin a Bus case.

I do not know if gear sets can be interchanged for a taller
4th gear ratio (according to the list earlier Buses had a taller 4th  
gear
but shorter final gear ratio0 but I would suspect not.
Anyone able to confirm that???

The only gear set that would provide taller 'highway' gearing would be
the AT gearbox set from a 73-77 Bug with a 4th gear ratio of 0.93, a  
final
drive of 3.875, giving an overall gearing of 3.60 according to the above
website.
Would that gearbox or gear set fit any Type 2????

I would think more likely that as Peter says, most Buses have optomistic
speedos -- mine according to an overhead radar on the Hume Hwy in
Victoria (Australia) is 7 kph fast (indicated 101 kph while radar showed
94 kph)

If that ratio were consistent, by 146 kph (90 mph), my speedo would be
approximately 10 -11 kph fast.  However, at that speed my motor would
be turning over at about 4800 rpm!!! (if the calculations I put in at  
this site
www.locost7.info/gearcalc.php		are correct.)

By the calculations on this site, 4000 rpm for my 2 litre Bus would  
equate
to about 122 kph (78 mph approx)

As a side issue, what temps do you run at at those speeds?  I find if  
I run
continuously over about 105 kph (65 mph) my temp guage shows 110 -
120 degress C (230 -250 degrees F)  a little hotter than i would like  
( it
is of course a VDO guage!!!)
