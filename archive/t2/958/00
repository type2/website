Subject: Re: [T2] S boot redesign

I doubt that isolating the AFT from vibration was the reasoning for the s
boot as much as as space management in a confined space. It allows the
assembly to be placed off to the side instead of atop the engine (where it
is found on most cars I've seen. And connecting the two units was done with
a rubber piece because it's cheap and durable. It makes more sense to me to
mount the air flow meter next to the throttle body with a short length of
generic rubber hose, with a single take-off for the cold idle circuit. The
length of hose needed to run to the air filter box could be any kind of
inexpensive flexible ductwork.

I do agree that the environment and contaminants like oil lowers the
expected lifespan of this part, and the vibration of the engine is what
eventually breaks it. Putting the two components together (throttle body and
air flow meter) would prevent cracks forming between these two pieces, and
as for the ducting between the AFM and the air filter, that is less of a
concern, and so the quality/specs of the piece is less important.

If my s boot was shot that's what I would do. I would start looking for
generic pieces from boneyards to see what makes and models would carry the
bits that could be used in the conversion.
