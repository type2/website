Subject: Deck Height of .120 Stock

Greetings All -

I got no feedback earlier - meaning none of you know the stock "A"  
and "B" dimensions of a piston? Or am I on the "don't talk to"  
list? :} I found my answer on Gene Berg's website... "A" = 39.6mm and  
"B" = 33.93mm (otherwise known as 34mm).

So, my pistons measure 39.6mm ("A" pistons), but I still have a .120"  
deck height without any spacers, etc... The thing I didn't mention  
before is that I'm using one of the all-aluminum cases for the first  
time (go figure). It's an AutoLinea stock-type case - not the brand  
new high-tops or anything like that - just the stock style.

Can this case be pushing the cylinders "out" to make all of that deck  
height? Does anybody have experience with this case?

I can still make this motor "work", because I have some heads with  
small CCs, but obviously, I want to figure this one out.

Thanks -

Mike
