Let me point out the ambiguity in the term 'tow bar'.  In 
some parts  of the world 'towbar' means a quasi-permanent addition to 
the frame  offering a tow ball in the midline just outside the *rear* 
bumper,  allowing you to tow a trailer.  The item shown at the above 
URL is to  latch onto that, and fit onto the front of the towed  
vehicle.




hey Robt  Here in the states that is called a towbar and the other a  tow 
hitch  later  Mark D
