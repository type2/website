You can do that, but first try the 2-hammer method.  With the puller in
place, put one hammer against the side of the pitman arm and give the
other side a whack with a lighter hammer.  The direction of the impact
should be perpendicular to the tapered stud of the rod end.  The idea is
to "oval" the hole microscopically and pop things loose.  It works for me!
