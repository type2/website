Subject: Build or Buy?

I am thinking hard about whether or not to rebuild or replace my engine.
I live in Las Vegas and I'm interested to know if anyone has good or bad
things to say about the shops around here. Can anyone recommend one over
another? 
 
I posted the numbers from the engine case to the list before to verify
what engine I had and received some very detailed replies.  It turned
out to be a '73 or '74 super beetle engine in my '71 Westy. AH038475 It
has single port heads and I need a new carburetor already. I'd like to
put in a 1776 with dual port heads but I'm nervous about the quality of
the engine that I might get back. One shop was offering a 1600 Dual port
for $695 and hinted on charging more because I have single port heads
for the core. I never got a quote for the 1776. What is the average
price? 
 
I'm expecting a certain level of care to go into the building process of
this engine and since this would be my first VW engine rebuild, should I
trust that even the sloppiest professional job would be better than a
thorough attempt by myself? Ha. Guess I'm asking you to make a character
judgment on a stranger. Tell me how you made out? Did you build or buy?
Would you do it the same way again? 
 
 
 
Pondering,
