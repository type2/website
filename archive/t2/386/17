Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Rear Wheel bearings

I'd really like to regrease my rear wheel bearings.  Unfortunately, Rick
Taylor is too busy to manufacture the greasing tool he invented for all of
us. We should work out a cheap and easy method to do this. Something along
the lines of removing the bearing housing from under the drum,  installing a
grease fitting in it, and letting rip with the air pressurized grease pot at
a lube shop till it runs out clean on the other side of the stub axle.
Hopefully a method that doesn't require pulling and destroying good bearings
to install. Any ideas anyone??

<I always had this on my mind when I read how folks struggle with this
nut on the axle shaft--
Why not beg, borrow, steal, buy (?) an impact-- run the nut down--and
check the torque--and get the job over with--
I mean it's not something that has to be done often--
And if a guy was smart--he would take the time to drill and tap a grease
fitting into the rear hub--so this ordeal would be a thing of the past--

Just curious-
