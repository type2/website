Subject: Re: [T2] Build or Buy?

Dave,

I rebuilt my first 1600 when I was 17. I had marginal tools and very little
experience with cars. In fact I think I had just learned how to adjust the
valves a week or so before I began. I had a 71' and the clutch was shot and
she leaked oil very badly. I actually went half way. I had a local shop I
trusted build me a short block. Then I sent out the heads and finished the
job myself. I think I spend around 400 for the shortblock and the guy let
me make payments till it was done. I had him drill and tap the case for a
full flow oil system. The thing is the case is the toughest part of the
rebuild. It is also probably the most critical part. If you have limited
experience and understanding of the 1600 engine and you are considering
modifying it from stock you need to be very diligent in your techniques. If
you slap something together it may run great for a year then you are back
where you started. So the long and short of it is this. I would look for a
builder you trust, maybe ask the list for a good shortblock source. Then
have the 1776 or 1835 shortblock built that you want. Get a quality piston
and cylinder set, a gasket set, some good manuals including Muirs book, a
set of good carbs (not too big) and do the top end your self. You will
learn a ton about your engine and you will have the satisfaction of knowing
you did the job right. You can calculate your desired compression ratio and
set it with shims, cc the heads etc. But doing the case your first time out
could be dangerous. I'm not saying you couldn't handle it but if you are
going away from stock there are a lot of considerations that have to be
made to make a quality product.
