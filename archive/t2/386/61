Subject: Re: [VB] Noisy TO bearing saga continues

I replaced the PP ( 3rd one) and the gland nut, on Sat. and so far it seems
like it might be gone.   One thing I noticed, the clutch worked best when I
had a match between Brazil TO and Brazil PP.  I had a German PP in for
awhile, and the noise was more noticable. I checked and the contact ring on
the PP
was different diameters, with the German being smaller, as was the German TO
id and od.
 I am starting to think the noise I was getting was the TO hitting thePP,
but not centered on the ring, so that the TO bearing  is not rotating, like
it should, but rather it is just dragging agaist the ring on the PP. This
would give a scraping sound which would change pitch as the clutch is
depressed, getting worse and worse the the more you depress the pedal, as
the the two rings, TO and PP, get farther and farther off center from each
other.

What do you think??
