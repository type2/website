Subject: VW Vagabonds return

I just went to this web site to find out what country they're in now and saw
that they are due to get back home to San Diego tomorrow at 2pm at the Mission
Bay roller coaster. Pass the word around and welcome Rich and Amanda back from
their 3 year adventure. See: http://www.vwvagabonds.com/
