Subject: Alternator Warning Light

My alt warning light I noticed for the first time today has a very faint
glow  very faint you can hardly see it- it seems to glow at idle or when
the clutch is depressed and the eng speed drops and then goes out on
acceleration.  Any ideas  Bentley talks about it in term s of flickers and
when it comes on  any direction on what to look at would be appreciated.

Thanks

Eric
