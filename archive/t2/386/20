There are two style of EGR for FI busses. The later style is purely
mechanical and it is activated by the position of the throttle.

The earlier style has a vacuum hose and and an electrical switch. The vacuum
hose connects to ported vacuum so it would be part of the same system of
vacuum lines going to the distributor. If it was hooked up to the Decel
valve it could be active at idle.

The purpose of the switch is to close the valve at idle and WOT. It's wired
to the throttle valve switch under the throttle body and Bentley has test
instructions. If it's not closing the valve at idle the bus will run poorly.
