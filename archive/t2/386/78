Subject: Re: [T2] Propane tank question, Will this work?????????

<http://www.nfpa.org/Research/nfpafactsheets/propane/propane.asp> Note 
the section at the end exempting horizontal cylinders. Many of the 
'service station' type refilling facilities do not know the real 
regulations.  It might pay to do some more research and have some 
documentation on-board.  I've had to fight a couple times, but I've 
always gotten the Westy and Riviera tanks filled.  As a last resort, one 
just goes to the local bulk plant.  They *know* the regulations.
