Subject: Parted out a 1970 Alabama Camper

I parted out a 70 Bus this weekend with a camper 
conversion by "Alabama Camper".  Anyone have any info on 
this conversion?

If anyone needs any items from this bus, let me know and 
we can work somthing out.  There is a good roof section 
(no sunroof or pop-top)that is available, other than that 
most body panels are rusted out.  

I am in southern Wisconsin.
