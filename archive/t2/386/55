That statement's a puzzler to me.  "Alignment" of the clutch disk simple
allows the transmission shaft to slip through the center hole of the disk
easily when mating transmission to engine.  If you've got your transmission
mated to the engine the disk is "aligned" as much as it ever could be
because there's no radial movement of the disk possible at that point.
