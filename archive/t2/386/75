Hey there Volks,

I've got some photos from BBTM (in Old Mystic, CT) from this past weekend in my
gallery. Check 'em out here:

I wasn't in full on photo mode this weekend, so in hindsight, I didn't take as
many photos as I should have. 

Bill Monk and crew did an excellent job of hosting a great event. 

Enjoy,
