Subject: new door handles...

Ok... another small problem.

	When I installed the new door handles that I got, (reproductions,
not originals), the doors would lock, perfectly.. but I was UNABLE to unlock
them with the key. I had to go inside the bus and unlock it with the switch
inside the bus.

Any idea how i can adjust this? It seems like maybe there is too much force
required to unlock it that the key can't handle it.
