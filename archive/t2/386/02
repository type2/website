When you say mechanical lifters do you mean hydraulic or solid? since
they are all working in a mechanical system they all might be
considered mechanical :) The only reason I ask is they are set
differently & that will cause problems if set incorrectly.

BTDT.

Before suspecting the fuel system, I would start with a compression
check of all cylinders. There are lots of links & information in the
archives about doing this. But since you can't just go down to the
local FLAPS and pick up a fuel injection tester your best bet is to
buy a compression tester & see what it tells you about your engine.
I don't have a lot of experience only a few years w/ VW, but on all
the engines that I have had a cyl go out (like burnt valve) the
compression chamber gets oily/dirty/wet. A compression test will help
you see this or let you know not to worry about that possibility.

I think I'm just reading it incorrectly, but just in case. did you
align the same mark on the crank pully as you do for TDC of #1? or the
mark 180 degrees from that mark? The mar 180 degrees from TDC of #1 is
the correct one. Otherwise your valve adjustment will be incorrect.
Sounds like you did it correctly, just trying to eliminate any
possible simple errors that don't take much to verify/fix :)

John Anderson has mentioned that autozone carries Lucas injectors for
a nice price that are new, but I would check the compression of that
cylinder first. Then look at the fuel system.
