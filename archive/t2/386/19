I am wondering if this method of filling the entire hub with grease is
acceptable.  My understanding is that full hubs run hotter.

Is there space to get in there with a needle adapter on a grease gun?

If you want to get complex, how about drilling the stub axle lengthwise
and then cross drilling it between the bearings?  Put a grease fitting on
the end of the stub axle and tell everyone at the shows that it is a
long-lost M-code for wet conditions.
