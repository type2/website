Subject: CD Player Install

When I bought my bus the PO had installed a cd player- He had looped a wire
around the base of the fuse and ran power this way (Fuse 12 in the box)- I
put a proper connector on and attached it at the rear of the box on #12.  I
began to notice that after I did this, my alternator warning light would
glow
very faintly when I pressed the brakes  Disconnected the radio and cannot
see any glow now.  My, question is which is the correct fuse to put my radio
on? If I remember correctly radios in VW are always on unless manually
turned off?

Thanks
