I was looking at www.trimlok.com and it looks like they have a couple seals

that might work well.  The original seal seems to be fairly simple, just a

square edge that rests on the roof.  I wonder if a seal with a small bulb

might not tend to seal a bit better to protect against wind and rain?

If there isn't an original available try:

And browse the catalog for what's similar...Some 'generic' seals are 
in the catalog, as well as sheets of sealing material for creating your
own hard to get replacements... ;-)
