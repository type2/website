Subject: Where does the 3rd tube from the fuel pump (mech) go?  '72 Bus

I haven't had any problems with my fuel pump for the past 7 years.  Then it
commences to dripping and spraying fuel from the tube/spout from the bottom
of the fuel pump (mech, right front of the engine).  I don't understand what
this spout is for.  I thought I needed a new pump, so I ordered one from Bus
Depot and it came with a rubber hose on this spout in question.  I
understand the topside two spouts for carbs and tank, but the third.  Beats
me.  I removed some tin I found a hole in which was close to the spout.
Still couldn't figure out where this went.  I'm freaking lost!  : )

Do I just change pumps and leave this spout thingy loose?  I don't think it
was ever attached to anything since I got the bus.  And the webers don't
seem to have another hose attachmet site for an extra fuel line.

Is the spout thing a relief valve going nowhere?  Does it go to the 2nd carb
which is running from a split fuel line right now?  I can usually figure
this out by meditating or letting my mind run wild, but no manuals at all
have revealed anything to me (owners and Muir).

Do I have to remove the engine, if I should change the fuel pump?  It seems
that I shouldn't -- looks very accessible to change the pump as it is.
Maybe I'm missing something.

Anyone looking to spread some good karma through extolling me with your
wisdom gets hardcore good merit in my book.

I'm open.  Please help.  : )

Cheers,
Kenn
