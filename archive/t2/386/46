took me forever with the help of another bus owner to mate the engine and 
tranny.
wished i could get smooth as silk out of 1st as well starting to worry me .
(now when the other tranny was expected to be taken out i did notice that the 
tranny bolts in top were gone so could that of warped the flywheel?
just curious?
could that also of been what made the sequencers go out in the original 
transmisson.?

If you're missing the bolts that hold the transmission in, you could be separ-
ating the engine from the trans instead of compressing the pressure plate.
Try crawling under there while someone presses the clutch pedal. Nothing 
should
move except the cable and the throwout arm. If the tranny or motor is shifting
that 'could' be the problem. If it is, and you've been driving like that, the 
lack
of clutch action could have over stressed the synchros...
