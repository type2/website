Subject: Re: [T2] fuel filter replacement questions

Get yourself a fuel line clamp.  Bob at VWTech was kind enough to sell
me one of his snap-on plastic clamps with an order of parts, and it's
changed my life.  ;-)

I've looked at various types on the web, looks like they all would work
nicely.  Just get one, makes your life less fuel tainted.  

Having just gone thru this to troubleshoot problems, I would get the
rear end of the bus up a bit so you have some room to work.  Get some
line that will fit OVER the existing line from the tank.  (7mm) 
Anything would do, as long as the fit is snug.  Clamp the line in the
middle from the tank to the filter.  Remove the filter end, putting the
filter over some sort of container to catch the dribbles there.  Slip
the larger diameter extension over the existing hose, route it out to a
large can beside the bus, and remove the clamp.  Rinse and repeat 'till
tank is empty.

While you're at it, why not replace ALL of your fuel hose with the
CORRECT stuff?  The bulk is 7mm, and the bit between the filter and the
pump is a larger diameter that escapes me at the moment.  Readily
available from some list vendors.  

Please, do NOT replace with something "close enough"...  This is your
fuel system.  Don't make me Doktor Tim you.  hehe.
