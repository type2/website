Subject: Re: [T2] Propane tank question, Will this work?????????

> I assume that the 68-79 Westfalias and the
 Vanagon Westfailas do not have tanks with these new

Whoever refuses to fill a bus tank needs to read the law. Horizontal, stationary tanks mounted to motorhomes
ARE not covered by this regulation. In other words, exempt.
