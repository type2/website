high greg i have just had the engine out to replace the tranny and didnt see that the engine flywheel was damaged or warped but could of been?
It rumbles really bad when releasing the clutch in first like the thing is comeing apart.
the only oil leak that i have at the momment is with the oil filler tube which i will be takeing apart tonight to fix and seal and replace wednesday night so that the seal will have plenty of time to rubber up for me..
