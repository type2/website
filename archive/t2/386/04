Subject: Dizzy?

Since everybody has been saying that the 009 is a little wishy washy and that 
some hesitation is to be expected I decided to look around for something 
different and have found a 034 vacuum advance dizzy for $66.00 and was 
wondering first if this will fit my 69 1600 engine and secondly if that is a 
good price.
