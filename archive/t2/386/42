in my bus I have removed the entire heating system, and with it some of
the very bottom tin (not the piece between the cyl) as such I was
concerned about not triggering the thermostat correctly and to be safe
removed it, I have a temp guage and the bus does not fluctuate that much
but in the winter it does run cooler than optimal
