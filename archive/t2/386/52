I'm not sure how a misaligned clutch disk could possibly persist after the first time the clutch was depressed, though.  If you get the engine mated to 
the tranny at all, you've got at least a minimum amount of alignment among gland nut, input shaft, and clutch disk, right?  And the first time you 
depress the clutch while the engine is running, the disk is released and can shift about radially on the input shaft splines as far as slop allows 
(<1mm?).  So how can you affect the alignment of the disk for other than installation purposes?

Now I can see a misaligned PP persisting -- as Ronnie recently pointed out he had gotten some Sachs PPs that were not precisely the right diameter, 
allowing them to be mounted off center on the flywheel (enough slop in the 6 mounting bolt holes).

It occurs to me that my experience is with uprights and this may not all apply to a TypeIV engine.....

Just wonderin'
