Subject: Re: [T2] Propane tank question, Will this work?????????

We have two 20lb Horizontal tanks that we use for our oven/range. Both ARE
subject to 10 year inspection, and MUST have the new valves to be filled
here in BC. Same regs when we were in California last year.  Been there done
that, went through all of this, still had to get the new valves. Check with
Transport Canada if you are unclear.

Cheers,
Matthew

As Karl has pointed out,, If you have been refused when asked to fill that
style
 of HORIZONTAL tank,,, You are getting erroneous information!

 In Ontario, and all Of North America .. HORIZONTAL tanks are EXEMPT.

 If you want to replace your valve,, you need one that DOES NOT have the
OPD...
 as gravity can cause improper operation of this valve on a HORIZONTAL tank.

 no best before date
 no valve regulations


 But they must be safe,, and rust or dents are not acceptable... or leaking
 valves.
