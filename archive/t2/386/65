Subject: Re: [T2] warped flywheel? on 76 bus

Hello Guys   I have to respone to this . We always gring the flywheel when 
doing a clutch job, it is the proper way to do it. You can not look at a 
flywheel and tell if it is warped, just like you can't tell a brake rotor is 
warped by looking at it. I have a peterson flywheel grinder that will remove 
the warpage and hot spots. You can not remove hot spots with a lathe. Also 
the flywheel grinder will remove just the bare amount also something that 
can't be done on a lathe. My friends not to sound too much like Dr Tim but 
there a right way to do a job and a half ass way. the choice is yours but I 
have to do this for a living and I don't like to do something twice. You 
should also replace the main seal with a clutch job.  Later and have fun
