The Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection is warning consumers and businesses about illegal refrigerants sold for motor vehicle air conditioning. The products are highly flammable, and can pose a serious risk to service technicians and vehicle occupants. 

The Mel Brown Farm Supply in Johnstown, Colorado, sells Red Tek 12a. which contains several flammable liquified gases, and is banned in Wisconsin and several other states. The company is targeting farmers, farm implement businesses and vehicle repair shops with mail solicitations. Purchasers should contact the Regulation & Safety Section at 608-224-4944, or the Consumer Protection Hotline at 800-422-7128. 

Other products containing illegal hydrocarbons include Duracool, Enviro-Safe, HC 12a, OZ-12, and Maxi-Frig 12a. Sales are often through multi-level marketing networks, and begin with mail, newspaper want ads and Internet solicitations. "These are not product brands typically found in auto parts stores", says Judy Cardin, chief of the Regulation and Safety Section. "
