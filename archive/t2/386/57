Subject: Thermostat

Does anybody have any of the thermostat mounting/operating rod and whatever 
else I might need to install the thermostat on a 1600 that they would be 
willing to part with. I haven't checked with the local boneyard yet. I don't 
see any problem getting one off of a donar odes anybody else? all this talk of 
thermostats reminded me that mine was MIA and I would like to get it installed 
before I finally get this bus on the road.
