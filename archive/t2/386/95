It's a no-no in the USA, along with Duracool, Enviro-Safe, HC 12a, and
OZ-12.

EPA info:
http://www.epa.gov/ozone/snap/refrigerants/lists/mvacs.html
http://www.epa.gov/ozone/snap/refrigerants/lists/unaccept.html

(They don't list Maxi-Frig 12a specifically, but it's the same thing as
Duracool.)

The only one that comes up as acceptable is "Free Zone":

("Freezone RB-276" in a search will bring up a list of other sources for
it.)
