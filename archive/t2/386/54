Did you replace the clutch disc and pressure-plate?  As a personal 
preference, I ALWAYS replace the disc at least when pulling the engine.  
Since I only do this every few years, cost isn't as much of a factor as the 
time and effort to pull the engine is. Usually by this time there is some 
spring unevenness in the PP anyway.  Springs in the clutch also wear out 
before the friction material is worn to min.  Cheap insurance IMHO.
