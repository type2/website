Subject: Re: [T2] warped flywheel? on 76 bus

If it was doing it with the old tranny, then that definitely means that the 
clutch disk is not properly centered on the flywheel.  The flywheel and 
engine are your two constants, you have changed the transmission and it's 
still doing it.  I would get a clutch disk alignment tool, center it, and 
reinstall the engine.  I bet that will fix it.
