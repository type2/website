Subject: Riviera Conversion

I spent most of the day yesterday installing an ASI Riviera Penthouse top on
Gretta, my '72 bus.  The install is pretty much done, and I think the
anxiety from cutting a huge hole in my baby is finally starting to subside.
Of course, as with any major project like this, I have a few questions...

Does anyone know of a good supplier for replacement seals for the Riviera?
I was looking at www.trimlok.com and it looks like they have a couple seals
that might work well.  The original seal seems to be fairly simple, just a
square edge that rests on the roof.  I wonder if a seal with a small bulb
might not tend to seal a bit better to protect against wind and rain?

What thickness is the original top mattress for the Riviera?  There was no
matress available with the poptop, so I will have to start from scratch.  I
think the top mattress in my Westy is 2" high density foam.  Would this work
well for the Riviera also?  If anyone has an original Riviera mattress that
they could pull dimensions from I would be eternally grateful.
