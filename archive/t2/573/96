Subject: RE: [T2] pulley/spacer behind fan

The spacer diameter is not too important but the thickness is. Is about the thickness of 1.5 music CDs... Maybe two. 

2mm-3mm. I can give a very specific measurement after I get out my caliper and get the thickness. 

The thickness of the pulley center is the same as the spacer thickness. 

The outer diameter needs to be bigger than the outside of the fan hub so the fan has a flat surface to sit on. 

Need digi-pics. I think I can find a puller and a spacer to take pics of.
