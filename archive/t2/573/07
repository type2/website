My thermostat (bellows element) is apparently toast. I've heard
that original thermostats are no longer available. Bus depot lists
one (part no. 111119159AGR that apparently will work, but requires some
modification. Can someone explain this modification and describe how
well this thermostat works in the 2.0L application?
