Not really Larry--

But the vehicle will have to have some intensive sanding to get the
roller marks off the surface of the Bus-Van--whatever--

I don't think anybody really thinks about this---nor cares--the thing
has some kinda paint on it--and it's good to go for now---

I can hardly imagine ( and don't want to ) how much paper and time it
would take to straighten out a mess like that---

Yeowza--~!!

And then if anybody wanted to get a decent finish--figure on how much
surface / primer that will be required to bury all the barn paint that
more than likely went along with the brush and roll job--

Yuck---



E-mail message

I hope those of you who are thinking of painting some or all of your Bus
with a roller realize that if you (or the next owner) ever want to do
the job right it will cost twice as much or more because the whole Bus
will have to be stripped to bare metal.
