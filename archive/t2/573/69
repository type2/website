Subject: RE: [T2] pulley/spacer behind fan

The smog pumps are driven from a funky pulley attached to the nose of the
fan (ie. closest to your face when you look into the engine compartment).
The pulley behind the fan was AC application only.

BTW, if you ever take the fan off a type IV motor and re-assemble it without
using either the pulley or the spacer you'll start chewing up fan belts
right and left.  It's interesting to me that VW must have designed this
setup to accomodate an AC system (else why would they have used the spacer
at all?).  Yet the AC systems were all after-market, dealer installed.  Go
figure.

P.S.  Andy, are you the Andy I bought the AC system from about 6 years ago
(when I was in San Antonio)?  I've still got it, but since I moved to
Colorado I sort of lost interest in installing it :)
