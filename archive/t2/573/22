Subject: Re: [T2] Painting fiberglass top question

Sorry for walking right into this question from the end..

I just did my top,
Cost me 20$
My VW shop told me to use Tremclad Rust Paint
Said buy a small roller and give it two coats. He's been
doing it and recommending it for years and years and years..
you get the idea.

So I bought 2 tins of semigloss white and did it.
Looks great! (thats' 20$ Canadian too)

<< It is expensive at $50 a gallon, but one gallon covered my top in
about 4 coats and I still had some left.
Good luck!!

50 bucks a gallon is cheap for a urethane paint.

Imron woud have cost you $300.00 minimum.
