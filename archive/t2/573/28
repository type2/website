It also has a tire size of 215/50R15, if my reference is correct.  This
is three sizes wider than the stock bus tires.  If you put your Passat on
185R14s, you would need to use light truck tires to carry the load.

There is also the issue of sidewall stiffness, which is a given with the
passat's 50 series tires.  The bus needs the truck tires as much for their
sidewall stiffness than for load-carrying capacity.

Empty, the passat has most of its weight on the front axle, and most of
the load you can add is over the rear axle, evening things out.  Remember
that putting weight in the extreme back actually unloads the front axle!

Empty, a bus has most of its weight on the rear axle, and as you add
weight most of it will be added to the rear axle.  This is why the empty
and loaded tire pressures for the front wheels are the same for the bus.
The rear tires on a bus really take a beating!

I think that comparing these two vehicles is apples and oranges.  Bus
tires may well be "old technology", but my '71 came with radial tires that
are pretty much the same as the ones available today.  Unless I want to
pop for 20 inch wheels and go bling'n with low profile tires I will
continue to run the "old" (actually "current") technology 185R14s.
