Subject: Painting Engine Tin

Hi Folks,

The picture of Mark Dearing's/Jamie Auch's AWESOME tie-dye engine inspired 
me to paint my engine tin.  My engine is out for service and I have all the 
tinware off, so it's pretty easy for me to throw a coat of paint on it 
before putting it all back together.

So, my question to The List is, what type of paint did you use?  I would 
imagine that some hi-heat paint like Rust-Oleum's BBQ paint would work well, 
but does it come in colors other than flat black?  I'm running an 
aftermarket exhaust and the tin behind (FIF) the fan gets pretty hot, and 
I'm sure it gets hot enough to burn off regular rattle-can paint.

I'm not looking to do a Way-kewl Supa-dope paintjob, just add a little color 
to non-critical tin.  If anybody else has done this, I'm sure you have some 
valuable insight.

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.


Best,
