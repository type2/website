Subject: Re: [T2] Painting fiberglass top question

I think you can paint your hitop (once it is sanded and primered) with just
about anything. However it comes down to how long the paint will last. As
stated the top will flex and over time could crack, chip and especially fade
in the sun.

Consider this...when I painted my hitop I went to the boat store and bought
the Interlux "top side" paint. This is paint made for the fiberglass deck of
a boat. It is SUPER UV resistant because the idea is that a boat deck gets
blasted by the sun a lot. It should hold up for years on my high top. The
Interlux paint is available in some limited colors, including a dark blue.
So it is probably possible to have it tinted to match your bus color. Or you
could possible buy the dark blue if it is to your liking and have the bus
paint matched to it, although I bet you have your heart set on a color
already. I would call the biggest boat store in your area and see if they
carry the topside paint and then ask them about color matching. It is
expensive at $50 a gallon, but one gallon covered my top in about 4 coats
and I still had some left.

Good luck!!
