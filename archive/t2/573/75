Subject: 2/3 Middle & Rear Bench+ TMI Vintage Series Covers on eB*y

Hope this is ok for Friday....

I have just listed a brand spankin' new set of TMI's Vintage Series upholstery
on eB*y!
Color is two-tone Silver Plat./Mesh Plat.

You get one set for the 2/3 Bench and one set for the Rear Bench.

Also included is the original 2/3 bench from my 1974 Microbus and the Rear
Bench.  Both in very nice restorable condition.  The seat covers are new in
the box.

Here is a link to the auction:

Please feel free to e-mail with questions.

Thanks,

Tom
