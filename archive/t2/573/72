Subject: RE: [T2] Re: MORE paint questions

Let me just toss my rasta beanie in the ring here and suggest that there are a number of reasons for seeking a
"less than optimal" solution. If money is an issue, and God knows it is for me, then you have to make some hard
choices--

1) Let the bus rot until you can afford a "correct" paint job
2) Get a second job (and have less time to enjoy the bus) to pay for the "correct" paint job
3) Do a less than correct, but "good enough" paint job

Depending on the objective, Choice #3 might make the most sense. 

ON TOPIC--I wouldn't use Rust-O-Leum! I've heard that it has a fish oil base that prevents any sort of
overpainting. I'd search the archives for a no-rust auto primer and a good paint alternative.

For my own rusty bus I'm considering "stabilizing" the front window rust with Eastwood's Rust Encapsulator and
who knows, maybe rattle-can paint over that. Tractor paint sounds interesting, maybe that.  I plan to
experiment with something that won't be a horrible match for the Bright Orange. Someday I hope to be able to
replace the entire nose section and do the job "right." But someday is not here now and I'd rather do a "good
enough" job than do nothing.

In Cybernetics terms this is called "satisficing." It is different from a "cob job" because one strives for the
highest quality, all the while recognizing that the results may be less than optimal. Source:
