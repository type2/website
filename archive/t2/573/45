Subject: Boneyard Find

10 June 2004

I have happened upon a rare find, at least for my neck of the woods. In a
local auto repair/boneyard there is a 77 T2 station wagon. A year ago the
guy said he wasn't selling it whole or in pieces; today he said he'll sell
me anything I want off of it. I pulled a few small items I wanted today and
I'll be going back for a few more this weekend. I just wondered if anyone
here on the list might be needing some of the remaining items. Let me see if
i can list out what's left on it.

First, there is NO engine, NO transmission, and NO FI parts at all. That
being said, I did see:
        -instrument cluster
        -fuse box, looked intact
        -tail light lenses, both sides. They looked OK but who knows if they
disintegrate when touched
        -side markers, front and rear
        -all glass is good EXCEPT for the windshield. the sliding door has a
vent wing as does the window opposite
            also the large glass on the sliding door has a lerge VW emblem
etched on it
        -rear hatch looked good, as did the engine hatch.
        -front seats are intact but Very 'sat out' brown vinyl candidates
for rebuilds.
        -middle seat is gone, rear bench is there, also brown
        -brake fluid reservoir
        -most of the body metal looked OK but I didn't look too closely.
        -on the rear hatch are is the chrome 'fuel injection' emblem

That's all I can think of right now. P-mail if you have specific needs and
I'll check it out for you. I'm willing to pull parts and ship reasonable
pieces.

Regards,
Dave
