i believe they are good tires. we used to get that brand here in canada,
they made very good snow tires in particular. i have not seen them much in
recent years, but they were seen as a premium tire last time i knew anything
about them.

of course, make sure the tire specs are what you need, brand is irrelevant
if it is the wrong type of tire.

the reinforced/extra load tires look promising, but the website is pretty
skimpy on specs. they seem to have a head office in NJ.
