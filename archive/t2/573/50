Subject: 050 Distributor

Can anyone give me a hint on the orientation of the little notch (#1)  on
the distributor when installing an 050 in a type IV eng - In other words
where should that notch point to begin with - I seem to recall from an
earlier post that it was different from my stock vac unit

Thanks
Eric
