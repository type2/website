I have to agree.  Way back before I knew better (it's in the archives) I
ran standard load tires on my bus.  Everything went swimmingly until I had
two tread separations (both rear wheels) within 100 miles on a road trip,
on half-worn-out tires.

Learned my lesson, switched to 185R14 load range D, and carry two spares
on road trips.  Nary a problem after that!
