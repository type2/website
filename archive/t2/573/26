Subject: MORE paint questions.

     The thread on paint has me thinking about what I want to do with the 
paint on my bus.  I like my bus for what it can do, not what it looks like 
(sorry!).  So for my paint I just wanted to do something cheap and easy that 
will keep the rust off, be durable, and be mostly one color :-)  Now as for 
short changing the job, I don't consider it that.  I just know what I want 
out of my bus, and it's not really looks.
     I was kind of thinking of some Rustoleum green on the bottom and white 
on the top painted on with a roller and brush.  I know that's not going to 
look great, but other than looks will it cause any problems?  Is that going 
to allow rust to come and attack the bus?  What other cheap and easy options 
are there?  If the only good way to do it is auto paint, I guess I'll do it 
that way.  I'd just like to hear some options.
