Mike,

Whooo!  Not so fast there on the statement below.

Volkswagen Products Corporation in Ft. Worth Texas was a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Volkswagen of America.  Before they bought it, it was the 
first company to have ever installed an automobile air-conditioner in any 
car.  They "old" guys there claimed they put an a/c in something like a 
1954 Cadillac when it was new....sorry I don't remember the original name of the 
company.  They President and VP of VPC were both native speaking 
Germans....and sounded like it too!  LOL

We designed a/c for all sorts of cars other than VW's, but mostly VW.
We designed the a/c for the first Rabbit's..installed at the factory IIRC.

We had the front clip for a bay  window bus about 6 months before the 
world knew that they were going to change.  The under-dash a/c was designed 
around it to start with.

A very close friend of mine(college buddy/roommate) was the person that 
did most of the design work on the overhead a/c's.  I think they reason 
that dealer's installed them and then later on at the port, was that VW 
just couldn't see shipping  them to Germany as kits and then back to the 
U.S. as part of cars.

We had a T4 engine on a test stand to use to design all of the compressor
mounts for the engine.  I bought that engine from the company at a "clean 
up sale" before I quit working there($250).

When I started working there in 1972 as a master R&D tech,, I started out 
in a/c design part and then started working pretty much exclusively on 
cruise control kits for everything else in the world...even did Porsche's,
BMW's and Mercedes....along with the odd Chevette here and there<grin>.
You all *do* remember what a Chevette was, right?  After we got though 
with that one, I swore i would never ever stick my hand into the engine 
compartment of a Chevette again...*NO* breaks on the edges of any of the 
sheet metal...everything was like a razor blade.


 Cheers, dave --
