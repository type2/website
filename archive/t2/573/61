Greg--

I know exactly where your coming from--and boy---you win the all time
LMAO award--
(I'm still laughing as I hunting and pecking this response)--:>)

You'd  be on the street hunting for Pop bottles---

Good one--

They used to be the source of my gas money waaay back when--I remember
this one well--

I think pop bottles brought 2--3 cents Beer bottles where a nickel--a
great find--
gas was a quarter a gallon--i'd be good for a couple of days ( if I
stayed off the throttle ) in my 56 Pontiac Starchief )

I understand the unreal cash outlay for refinishing materials--

But here's how in my mind I justify the ridiculous costs--
 
I only want to do this job once---I only want to do this job once---I
keep telling myself this--

 I wake up in the morning finding my right arm moving as though it's
sanding---and when the paint looks great for as long as I own the
ride--this makes me happy--makes the job of selling the ride a lot
easier--and then I wind up buying another toilet that needs paint
again--Boy am I one sick puppy--

My next vehicle--whatever it is--will be new--

I'm getting burnt out working on my own stuff--let alone the vehicles I
do for a living--
 
I'm still laughing about the pop bottles--great analogy---you did good
on that one---:>)


Take Care--

Terry

 
<<< I appreciate a nicely painted bus as much as the next guy, but if
I'd painted the westfakia at a "Pro" shop instead of Maaco then I'd
still be scouring the streets looking for bottles to return to pay for
it. (I bet a third of this list is too young to remember returnable soda
bottles. We haven't had them here in Ontario since forever).
