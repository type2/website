It seems to be working when I try it. If you are trying to order the
N.O.S. manuals that I posted about yesterday
(<http://busdepot.com/catalog.jsp?model=100>), it could be that one was
pulled off of the website when already in your shopping cart. I've been
pulling them off the site as they sell out, which seems to be happening
pretty quickly. I don't know if it might generate an error if an item
were already in your cart when I pulled it.  Just a guess. 

I did get one person this morning who told me they couldn't reach
busdepot.com at all (not even the main page). But since I didn't get any
other complaints, and we've been getting orders all day, I chalked it up
to an ISP problem on his end. Anyone else having trouble?
