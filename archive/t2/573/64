Hi Terry,

For me personally the bus is a hobby. (OK, some people draw a fine line 
between hobby and "obsession" but let's leave that alone for now..) .. 
I "wrench" on computers for a living. Working my frustrations out in  
the driveway is a nice distraction after a day of telling customers 
stuff they could have found in page 2 of the manual and fixing 
manufacturers defects. So if I have to do something over every couple 
of years on it doesn't bother me as much. If I wasn't "working" on the 
bus I'd probably be doing some other expensive hobby, and that would 
make for twice as much $$ falling out of my wallet. After all, a night 
in the driveway turning a wrench or pushing sandpaper is pretty cheap 
entertainment, AND it saves me $$$ over paying someone else to do the 
work.

Often it turns out that I go back to a repair late to do something 
better... Last summer I resized my engine to 2L, this spring I upgraded 
to Fuel Injection. If I could have done them both at once it definitely 
would have been nice... I could have saved about $200 in fuel by now. 
But I wouldn't have had it done in time for my summer vacation and 
BOTC.  As it turned out I wasn't able to compile a full set of FI parts 
until March of this year.

I do agree that doing something right the first time is cheaper. It's 
just not always possible for everyone.  YMMV.

Happy trails,
