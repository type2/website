50 bucks a gallon is cheap for a urethane paint.

Imron woud have cost you $300.00 minimum.

As far as the cheepo spray guns go--remember this -you only get what you
pay for--and I have never seen anything outa Harbor Freight worth
writing home about---

My Binks #7 cost $395.00--the Binks #2001 was $379.00--without the cup--

Both lay down paint perfect--
