Rob,

http://www.shockwaverider.com/newengine/

All powder coated except for the very front piece(por-15).

I did all of it(except the fan shroud) including the heater boxes in my 
shop oven($50).  Heater boxes in hi-temp "aluminum color" and the sheet 
metal in semi-gloss black.  Plenum and intake runners, same as the heater 
boxes.

Yours looks terrific...yes, you can powder coat in yellow or *neon* yellow 
if you want.

I have powder from both of these companies...

Take a look at some of the powders these guys have...awesome!!!
All it takes is a sand-blaster, an old electric oven, and a powder coat 
gun....ya don't need the fancy expensive one either.

Cheers, dave
