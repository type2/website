Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Pedal Question

3rd possibiliy (happened to me) - bad brake booster. Mine filled up with
water over time and would not fully release the master cylinder even
when I pulled up the pedal. I first swapped fluid, flex hoses, master
cylinder, and calipers until I made the right diagnosis ...
To rule out this problem, pull vacuum hose from booster and check for
fluid inside (I used a little hand pump). Pulling the vacuum hose and
checking whether the brakes behave differently may also serve as an
indication. Do not run the engine longer than necessary with the vacuum
hose disconnected - huge vaccum leak.

Go underneath and lubricate the pivot point. If that doesn't resolve the

issue, you got a sticky, contaminated master cylinder. How filthy is the

fluid?? Know if the problem is contamination, the whole system is 
contaminated. You can try flushing new fluid through the system. Do it 
twice a few days apart. Exercise the calipers each time. If that doesn't

resolve all issues with no leaks, budget replacement of all cylinders, 
calipers and flex hoses. Do it all at once then flush and renew the
fluid 
yearly and you will NEVER have another hydraulics issue.
