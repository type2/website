Subject: bus is fatter

Yup, the new old bus I got is fatter than when it got the
Westfalia treatment way back in 74'.

I thought I should get her ready for camping and wanted
to make sure everything fits... (just bought it this spring)

Tried to put the kids cot up front and the brackets that go
width wise are an 1" too short. All I can figure is the bus
got fat and old and it's posture went bad... became a little
shorter and squatter.

Any other thoughts?
