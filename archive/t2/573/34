Subject: Re: [T2] Binks paint gun

 About 20 years ago I borrowed a Binks model 115 (I think that was the number)
touch up gun to paint door jambs and engine compartment,  It did an amazing 
job
without runs or orange peel. I lost contact with the painter that loaned it 
to me. 
I would like to find another. The salesman at the local car paint supply says 
it
can't be sold in this area due to "clean air" requirements. Anyone know a 
source
for that Binks. I could do my painting at my son's place in Oregon......
