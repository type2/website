Orient engine TDC #1. Install dizzy. Turn body until rotor points to the 
little notch. You may need to reorient or get a different capacitor for 
clearance. Some mount left of the clip, some to the right. You can also 
install the drive tang 180 degrees which will put the capacitor opposite 
any restriction. With left/right mount capacitor and 180 degree tang 
options, that makes 4 combinations, one or more of which will allow proper 
orientation and timing. For sure it will be different than stock cause it's 
not stock.

Timing with the 050 is as follows. Turn the idle screw in all the way, then 
back out one turn. Then set timing to get about 1000 rpm idle. Then you can 
turn the idle screw in to drop it a bit closer to spec, perhaps 900. That 
will probably be 10 BTDC or less. That will put total advance a bit short 
of optimum for the T-IV, but it is a whole bunch better than an 009.
