Subject: RE: [T2] bus is fatter

Er fabric shrunk?



...
Yup, the new old bus I got is fatter than when it got the Westfalia
treatment way back in 74'.

I thought I should get her ready for camping and wanted
to make sure everything fits... (just bought it this spring)

Tried to put the kids cot up front and the brackets that go width wise
are an 1" too short. All I can figure is the bus got fat and old and
it's posture went bad... became a little shorter and squatter.

Any other thoughts?
