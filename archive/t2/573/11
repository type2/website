Hi Volks,

I painted the Westfakia's roof in March of 2001 with 1 quart of 
Interlux Premium Yacht Enamel. The can cost $30CDN and was enough to 
cover the roof with two coats and still had enough left over to coat 
the bumpers as well.

You will get great results from a brush and roller, no spray-gun 
required.

Happy trails,
