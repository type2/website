Which is why its easier and better to strip it down to bare metal. Still,
the cost of time and materials to do that is more than the paint job. I
worked in the business for 11 years and I could tell you stories of
corners cut by owners to save money in the short run only to find that
they have cost themselves in the long run. One that makes my blood boil is
when a person is approached in a parking lot with an offer to fix their
dents on the spot. The culprit gets a coat of bondo slapped on without
even grinding the paint down. Its covered with a light coat of primer and
he's told to take it down to a paint shop when he's ready. Once at the
paint shop he finds out that the whole thing has to be taken down so the
body man can start over from scratch and do it right.

But, if you have a roach to start with and just want to feel better about
your ride for the short amount of time left before it goes back to the
earth, go for it. Paint it up to suit your fancy. Hand painted Busses
have a lot of character.
