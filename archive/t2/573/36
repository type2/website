Subject: custom exhaust

I was thinking about making a custom exhaust for our 2.0l bus engine. I have 
good heater boxes but thought maybe I'll eliminate them cause we dont drive it 
int the cold, and I thought maybe a little less weight is good. So my 
question is, what about running this bus with a custom exhaust and how much back 
pressure should I worry about or the more open the better. Thanks any help is well
