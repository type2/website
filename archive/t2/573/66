Subject: Brake Pedal Question

I had a little problem last night on my way home from work and needless
to say it caught me by surprise. My brake pedal, when depressed for
braking, now refuses to come back up. I literally have to use my foot
and lift it back up. I can't say this is a reoccuring problem but it
made the trip home yesterday a little more complicated (especially in
heavy traffic). Is there some type of spring or cable that releases the
brake pedal after you are done stepping on it? I didn't drive to work
today because of the fear of losing all braking or locking my brakes up.
Any suggestions would be helpful!
