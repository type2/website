Go to a local automotive paint store and talk with their in store 
specialist.  They will tell you exactly what paints need what primers 
and what primers may need other prep work as well.  They will even 
provide thinning rates as well as massive paint chip books.  They will 
even tell you the amount of and type of hardner to use.  I have done 
this with every paint job i have done.  (with the exception of my first 
one, any guesses on the results of that one?)
