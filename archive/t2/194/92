This does not sound good.  Oil in the cylinder can
only come from one place - past the piston.  If you
have this much oil, sounds like either the engine was
over heated and the rings in the (often failing)
number 3 are letting oil by.  Unless you dropped a
valve that beat a hole in your piston...

Where are you located?  Undoubtedly there is a list
member near you that can offer hands on assistance.
