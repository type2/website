Hi Richard

I must admit ,, that is a pretty bus in that photo!  AND it is posted on a
really great webpage!
I was pretty sure that was on Bartniks camping page tooo,, but I think Sean has
rearranged his site a bit.

That is my camper,, 
I have to admit,, I was just trying to dress up the camper a bit,, and imho I
liked the westfalia sticker so I bought 2 and put them where it looked good, to
ME and I am Happy! :-)

I was sort of swayed by the photo in the advertisement in the Vw magazine where
I located the vendor of the stickers. As they showed them on the front right...
Then I found the internet, and all the experts!.. and since have been told many
time that Westfalia doesn't belong on the front,, and only on the rear left of a
78 ish camper.
Oh well,,, I am still happy ! :-)

If you look again at that photo, you will see I took off the spare tire and put
on a large chrome emblem also, I wasn't really interested in 100% stock ..

Those logo's where put on in about 1995 , by me, without any indication that
there was any there before.

But the small logo on the side of the front cap was there originally, and I just
replaced them.

Hope that helps!
