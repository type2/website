If you blew out a spark plug, it wouldn't lose power gradually.
My vote is for a hole in a piston. Fits all the symptoms.
Might even be possible to drive an hour and a half more
like you did, but that is going to inevitably cost dearly.

No problem. Time enougfh to let it cool and do a
compression test. When you get really good, you
will be able to calculate the available sources of
immediate assistance, tools, parts, and procedures
to drop that hot engine at the side of the road and arrive
home repaired at the first hint of power loss.
