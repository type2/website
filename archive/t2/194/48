The scat engine and kits is the one engine item i dont remember ever 
hearing any complaints on.  I know of three that were installed locally 
and a year later were still running strong after severe abuse.  Not sure 
but i think either VW trends or HOT VW did a review on them a while 
back.  As for german parts... even the german engines have brazilian and 
mexican parts in them.
