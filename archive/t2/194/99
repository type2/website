Subject: RE: [T2] Please help Urgent!!!

While there's no way I can diagnose your engine from the comfort of this 
chair (which isn't all that comfortable) ... it doesn't sound like you'll be 
driving it cross-country anytime soon. Anything more serious than a dropped 
valve seat or a stripped plug hole probably means splitting the case (even a 
holed piston, since you'd need the clean the pieces of it out of the case). 
The oil situation is no good either. I agree with the sentiment that even if 
you could run it on 3 cylinders for a thousand miles without it overheating 
and throwing a rod (unlikely), you won't make it over the Rockies. I live 
there, and I have enough trouble making it over the Divide on 4 cylinders.

Definately do the compression test.

Good luck!
