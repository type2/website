Subject: hot times

The temps hereabout have hit the century and above.
Today, Driving my '68 breadloaf on the interstate at
65 on a grade put the temps into the uncomfortable
range (VDO dipstick gauge: 200*. As I pulled off an
exit to check the oil, engine missed a couple times.
And the oil lite stayed on at idle. Oil (multigrade
Quaker) was fine and the engine did NOT have that "hot
smell."

I drove slower the rest of the day and all was well.
But I'm going to be dealing with these temps all
summer and I may even be taking some steepish mountain
grades in it.

Question: Are there some special things I can do to
maximize my bus's chances of survival?

i.e. Put in 50w straight grade oil? should I set
timing on the retarded side?

(BTW, Except for the temp gauge and Budda pendant, the
bus is stock.)
