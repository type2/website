This would have described me several years back.  Passenger-rated tires
that I was happy with.  Then two of them decided to separate their belts
within 100 miles of each other.  This left me stranded in Bishop,
California, not exactly the tire capital of the world.  I ended up buying
a worn-out tire just to get to Reno where I bought a set of proper 185R14
load range D tires.  I was amazed at how well the bus handled after that.
I had nothing to compare to, so the mushy handling of the weak tires felt
OK until I switched.
