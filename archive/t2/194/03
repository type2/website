Subject: further dual carb questions

I meant to ask this in the last post.  There are three ports I see for
vacuum.  on the "spider" there is a port in the center.  This has got to
be "manifold" and is capped.  On the left carb, there are two ports.  on
comes from the throttle plate, faces the center of the bus and appears to
be manifold vacuum.  This port is currently capped off.  The second comes
from the venturi body of the carb, faces away from the center of the bus,
and is connected to the advance port on the distributor.

Questions:

Have I correctly identified the port function for the ported vacuum as the
upper, outer port on the left carb?

Neither manifold vacuum port is currently connected. Where should the two
manifold vacuum ports be connected?
