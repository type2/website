3 M makes an adhesive remover. A body shop supplier would have it.
Another source would be a commercial janitorial supply house. The
problem with removing adhesives is finding out just "what" was used.
A professional installation is easy...Carpet adhesive is used with car-
pet, etc. DIY jobs are often "what's at hand"...Another easy first try
is a heat gun...Start at the lowest setting and keep working the temp.
up - Just be sure whatever is around or underneath the hot spot can
take the heat without melting or igniting. 
As an aside, I did some repair work on an old Victorian house...Gorgeous
parquet floors with patterned borders...Or they were, until someone
glued down carpet with an adhesive that left black blotches in the oak.
