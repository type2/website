Subject: HELP! Air cleaner instal & Cooling Flaps

Hi all,
   Thanks for all the help you have given me so far, here is some other 
questions I am hoping to get some help with.  I have consulted my Bentley, 
but perhaps because I have not done much technical reading before, it has 
not helped me with these specific questions.
   If you want a visual of the stuff I am about to describe or ask questions 
about, here is a link to pictures of my engine as it applies to these 
questions.

1) My engine appears to have been from a 79, and is a 2000CC according to 
the Bartnik engine code list (Engine code GE).  Does this mean I shouldn't 
even be attempting to use the air cleaner from a 74?
2) Okay, if I can fit in this 74 air cleaner I bought, how (maybe send me 
some pictures)?  There is a little fuel pump in the way, is that supposed to 
be there, and if not there, where?
3) For the carb pre-heater hose on the air cleaner, where does that go?  All 
I have is the two holes/ducts for the heater blower.
4) While you're at it, what about the other vacuum line on the air cleaner?  
One attaches to the air cleaner itself on the little round doo-hickey (got 
that much from the Bentley) where does the other one go?
5) Alright, I think I have found the "cooling flaps" you guys always talk 
about.  Mine are still there!!  The little wire that controls them, what 
does that hook to? The carb linkage/accelerator cable?  It's been cut on 
mine.
6) look at the pic of my alternator.  Should there be another tin piece 
there, or a cover for those big holes?

HELP! Makes for such a crappy battle cry!
