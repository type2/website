wow, outdid myself and didn't hurry or cut corners, even fought with
getting the (-at-)#&*$% temp sensor back in....but I have done it a few times
before.....3/4 head swap on 78 Fuel Injected 2 liter!!

OK I cheated a little and didn't drop the engine but I'm not sure how much
time that actually saves.
