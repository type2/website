Subject: curious about valve clearance

Dear list,
please give me enlightenment ...

1. Are all the valves should be set w/ the same clearance ? I read Muir, Bentley and AFAIK
same clearance.

2. If not, what will happen if I set intake valve tighter or looser than exhaust valve ?

3. Should I set the clearance differently if I install an A/C unit for my bus ?

4. Tigher clearance means the valve opens longer than loose one ? It seems to me,
especially when I look at http://www.howstuffworks.com/engine.htm

I already through the lib and archive, there are some postings but nothing answers my
curiosity ...

Thank's a alot
