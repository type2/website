Mixing brands, in and of itself, is not that risky.

Actually, synthetics supposedly handle high temp _better_ than conventional
oil.  However, most synthetics I've seen are 10W30 or lower.  I tend to
prefer either straight 30 weight or 20W50 in an aircooled engine.   I have
always had good luck using 20w50 in the winter and 30 weight during the
warmer months.

This has me worried.  Of course it could be a lot of things.  On the minor
side, you could have merely shot a spark plug out of one cylinder, if the
threads are stripped. (Happened to me once; made quite a racket!)  On the
major side, you could have dropped a valve seat and thrown a rod through the
case. (Happened to me once; made quite a racket!)  Both would account for
the loss of power and the noise, but then again so could a lot of other
things.  Sounds like it may be best to do a compression test and take things
from there.

Here's hoping you just lost a spark plug!
