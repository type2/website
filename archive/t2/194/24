Subject: Re: [T2] further dual carb questions

On my 71 all the brass bushings were worn out.  They
both were so gunky it was all sealed up tight.

Until my ever helpful brother dipped them in carb
cleaner over night.  The next day we could get it to
run at all. (all the buildup was gone!)

In the end we had to get all new bushings made and
pressed in.

There is my two centavos
