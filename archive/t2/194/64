Subject: 1600 oil leak dagnostic inquiry

hello volks,
just returned from an oakland to wyoming round trip in
our 69 Bay window. things went very well. it was my
first long road trip in a bus with a 1600 and i was
nervous about the long climbs but we did fine. 

when i returned home the first time i started the
engine the oil light stayed on a little longer than
usual at low idle. i took notice and checked the
oil.we had not used ANY oil in the 3000 mile round
trip. and for the first time were a bit low.  the next
day i noticed a small puddle forming under the engine
while it idled for 10 minutes. crawling underneath
revealed some kind of leak. there is oil under(where
the oil drain bolt is) there is some on the muffler
(right side) also a bit inside the engin compartment.

any ideas on what to check first based on this, 
i have some time to fix it before my next trip  but
must do it soon


thanks in advance for any useful info

Mick in Oakland
