Subject: (OH NO!!) OIL

Now that my guages are installed, I think I have oil pressure issues. I am
currently using Shell Performance 40 weight dino oil on a *moslty* stock
carburated 1.8L with 18K on an AVP rebuild. Once the oil reaches full temp
(~200), the idle pressure goes down dramatically. There is a corresponding
drop in pressure at speed as well. I am going to try using a higher quality
oil, specifically Castrol HD40. (The Shell is a loss leader sale oil for
Advance auto parts.) While perusing the oil shelves at my FLAPS today I
noticed that they carry Kendall 50 weight. Has anybody used this oil, or any
50 weight oil, in their T4 engine? If so, what kind of results did you have?

As always, opinions, facts, conjectures, hypothetical and theoretical
speculations welcomed and even encouraged.
