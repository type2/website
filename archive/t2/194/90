Subject: exhaust stud question and carb info needed


I have my engine out ('74 Westy, 1.8l) to take care of a few problems
and try to get it running better.

There's quite a few things I need to do, and have questions on a couple of
them.

1. One of the exhaust studs is missing. Local VW FLAPS told me it's an 8x9mm
   stud. He doesn't stock them. I pulled one from a spare 1.8l that I have
   and it's 8x8mm, but when I put it in the head it's loose. Would that be
   because the hole is stripped or did some heads really come with 8x9mm
   studs and others 8x8mm? I need to get a new stud ASAP (I'm not going to
   put the engine back together until I have it) and I need to know whether
   I'll be tapping out a 9mm hole or not. If so, is this something I can do
   with the head still bolted on (is it a blind hole or will I have to worry
   about bits of metal getting in the cylinder?)

2. My bus has Weber 34 ICT carbs. I have zero info on them and have found
   all but zero info on them on the web. Does anyone know where to get 
   specs, etc. on these carbs? There's an outfit in England that still sell
   them and say they're great, but they have virtually no info online except
   pricing. I'm not going to swap these out for something else -- they work
   pretty well and I'm going to put an engine with FI in the bus before
   too long, but just want to make sure they're tuned up properly in the
   interim.

I think I can deal with all my other issues myself. Thanks in advance for
any info/advise.
