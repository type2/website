I bought self adjusters from JC Whipme. They came with all the hardware
needed and then some, and work great. I think they where about $100 a pop.  
Not cheap, but I feel better knowing that I have new belts in. Belts are
suposed to strech a little in an accident to keep you from breaking
things. Old belts loose there give, or may have even been in an accident
at some point. You are much safer with new belts. They may not be stock,
but they make me feel safer in my bus.
