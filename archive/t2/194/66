Subject: Cap Nuts (Oil Plate/Strainer Cover Nuts)

Folks,

I'm having a tough time finding these things for my '70 loaf.  I did
find them at aircooled.net for $2 each, however!  Yikes!  $12 seems kind
of high for six cap nuts.  Anyone out there have a better source for
these nuts?  Oh...and are the oil plate cover studs 21mm long?

In other news, I saw a 67 (I think) double cab 3-door pickup for sale
here in Tacoma, WA.  I just spoke with the guy and he said he'd take $5k
for it.  It's all been gone over mechanically, with "only" the interior
and body to finish up.  It's his primary trasportation, and he says it's
mechanically sound.  The interior doesn't look that bad (better than
mine, but that's not saying a lot), and the body looks ok too.  It would
want paint, but there are no blatant rust problems, just the odd dimple
here and there.

If I'd seen it a week ago, I would have bought it (instead I got the
anthesis of the VW pickup...a Ford F-250 with a 460 V8).  If anyone is
interested, you can send me your info, and I'll try and get it to this
guy.  He lives on a boat, so tracking him down might be a challenge.

Thanks again,
