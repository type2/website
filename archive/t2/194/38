Subject: Re: [T2] `71 BUS MASTER CYLINDER CONVERSION HELP!

I am replacing all brake stuff on my '72.  My vacuum servo is also bad.
However, it will stop with a failed servo, it does have a failsafe mode,
just plug the vacuum line to it so the engine runs well.

I have sent my servo to H&R rebuilders in Dallas to get rebuilt.  I expect
it to cost me about $100.  I like thinks to work like they are supposed to,
especially my brakes.  I safety is worth this investment, especially when
there is only about 0.093" of steel between my knees and all those SUV's
that are in front of me.
