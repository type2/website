Subject: more fuel pressure problems.


hello again...

my woes with fuel injection continue. Still, the following problem
persists:

My engine will start, run for about 45 seconds, then dies. It is very
difficult to start back up immediately. You have to wait for about an
hour... then it will only run for a few seconds. The fuel pressure when
cranking is about 37psi. When I stop cranking the starter the pressure
will slowly drop to zero in a 20 second time period. Is that normal?
remember it taking a LOT longer for the pressure to drop to zero after
cranking the engine. However, when the engine does start, runs, then
stalls...  the pressure reads zero as soon as i can run to the engine
compartment and read the gauge... Is that what is causing
the engine to stall? low pressure? Also, I am 100% positive there are no
leaks in the lines.


 I havne't been able to read the pressue
while running yet... need a helper...maybe tomorrow. 

I replaced the fuel pressure regulator with a new one. I drained the fuel
system, and am using Chevron Techron fuel system cleaner with new gas as
suggested to me from the list. I still hve the same problem. 

If this is in fact a pressure problem, the only other thing I can think of
is the pump.... maybe once the engine starts up the pump's pressure is too
weak to keep the engine going for more than 45 seconds.... does that sound
like a reasonable explination... even though the gauge reads 37psi when
cranking.... if not where else should i look....(aside from a weber
conversion ;) Fuel injection is great when it works.... but it can be a
headache when it doesn't.

thanks,
Eddie
