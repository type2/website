Subject: Sad news-- 74 westy FS

Well, it looks like I will be taking a position
in Florida.  This forces me to get rid of at
least one of my vehicles, my 94 Camry or my 74
Westy.  You know which I'm rooting for, but my
wife would prefer air conditioning on those rare
days she'd be driving my car.  Three vehicles is
out of the question as we will likely be in a
condo for awhile.  

74 one with the large poptop and full width bed
up top.  Very comfy.  I sleep up there when
camping alone.  Downstairs is a full width bed
that seats three not two like the later busses. 
Behind the driver is a sink cabinet.  Behind the
passenger is an icebox.  (I don't care much for
the two cabinets).  In cargo hatch is another
cabinet.  Green/blue interior.  

It has rust in the usual east coast spots,
rockers, arches, front floor.  PO had Maaco spray
the bus.  Looks good from a few feet, about what
you'd expect for a bus in this price range.  

It is an 1800cc, rebuilt by AVP for the PO. 
Approx 30,000 miles.  Good compression all the
way around, 120 psi.  No leaks.  Tranny shifter a
little sloppy.  I had bushings on the to do list.
 Front end also needs at least a tie rod. (I'd do
all.)  

New tires, front shocks (KYB), distributor,
tuneup, brakes, clutch cable.  

Asking $2500.  I'd just love for a listmember to
adopt my bus so I know it's going to a good home.
