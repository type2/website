It's normal for oil pressure to drop dramatically with increase in oil =
temp. When I was putting dino oil in my '79 Type IV engine, 40w =
Valvoline racing oil seemed to lower oil temp slightly in the summer and =
provide good oil pressure.

I think that 50w might be too thick, unless you're driving through the =
Sahara Desert in summer. It could cause the front seal to blow when =
starting the engine on a very cool morning.

Now that my guages are installed, I think I have oil pressure issues. I =
am
currently using Shell Performance 40 weight dino oil on a *moslty* stock
carburated 1.8L with 18K on an AVP rebuild. Once the oil reaches full =
temp
(~200), the idle pressure goes down dramatically. There is a =
corresponding
drop in pressure at speed as well. I am going to try using a higher =
quality
oil, specifically Castrol HD40. (The Shell is a loss leader sale oil for
Advance auto parts.) While perusing the oil shelves at my FLAPS today I
noticed that they carry Kendall 50 weight. Has anybody used this oil, or =
any
50 weight oil, in their T4 engine? If so, what kind of results did you =
have?

As always, opinions, facts, conjectures, hypothetical and theoretical
speculations welcomed and even encouraged.
