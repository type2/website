Driveability on 3 cylinders would of course depend on how strong the engine
is on the remaining three. I recently lost a head gaket in my Fiat Spider
(1800cc) but didn't know that this was my problem at first.  It got a bit
loud and lost some power, but wasn't running so poorly that it caused me to
pull it over and call AAA. I wasn't overly concerned; was guessing maybe a
major exhaust leak and rough running due to lack of back-pressure.  So the
next day I drove it to my mechanic (at 50 mph, although it did lug on
hills).  He did a compression test and discovered that it was essentially
running on 1-1/2 cylinders!  I guess that remaining one cylinder was really
kicking some butt! :-)  On the other hand, I've seen more than one car that
had such a tired engine that it was effectively running on the equivalent
compressions of 3 cylinders even when it was running on all four, and the
owner didn't even realize it!  (Especially on busses, where the reputation
for lack of power is so overblown that some people think that their 2 liter
bus dropping to 40 mph up-hill is normal!)  Take one cylinder away from that
engine, and such a bus would barely run at all.

But... a lot of smoke and severe oil loss are not particularly consistent
with the blown plug theory. I guess I should have read the symptoms more
carefully, or perhaps it was wishful thinking... Indeed, it's starting to
sound like something more severe to me.

I saw a Vanagon (early watercooled) drive nearly 20 miles at about 40-45 mph
with a big hole in the top of the case.  (Although admittedly I've never
seen this happen on an type 4 engine.)  As with the Fiat example above,
sometimes an engine will surprise you...
