I am using valvoline 50W race grade.  When the temps here are in the 
90's and i am running stop and go or high speed the oil pressure running 
wll be about 40 at 60mpg and will drop to about 15 at idle.
one quick little rain shower an idle pressure will climb to about 20 and 
highway will be about 45
