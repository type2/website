From a safety standpoint, I would say this is a no-no.  I believe the 
Bentley manual gives a great description of the differences between the drum 
and disk brake master cylinders.  Besides the proportioning 
valves(external), the residual pressure valves are necessary to allow the 
calipers to operate properly.  Apples and oranges I'm afraid.  DO yourself 
the favor, and AT LEAST put the disk brake cylinder in the vehicle.  You 
could probably drive without the booster, but not without the proper 
cylinder.
