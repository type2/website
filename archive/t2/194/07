Subject: Re: [T2] further dual carb questions

On my '72, 1700 cc with a dual vacuum distributor (205E, I think),
34-PDSIT 2/3 carbs:

There are connections to each manifold that are connected to each other and
to the vacuum booster.  There is a tube located approximately where you
would imagine putting a fuel injector.  There is a boss there for each
cylinder, but there is only one on each manifold, on the front cylinders, #
1 and #3.  This is clearly the manifold vacuum.  They are big connections,
maybe 1/2" dia.  I think that later buses have a different configuration
here.

The venturi vacuum is on the left only carb and points left, away from the
centerline of the engine.  This goes to the vacuum canister on the
distributor, the vacuum canister port that points away from the centerline
of the distributor.  Vacuum here advances the timing.  This is a small dia.
tube.  Maybe 1/8" id.

There is an additional vacuum that is connected to the throttle body and
that is manifold vacuum.  It is connected to the vacuum canister on the
distributor, the port that points towards the centerline of the distributor.
Vacuum here retards the timing.  This is a slightly larger diameter tube,
maybe .1875", or so.

Hope that helps.
