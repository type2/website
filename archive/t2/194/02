Subject: Dual Carb Help needed!!!

Volks,

It is *so* much fun to be able to write with an actual question :-)

Here's the scoop... I am in Atlanta, Georgia  attempting to rescue Nikki
Elko's '73 bus.  It is as stock as you could ever want.  1700 with the
dual solex carbs.  I checked compressions this morning and they are
100-100-120-120.  I theorize someone forgot a spacer or installed head
gaskets where they should'na.  Not perfect, but not fatal.  Dwell is at
48-49, timing (stock dist, but vacuum retard disconnected) is 6-8 (it is
wandering oddly) advance maxes out a bit above 40, probably 45 or so.

The manifold vacuum is at 14" measured at the hose that comes off the
"spider" that I am guessing is the balance tube.  This is not good! :-((((
14" is below my minimum acceptable level by an inch.  Problem is, I have
dead flat *NO* dual cab experience.  With the short intake stacks, I
cannot imagine a leak there.  All I can think is that the gaskets at the
top or bottom of the stacks are leaking.  With the wandering timing, I
will bet it is only on one side, as well.

Anyone?

I would be especially interested in hearing from David or Art if they did
a compression check and see if the compressions have changed since.
