Costco's policy (at least at the one I was at) is to only 
fit original spec tires. They will flat out refuse to mount 
anything bigger or smaller than stock.

>Any word on canadiantire, or wally world??

I haven't tried Wal-Mart but I got my Agilis 215/65-15 51's 
at Canadian Tire. The price was REALLY competitive, to the 
point that I decided to buy TWO spares... then proceeded to 
spend all of the savings to buy a sixth 15" rim.

Don't be put off by the fact that I have 15" wheels and you 
are looking for 14" wheels. Canadian Tire will now special 
order tires for you so even if they don't have ot chances 
are they can get it. There is some pretty good tire 
information at:
