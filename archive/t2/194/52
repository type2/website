Subject: '71 Front Axle/Brake Swap Questions

I have a '71 with disc brakes and I'm thinking about changing them out
to more available later model ones. The '71 disc brake stuff is
much harder to come by and I plan on keeping this beast for many years
to
come.

I have some questions and need hard answers not just guesses, thanks:

1. Are that front brakes the same from '73-'79? I have seen in several
places where people thought there was some kind of change late '74.

2. Can I replace the complete front beam/axle from a late model bus? The
only piece of info I could find was from some obscure German website
that said the lower mounting holes were moved 30mm. If that is true and
all else fits could I just drill new mounting holes? Comments.

3. How about replacing the spindles only. Will late model ones fit? If
they do fit do I have to replace the trailing arms or can I disconnect
them at the ball joints?

Any feedback is welcome. Post responses to the list it you think it
would be useful to others or e-mail me directly.

Thanks,
