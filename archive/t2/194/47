Subject: PAINTING?????? WELDING?? GAHHH


ok people, i just had an amazing revelation. (ready for this?) since i 
stripped my whole entire bus, i'm thinking of (gasp!) painting it 
myself! inside AND out. but before that of course i need new doors and 
windows, but...basically, i need to know HOW do i paint a bus? what sort 
of paint (not color) how many coats, how long does it take, do i take 
the body panels off? what if i find rust when i sand the existing paint 
off? once i sand the paint off, should i paint it right away with primer 
so it doesn't rust? or should i just save the money and bring it to a 
proffesional.

-Jay
