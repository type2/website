Subject: re: Engine hiccupping

I have the same bus as you, and the same problem
recently. eventually it may start feeling like it's
totally running out of gas. my problem was the
temperature sender was coming unscrewed from the 3-4
head. i would also check the FI grounds under the
intake manifold, and of course, it could also be the
fuel filter, so changing that wouldnt hurt.

hope this helps.  do you have a bentley yet??

peace!

Hi Folks
I've got a hiccuping engine question:
Here's the context.  2 months ago I bought a '78 bus
with a 2000 cc FI
engine. I got it inspected and on the road a week ago
and have been 
doing
errands around town
