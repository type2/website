Subject: Re: [T2] What is this tube?

Must be a Calif engine or intake......
Back in the early 70's California decided to go after NoX emissions. Oxides of
Nitrogen are formed when combustion temps go above 2500 degrees F. Almost all
66-70 cars had to have an add-on NoX device installed statewide. [high smog
counties like Los Angeles had to go back to 1955!]
There were 2 ways to do this on 66-70 vehicles. The most common deleted or
delayed vacuum advance. [almost all 1970 GM cars had transmission controlled
spark so they were exempt]
The best one was called Pure Power and it delayed vac advance. The WORST was
called Car Kit and it did away with vac advance. It came with a label to put
on the speedo and two nipples. You removed the vac line and capped both
nipples and stuck the label on the speedo..... $18!!!! [cost] for this cream
puff kit.
Almost all air cooled VW's used vacuum advance only distributors, so this type
of NoX device would not work.
The only thing you could use was an EGR [exhaust gas recirculation] kit. STP
made the only certified kit. Yes, the same company that made the oil
treatment. Owned then by Andy Granatelli and the parent company was Grancor,
which stood for Granatelli Corp. This kit came with a drill bit, a pipe
nipple[still on your manifold], an EGR valve, a spacer plate with a nipple on
it, a special hose to go between the valve and spacer, and two longer studs
for the carb. It involved drilling a hole in the heat riser tube and removiing
the carb and installing all the pieces. The downfall was 98% of the heat
risers were plugged....

If you can guess, I put a lot of them on.....
