With abosolutly zero experience, and knowledge in the application of
paint, if I were you I'd save my money and have it done professionally.
You'll waste more time and money trying to figure out the correct
process and application of the refinishing materials, and then be so
aggravated at the results it won't be worth it.

ok people, i just had an amazing revelation. (ready for this?) since i
stripped my whole entire bus, i'm thinking of (gasp!) painting it
myself! inside AND out. but before that of course i need new doors and
windows, but...basically, i need to know HOW do i paint a bus? what sort
of paint (not color) how many coats, how long does it take, do i take
the body panels off? what if i find rust when i sand the existing paint
off? once i sand the paint off, should i paint it right away with primer
so it doesn't rust? or should i just save the money and bring it to a
proffesional.
