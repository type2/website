My 79 westy crapped out on me today and I have a cross country move plann=
ed very soon.  I was driving on 101 south and it just started loosing pow=
er.  Then I saw a lot of smoke and the exhaust sounded really loud.  I pu=
lled to the side of the road.  the engine was really hot.  I checked the =
oil and it was surprisingly low considering I had just filled it this mor=
ning.  I added oil and let the engine cool for a while.  I committed a te=
rrible sin though.  I mixed brands of oil.  All that was available was so=
me oil I had bought for my roomates car.  Both were synthetic and the sam=
e weight though.  The syn does not seem to hold up to the heat. It seemed=
 real thin and I will be changing to dino.  Then I tried to start it and =
it started, but didn't seem to have enough pick up to join the traffic an=
d get off the exit about 5 feet ahead. finally got it going and made it t=
o my dates house.  The pickup sucked. It sounds like the exhaust is reall=
y loud, but I'm not sure if that is what is actually making the noise.  A=
lso, checked the vacum hoses and seemed ok, but will check again.Tryin to=
 get home sucked to.  I got the car goin and made it to the end of the bl=
ock.  Went to turn stepped on the gas, and it died and I rolled to the si=
de of the road.  Tried starting it.  Started, gave it gas, it died.  Did =
this a couple times before it finally started going.  Pickup sucked.  It =
really concerned me.  I usually average 70 on the highway, but I could on=
ly do 50 and it took a while to get there.  A half hour trip took me over=
 an hour and 20 minutes.  When I finally got it home I took a look under =
the car. oil everywhere.  I know my pushrod tube seals leak.  I'm waiting=
 for the ones I ordered to come.  But it is usually not this bad.  I was =
watching it smoke and drip off the engine.  Waiting for it to cool to che=
ck the oil level.  RPMs sounded real high the whole time (no gauges thoug=
h).  Extremely oily on the heater box and white boot thingy on the driver=
s side.  Passenger side not as bad though except for where the push rod t=
ubes leak.  I have 3 days before I leave for a week vacation (the bus wil=
l sit for this week)  The day after I get back I leave for a cross countr=
y move during which the bus will definitely not be sitting.  And I'm supp=
osed to meet my date again in 3 hours!

Any help would be greatly appreciated,
Thanks,
Kyle
