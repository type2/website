There is no such thing as bus high back seats. ALL were low backs.

Headrest 101:

The 1st year was 1973. They are one-year-only with a release button on each
tube.
74/75 were soft vinyl with a zipper along the bottom from post to post. Age is
catching up with them.....the material between the zipper and vinyl is
self-destructing and separating.
75 to 79 are hard molded vinyl. The sun bakes the side edge and it has a habit
of cracking when pushed.
Any bay bus headrest will fit any bay seat from 73 to 79. They will not fit
Vanagon seats. The posts on Vanagons are smaller in diameter.
I have pairs in almost every color EXCEPT black. I have soft vinyl and hard
vinyl. 73-only is very hard to find. Black is very hard to find. The most
common hard vinyl is brown.
