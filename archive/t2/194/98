Hello all,
I have a 73 Westy and I am having a problem with my turn signals.  When I put 
the turn signals on the lights on the dash light up but no where else.  The 
indicators on the front and rear of the car are dark.  no "sound" either.  I 
do however have flashers.  Is the module for the turn signals and flashers 
two stage?  If so that is probably where the problem is.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
You can contact me off the list also.
Regards,
Al
