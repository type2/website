Subject: Tire Question for Canadians

Hey all you Canadians:

I know that this has been a long and tired (what a pun
on friday) subject, so please just p-mail me back.

Where are you getting your tires.  I can get CR21's
Contis from Tirecraft for about $125 CDN each
installed, but Id like to go a little cheaper if
possible.

I was at Costco tonight and it was a disaster.  The guy
proceeded to show me (in his dog eared book) that the
correct tire is a 185R14C.  "And you cant get em,
there's nothing like em anywhere" says he. In the end I
went through all the tires and read the labels, and
they go nothing in 185/14 that would work.

Any word on canadiantire, or wally world??

Logan
