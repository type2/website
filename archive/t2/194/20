seats,

That is what is meant by 'kombi': It is a combination vehicle. It can be a
passenger vehicle with the seats in and a delivery vehicle with the seats out.
I believe you are confusing it with a panel, they did not have seats.....

> and here's what the numbers look like. on that thing where
the numbers are behind the 2/3 seat. (o yeah its a spilt window, 1/3-2/3
seat in front, the roof is all primer, (which makes me think its a
kombi) and whoever the owners were, in the 70's (who were extremely
tacky by the way) added this wierd fold out seat, storage areas, all
made of ply wood and shag carpeting. there was nothign in the middle
either, no carpet, nothing, i took all taht crap out today though. it
took a long time. Oh yeah, does anyone know how to clean metal? i want
to clean the inside, there's weird seat hairs and glue from the
yellowish brown "insulation" that was put in.  oh yeah, here's those
numbers.


>07  0   <----(this makes me think its a 67) but its registered as a 66

This should mean October 7th. 07 is the 7th day, 0 should be for the 10th
month, October. This would be in 1966. The production year from about the
beginning of August to the following July.

2312  231 means Kombi, cargo doors right, LHD. The 2 on the end is the type of
paint.
383883 the 1st 38 is paint upper, the 2nd 38 is paint lower. If it was a two
tone bus, the two numbers would be different. 38 is L512, Velvet Green. The 83
is the upholstery, Mesh Grey.
6039108 The 6 tells you it is a 66, the next 6 numbers are the sequencial vin
numbers. If you look in the engine compartment, right side, in front of the
edge of the apron, you should find the complete vin number stamped into the
body. It should be 236039108.
