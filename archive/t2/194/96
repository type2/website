Don't presume to understand why a PO did anything...Could have been pre-
emptive welding to prevent a beam from rusting out and collapsing...Could
have been welded in by someone who did a similar job on another type of ve-
hicle - The "worked there" scenario? Unless you're keeping or restoring your
bus bog stock, if it stays around another twenty years, consider what some
FO (Future Owner) will be asking about why you did what you did...
