I have to tell ya,----
This is really good reading, and kinda funny.
A 2 or 3 day paint job?
Of course this article isn't talking about a VW Bus --is it?

Perhaps a Crosley coupe--maybe.

It takes me from the time I mask to the time I'm removing the paper and
tape on a Mack R-Model cab and hood, ( which has less overall surface
area than a Bus ) at least 2 weeks, and this is without any body work.

It might be a remote possibility, if an army of 10 attacked the Bus
non-stop for 2-3 days.
And even then, it would almost still be impossible, if you are
considering drying times of the sealer's and primer's, and then the
paint itself.

I use high end materials, and at best for the paint to dry so the
vehicle in question can be sanded and buffed and unmasked even is in
this summer heat, is overnight.

I think this article was written by the Earl Scheib group--"In at nine,
out by five".--:>)

I feel this article is a bit on the unrealistic side of never
happening--not for a properly prepped, and painted vehicle anyway.

Later,
