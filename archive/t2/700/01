I have the push rod tubes out and I'm in the process
of cleaning, but after removing another tin I think I
have found more sources of leaks.  The top picture is
between the head and cylinder.  The bottom one is at
the cylinder and block.

Is there a  way to remove these (what is the proper
name anyway?  I have heard "jugs", but I'm sure that's
slang) without pulling the engine?  If that is not a
problem is there a gasket kit that I can buy?  If I
have to pull the engine agan I might just buy a new
one.  Should I replace the other side (push rod seals)
if it is not leaking.  The PO did use RTV.
 

Thanks,
cp
