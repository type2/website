I think it "depends" on the dynamics of the accident, I was clipped by a
tractor trailer when the driver fell asleep, the tire hit the truck and
pushed me away from the rear wheels of the truck, still have his mark on
the tire cover. did some front end damage but didn't even break the
windshield.  we were doing 55-60mph at the time. instead of rolling my van
it spun it around, I went backwards into a guardrail.
  we pried the rear bumper from the guard rail and drove it to safety.
only major damage was broken front turn signal, destroyed battery (from
hitting guard rail, disconected it and used the twin on the other side)
and some body damage.  I think the tire on the front saved my life or at
least major damage.  The State Trooper who investigated said I was one
lucky B*st*rd, I think he was right, also worked my guardian angel
overtime too.... still drive that bus with repairs today
