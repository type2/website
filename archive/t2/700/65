Go to www.metwiz.com <http://www.metwiz.com/>   then the archive section
find nov, 2004 and look on page, 1 top pic, That how I fixed one for Steve's
Westy. Mounts under the bumper via self tapping bolts, with a small bracket
to the vent area / 3  metal screws. With out the bracket to the vent it was
too shaky. 5 bolts total I think.
