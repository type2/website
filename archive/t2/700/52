if I ever find a 20+ year old bus with an unmodified wiring harness I'll
buy the bus because it will have less than 50k miles on it.

my local Home Depot has "Wire by the foot" and some of it is very good
stranded wire for outside use.   can get at least 10 or so colors that
way.   But I just go to a nearby "electrical supply house" and get what I
need

somewhere in one of these stores, an electronic store I think, I found a
whole bag of different colored pieces of shrink tubing.  I have been using
that for years.  it's amazing how many different colors are avaliable.

that's my preference,  plain metal, solder, shrink wrap,  not everywhere
but I'm working on it.

I have done the enlargement thing with the BA-4 schematic and taped it to
the back of a clip board, could hang it within easy reach while working

have never found a decent replacement fuse panel,  I do run an auxilary
with in line fuses for "other non stock stuff"
