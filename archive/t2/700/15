Subject: Question about spare tire holder

The spare is coming off the nose of my bus, the bracket is going in the 
trash, and I'll be spending the better part of a month reversing the 
damage done by hanging a spare there.

While thinking about what needs to be done, I spent an hour or two 
looking at all the pics of buses on the samba. I couldn't find a single 
one where anyone had engineered a swinging spare carrier to the rear.

Doing this is not impossible. But it has some problems:

1. There's nothing off-the-shelf that can be bolted on; it has to be a 
hack. And the standard wrap-around-the-corner bracket solution is not 
ideal.

2. It needs to be quick-release (maybe from inside?) in case of an 
engine fire (although if fuel lines are properly cared for, should this 
really be a cause for paranoia?}

3. License plate will probably have to be moved.

4. The carrier would probably have to be mounted through the 
reinforcement between a rear light and the engine hatch, with 
additional brackets.

5. It would have to swing to open hatches. Less convenient, but tough.

Other options:

A. Hang it under the bus and hope I don't need the ground clearance too 
often

B. Hack a support for inside early Westy luggage carrier (top heavy)

C. Move the spare inside the bus somehow (will require revising 
cabinets, giving up that space)

Anyway, I don't want it on the nose anymore. Has anybody seen a 
rear-mount spare? Has anyone thought through the problems and devised 
something?

(Note: I'm not interesting in doing anything that requires duct tape, 
JB weld, bungie cords, gobs of silicone sealer, baggies,  bondo, or 
just mounting a front bracket on the rear hatch. There's a place for 
that kind of stuff, but not on my bus.)
