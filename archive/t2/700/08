Subject: Distributer Case Bolt

Alrighty then,

We have a distributor case bolt that will not tighten...pulled it out and 
stripped, so we flipped it over to the other side and screwed that 
in....won't tighten.

the case is stripped?  Retap~anyone done this?

Any other options on how to fix it....
looking to leave town tonight and canoe and surf..
