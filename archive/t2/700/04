Subject: Happy Me!

Today I became the pround owner of a 1966 split window camper.  I am beside
myself with joy.  I have an 82" 2.0L air-cool as my daily driver and I have
enjoyed reading this list for hints and help on that but I'm sure you will
hear more from me in the coming months as I work to get my new air-cool up
and running.  As soon as I get it home I'll post some "before", pics on my
website.
Hehehehehehe!  I never could get the hang of Thursdays but this has been a
good one.

Pro Deo et Patria,
