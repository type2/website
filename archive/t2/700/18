Subject: Re: [T2] Question about spare tire holder

The spare tire was in a special compartment under the sink/stove. Like 
I said, it would mean revising that cabinet (in my bus) and giving up 
the space. That's about four cubic feet, and would require building a 
whole new cabinet. So, I've got to build something one way or another.
