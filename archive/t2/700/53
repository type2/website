Subject: Re: [T2] Pulling out all the wiring!!!

I dabble in the electrical world of buses from time to time and have some 
foresight.

I have sold a few good used main harnesses for late buses. The earlys where 
available and may still be.

An idea of new aftermarket late harnesses is tough to materialize. The real 
problem is the wire striping. You have to do this yourself of get it custom 
done that is unless you reinvent the wheel. Actually you will still have to 
do this if you ever want to trouble shoot your own work. The main itself has 
at least 10 wires that run the lenght of the bus. Put ten in the tube and 
you'll need a guy on both ends with tester to ID them. That is I don't think 
you can buy 10 different color wires.

Also the OEM style connecters are not just unisulated wires connectors. They 
are brass, open barrell ("w" crimp), with insulation supports. These are 
tough to find (its a UK auto thing) and they are a couple of  different 
sizes and styles, male, female, hoop, ect. and some have locking tabs for 
plastic plugs.

Dont forget the guages, yet another conversion factor problem, to nurture 
the dimentional analasys intelect.
