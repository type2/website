Subject: Re: [T2] Where should the HE bypass air exit?

With the '78 the heater boxes have air pushing through them all the time winter and summer. 

What happens is when the heat is off the heater valves dump the heat through flexible tubes (most likely not there) to metal tubes that hang udner the rear frame rails beside the valve covers. These get left off pretty quickly on a bus getting a major engine repair too. 

I don't have pics though... Still got all the pieces - somewhere.
