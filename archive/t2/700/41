I don't know about seatbelts, but the source of the fallacy (IMHO) is 
to think of the spare as a tire. Yes, there's a tire there, and if 
someone managed to hit you on that tire, and only on that tire, at a 
very low speed (say, 3 mph), it might help. But the guts of your spare 
is a very rigid steel wheel. It doesn't want to absorb shock. It wants 
to pass it on.

Think of it this way. If you were bushwhacking through the forest, 
which would be safer? Nothing in front of your face? Or carrying a 
frying pan in front of your face? The frying pan is going to do much 
more harm than good.

That's what your spare is -- it's a frying pan in front of your face.
