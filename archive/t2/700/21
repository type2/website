Subject: vanagon vs. bus seats

The vanagon seats in our bus are certainly comfy, but they're so high I 
miss half the mountains!  Are the stock bus seats noticeably lower?  
Are they (restuffed) noticeably less comfortable?  We're considering 
buying some correct seats and restuffing them.

thanks,
