What if you kept it on the nose, but instead of using the carrier that
bolts to the nose itselve you make one that bolts to the bumper
mounts?

It could just be a V shaped tube that has "feet" to run under the
bumper and attach there. I'm just thinking about the stresses to the
unibody you would be applying with a swing-out mount in the rear. Plus
the fire issue you've already mentioned.
