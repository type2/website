The problem with most leakdown gauges is the price. Just check out the one at ACN. Even eBay prices are out of line.

The gauge I have costs $65 new. It's from an aircraft supplier and has two benefits to the average tester:

- there is a pressurizing valve to prevent a prop strike but for the bus engine this is just as handy because you can detect the engine rotating before you fully pressurize the cylinder in case you aren't exactly at TDC. It also makes disconnecting from the air supply much more pleasant.

- the gauges are matched by the mfgr for accurate readings
