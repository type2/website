Any discussion of oil temperatures has to include where its being measured
in order to be meaningful. I always recommend that anyone read what Gene
Berg (www.GeneBerg.com) had to say as a starting point. I've heard that
measuring at the sump plate will actually give a high reading because its
made of steel and doesn't dissipate the heat.

For your anticipated application I'd recommend looking to Bus Boys. They
have an oil cooler that has better cooling than your generic cooler. They
also have a bypass, I think available in 2 temperatures, that will keep
the oil from going to the cooler until the oil gets hot enough. This will
help your engine during that critical startup time when much of the engine
wear takes place.
