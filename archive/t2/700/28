I had a Mexican guy in San Antonio that does seats redo the seats in my 71 
Westy with Foam and the difference is incredible, I can ride longer and it 
feel's like I put new shocks and tires on the bus. Others drive the bus and 
go ask about what shocks I have on it. It's the seats I tell them.

The reason I did this was that my wife's longer legs would hurt as the new 
WBW seats I installed sit a little lower than the foam. I'm going too try 
and post some pics on a website to view for everyone
