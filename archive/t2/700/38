Subject: Still no idle

Spent a few hours with GWB last night. I still can't get an idle. 

HOWEVER: I discovered those red boots I put on the brake booster
aren't tight enough. So I blocked the ports off again. Also, the hoses
on the idle circuit are cracked. So I gooped 'em and taped them for
now. Still no idle. Adjusting the idle mixture and air screws doesn't
make much difference. So I'm hoping it's the idle circuit hoses.

I asked before and didn't get an answer, but does anybody know what
the hose size is for the idle circuit hoses? I was hoping the 15/32"
ones on the brake booster line would work, but it appears to be too
big. :(

Thanks!
