Subject: Temperature at Speed

     Hello again, and thanks for all the great answers to my questions so far. I don't belive I've come accross such a helpful bunch of folks since I ran into some of those Pashtun tribsemen near Afghanistan.
      Anyways, when I bought my 73 type two from a guy in San Diego, and drove it home to Irvine, the fella that I bought it from told me that the aftermarket temp guage that was on the dash should hover right around 250 degrees at running speed (55-65mph). On the way home it hung right at 350 degrees, and I hung by the seat of my pants because I thought the engine was running hot. But every time I opened the compartment to see if I could fry an egg, I could put my hand on the air cooler and the dipstick was barely warm. I believe the gauge is attached/wired to the #3 sparkplug. Is 350 degrees standard running temp for these things. It seems about right to me.
 
P.S. I decided to name the bus Schatzy.
