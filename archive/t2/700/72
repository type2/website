I didn't find one that was suitable for my needs but once again, this
wonderful list saved the day when a listmember offered to take my
description and make me one:

It's made from a cored Bosch spark plug and some pipe. I fit my air coupler
on the end and it works marvelously. In fact with the gasket on the bottom
instead of an o-ring and my ability to torque it down the readings are more
accurate than ever!

This isn't valved like your average compression tester hose but since I've
moved on to performing leakdown testing with my portable compressor I'm very
happy now.
