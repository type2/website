Subject: Inline Oil Temp/Pressure Gauge?

Volks,

In the 1600SP engine that I am (still slowly) building, I am going with a 
full flow oil system.

Having an external oil line has gotten me to thinking: is there any easy 
way to measure the oil temp and/or pressure of this oil?

I have an oil temp sender -- the type that you plumb into the sump -- and 
an oil pressure sensor, I assume I just need to get the appropriate 
fittings to plumb these into the oil return from the filter?

Has anyone done this before?

Comments for/against?

It strikes me that measuring the oil temp pre-oil cooler might give me a 
hot reading, but it would at least give me a more accurate reading than a 
sump plate sender that is getting cooled by air rushing past it...

Cheers,
	Tom
