not necessarily in the vein of your question, but in my mind just as 
important when taking long roadtrips in buses:

1) Triple A PLUS membership
2) a good book or 3
3) a compass
4) a frisbee, journal, or something else to toy with while waiting for the 
bus to cool down (maybe take up juggling?  Learn all those folk songs on 
guitar you've always wanted to learn?)

which leads me to what I really want to say: bring your patience.  I think 
the best thing for driving a bus on long distances and in the summer is 
patience.  Drive a reasonable speed.  Stop often to let the bus cool down 
(listening to your gauges and being preventative).  Stop as often as 
necessary if the bus isn't running right.  Take the time to get things 
fixed if they seem broken -- don't just try to "push through" when that 
means driving 65 mph in the summer for 350 more miles.

So bring stuff to keep you amused when you stop.  Make a game of it.  
Figure out what it will take to let you be relaxed about it and have fun 
while still being sensible.

This isn't to say you can't drive your bus for 700 miles a day in the 
desert: you can!  But it can't hurt to take it easy every now and again.

Other random stuff for happy bus traveling:

5) a towel to wet and keep draped over your cooler (evaporative cooling!)
6) spray bottle to keep you cool
7) a sense of adventure (for backroads and side hikes)
8) flares in case of breakdown
9) local information on some of your destinations for hiking and otherwise
10) SUNBLOCK!
11) 2 days extra water
12) 2 days of canned food
13) snack bars or other munchies to stave off hunger and aid patience

Other bus related investments:

tools not to be without 
	or
tools i wish other people had when i stopped to help them fix their bus

1) spark plug wrench
2) screwdrivers (phillips and standard)
3) hammer
4) adjustable wrench
5) 10mm and 13mm wrenches
6) feeler gauges: 0.006, 0.016, 0.026 (valves, points, plugs)
7) vise grips
8) multimeter (optional, but HELPFUL)
9) wire clppers/pliers (optional)
10) 12v air pump (necessary if you're getting off the beaten track)
11) spare gas can (small, doesn't have to be full)

spare parts:
1) spare spark plug
2) spare alt belt
3) spare points, condenser, rotor
4) 2 qts of oil

misc:
1) duct tape
2) zip ties
3) 12-16 gague wire
4) spare connectors for wire
5) tube of RTV sealant (optional)
6) multipurpose grease (optional)

hope this helps.

really, I think having those tools and spare parts are the most important 
things you can have.
