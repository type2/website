You want to do it right? With all the exact same colors/stripes as
original?

Here's a copy of a message I sent to the Buskatiers list a couple of months
ago. If you go to the Thomas Register version of the AWP web site directly
http://www.thomasregister.com/olc/72978943/home.htm they have a "search"
link. Use it and search for "GPT", "GXL", or "SXL" depending on the
temperature range you want for the insulation.

Their web site is pretty hosed in several places so you'll most likely have
to call to get quotes on the specific color combinations you want. It's
odd, they have a site in their own name (http://anaheimwire.com) and also
the site through the Thomas Register. Their own site is not nearly as
robust (ie. no search function, no "quote-request/order" functions, etc.)
but it's also a bit less "messy" to browse around. The links below take you
to the wire lists on their own site.

And now the old message with the info:

Hmmm -- that page was just for GPT wire with insulation rated at 85 degC
(185 degF). GXL or SXL rated at 125 degC (257 degF) might be better for
anything that goes in the engine compartment.
