Subject: [T2] Compression tester hose

Richard Atwell asked:

"Has anyone located a suitable extension to use? What I'm looking for is 
something long enough (say 6") to clear the engine tin (front and rear) with 
the correct thread size (M14x1.25) and hex shape so I can get a wrench 
around it to snug it down. What would be ideal is M14x1.25 on one end and 
1/4"-NPT female on the other so I could fit an air hose coupler fitting.

There must be such an adapter used on even harder to access vehicles..."
