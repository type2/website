Richard, List,

If you are on a tight budget, you can make a leakdown tester with
easy-to-find bits. Two gauges, a few union bits and a regulator. I think I
paid about 20.00 for all the bits needed, from Princess Auto, which is the
"Harbor Freight" of Canada. If you already have a compression tester, it
should be cheaper since you already have the pieces that plug into the plug
hole, you just need to make it adaptable to your new leak-down tester.

If you do a google search for "make leak down tester" you will get some good
hits.
