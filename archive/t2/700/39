And Mark replied:

This is a fallacy. There's discussion of this in the archives, but
basically having the tire on the nose increases your chances of injury
in a front-end collision.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

When my 78 Westy was plowed into from the front and pushed back into my 77 Westy,
ALL the damage to my 77 nose was done by the spare. If it was not there, then both buses 
would have just kissed bumper to bumper. Except for the front of the 78......
But because of the spare on the 77, the whole is caved in, even the dash is broken and ruined 
along with the wiper assembly and windshield.

I have always heard that having the front tire in the front of the bus can make things alot better if you get into a wreck?

can this be one of those things that are like seatbelts sometimes they can save lives other times they can take them..?

Really curious....
