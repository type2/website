volks

just went out to run an errand and just by chance had it parked with the
wheels turned.  something caught my eye, close look my Michelins on the
front the tread is seperating.  I've been using Michelins for over 30
years and have never had a tread seperate.

 good news I guess is that I drove over 400 miles on the interstate last
weekend and am going on two 150 mile round trips this weekend..that could
have been a disaster if it came apart at speed.

in any case to make a long story short I now need two tires.

whats avaliable in 205/70R14 all season radials...these tires are a 99S 8
ply rated and great, but no longer made.
  any one in the USA carry the Agelis tires???  they are the direct
replacements.  there might be some warranty coverage left on these tires
but big deal there are no tires anymore from Michelin, at least not what I
want...

THanks
Bob
