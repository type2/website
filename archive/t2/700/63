Subject: Re: [T2] Question about spare tire holder

Alot of the crash tests of the SUVs have mentioned that the spare tire causes the tailgate to deform badly where the bumper tap would have caused little or no damage. Notice howmany of the SUVs are moving the spares under or inside the vehicle now... I'd say the insurance companies are helping this along too. 

Mine is on the front and it's going to stay there. If I get hit in the front, I expect other car + my tire is going to do just as much damage as other car + my bus nose. I DO however thing parking lot love taps would be much less damaging without the tire. 

Now no comments about my mind section and sexual rendevous at the grocery store.... <griN!>
