From your pictures I see you are missing the Forget Me Not sheet metal
pieces.
These are absolutely necessary in properly cooling your engine.
Buy a new set of Viton O rings for your pushrod tubes.
Careful as you push the large outer O ring through the head opening, it
needs to be massaged past a sharp edge that is present on most type IV
heads.
