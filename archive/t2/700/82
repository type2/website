if you really want to get the correct wire with stripping and you can't
find it for sale you can have it made.  i was in the machine tool wiring
industry for several years and it was common for us to order custom
striped wire from our wire supplier.  it takes about a week to get so you
have to plan in advance and you have to buy a spool of it.  this is who
we used as our supplier.  it wasn't really much more expensive than the
regular spool price.
