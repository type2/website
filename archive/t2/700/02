Subject: Re: [T2] Where to buy dashboard bulb holders ?

These bulbholders fit 67-74 Karmann Ghias, 71-74 Type 4s as well as
the Bay Window and some watercooled models.  A boneyard should be
treasure trove for these.

As far as CIP's price, it does look outrageous, but it's not their
fault.  Blame it on VDO & the euro exchange rate.  Landed cost from
Europe on these babies came in at an agonizing price last month here
at KGPR, so we and CIP don't make much on 'em.  But we sure sell the
heck out of 'em and can never keep enough in stock.
