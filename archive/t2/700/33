<How do I remove the steering wheel???>

I've had good luck removing the nut that holds the wheel on, and then smacking the wheel from the bottom at 9 and 3 o'clock positions. The idea is not to beat the steering wheel into submission, just to shake it and rattle it. The few times it did not work (Ford products) I used a wheel puller set (Harbor Freight, Northern Tool, Sears).
