Subject: Where should the HE bypass air exit?

It appears that there used to be tubes directing the hot air from the 
flapper boxes somewhere out the back.  IOW, when the heat's not 
directed to the cabin, where should the air go (on a 1978)?  I guess 
all the way to the back like the exhaust.  Anyone have pictures?

thanks,
