Good points Larry!

I should note that I am not actually going to install an external oil 
cooler.  I merely meant that by measuring the oil temperature before or 
after the oil filter, I would be measuring it before it got to the stock 
doghouse oil cooler.  

Part of my motivation in measuring the oil pressure at this juncture is so 
that I can use the stock oil pressure sender for my idiot light, as per 
Berg's recommendation.
