Subject: Re: [T2] Question about spare tire holder

> The spare tire was in a special compartment under the sink/stove. Like
 I said, it would mean revising that cabinet (in my bus) and giving up
 the space. That's about four cubic feet, and would require building a
 whole new cabinet. So, I've got to build something one way or another.

Under the sink/stove?  Mark, what year is your bus??
The only ones [in the USA] that were UNDER was the collapsible spare under the sink unit
of the 74/75 deluxe Westies. The sink unit is behind the driver, the stove is behind the pass.

76-79, the STOOD up in the right end of the sink unit.

I found a spare mount that stands on the bumper and only uses the body for support. All the weight of the tire
is on the bumper. I can send you pics of it. Let me know.
