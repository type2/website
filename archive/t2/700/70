Metric sized (not that it really matters) stripped wire but an axial stripe
that doesn't spiral clike the original can be bought in large quantities for
those serious about restoration:

I've replaced all of the OEM connectors in my engine compartment. I get them
directly from Wurth. I've also bought them in singles instead of by the box
from my local vw restoration shop:

0558 5040
- 6.3mm connector for small gauge wiring 0.5mm-1.0mm

0558 45040
- same as above for larger gauge 1.0-2.5mm

0558 5047
- same as above but for largest gauge in a few places 6mm2

 0558 5029
- small 2.8mm connectors used behind the dash and for side markers

0558 928
- 6.3mm piggy back connector

0558 5054
- female connector for insultated tee connectors

The lowest price I've seen for the uninsulated crimper the you need for
these terminals is $28 from Del City:
