I've been doing some ignition system tests lately because gas mileage has been on my mind. This made news today:

> DALLAS (AP) -- Buoyed by rising profits from lofty oil prices, Exxon
> Mobil Corp. passed General Electric Co. Friday to become the largest
> U.S. corporation by stock market value.

> 	Last month, Exxon Mobil announced it earned $25.3 billion in 2004,
> 	believed to be a record for U.S. companies after excluding windfalls
> 	from selling assets. Revenues were $298 billion, topping the
> 	previous leader, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., at $288 billion.

I have an idea how the cost is gas is divided into taxes, other pie pieces and so forth but that's an insane amount of profit.
