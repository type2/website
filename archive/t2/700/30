Subject: Re: [T2] Question about spare tire holder

might sound corny but i had a old weight bench that ws going to the dump but i also needed a tire mount for my tire cause i was moving it round in the bus all the time...
i didnt want to put a tire mount like originals cause i have seen what damage it does to the nose and also i have a great big huge sun face painted there in that spot....
 
i looked at the end of the weight bench the part that you do leg curls with and took it apart and bolted it to the front bumper and then got some threaded rods small and nuts and made me a bracket and put up top for support and bounceing....
the tire mount has done fine until once some friends and i had trouble getting the bus onto a tow dolly and the bottom got snagged but i bolted it up more and everything is fine..
 
i have a friend that has talked also of making a tire mount for the back somehow as well swinging like on a jeep but has also ran tino the thing where is the safest place to bolt? errrrrrr...
i like it in the front though in case i get into a accident hopefully it will protect me and us alot better...
i didnt have a welder but i could buy large bolts and nuts from the local hardware store as well as threaed rod and had a drill to dril the hole in the front bumper which is the largest bolt i had to drill it was like a 18 or 19 or something like that running through there for good support... the top was for added support...
i also remember i put a small strap of metal on the backside going to the top of the bumper for reasssurance....
in other words i could take it all off if i wanted..and have another front bumper in the building with no bolt hole through it but i like having the tire there just in case...
good luck
peace
