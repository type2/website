Subject: Pulling out all the wiring!!!

Hey guys,

    I'm completely gutting my Bus of all of it's wiring. It's old, it's
trashed, and I'm too ashamed to show you a picture of my Bus's wiring
disaster.
The previous owners of my Bus were unfortunately either profusely broke and
had to make do, or just extremely un-informed.

It's a rat's nest... with about 100 or so different clips, splices.. you name
it.

The old radio wiring was apparently also attached by the use of aligator
clips.


Since unfortunately, no one yet makes a replacement harness for our Busses, I
purchased one called "It's a Snap!".

It's the competitor of Painless Wiring.


I have a couple of questions which I was hoping you guys could answer.

1) Has anyone done this before? I'd love to hear from ya!

2) How do I remove the steering wheel???

3) Are all of these factory OEM switches described in the Bentley manual? (I
know, silly question, I should just look it up. I will, but just wanted to
know if any of you guys have tried to re-wire a bus while using the factory
switches and knobs!)

4) I'd like to see pictures if available, of any custom fuse block mounting...
the one I am switching to uses the new style fuses. (and not the ceramic ones
found in 70s european cars).



Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Todd
