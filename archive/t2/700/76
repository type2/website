You buy a gauge like this...

...and hook it up to a compressed air source (I used a small 2gal portable
compressor from Sears).

You then set the cylinder to TDC and start the airflow. One gauge reads the
pressure going in, and the other pthe ressure held by the cylinder. The
cylinder differential, or leakdown, can be read by subtracting the two
readings.

What's cool about doing this over a compression test is you can hear and
feel the air leaking from the intake, exhaust (valves) oil breather (rings),
head, etc to determine exactly how it is leaking.
