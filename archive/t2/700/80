Subject: re: Question about spare tire holder

Hi Mark, here are a couple links to pictures I just took of our 78 blue bus  
that the PO put a rear mounted spare tire on.  Funny thing is that there is  
already a spare on the nose too!  I  know the PO's were rock climbers  and 
spent a lot of time down in UT, AZ, Joshua Tree etc climbing, so maybe they  were 
way out there in some places and getting flats happened more often, not  sure 
but anyway.......
 
You did mention the license plate, and when the tire is mounted, (it isn't  
right now for the winter as I tinker with this and that) it does cover a bit of 
 the plate, 1/3 to 1/2.  We havent' had a problem with it..... perhaps that  
is just luck?
 
Here are the links to the pictures:
 
 
This one is the general shot of what the mounting looks like.  You  will have 
to picture the tire mounted there.

This one is of the pivot point.  There is an upper and lower bracket  that is 
bolted through the body.

This one is of the latch that is spring loaded and you pull back the lever  
and it allows it to swing.  You can see the downside when you notice the  
engine hatch.  Fortunately it is just a spray can paint job!

I didn't get the story on it, whether it was a kit that the PO's bought, or  
if it was made for them, but it is nice and does allow for quick access if you 
 need to put a fire out or something!
 
Maybe this helps give you some ideas!
