on a previous bus I did indeed put my spare tire under the bus.  I had a
bolt thru the floor that I cranked tight with the lug wrench.  getting it
out was easy, getting it back in was a major PITA.  but putting it back
doesn't have to be done on the side of the road.

it never touched the ground and I did a fair amount off paved roads.


at the moment I have my tire on the front of the bus, mainly because I
like the looks of the bus with it there...not to mention I can get a sheet
of plywood in the bus with it out of the inside, can't with the tire
there.
