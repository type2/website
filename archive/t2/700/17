Subject: What would you do with $1300?

Hi gang,

We've been quiet because, well, the bus ('78) has been doing great!  
We're entering the home stretch now before our planned trip 
cross-country (and back) this summer.  The subject line comes from the 
recent sale of our old car, which gives us $1300 or so for the bus.  
Since there's nothing strictly wrong with the bus now, we're deciding 
what to spend on prevention/upgrades and what to save for problems on 
the trip.  Any advice appreciated!

Specifically, we're considering throwing some cash at a local ACVW 
mechanic to go over the engine.  The '79 motor (hydraulic valves) is a 
VW Canada reman with about 20k on it.  The heads are "AMC" which seem 
to get mixed reviews.  The PO was unclear about whether these heads 
were part of the reman or not (he got the engine from a friend's 
totalled Westy).  Would a compression/leakdown test be a good idea 
before a ~7000 mile summer?  Other tests/checks?  And what is a 
reasonable price for such a service?  Again, the engine runs fine now 
and uses no appreciable amount of oil.

Any other preventative maintenance/upgrades worth the cost, given that 
we need some reserve to handle on-road problems?  We have or will 
shortly have done the following:

1) fuel hoses
2) brake flex hoses
3) steering coupler
4) CHT and OP gauges
5) Vanagon seats (little too high for me, but they are comfy!)
6) all tin seals/thermostat
7) new distributer (courtesy PO, wrong part but is SVDA from bug)
8) new tires with correct load rating (Jupiter, which seem to have poor 
reputation, rats!)
9) battery

Thanks, we are eagerly awaiting the trip and know the bus will see us 
through with a little help from our friends :-)

P.S. Don, your posts have really gotten us excited!

cheers,
