Subject: Women drivers /joke/

I just found it somewhere else, and thought it would make a good "friday
 laugh". Enjoy!

"WOMEN DRIVERS"

I looked over to my left and there was a woman in a brand new Cadillac doing
65 mph with her face next to her rear view mirror putting on her eyeliner.

I looked away for a couple of seconds and when I looked back she was halfway
over in my lane still working on her makeup.

As a man, I don't scare easily, but she scared me so much that I dropped my
electric shaver which knocked the donut out of my other hand.

In all the confusion of trying to straighten out the car using my knees
against the steering wheel, it knocked my mobile phone away from my ear
which fell into the coffee which was between my legs and slashing over me
and burned big Jim and the twins, ruining the phone, soaking my trousers and
disconnecting a very important phone call.

Damn women drivers.
