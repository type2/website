Thanks, Dan.  That's probably what I'll do when I get the bus  painted and all.  But for now, I just need the front one.   Lot's of other priorities first.  Cheers...KR

I spent $30 at wal*mart on fabric.  After I spent 30 minutes teaching 
myself to sew and load the bobbin it took no time at all to crank out 
the 13 curtain panels I needed.  It was very easy and rewarding to do 
myself.
