Subject: tie rods

Hey, guys.  I'm going to have to replace a bent, adjustable tie  rod.  Kay at BD says she shows that it goes on the driver's  side.  But I'm pretty sure the picture in Bentley ( Chap. 2, Pg.  3) is from the back looking forward and shows it on the passenger  side.  Mine is definitely on the passenger side.  Am I going  to have to buy that puller shown in Bentley  or can I just hit it  real hard with a mallet like you can do on most vehicles?   Thanks...KR
