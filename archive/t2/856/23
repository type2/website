Subject: Need help with transmission

While sitting in nuetral, when I release the clutch pedal, it makes a very
noticeable whirling sound from the tranny. If I depress the clutch, it stops.
Let out clutch, it starts to "whirl" again.
I just replaced the cluth kit. Installed engine back in and it still makes the
sound.
I was wondering if you think the one of the following may be the problem.

1. Mainshaft bearing is bad, making the sound??

2. The TRANSMISSION DIFFERENTIAL BEARING is bad, making the sound??

OR, none of the above??

If it is possibly one of these, how hard are they to replace?? Any special
tools needed?

Thanks for any help.
