Subject: Re: [T2] best source for turnkey type4

 Boston Bob is highly rated.

after Clark asked:

Your overall best pick for a source for a turnkey
1800cc or 2L oval-ported type4 is kindly solicited.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Boston Bob and AVP only offer long blocks, AFAIK.

Clark wants a turnkey engine. A turnkey engine is a complete ready-to-run engine that you just bolt in and add
fluids.

I do not know of anyone offering a turnkey type 4 engine. You have way too many differences from year to year
to even attempt this.

This may be why Bus Depot does not stock AVP long blocks:
1800: FI or carbs? You need a case with the fuel pump on it for the carbs. Auto or manual trans? Manual you
need a pilot bearing. Calif 73/74 1800, you need air injection ported heads. 1 port on the left side? Or 2
ports on the left side?

Now if you add in the 'turnkey' part of the equation: 73 EGR filter comes off the muffler, 74 EGR filter comes
off the #3 exhaust manifold.

On 1.8/2.0: the EGR valve is electro/vacuum on 75 [1.8] and on 76 [2.0] to mid 76. On mid 76 to 78 it is
mechanical. The dist on 75/mid 76 is dual vacuum, mid76/78 is single vacuum. I won't even mention the
pre-heated exhaust crossover pipe on 75/mid76 that you need that air cleaner for or the differences in the
decel valves between the years......

At one time BeetleMex offered turnkey type 1 engines..... but no more.
