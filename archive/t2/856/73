Subject: Re: [T2] Thermo and Full Flaps

On the type 4 engine you had better have the thermostat!!  If the flaps are 
always open, what is the point?  This is virtually the same as just removing 
the rod with the one flap on it (although many folks remove the flap that is 
clipped in the shroud, and the oil cooler gets no air directed over the top 
of it)you better have the patience of a saint to "be sure it is warmed up" 
before you drive off!

You, as many do, miss the point of the thermostat.  It is not just for cold 
temperatures.  It is so that you quickly warm up the motor, which extends 
its longevity and increases performance.  I have worked on many a motor that 
someone has disabled the cooling system on.  They usually have a few things 
in common.  Tons of sludge inside, milky residue inside the oil filler cap 
( from not being warmed up....the motor can't brn this stuff up) and usually 
a bunch of leaks.

You can find a thermostat.  Used or new.  It is not impossible.  If you are 
rebuilding it, don't you want it to last?
