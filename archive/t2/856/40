Depending on where you live, if you have any marine supply stores or  
anyone else who would have marine canvas remnants (here in Charleston  
I fixed the local expert's Mac, and so I have a hookup if needed)  
that they'd sell you for cheap.

Just a thought.

That stuff comes in lots of colors, and lasts for quite some time.
