Yeah, I've heard about that.  Guess if I dye mine I need to find  some UV protective dye.  That's a ways down the road,  though.  Right now I'm happy to have something to keep the morning  sun out as I sleep in.  Cheers...KR

Once I spent a hefty amount of time hand sewing crap fabric to craft
curtains that got cooked in less than a year in the sun in my bus. (in
socal...)
