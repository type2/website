Called either a "roo" bar (for keeping kangaroos from causing too  
much damage to the front of the vehicle) or a "bull" bar (though  
definitely not designed for stopping bulls ....).
As Neale said, they can be a two-edged sword.  Great for parking  
bumps and Very minor nudges but in big shunt have been known to fold  
onto the legs of drivers causing
more human damage.
Having said that, I figure that in any largish shunt I'm going to be  
in trouble anyway so we decided to leave it as it was.
