Thanks for everyone's responses...especially Karl's
characteristically thorough and fog-clearing one.

Looks like i was able to talk the kid down off the
turnkey ledge and let me just put heads on it.

Anyone have any experience with these $189 reman heads
on busdepot?

Ron - any of these come back to you yet?

Looks like a hell of a deal if they're holding up!

tia,
clark
