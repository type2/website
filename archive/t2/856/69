Subject: Dreaded CA smog check

Well, after much preparation (tune up, oil &all filters changed) and
dread, I took my '79 into a mandated "test only" facility for it's
initial smog check.
A little background on the motor: 15,00 on a rebuild, a successful smog
check upon purchase, then a two year sit.
I'm proud to say that it passed with flying colors.

At 15 mph, 2033 rpm:
%CO2 measured 15.3, %O2 0.3,
HC (PPM) is 13 (max. is 204, ave. is 49)
%CO is 0.17 (max. is 1.46, ave. is 0.24)
NO (PPM) is 459 (max. is 1486, ave. is 535)

At 25 mph and 2081 rpm, the results were:
%CO2 15.3, %O2 0.2
HC (PPM) is 15 (max. is 123, ave. is 38)
%CO is 0.19 (max. is 1.25, ave. is .23)
NO (PPM) is 471 (max. is 1346, ave. is 449)

My NO results were the only area where I was above the average, and only
at higher rpms. Anybody want to take a stab at how I can improve in this
area?

Is there anywhere I can see results/averages/maximums for other vehicles
so I can compare myself with, say, a Hmmmer?

An anomaly: The report has a "N/A" on the fill pipe restrictor line.
Boy, I'm soooo happy I paid $$$$$$ for that fill pipe restrictor.

Another one: My timing is set to 5 degrees BTDC, as per Bently. The
report shows 2 degrees BTDC and a "pass."

Moral to the story is: always pay the extra $20 for a pretest if you're
not absolutely positive you'll pass. BTW, I highly recommend the
facility I used, "Official Smog Check Test Only" (who came up with that
name?) in Oakland, CA., near the Coliseum DMV. They advertise with a
coupon in the Classified Flea Market, $39.95 + 8.25 for the cert.,
prompt, very clean shop, couple of pre 30's guys who, as my coworker
puts it, "have not been around long enough to have learned to take
advantage of people." I prefer to believe they are honest, don't pay a
lot in rent, and are maybe a little idealistic.

All in all, a very pleasant result to a dreaded chore.

Comments are welcome.
