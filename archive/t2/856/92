Subject: Re: [T2] shifting problems - solved!

Thanks to Chai for the help.

I pulled the shifter, shiftplate off my parts bus and installed it in my 
deluxe. It was somewhat of a pain to get it set right, but I was able to and 
now all 4 gears are where they are supposed to be. (Before you did not have 
to push down at all to get reverse). I think it was all just installed 
incorrectly or had come loose or something, the plate was intact but more 
beat up than the one on my parts bus.

Also fixed the tail light that was out and today I will go register and get 
a plate for my new deluxe and it's ready to be tuned up and driven.
