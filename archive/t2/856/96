Subject: Last week to order SDC Everybus Shirts

Sorry for the cross post here, but it's friday, and I
just wanted to drop a quick reminder that y'all have 1
more week to order the SDC Everybus 06 shirts. 

Designs and ordering info can be found at
www.busesofthecorn.com/suburban/ or at
www.mindspring.com/~everybus/

My last day for ordering is April 2nd. I don't
anticipate having extra's at the event, so order
early!

Thanks!
Adoom
