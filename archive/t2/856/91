Subject: Westy pop-top  support arms

Howdy All,

  I hope y'all can help me out a bit.  I have a 72 westfalia I am in the 
process of restoring.  When I purchased the vehichle it was pretty much 
totally dismantled and the seller didn't give me all the parts.  I am trying 
to find the support arms for that style pop-top.  I have the hinges that 
mount on the front but the support arms were missing.  Can anyone help?  I 
am completely at a loss as to what they are even supposed to look like.  
Perhaps someone could send me a picture?  I do have the support bar from a 
78 but it is quite different from what I need, it is much wider and probably 
taller as well.  But I was considering just cutting a section out of the 
middle to make it the right width and then modifying the bus itself so that 
the hooks will work properly.  That design seems quite stable and I think it 
would work quite well.  Has anyone ever tried that?  Does anyone have any 
suggestions?  I would like to see a picture of the original support arm just 
so I know what it's supposed to look like.  Any suggestions are welcome, 
thanks for your help.

  Bryan
