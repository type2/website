Subject: Thermo and Full Flaps

Rebuilding the '79 engine.  Mr Atwell says I must have the thermo and
flaps in working condition.  What about not having a thermo, leaving
flaps open and making sure 2.0 engine is warmed up before taking off.
This will be driven in the summer for camping and only in the Winter
to warm it up and top off gas tank.

Thanks for any opinions.
