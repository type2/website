Subject: looking for grey wiper blades....

Hello everyone...

Finally I found a pair of wiper arms like my original ones. Thanks to 
everyone that helped...
They are new but now i'm looking for a pair of 16' wiper blades with the 
same color and style...Painted Diamond Silver Lacquer
If you have a pair and want to sell it, please e-mail me some photos, price 
and shipping cost to Lisbon, Portugal.
I've posted a picture on Thesamba.com (look for JINDUNGO) for any interested
potential seller see what I actually have (wiper arms) and what I'm looking 
for (blades)....

Regards from Portugal.

Joao
