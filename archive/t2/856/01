Check the simple stuff first: make sure that all your fuses are properly
seated and not corroded. I have seen bad fuses result in similar symptons:
instead of being fed by the correct fuse, a number of lights and devices on
the dashboard were supplied by current through the generator idiot light.

Makes sense if you look at the wiring diagram: all this light does is
indicate a voltage differential between generator output and voltage at the
dashboard. Does not say which is higher or lower.

So, your problem may just as well be up front as it can be back in the
engine copartment. A bad ground around the dashboard may also result in such
symptons. Do your flashers work fine? If not, start looking around the
fusebox and the dashboard - flashers are pretty sensitive to the correct
supply voltage.
