Subject: Re: [T2] walmart awning

Two other things about the awning.  I got a pack of 4 tarp clips  at Hong Kong Harbor Freight for 4 bucks.  And for those of you  with Sage Green Westies like mine...the awning is also green!  I  would advise you to use the guy ropes supplied.  
  
  I see some more numbers on the receipt.  ST# 5251, DP#0000072,  TR#04589.  I'm thinking the ST# is the stock number but who  knows.  Hope I haven't given you a number that will let you clean  out my checking account.  Cheers..KR
