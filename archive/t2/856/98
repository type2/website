Subject: walmart awning

Several had asked about the awning a friend of mine got at Walmart and  attached to his bus.  Well, today I did the same thing.   Unfortunately, it's no longer listed on their site so it may not be  available long.  But my Walmart had several in stock.  It is  an Ozark Trail 11'x8' 'Dining Canopy.'  $29.96.  Comes in a  nice travel case.  The poles all have neat little spring things in  them so that when you sart to spread them out, they automatically snap  in place.  Nice because you don't have to keep track of the pole  numbers.  Easy to assemble.  Exactly the right height.
  
  To attach to a bus just you leave out the rear poles.  Go to you  local hardware store and buy a pvc fitting that is threaded and uses a  9/16 wrench.  It will thread right into the fitting where the tent  pole goes in.  That fitting is made for gluing on a 1/2' pvc pipe  on the other side.  But that fitting sits down in the gutter  nicely as is.  Don't need anything else except 4 awning clips and  some rope.  Somewhere on each side, just loop a piece of rope  around the frame and clip it to the gutter.  I used a short piece  of bungee cord.  In the center, you'll need to put one clip on the  very center of the awining and one clip on the gutter and use another  short piece of rope to tie the two together and hold the awning down  tight.  The ends of the canopy are held by weaving it underneath  that fitting so that it holds the awning itself in the gutter.   There is a long piece on each end that was supposed to cover the  pole.  I brought those along the gutter and wrapped them
 around  the center cross-member.  Seems quite secure.  Secure the  front poles to the ground with the stakes provided, then two guy  wires.  It was really windy today and it didn't move at all.   But be sure to note how it was rolled up originally.
  
  I'm sure this thing won't last as long as more expensive units, but  it's easy to set up and it works. And the price is right.   I can  send pics if anyone is interested.  The number on my reciept  is:  004729736209.  Might could get them to order you one if  they're out of stock.  I'd hurry as the website no longer shows it  and it did a few months back.  Cheers....KR
