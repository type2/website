When you shop for fabric, it is worth mentioning to the fabric seller
that you intend to use it for "car camper curtains". They will direct
you to something that can stand this sort of constant UV/heat attack.

Once I spent a hefty amount of time hand sewing crap fabric to craft
curtains that got cooked in less than a year in the sun in my bus. (in
socal...)
