Subject: Re: [T2] curtains

see our camper http://www.geocities.com/mike_benthin  (too many hits in 
one mo may shut it down for a bit).
I made all the curtains.  The front is a one piece, with snaps inserted 
at the right places.   Mine are three layered- white on the inside to 
reflect interior light, colored on the outside.  In between is a very 
opaque fabric to act as a light block; useful forWalMart camping or 
rrest areas where there is all night outside light.  My first curtains 
(done for a 71 camper) used black plastic garbage bags layered inside.
    Nyssa made curtains out of patchwork pieces fastened together with a 
glue gun!  She has a bus restoration section on her art site:
