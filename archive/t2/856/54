"Wondering if the kid installed a 009 in his bus -- following Muir's advice"

When John Muir used a 009 dist, he used them in pre 70 VWs, which they do
actually work good in. I have a German one in my 65 Beetle (28 PICT carb)
and it works great. Its only when the 009 is used in a type IV engine or a
type I engine with a 34 PICT 3 carb that it sucks, especially now since most
009s that people are using are made in Mexico or Brazil. I doubt that Muir
even owned a VW with a type IV engine. The fuel injection and type IV info
in the idiot book was written by Tosh Gregg.
