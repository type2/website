Subject: Re: [T2] tie rods

    I use a 16 oz ball peen hammer. Just take the nut off and smack the side
of the "Boss" where the tie rod end attaches to the spindle. Be sure to hit
it "end on", and it will spit the tie rod out! The vibrations flex the taper
just enough for the tie rod shaft to loosen and free up.
    I learned this from an old front end hand, when the tie rod puller I was
using just would not break one loose. He said to hit it on the side before
using the puller, to loosen it. Well the first time I tried, it popped out,
so now I don't even get the puller.
    Works for me.
