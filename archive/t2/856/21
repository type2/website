Subject: the sight just makes you ill.

my Boss's old 1975 Westy that he sold in december just
came back to the shop tonight for an inspection and an
old change, I drove past it on the road on the way
home. It used to be a a beautiful orange, now it is a
nauseating primer dark grey. YUCK!
I would have loved to see the look on my Boss's face,
he owned this bus for wow, since 1988, sold it since
he got a 1979 Westy.
