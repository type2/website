I use acetone everyday to remove nail polish. We use it to mask off 
areas we are gold plating. One time I didn't have acetone so I used nail 
polish. It took a lot longer to remove the nail polish. My point being, 
that even if women use nail polish everyday, the concentration isn't as 
strong (I assume. I'm a jeweler not a chemist)
