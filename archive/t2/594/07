Hey Guys,

Thanks for the quick replies and encouragement.  I changed the condenser and
points back to the ones that came with the bus and guess what... it fired up
and sounds great! It was pouring rain so it's hard to tell what I fixed at
this point, I really wanted to try the new transmission (no taillights
installed yet, so I was afraid to drive it).
I feel a slight exhaust leak on the left heater box to muffler which is
disturbing b/c it's a brand new muffler and new seals...anyone had luck with
any type of sealant or wrap at this joint?
And, the oil cooler that I had taken so much time to remove and have tested
was still dripping a little oil.  I replaced the oil cooler seals and the
local VW shop hooked the oil cooler up to their tester and promised me it
was ok.  I'm hoping this oil was oil still in the grating from the previous
leak.
If it's nice tomorrow, I may degrease the bottom of the engine and check for
any leaks...though I promised my girlfriend I would take a break from the VW
until next week...

Thanks guys,

Tom
