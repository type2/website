Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Swap Info?

Purists have always pissed me off.  I don't care how dear a vehicle is, or
if somebody thinks you should always keep it factory fresh.  The fact of the
matter is that the current owner is and will always be the only person that
has final say on what fixes, changes or improvements they do to their
vehicle.  
Can we kill this thread now?
