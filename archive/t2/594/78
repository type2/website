I think that you will have better luck with the carb-dip you can get in
gallon cans at the FLAPS.  Be warned, however, that this is nasty stuff
and you must follow the instructions to the letter.  The stuff is
hazardous waste and stinks badly to boot.

I also have good luck with spray carb cleaner.  It cuts the gummy stuff
rather well.  I usually put the nuts and bolts in the bottom of a old
cooking pot, spray the carb in the pot, and let the cleaner that runs out
of the carb work on the hardware.
