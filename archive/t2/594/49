Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Swap Info?

Don,

There are two separate questions going on under a single subject in 
this thread. One has to do with the aggregate -- what most or many 
people do with their buses. That question doesn't have a lot to do with 
you.

But it's true that you started the thread, and there's an entirely 
different question involving you. I speak for a lot of people when I 
say that you should make sure you've mastered the skill of setting your 
bus safely securely on jackstands, so as not to kill yourself, before 
you start talking about engine swaps. Especially in earthquake country.

Mark
