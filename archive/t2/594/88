Don,

You should leave those opening open if you remove the heat exchangers. This
seems counter-intuitive, but I remember a thread on shoptalkforums recently
and jake raby has proven on his dyno that engine cooling suffers if the
openings are blocked. Blocking the openings creates turbulence inside the
fan shroud and the airflow to the engine is reduced.
