I don't think that you're the only one who prefers stock transporters
on this list. I think that most people are just understanding the
benefits.

If the 1000-ish people on the list preferred a swap, KEP would be
overloaded with orders. ;-)

I personally prefer a perfect stock engine to the Toyota, but there's
more to the equation for me than just a vague preference. I think most
of the list would agree that VW did a kick-butt job in designing the
air cooled engine in general and the Type 4 engine in particular.

30 years ago I'd say we need to go smoke the peace pipe. ;-) But now,
I'll just have a beer  and respect your opinions.
