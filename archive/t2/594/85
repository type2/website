Subject: 71 FS $100/AIRS rescue almost complete...

Listees,

The guy that Danny bought the bus from helped Danny get the engine running 
in his bus. It's running but there's some issue with the clutch and Danny is 
going to drop it again to fix tomorrow, but he should be good to go. 
Something with the throwout bearing. So Danny should be back on the road 
heading towards AZ very soon.

Now he needs to get rid of this 71, he's asking 100 obo. See the samba ad:

It would make a great parts bus for someone. Has title. Someone expressed 
interest but I lost that email, can you email again or call Danny directly?

Thanks,
Daniel
