Hey Thomas,

I've been there!!!! When I had my first bus I pretty much had my thumb in my
butt for a while, and while you have much more experience than I had at the
time,  it can get frustrating when things aren't going smoothly. But at this
point you are so close you should keep chugging. Don't waste all your time
and devotion on some other guy who will change a few wires and get a great
deal on your bus!!!

The green wire to the dizzy is just your condenser wire...new condensor is
only a few bucks. Change that and the points and see what happens. Might
fire right up. And
if it doesn't what I would suggest is taking a break for a few days or even
a week. Do some other project and then come back to the bus with a clear
head. I found I got so wound up in my bus that I couldn't come up with new
ideas, etc. without backing up and starting fresh a few days later.

Good luck!!!
