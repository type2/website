just my opinion and experience, I have had the heat exchangers completely
removed along with the fins etc for about 10 years now and have noticed no
difference or change of any measurable amount either way.  just remember
to seal up the fan ducts near the intake blower and keep the little piece
of tin above the push rod tubes in place, the ones below the push rods are
arguable, I have had mine off since the beginning.. exhaust cooling air
just blows straight down into the slipstream..
