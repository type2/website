No need to get mean. :-^

Funny thing is that I've been under cars that I've put on stands that
have been hit while I was under them with no ill effects other than a
heart attack. When my bus came down, it was on stands, with wheels
chocked and all.

Needless to say I'll be using many more chocks and stands in the future. LoL!
