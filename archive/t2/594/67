Which means I'd probably better hide one of my 1950's style rocket castings.

I've been working on a table top game, a rocket race game actually, and have
produced three masters so far for the playing pieces.  One of them
incorporates a cockpit that looks surprisingly like a well-known vehicle to
this list.

I suppose an antimatter drive conversion (even a fictional one) is a
no-no...
