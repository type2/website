Subject: no fule pump & little spark

hows it going I just got done rebilding my 83 (calif) air cooled vanagon and im having trouble starting it .when i turn the key the fule pump dose'nt kick on to prime the engine. So i put on a jumper wire on the fule pump. turn the key the engine turns over but does'nt start.So i decided to check the spark . i put the battery charger on so it will have plenty of juce. this time i have a friend turn the key i  took the coil wire off the top of the distrubuter and i only get spark for a half a second then nothing.are these two problems related? how do i get spark to the coil ......im stumped please help
