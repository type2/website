>But what to use for the lower holes???

Your favorite beverage can. Cut the bottom and top off, cut a slice down the
middle and flatten it out. A few hole and a few rivets and BAM! you have a
decorative hole plug. I used Red Bull cans to block off the fan shroud
holes. They fit perfectly. Just cut off the top get some hose clamps and
there you go another use for your recycled goods....I also cut the red bull
symbol out of two more cans and used them to plug the bottom holes. My
engine looks like an advertisment for redbull...
