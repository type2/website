Subject: Re: [T2] Wires go to where?

Thanks every one for the help. Karl seems to have split a hair with the 
precision of his answer. I have left them alone. I am about to run out to 
get a few little items for the bus and then will be turning the key on the 
bus. Many many many hands crossing fingers in my head. I will post the 
results, I have been making a laundry list of parts that I still need to 
replace but I think I can get her moving. We'll see...
