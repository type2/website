Not so. We type2 drivers have (or had) this in common with drivers of 
splittes, Vanagons, and even pre-EV6 Eurovan drivers: speed and power 
were way down the list of things we valued. What we shared -- or so it 
seems -- was a willingness to take our time getting where we wanted to 
go. We valued a special set of driving skills over horsepower.

I won't wave at watercooled transporters in the future because I know I 
won't get a wave back: the other driver will have to put down his cell 
phone first, and by then they'll have zipped by me.
