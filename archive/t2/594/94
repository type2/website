Subject: Tranny Leak?

Hello,

I crawled under my 72 van today and noticed "thick gooey" oil near the front 
of the tranny. Oil was all over the limiting stop and the bonded rubber 
mount, which is where the gearshift housing resides.

The tranny works well I have never had any problems with it ...yet. Where 
could this oil be coming from (i.e. assuming I don't have a major cracks) 
and how easy is it to fix? I am not sure if there is a gasket between the 
gearshift housing and the body of transaxle. I assume if this needs 
replacing I will need to remove the tranny. How much work is this once the 
engine is out?

Thanks in advance, Phil.
