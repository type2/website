Subject: RE: [T2] Why is my oil cooler still leaking?

Yes, they can fail. I've heard it recommended or read somewhere that the oil cooler should be replaced at each rebuild. I didn't last time, but I'll probably get a new one next rebuild.
 
Be sure that the oil is really from the cooler before you rip into it...
