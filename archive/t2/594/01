Thanks Dave. I don't have the timing info, just duration and lift - not
timing.  Does anyone on the list have this for a Webcam 107i?  Does
anyone have this for the stock cam?  I could do this on mine and see if
it resembles stock as far as timing goes.

   Same thought I had (and others suggested) after discounting it as
ignition timing, so I took off any extra bits and sealed holes with
rubber stoppers - so I am very sure no extra air is getting in past the
AFM. Also checked by flowing propane around potential openings (while
trying to get it to run steady)

    It is , but it runs very very roughly until 5K!  If extra air was
getting in past the AFM it would be lean, no?
