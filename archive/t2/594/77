Subject: re: engine swap

If you wait to check out the bus before you wave they will have already
zipped by anyway, and, you may have missed waving at a really cool/good
person.  Who, may one day stop to help you if you are having problems.
Would you decline their help just because of the bus they drive?

Just a thought
