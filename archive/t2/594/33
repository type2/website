Subject: Re: [T2] Can you boil a Carb?

Hi Phil,

Bleach won't help at all. Vinegar will make the copper and brass bits 
very shiny, but AFAIK it won't do much for the zinc.

Go to a Yamaha Motorcycle dealer and talk to someone in their service 
department. Yamaha has a product made exactly for this purpose, and the 
people on the vintage motorcycle list say tht ir works wonders.


Happy trails,
