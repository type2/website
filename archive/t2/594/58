I've had a couple of '59s with the mighty 36hp engine, some later ones 
including the '71 that I really liked and the '86 which came with a radiator.
Know what they all had in common? I had to downshift on a hill.
I'm sorry but to me, a VW bus IS A VW bus.

On the other hand there is a lot of knowledge about the cooling system on 
the vanagon list.
