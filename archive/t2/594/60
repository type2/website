Subject: Re: [T2] Heat Exchanger Question.

When I pulled mine off, I cut up some sheet aluminum and siliconed the
pieces to cover the heater holes in the tinwork. But there's heater
pipes that go from the other end of the HE's that you'll need to block
off as well.

I haven't had a problem since my pipes are all well sealed, so when I
turn off the heater from the levers at the front, nothing comes
through.
