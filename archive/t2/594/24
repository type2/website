Subject: Re: [T2] Linnoleum and pop top Q:

If the poptop on your Riviera is like the one I had, it's not the same
canvas fabric as the westy...

It's more of a tarp kinda thing.  I'd use a really good goo with a tarp
type patch.

For a little hole in the screen, just use a needle and thread to close
it up.
