"I've gotten on my soapbox because 
since this thread started, not a single person on this
list other than 
me has expressed a favorable view of aircooled engines
in transporters."

HELLOOoo!... I'm with you Mark. If want watercooled
I'll
start saving my pennies for a Euro.
  Having said that I dont much care what others do
with
their type 2's... maybe someday only U an I an the

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me What a long, strange trip it's been.
