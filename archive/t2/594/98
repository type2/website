Subject: NEW Westy Plaid Fabric has arrived!

I am happy to announce that I have just received from Germany brand new
replacement green/yellow/orange plaid fabric, as found on '76-77 Chrome
Yellow Westfalias. This is brand new inventory from the original
supplier in Germany. It is the first time this color has been available
since my stash of N.O.S. fabric ran out a couple of years ago. It is
sold by the running meter to use for recovering your front seats, etc.

In additon I have the green plaid used on green '76-79 Westies:

And striped fabric for early Vanagons:

Other colors will hopefully follow in due time, but probably not until
sometime next year. (It it took a year to get the one I added this time
around.)  Meanwhile, if you have a '73-75 Westy with orange plaid, the
orange part of this '76-77 yellow/green/orange plaid is basically the
same orange, so this plaid will still look good in your Westy even if
not exactly like the original.
