Hello Tom  No it's not hopeless    the worse case is you have fried tyhe 
ingnition wire all the way back to the switch, the good would be just the points 
and condenser . Either way it was you own fault .  If you have had 15 VWs then 
either you haven't learned or have forgotten what you have learned on hooking 
up the wires. Let me ask you this  while the motor was out did you replace the 
flywheel seal and o ring, also while doing the oil cooler seals did you 
replace the fan crank seal and o ring ???? I dont want to sound like the Herr Dr 
Tim but beiing in the business for over 25 years I tend to agree with a lot of 
what he says. Do it right the first time using the best parts you can get and 
more often than not you will come out ahead.   I wish you luck keep at it   
later  and have fun  Mark dearing  salem Import Service  Salem Va
