Subject: got overriders? 

Hi fellow bussers,

I am restoring a set of bumpers for my 72 Westy, and I
am looking for overriders.
68-72 style, must be straight (hey, stop laughing)
better if with great rubber (no, really, quit it!)
and the spacer.

Some (surface) rust  is OK.

Now that you've picked yourself off the floor...

I'm serious. I need four. I'd take even one if you've
got it.
I found four in one day at Pomona 2 years ago, but it
was slim pickins this time around.

Anyone? Please let me know what you've got. I'd like
to have them all painted together when I get the
blades back from the shop next week.
I can pay $. 
Or, the only thing I have to trade is a rear bug
screen, and those chrome deflectors for the cab window
tops (used but good) --go ahead, keep laughing.
Anyone?
Thanks,
Jason
