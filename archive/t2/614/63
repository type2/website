Subject: what do I do with the corrosion?

Hey 'yall...

Spent some more time in the '72 Westy cleaning up the
inside of the fridge, the jealousies, the floor (a
spic 'n span original Westy floor. I've got to post
pics!)
I also found an old original VW fan belt under the
driver's seat!

Well, I figured I'd better turn my attention to the
runnings of the thing, seein' as it aint gonna do me
no good no how looking all pretty but sittin' in my
them thar driveway.

So, the battery was dead when it arrived. I had jumped
it, and it ran for a few blocks. GROSSLY
UNDER-POWERED! 
It was all it could do to get me down the street in
2nd. It may be running on three cylinders, even maybe
two!
(Disappointment. Never rust the sellers on ebay who
aren't VW people)
Anyway, I figured I had better figure out the battery
first.
So I took out the battery and it was made in 5/03. 
Figuring it was good, I threw it on the charger.
BUT...
The floor of the battery tray. In fact the entire
right (passenger's) side of the engine compartment,
over there, is covered in the chalky white "corrosion"
from what I guess was once the old battery. You can't
see any swiss cheese from under the car, so I figure
I'm doing alright so far. But how do you get rid of
this chalky white stuff? I figured I'd go over the
area with a scraper and then whip out the
Shop-Vac(tm).
Is it as simple as that?
Do I need to call the Haz-Mat guys out?
Is there anything I should coat the area with
afterwards? Will the chalky white stuff residue hurt
the metal any further?

Advice?
Thanks,
Jason
