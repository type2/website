Horrible distributor for a bus!


Distributor: VW 126-905-205, Bosch 0231 178 009
Chrome Version: Bosch 9230 081 094
Can Use: 0231 178 001, 0231 178 003, 0231 129 010, 0231 129 019
Note: The 001 distributor has VW# 126-905-205 stamped above the Bosch number and is primarily used on
industrial engines for constant high rpm use. The 003 was the successor to the 001 and 009 succeeded the 001
or 003 as per Bosch microfiche. The 001 or 003 Looks identical to the "009".
Timing Set At:: Most applications - 5 to 7.5deg BTDC Static. Full advance should not exceed 32 degrees at
3000rpm with stroboscopic timing light.


A much better choice would be a single vacuum dual advance distibutor like this one:

Beetle 1970 * 1600 Auto-Stick Trans

Distributor: VW 113-905-205AD or AE, Bosch 0231 167 029 > 113 905 205AL, 0231 146 101
Can Use: VW 113-905-205AA, Bosch 0231 115 078
Vacuum Can: 07 138
Timing Set At:: 0deg TDC (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe w/vacuum hose disconnected and plugged
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv; Centrifugal: 13-16deg (-at-) 2200rpm, 25-28deg (-at-) 3900rpm

but I would set timing at 5-7.5 before.
