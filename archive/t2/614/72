Verify the timing, either with or without vac retard as required. Back off 
2 degrees and rpm will drop a bit, reset mixture, then open idle a bit to 
get about 900, or maybe less if the motor build was properly balanced. 
Drive a hundred miles, then check plugs for clean condition to verify a 
clean mix.
