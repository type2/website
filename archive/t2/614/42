Nothin' like fermaldahide to preserve your bus! ;-)

As always, do a test spot. I think the Eraser takes a bit of surface
material with it.  Certainly on wall paper, and we noticed "old blue"
coming through when cleaning a 1 layer painted blue wall.
Never tried it on the bus.  I'll have to check to see if there's still
crayon on the exterior!

Krud Kutter did a nice job taking mold off my penthouse.
