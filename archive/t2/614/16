Subject: Just put on a high quality Empi muffler (hahaha)

OMG! What a joke the paint is!!! 

After installing it (and scrounging bolts and nuts since the #(-at-)$T%(-at-)
thing didn't come with any hardware) I drove it 2 blocks to a car
wash, then 2 blocks back. When it arrived it came with a semi-gloss
black finish. Now look:

It smelled awful and was smoking like crazy too. But it gave me a good
chance to see if my engine compartment seals were working... I just
followed the smoke. None made it inside (woot!)

Hey, Ron, might want to put a bit of a warning on the Bus Depot site
about the finish cooking and the fact that it doesn't come with any
mounting hardware. Since the stock muffler came with studs I wasn't
expecting to need anything...

Sounds pretty good though. Not much louder than the stock one I had on
there (that was messed up). I'm happy overall, but that paint... wow.
