wrecking yard:  a super rare 77 Champagne Edition bus. Built 3/77. Has all the light tan velour 
inserts in the seats, including the 3/4 middle seat. Unlike the 78/79 CE, the rest of the interior is 
standard bus black. Does not have intermittent wipers. Has chrome bumpers. Had a clock.....
Two tone paint, still original. I liberated the M code plate. here is what is on it:
