Sorry, the mis-pricing was my fault. I had something else on the brain
at the time.

The other comments still apply, however. Paint for shipping? I
*really* think a comment about that on the site would be in ordung.
That and the lack of hardware. Maybe mention it's a 2 tip muffler, not
a 4 (not that I really care...heh).

I still like BD for my bus, don't get me wrong. And if it came down to
it would I buy the Empi again in the same situation? Yep. Even that
$99 was hard to come by for me right now. And I'm sure it'll last long
enough for me to save up another $99 to buy another one. ;)

Wanna know what's funny? I've been looking at other bus mufflers on
the road (there are lots of busses still here in Orange County) and am
noticing that virtually all of the non-OEM mufflers look just like my
Empi! LoL!!!
