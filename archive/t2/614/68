I used the Bus Depot stainless Steel muffler, reconfiguerd my 1978 exhaust
headers to the 72-74 style and 5-6 years later the muffler still looks
almost new.  my recomendation without reservation.  only thing the little
tail pipe piece was welded up wrong and came out at a strange angle,
mostly pointing up, cut and rewelded it and works fine
