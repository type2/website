Subject: what do I do with the corrosion?

If you suspect battery acid in the area concerned, first you need to get 
your garden hose and clean and flush the area thoroughly. Remove the drain 
plug before you start if it's not rusted through already. Then you need to 
make up a batch of baking soda in water to rinse it out and neutralize any 
remaining acid. Then scrape and treat the rust remaining after it dries.

> But how do you get rid of
this chalky white stuff? I figured I'd go over the
area with a scraper and then whip out the
Shop-Vac(tm).
Is it as simple as that?
Do I need to call the Haz-Mat guys out?
Is there anything I should coat the area with
afterwards? Will the chalky white stuff residue hurt
the metal any further?
