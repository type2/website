Chris: How about using a muffler kit!!? :)

I had a problem on my 71 Westy, when the 10+ year old
aftermarket quietpack exhaust rusted out.. Header
pipes were still good, but I couldn't buy just a new
muffler because EMPI had changed the collector flange
size and angle..

So, I cut the rusty muffler off the pipe, and re-used
it by clamping on a $20 "muffler kit" for a Corolla,
from Autozone.. It runs fine, and is nice and quiet..
Plus the new muffler's aluminized and won't rust!!

I was rushed for time, and needed a quick fix the same
day, but now it's done I doubt I'll rush to buy a new
muffler AND headers anytime soon. Manufacturers only
keep changing their designs to force us to buy more
new product for $$$.

Anyone else have any experience with this??
