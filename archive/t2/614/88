The greatest stress on the steering box is when turning the wheels without
the bus moving.  Wider tires mean more force needs to be transmitted
through the box.

I suspect that the reason that VW switched to the worm-and-roller box in
'73 was because the wider radial tires were causing more failures thsn
the narrow bias ply tires.  I'm careful to never turn the wheels at a
standstill even with 185's.  Steering boxes are no fun to change and cost
$$$!
