Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding Door (Painting Question)?

Hi Kevin,

Getting the sliding door off without dropping it is an interesting 
exercise. You''d be best to get a helper for the job if at all 
possible. Be careful, it's VERY heavy and its size makes it very 
awkward for one person to handle it.

There are four bolts inside the bus holding the U-bracket to the rear 
door at the beltline. Once those are removed the U-bracket can be 
pulled from the door, and the rear of the door will be hanging loose. 
If you then remove the bolts from the lower slider arm you can swing 
the door outwards from the bottom and remove it from the bus.

While you have the door off take the opportunity to clean and lube the 
U-joint and the slider track, it will make the door slide a lot 
smoother.

Happy trails,
