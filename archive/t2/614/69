Bob,
Glad you have had good luck with this muffler, I have not, I have had the
same problem twice after 1.5 years on the T1 and T4 stainless steel
mufflers.  The outside does stay rust free, but the inside rusts away and a
big piece of metal always breaks loose (When the exhaust is off and you move
from side to side, you can feel the metal shift)

For the money, I am going cheap, as I still end up replacing in the same
amount of time :(  Wish there was something better out there  :((
