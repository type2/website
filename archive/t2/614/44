I have been looking for these pieces(both sides) for a few weeks. I still 
have not found them.

Facts from the list if they are:

They help push air to the back of the bus.
They are needed.
They are stone guards for the pushrod tubes.
They are not needed(written by someone who uses J-tubes.


And various other reasons.

Good luck, if you find any let me know I am still looking.
