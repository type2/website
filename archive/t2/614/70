Subject: Re: [T2] Just put on a high quality Empi muffler (hahaha)

I dont understand why we cant use quality parts that aren't made 
*specifically* for the type 4 motor.

Aren't there any muffles out there at the right diameter that one could 
simply connect in the stock type 4 muffler location, with perhaps a little 
extra effort?

Personally, I don't care if I get a good sound out of mine, its loud enough 
as is, some big heavy duty muffler would be nice to cut down on some of the 
cabin noise. With all of the people out there buying new cars and right away 
replacing their stock exhaust with "pretty stuff" - there are a ton of stock 
mufflers out on eBay for super cheap, and id be willing to bet they are the 
2mm thick types.

am I missing something on why this wouldnt work?
