due to some weird karma, I've ended up with 3 GEX engines over the 
years.  2 type 1s and 1 type 4.

The list consensus matches my experience to the tee.  All 3 were absolute 
junk.  And all 3 were fresh from their shop.

The 1st major expense you should count on is replacing the engine.  With 
the lack of proper cooling, and an unknown number of miles on a very 
limited life motor.. I'm glad you made it safely home.

Friends don't let friends buy GEX
