Vincent,

if indeed you aren't going off-road & it doesn't snow much where you live,
then you might try the Yokohama Y356.  low noise factor & they are great in
the rain.

i got a set from www.tirerack.com for about $58.00 each. they are available
in both C & D load range and match the stock tire size for a bus.

HTH,
