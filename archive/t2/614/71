Subject: Looks like carb rebuild time

:-( 

After putting the exhaust together on my 73 the idle was all screwed
up. Lopey and way too high. I had set it with massive exhaust leaks,
so now that there's the right amount of back pressure it's off.

Diving in with my tach I start adjusting the mixture. Well, with the
idle screw all the way in and the mixture screw all the way in it
still idles at 950 RPMs. I guess I should be happy it's close to the
right spot. LoL!

The exhaust smells clean like this too. No unburned fuel smell, no
scorched air smell. I backed the mixture screw out until the idle
started climbing, turned it in until it hit 950rpm, the lowest it
would go, and left it.

Time to see if these rebuild kits I got are complete... I hate
rebuilding carbs. I've done a few and am always nervous about doing
it.
