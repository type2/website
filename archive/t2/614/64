Subject: what do I do with the corrosion?

Jason,
        Lots of kinds of rust treatments should clean up the corrosion damage 
you are speaking about.  I would go at it with a wire brush to remove the worst 
accumulations, then use some kind of rust treatment or rust converter.  Finally 
a good layer of undercoating (from the spray can) should keep things looking 
nice for a few years.  The chalky white stuff is the result of the action of 
sulfuric acid on your body metal.  The damage has already been done... but 
removing the c.w.s. and recoating with undercoat will help prevent damage if 
more acid and/or acid fumes are released.  At the bottom, I've forwarded my 
earlier post on rust treatment.  Glenn

...So, the battery was dead when it arrived. I had jumped
it, and it ran for a few blocks. GROSSLY
UNDER-POWERED! 
It was all it could do to get me down the street in
2nd. It may be running on three cylinders, even maybe
two!
(Disappointment. Never rust the sellers on ebay who
aren't VW people)
Anyway, I figured I had better figure out the battery
first.
So I took out the battery and it was made in 5/03. 
Figuring it was good, I threw it on the charger.
BUT...
The floor of the battery tray. In fact the entire
right (passenger's) side of the engine compartment,
over there, is covered in the chalky white "corrosion"
from what I guess was once the old battery. You can't
see any swiss cheese from under the car, so I figure
I'm doing alright so far. But how do you get rid of
this chalky white stuff? I figured I'd go over the
area with a scraper and then whip out the
Shop-Vac(tm).
Is it as simple as that?
Do I need to call the Haz-Mat guys out?
Is there anything I should coat the area with
afterwards? Will the chalky white stuff residue hurt
the metal any further?

    Subject: Rust treatment
      
A couple of weeks ago, 'Tony in NJ' and I exchanged emails on a Benjamin Moore 
rust treatment product.  My local dealer wanted double or triple the price Tony 
was paying... so I chose to try RUST BUSTER, which I found at Tractor Supply 
for ~$18 per gallon.

The instructions for use are pretty sparse, but the label shows a 1-800 number, 
so I phoned.  I said I wanted to paint the surface after treating it.  Nice 
lady said I should let the product dry, then clean off the white haze.

OK... I was working on a roof, so I got the roof good and wet with Rust Buster; 
then went to bed.  In the morning I was mildly horrified to find the roof was 
covered with a black flaky stuff.  But it looked worse than it was, as I found 
when I started in with some Scotch Brite.  The worst areas were indentations 
where there were puddles of black muck.  I first tried wire brushing, but the 
stuff is pretty hard.  Things went much better when I got a bucket of water and 
started working on the semi-dried puddles with moistened steel wool.  The black 
muck came up readily.  Encouraged by this, I did the entire roof with moistened 
Scotch Brite.  Now, at last :-)) I've got the white hazy stuff the lady told me 
about.  

Recommendations: 
(1) don't get the surface dripping-wet with Rust Buster -- apply it with a 
moistened cloth.  If you need more, you can wipe some more on.
(2) don't leave the work for hours at a time -- keep an eye on it (with 
protective eyewear, to be sure) and just re-moisten the areas where the 
chemical reaction seems to need more product.
