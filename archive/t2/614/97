Subject: wheel bearing ID

while working on my rear hub today i ran across a snag (well, 
several! but i digress...): the outer roller bearing on a 72 
suspension - which is what is on the 70 - should be 211-501-283D. 
this is what was marked on my 3 FAG bearing boxes, all sealed. 
however, these bearings did NOT match what was in the axle housing; 
the FAG bearings are all pressed together in that the outer race AND 
the rollers stay together... the inner race is free to come out, 
however. the bearing currently IN the housing is constructed so that 
the outer race STAYS in the housing, while the rollers and inner race 
come out as a unit.  my guess is perhaps the parts place messed up, 
and they have 211-501-283 bearings in the box? these would be for a 
68-70. if anyone has seen the two together, let me know if i am 
correct :)

speaking of races -  i ended up reusing my vaguely dodgy outer 
bearings; i could NOT figure out how to remove the outer race!  short 
of blasting, no tool i used seemed to budge it.  obviously VW had 
some snazzy tool that whipped it right out, but aside from that what 
should i try?
i DID have the proper tool to press out the inner ball bearing and 
seal, AND the press to put them back in! $50 between the tool well 
spent. fun to actually use something shown in a service book..........
