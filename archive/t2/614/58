Make sure you've capped off any ports that don't already have hoses.
Check the nuts/bolts holding the carbs and manifolds.
Get some "starting fluid" (ether) from your FLAPS and see if that will
get it rolling. If it starts fine with ether, then you may be right on
either the accellerator pumps or the chokes.
