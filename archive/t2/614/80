My two cents...

I really liked the stainless one that I sold Bob. If I could still get
them, this would be my strongest recommendation. Alas, the manufacturer
in South Africa went bankrupt and the tooling seems to have vanished
into thin air. I haven't given up, but it's been almost two years so I
can't say I'm too hopeful at this point either.

My second choice (for '72-74, or for '79-83 if a CAT is not required) is
the OEM style system. I don't know where Don got a quote of $250 for the
muffler only, but it sure wasn't from me. I sell the whole kit (muffler,
tailpipe, and hardware kit) for $159. (Less with your 5% list discount.)
This is pretty much always available and is what I recommend, now that
the stainless kit is not available. Nice quality and not horribly
expensive.

My third choice is the Pacesetter extractor system, which is a U.S. made
single piece system that in my experience has better quality control
than the Empi. (Most Empi's last a few years with no problem, but once
in a blue moon we get one that literally falls apart within weeks. Poor
quality control. If yours lasts a few months it will probably last a
year or two, anyway.)  Unfortunately Pacesetter seems to be out of these
about as often as they have them. I generally ship the Pacesetter as our
$99 system when I can get it, and the Empi when I can't. To be quite
frank, neither the Pacesetter nor the Empi will hold its own to the $159
OE style setup, but for under $100 what do you expect?  As several have
pointed out, if you get a couple of years out of it you didn't do all
that badly for the price.

Below these are a handful of low-end Chinese systems that I won't sell
at any price. Even for free I couldn't recommend spending the time
installing them. You're lucky if they stay in one piece long enough to
make it out of your driveway.

It's worth noting that none of these will accept a CAT or an EGR filter.
While a '72-74 does not require one, '78-up technically do. ('76-up in
California.) We do sell an OEM type setup for $299 ($398 w/CAT) that
does accept the CAT, and this is your option if your local inspection
requires it. (It is quite good quality.). It is a direct fit for '79-83,
but then again so are the above setups if a CAT is not required.

If you have a '75-78, none of these will work unless you use '72-74 heat
exchangers, in which case they are all worth considering since many of
the OE '75-78 parts are NLA.  I also have a direct-fit Pacesetter for
under $100 that is decent quality and works with the stock '75-78 heat
exchangers. That is probably the best bet if you don't need heat
exchangers yet (and wish to keep your existing '75-78 ones), unless you
need a CAT.

Incidentally, it is true that the paint on the Empi (and other) systems
is for shipping only. It will burn off immediatley when you use the
exhaust system. POR15 and others make high-temp exhaust paint if you are
inclined to use it, although we do not sell it.
