Subject: Re: [T2] painting a pop-top

I'm think I should paint my pop-top, but I haven't seen (or at least haven't
noticed) the "comprehensive" discussion about how to do this with the
pop-top in place.  My assumption is that removing the pop-top is not a
trivial matter and for most folks will do the painting with the top still on
the vehicle.

So:

Best to completely remove all the seals before painting?

What about the bolts that are visible on the outside of the pop-top?  Mine
are all rusty and I'd like to replace them, though I may not.  Paint right
over them?  Remove them, paint, then reinstall bolts?

If somebody has the comprehensive step-by-step procedure for painting the
pop-top in place I'd sure like to see it!

TIA.
