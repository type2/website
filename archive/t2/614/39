Subject: Missing cooling tin piece

Someone stole a piece of tin off my bus (!). How much risk do I run
driving without it?

Here's the piece info from the Bus Boys diagrams:
W. 021-119-356CU Warm Air Duct, Lower Right, Used 1972 to 1974, 1980
to 1983 All

It seems that I should be able to live without it for the time it
takes to get one, but I'm hesitant to second guess the engineers...
