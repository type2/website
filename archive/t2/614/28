Subject: New bus....

So I just got a bus off ebay for 1000 dollars.  It's
in fairly decent working order, but there's still some
minor problems I was wondering if you could help me
out with how to fix them.  

First, the battery is constantly going dead on me. 
One day it'll start up fine, the next the battery is
dead and has to be jumped.  My guess is the alternator
or the starter, but I can't tell cause it's so
inconsitent.

Second, the gas guage does not work.  That's pretty
straight forward.  

Third, it came with a tape player, however, the tape
player was not hooked up to anything, nor was there
anything for the tape player to be hooked up to.  It
doesn't look like there is anyway to hook up any kind
of stereo system, so anyone with any knowledge of
wiring and how to wire in a cd player would be much
appreciated. 

Last, I am planning on putting a couch in the back. 
Does anyone know the legality of that and if it would
be able to pass inspection and if I would get a ticket
for it if I got pulled over.  Thanks.


Thank you very much for all you're time and help, I
really appreciate it.
