Hi Folks,

I'm on my second EMPI GT-style muffler in 3.5 years, and here's what I've 
found:

1. Sounds great, looks great, resaonably priced
2. Original paint is cheap and will burn off in a few hundred miles
3. Once paint burns off, remove muffler and repaint with hi-temp BBQ black
4. Repeat step 3 until exhaust rusts so much that the header pipes crack and 
one of the mufflers falls off (or is "helped" off by some more serious 
off-roading)
5. Re-purchase new EMPI unit, begin at step 1.

Hey, for $99 every couple of years, it's worth it for me to have a 
free-flowing, good-sounding, good looking exhaust.  Plus, your exhaust bolts 
have a much smaller chance of shearing since they've been run in & out a few 
times a year.... <grin>

BTW, I happen to agree with the school of thought that says a cheap fix is 
better than no fix if you just don't have the $250 for a "perfect" unit.

Oh well, off to the shop to wire brush and repaint my exhaust...

Best,
