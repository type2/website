My thoughts exactly. Most that have follwed my engine refresh know that it 
was indeed a GEX. It still is not running due to the FI issues I have not 
finished, but before I started it all it was a good engine. It ran fine with 
the .009 and the single weber. Also those flaps were gone. The mouse nest on 
top of the fins of the cyllinders and a host of other problems. These can 
all be found on stock engines that DPOs didn't take care of. When I get back 
on the road I will post my comments regularly via trip report. I am not 
saying I am proud of the GEX in my bus, just thankful I decide to dig in and 
take a look.
