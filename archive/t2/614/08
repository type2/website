Blake--

Don't get discouraged. Having a GEX engine is not the end of the world. 
Worst case scenario, the engine dies in the next 3000 miles. So what?

Part of the fun of owning a VW bus is taking pride in keeping it going.
When I bought my first bus, a '75 Camper I knew next to nothing about
volkswagens. That was about 7 years ago. Now, there isn't a job that I
wouldn't consider doing on it. I've rebuilt 4 VW engines with outstanding
results since. I can find complete used engines in good running shape in
my area (Cape Cod, MA) for around $400. It can be cost effective to keep
replacing them every 30,000 miles or so. I think its a lot more fun to
build one up yourself. Its not hard at all. My current rebuilid has
114,000miles on it and it runs better than ever. Its an 1800cc type 4.
This is the engine i prefer in my bus. There is no problem with it at all
and I'm in the process of building another 2L type 4, just for fun...and
to have a good backup. 


My point is this. Don't get discouraged. There are lots of us on the list
that can help you if the 'worst-case scenario' occurs. We can help with
tech knowledge, where to find parts the cheapest, and give good advice on
what courses of action to take in a given situation. Vws are not hard to 
work on at all. With the right tools and knowledge you can accomplish
anything, even on a tight budget. My buses have given
me all kinds of headaches in the past 7 years, but with each headache I
learn more, and as a result I'm more confident driving them.


I've had just as much enjoyment in fixing my '74 bus as I have camping and
driving in it...maybe more. I think that is an important thing about
owning an old Bus. I hope we don't lose touch with that...its what keeps
so many old veedubs on the road.


:) good luck with the new bus.
