Subject: Sliding Door (Painting Question)?

Howdy,

I'm about to put a couple of coats of primer on my 71 Westy.
I've got the whole van prepped except I have one question.

Is it possible to take the rear hinge that attaches the right side sliding 
door to the track off, without the door falling off (in the shut position)?

With the door closed I can see that it is going to be a pain to get paint 
underneath it.

I started to take it off, but as I got to seeing how the door stays on the 
van I stopped as I was worried that the door would fall off.

Thanks
Kevin
