Subject: 1972 best guess

I have a 1972 VW camper.
It was sitting since 1990.

I replaced the fuel filter.
I put a lot of anti varnish fluid in it.

I took out both carbs and cleaned them somewhat with
acetone.

I replaced all post fuel pump fuel lines.

fuel pump is original, not cleaned.

It ran pretty good yesterday.

today it wouldn't start.

any best guesses as to how to proceed.

yesterday both acceleration pumps worked
and I expect if either of them was working then
it would have started.

this is very very confusing.

it implies that either both fuel bowls have leaked.
or that the slightly colder weather has prevented
it from starting.

many hoses are disconnected.
vacuum advance is connected.

any ideas ?
