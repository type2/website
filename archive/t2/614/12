Hello Jason

If you are open to sugestions, go find a marine enammel, polyurethane based
enammels are better, got a small foam roller, a small brush and a helper.
After wash the top using a bleaching solution and a hard plastic brush,
start to paint the top with up and down srorkes using the foam roller, you
will notice some bubbles in the roller path, tell the helper to use the DRY
paint in a side by side strokes go over the painted area to make the bubbles
gone, the helper must be next to you working on the wet paint and always
mantaining the paint brush dry with a towel.
I painted my 22 footer using this method (I read in a marine magazine) and
the results was pretty amazing.
Good look


Roberto
