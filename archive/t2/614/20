When we had our 78 Westy painted, the shop did the muffler too (empi,
installed by PO), no charge to us. We were tickled.

After a week of driving the paint was already rusting out and flaking
off. We had initially thought that the shop had been silly and painted
with regular body paint (which presumably isn't suitable for a
muffler).

With your story I'm wondering if  empi exhausts get way hotter than a
"regular" muffler should? FWIW our muffler is BURNING hot after we've
been riding around for a while - as is the rest of the exhaust. Maybe
empi uses cheap muffler paint that's not rated to a high enough
temperature, as did our shop?
