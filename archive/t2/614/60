It starts just dandy with a bit of gas thrown down
the carb.

I'm hoping that I still have a fuel pressure gage
around so I can rule that out.

I think I'll run a line into a can and have my
wife crank it to see if I have a fuel delivery problem.

The battery was a bit down, it seems I let the lights on.

I must have something really marginal.
