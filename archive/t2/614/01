You REALLY want paint made for fiberglass. Thicker and has more flex
to it than normal enamels.

Check Home Depot or Lowes or whatever for marine paint. Some spray it
on, some use a roller.

Scrub, bleach, light scuff sanding for prep. Use the matching primer
to whatever marine paint you get. It will probably be much thicker
than the paint and will cover any loose "hairs" from the fiberglass
nicely.

I've seen 2 roller jobs recently and they actually looked great. The
texture was much more interesting than the normally smooth Westy top.
Probably a pain to clean though.. heh
