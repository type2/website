Subject: locking z-bed/servo needed...

Listees,

I used to never lock my VWs. But this year I've had two break ins and one 
case of vandelism. My "new" 71 Westy doesn't lock (supposedly prev owner has 
key that works all doors in the mail, I'll believe it when I see it). So I 
wanted to be at the least to lock down my tools.

In my other 71 I built this horrible wooden box thingy that fit between the 
two front seats and had that locked down. But it was pretty small and not 
very much stuff would fit and this time I wanted that area open.  So I 
locked down the z-bed. I got a heavy duty hasp/lock combo from Home Depot 
for ~$7 and installed it. I did have to close up the little door on the 
bottom so that doesn't open anymore.  Here's a pic:

Also, I really really need a brake servo(booster). I just need one that 
doesn't work or is unknown as I'm going to have it shipped of to be rebuilt. 
I know for a fact that 72 servos will work on my 71 and it appears that 
early 73's will work, but would prefer a 71/72 to be safe.

Also I need other various parts for my 71 and I have various parts from my 
71 for sale. See ads at:
