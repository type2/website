Subject: Re: [T2] what do I do with the corrosion?

I don't know that I would use a vacuum like that without a hepa filter
on it. You'll corrode your lungs and your dustbuster. Remember this is
an enclosed area and the stuff is gonna get mixed in the air when you
vacuum it up. A painter's mask won't do any good, and I can't imagine
getting my head with a respirator into the engine compartment. ;-)

If you have access to a wet-dry vac, you could use a hose to keep it
all wet and vacuum that way. It'll paste up and should stay in the
vacuum. (Make sure you clean the impellers and motor as well as
possible immediately after.)

If you don't have that, wear gloves and use a wet rag to clean it up.
Baking soda and water in a bucket would work nicely to help clean iit
up.
