I really envy you. Here in PA, I'm lucky to see a bus driving down the
road once every month or two. The ones I do see are almost all late 70's
models. As for splitties, I drive past maybe one a year if that. I've
noticed a sharp decrease in the number of busses I pass, of any vintage,
over the last five or ten years.

Obviously VW related events are an exception. My family just got back
from Kampers Near Knoebels, where there were a couple dozen, although
many were from out of state. Similarly, certain concerts (Dead, Phish,
etc.) also tend to draw them. And of course there are the ones that
visit my shop to pick up orders (also often from out of state, or from
Canada, and increasingly more of the Vanagon variety). But as for seeing
one just randomly driving down the road, it happens so rarely anymore
that I actually get excited to see one (as does my six-year-old). 

It's the climate (or, more specifically, the road salt) to blame, not
the VW's themselves. You don't see many 1970's Fords anymore either, or
any other vehicles from that era for that matter. Most have long since
been eaten by rust.
