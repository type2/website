Subject: Re: Sparkplug crossthreading...

Mike,
I've had good luck in preserving my '75's original heads by use of the tool 
that is supplied originally by VW: the double-ended sparkplug/wheelnut 
socket wrench. To 'save the day', presuming there are still some threads in 
your #2 opening, you should acquire a KD-tool #730 "spark plug opening 
thread chaser, 14/18mm". The combination of the VW and KD tools makes for a 
near-perfect, on axis, 14mm chaser/tap to refurbish your threads as follows:
Take the 18mm end of the KD and screw it into the wheelnut end of the VW 
wrench. You'll notice that the inner diameter of the VW tool at that end is 
just a bit tighter then the 18mm threads of the KD tool and so you can "cut" 
some threads into the VW tool until the KD seats firmlly, and it will be 
right on-axis when it seats fully in the VW tool if you do it carefully. You 
have thus created (with the other, 14mm, end of the KD which now protrudes) 
a long 14mm thread chaser which when inserted into the plug hole and aligned 
via the engine tin's hole a virtually fail proof chaser that is certain to 
go into the spark plug opening on-axis. The taper of the chaser is such that 
if you are very gentle and just use your fingers you'll be able to 
'purchase' a grip on the remaining threads and at the same time 
clean/refurbish the crossed threads at the top of the opening.
Nothing guaranteed here, but it has worked for me all these years.
