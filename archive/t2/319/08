All the best--last forever--not cheap--but will give you the most bang
for the buck.

Preparation, preparation, preparation.

This is the most important part of the job.

Do this right and the paint will last for many trouble free years.

Later,

Terry

Has anyone out there successfully painted their pop top? I'd really like
to take mine from white to black when i paint my bus this summer. Any
ideas?
