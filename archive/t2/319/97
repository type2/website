Subject: [T2] squeaking belt

Re squeaking alternator belt:  Just a couple of obvious suggestions beyond
what you listed.  Perhaps it is TOO tight?  Also is it the belt squeaking, or
are the alternator bearings making noise?  (I.e., how old is the alternator?
Maybe you need a rebuilt one.)  Someone else will have to answer your other
questions.
