Hi Mike,
     The 75 should have solid lifters but if you have hydraulic
 lifters check your valve adjustments. As the lifters pump up 
the valves may not be closing. Even if you have solid lifters 
I would check for proper clearance. If there is any doubt
 adjust them on the loose side.  It can be very difficult to 
discern when the hydraulic lifters are just touching. 
   
Darrell
