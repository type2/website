>>History of the beetle and bus and lots of
 archive footage from the Wolfsburg
factory showing engine and body assembly.<<

Richard & list:

they frequently re-broadcast shows like this.

if anyone has a heads up on when it will be shown
again, i would really like to know.

i already checked the History Channel's website & it
doesn't look like it's on at least until the end
of this month.

TIA,
