Ok, I understand "restored", but if you were going to judge such a class 
in a show, *what* would you disallow(an allow)?

I have 67 bug with 90k original miles and the original(faded) dealer 
sticker still on it.  I rebuilt the engine last year and it *looks*
exactlly like it did when it came off the show room floor, with the same
external parts that came with it(original fuel pump etc).  All nicely
repainted to the same color as original.

Would it be allowed in the  "unrestored" class??
What about the gal over in Tulsa with a 78 vert with 10,000 garaged
miles on it.

The reason I am asking is that I would like to push for a class like
this in the local show this year...but gotta prove it will work!

Cheers, dave
