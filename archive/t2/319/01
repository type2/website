Oh great and powerful list gods.I have a 75 deluxe westy ready for
paint. the thing is it was yellow with the blue green interior. The
paint code on the M plate 9648 L65k IS RAVEEA GREEN and the interior
code 49 comes up camping red. Is this actually yellow and vw just called
it green or am I missing something. Thanks for any heip. Rich 75 westy
