Are the splined drums _that_ much more than the composite drums?  Wow!

>>>

No 50.00 per drum new for 68-70. still i dont believe in turning them.
It only marginally increases braking and is really more of a planned
obscelecence tool. Break the glaze with a little sanding, run them till
they wear out naturally, dont let the shoes wear to metal and damage the
drums.
Also I dont like semi metallic pads. The organic ones wear faster but dont
abuse the drums as much.
