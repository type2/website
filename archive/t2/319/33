Subject: Re: [T2] setting up eber. heater

Having a working gas heater in a bus can increase the value of the bus if it
is going to a colder climate (don't think those SW people know what to do
with a gas heater, maybe roast marshmallows).  Of course I do know of a few
SW bus people who like to camp in the mountains and go on the crazy "Mount
Shasta" trip, for them a gas heater is a wonderful addition to the bus.

You do have to cut a couple holes in the bus for the exhaust and intake air,
then a couple more for the duct to go past the gas tank.

If you want to be creative, you can find places inside the passenger
compartment such as under the rear seat, jump seat, under the dash, between
the front seats, build a small seat and put it behind the front passenger
seat.

Here is a good web site that will show you the engine bay installation that
requires a good deal of work and some extra ducts that it doesn't sound like
you have:
