Subject: 75 FI bizarre near failure and 78 dies on throttle up....

Took the fairly recently rebuilt 75 out today with stock engine and FI,
and like 2 days ago, noticed slight hesitations on accelleration; on way
home, they were more noticable (axactly like when you take your foot off
the gas pedal).  Push the clutch in, revved up fine beyond idle, but
poor power under any load.  This got worse until I could only drive in
first, and the engine was making "plup-plup-plup- sounds in time with
the rpm's- went back to listen, and I thought it made noise from the
valve cover areas as well as exhaust.  Most of way was flat, but the one
decent hill close to home it just couldn't do it (push clutch in, revv
it up, let out, just kinda was dying.  Stopped on hill, called home to
bring the chain.  Sat about 10 min, and then started it up...ran
decently in 1st and 2nd and I got it home, but still heard those
"plup-plup" noises.  Immediately did a compression test; good news is
that all cyl were within 10 lbs of each other; about 120 lbs on rebuild
under 500 mi.  The fuel pump is new, as was filter; tank interior looked
clean when sender was replaced.  Plugs were tan, but the "plup-plup"
sound makes me think "too rich", like tomorrow I must check temp sensor-
any in the know (Dr Tim?) know how to check what I think should be the
air temp sender under the throttle?  It's the early FI with 6 pin AFM.
BTW, took out the 78 after a few weeks of not running, and upon pushing
in the gas pedal it dies- slow pushing past idle and it will rev
up....what gives- too lean?
