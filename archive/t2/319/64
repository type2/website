Make it what you want it to be and sell/give away the pieces that you don't 
need. Maybe that would take another bus back to close to original as your 
moves away from original.

Mine's not original either but I can make it original later as I am only 
making color and upholstery changes.

Do what you want. If you worry about resale then store the pieces you remove.
