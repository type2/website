Subject: What a great list!

This is just a terrific list, and I just had the most fun using one of the
tips I found in the archive. I needed to get a pilot bearing out of the crank
on a FI engine, and I didn't have a puller. The tip said to pack the space
behind the pilot bearing with oil soaked toilet paper, then use a large round
dowel or punch and hits from a heavy hammer to compress the oil behind the
bearing, effectively making a hydraulic ram to force it out. Boy, did that
thing come flying out of there! My husband and I got such a laugh out of that
one! Thanks, whoever posted this, and thanks for a great list!
