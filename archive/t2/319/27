Subject: setting up eber. heater

We are going to put an eberspracher bn4 in our 72 bus, but we dont have 
anything from the end of the heater to send the heat into bus. How were these 
heaters suppose to be pumped into the bus and anybody have these parts or 
should we fabricate something. Does it go through the gas tank area and if so 
what is the safest way, thanks
