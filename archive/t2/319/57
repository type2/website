Subject: Re: Question...[T2] AridZona VW Show--Additional Bus Classes !!

Folks, can someone please describe to me what this class means?

> Best Unrestored-------All Years

Does it mean that the bus hasn't ever been totally repainted?
Does it mean no new rubber, no new interior?

The local show in August doesn't have a class like this and I 
would like to know how others are judging entries in a class like this!

Thanks ,dave
