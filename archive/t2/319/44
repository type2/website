Subject: Plug crossthreading on entry in "bizarre 75"- now what!

Re the "bizzare failing 75 bus-
In doing the compression check on the 75, #2 plug hole in  the new head
wouldn't accept the compression tip; I got a reading with it screwed in
about one turn.  Now the Plug will not go in without beginning to
crossthread, and I have stopped because I don't want to force it and
affect any further threads.
Tried adding nosieze compound, no go- anyone have experience with using
a tap-this has never happened to me as I always start the plugs by hand.
