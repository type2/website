Rob asked   ..."Has anyone out there successfully painted their pop
top? "...

When I painted the fiberglass luggage rack on our bus I used paint
from a marine supply store.  It's a single part, polyurethane paint.
It dries to a nice gloss, is made to go on fiberglass, and is meant
for outdoor service.  It dries slow which allows brush and roller
marks to "flow" out of the paint if you can't spray it.
