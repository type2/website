I doubt it.  The referee would have the same concerns about the EGR.  They
just need to match your bus to some known configuration.  I don't have any
idea what happens when NLA parts get in the way but that's what the ref is
for.

This how the sticker indicates the required tests and swapped engine:

First, go to the smog website and check your VIN to see if you already have
a fail recorded:

My own feeling on this is that you can probably get away with it but what
happens next test?  What about complications for a future owner?
