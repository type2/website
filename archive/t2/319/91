If he entered your engine swap data into the state database you have to go to the referee.  If he just told you go get lost you might have a chance.

Did the guy do any work with the smog computer, like enter your vehicle data?

Thanks George,

Yes, I've read the book and now I'm living the movie.

You don't have to let cops in your house, and I don't let anybody enter my number in the smog computer either, I got advice only.

Went to the bugshop that built the engine for that kid that got stuck in my yard for two months and he recommended a shop downtown. It's an old father/son autoelec. shop that's been around for ever with good repute.

I've got a good feeling about them, I think they'll be friendly and not know enough to get me in trouble.

And if they fail me for wrong reasons, I can go to ref, plead my case and get the engine swap sticker that tells them how to judge the test.

What else can you do?

Billy
