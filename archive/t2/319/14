Subject: checking brake servo

anyone have a method for checking to make sure their is no leaks in the brake booster?  I am getting a popping thru i carb and it is where I have the vacuum for the brake booster ported.  All new vacuum lines going up to the booster.  My bently manual says nothing about checking for leaks, although it does say to install the check valve with the arrow pointed towards the booster which is backwards unless your are in a parallel universe!
