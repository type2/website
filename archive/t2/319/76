Or any other auto engine!

The reason is probably weight and tradition.  Orginally airboats were
powered with war surplus aircraft engines that were available cheap.  then
they went to "runout" aircraft engines that were not airworthy because of
being over their TBO time.  These days, even the "runout" engines are
pricey.  The closest cheap engine to the aircraft engine is the VW.

Now you got me thinking about a Corvair for my bus again...
