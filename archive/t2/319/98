Subject: 78 type 2

this is my first attempt at using this sort of communication. I've read all
the rules, i hope i don't make any mistakes. my 78 bus isn't running to good
and hasn't for the last year. here are the symptoms. sometimes the engine
runs like a top. sometimes it backfires like the timing is way out. sometime
after it has been running I'll shut it off and then try to restart it, the
engine will barely turn over, almost like a dead battery. i suspect a fuel
injection problem or an alternator problem. here are some of the things i
have tried. rebuilt alternator. fuel injection trouble shooting: double
relay, fuel  injectors, cold start valve, temp sensors, injector resistance
block, intake air sensor, and everything else the book tells me to do. when
its running i can get the timing and idle speed dead on. i shake electrical
connections and pull hoses trying to recreate the problem but can't track it
down. like i said it will run perfect, i think i found the problem and then
it starts backfiring again or turns over very slowly. I'm at my wits end.
this is my first vw i love it but so far its been in the garage longer than
its been on the road. help
