Subject: ?couple misc. questions?

hey there list....i have a couple questions i'd 
like to see if all can help me out with. 
i have a 70'Westie that i'm gettin ready for our 
summer adventures. and i'm tryin to decide the 
best routes to take and what to order for her.?.?
first off, 
-should i go with an Electronic Ignition? i've 
read some pro's and con's on the issue, and 
what 'Hoover' has to say. but i'd like to hear 
your opinions also. 

#2-what is an accelerator return spring? i don't 
believe i have one on our bus. but i've seen 
them in parts catalogs. 

#3-what size of stud do i need for my front 
shocks? i'm missing the one that connects the 
bottom of the shock to the wheel assembly. 

thanks in advance for any advice u can pass our 
way. it's always much appreciated.
