You're gonna need a judge with a really good eye and knowledge of
the marque to keep the entries honest...You might try a Google
search for Concours d"Elegance for a 'correct' definition of un-
restored or original...BTW, when you get into the stratosphere
where Bugattis and the like fly you run into stories of an owner
applying for a competition and being told that his Bugatti is one
of three sharing a serial number, but the judges know of the
fourth 'real' one...
...Or of the guy who actually spent over a million to have a per-
fect Bentley recreated...8-)
