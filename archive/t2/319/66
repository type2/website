If they did, they did something similar on Monster Garage (TLC).  They put a
  2180(?) into the back of a new beetle, and sealed the chassis so it would
  float.  Pretty cool...

        A couple of months ago on "Junkyard Wars" (I think) they made an air

    boat using a VW motor to turn the big prop. Of course, it lost to the
    boat
    w/ the jetski motor.
