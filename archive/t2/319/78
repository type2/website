Subject: Leaky Valve Covers

Hi Folks,

I adjusted my valves yesterday and put my valve covers on upside down to 
keep the gaskets compressed evenly (I swap them this way each time I do my 
valves).  Today when I parked in a space that was on a steep sidehill, I 
came out to find oil dripping out of my 1 & 2 side valve cover.  I have 
always had some seepage from the valve covers, but this is ridiculous.

Does anybody know of a good source for perfect-fitting, perfect-sealing 
valve cover gaskets?  I've tried several sources and tried both cork and 
rubber, and have NEVER found ones that seal well.  I'm on a very tight 
budget, so I can't afford to try and try poor solutions.

I'm driving a 1979 Westy with a Jake Raby 2.0 FI engine -- the heads have 
been redone and now have solid lifters.  As always, thanks in advance for 
any help or suggestions.
