Subject: 2L core heads for sale 2 sets

One big valve, 40 X 34, and one stock.  The big valve sets needs the seats
replaced, the other set has cracking between valves and by plug whole.
Tired of keeping these for a rainy day, for i have just been putting new
heads on the last year or so to avoid warranty issues...........

All these heads are square port "vanagon" style.

$25 each and shipping.
