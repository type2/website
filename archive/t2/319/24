Subject: Bus For Sale

This ain't mine, folks! Just thought I'd let the list in on one I saw in the
trader.

1974 VW Camper bus. Well cared for bus, rust free and pampered, all records
available. $3100
270-753-0864  Murray, Kentucky

The picture shows a nice looking bus, white over blue, with a roof rack but
no poptop.

Now you know as much as I do; Call him, not me.

Regards,
Dave

PS: Murray is in the far western part of the state, about an hour south of
Paducah.
