Subject: suspension

Anybody know if/how I can stiffen the suspension on a Baywindow?  I use
the Single Cab as a work truck (a very sexy work truck, I might add) and
I'd like it to be able to carry the necesary weight without looking like
it's laying an egg.
It's rated as a one ton I believe and not that I'll ever load 2000
pounds onto it, I'd like it to handle better when it is under load.
Thanks for your help.
