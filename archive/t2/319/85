Hi Folks,

My bails are tight -- so tight that I have to use a mini crowbar to snap 
them into place.  I just pulled the covers off (in the last hour) to check 
them, and both gaskets had pulled inward towards the center of the valve 
cover.  I pushed them back out and put the covers back on the way they used 
to be.

I think I may need new gaskets, but it's only been about a year since these 
were brand-new.  Is this the typical service life of gaskets, or should they 
last longer?
