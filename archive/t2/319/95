Here are some thoughts.  Replace the points, cap, rotor.  Check the 
plug wires for cracking.  check the plugs themselves.  remove the fuel 
pump, it is probably gummed up, soak it and get it pumping again.  Check 
all fuel lines and replace as necesarry.  Check brake booster vacuum 
line, probably cracked too(nasty vacuum leak will run very lean).  dumped 
all the gas in the tank and start new.  get a can starting fluid, 
charge the battery, grab a fire extinguisher, pound a beer (rainier worked 
good for me : )  quick prayer and go for it!

'74- I was assuming carbed?


  Good luck, Paul
