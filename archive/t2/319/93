Subject: Re: [T2] CA SMOG REPORT (NOT)

That was interesting! I just searched my California bus, and found out it
passed a smog test in 1996! Can anyone tell me how to do a title search in
California and get the name of the previous owners? I'd like to research the
maintenance history of my bus, and the PO didn't know the original owner's
name. I've tried phoning the DMV before to no avail, since they don't answer
the phone.

First, go to the smog website and check your VIN to see if you already have
a fail recorded:

My own feeling on this is that you can probably get away with it but what
happens next test?  What about complications for a future owner?
