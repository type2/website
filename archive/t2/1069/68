Any current, decent, GPS measures speed primarily from the phase shift 
of the carrier, not positional changes over time. For instance, the 
SiRFstarIII, a recently popular GPS engine used by many manufacturers, 
specifies a 0.01 m/s (0.022 mph) velocity accuracy at 50% confidence. 
Someone who knows statistics better than I could tell you the 
confidence for a +- 1 mph error, but it's very, very high.
