Hey if all cars were scary at 80 mph again we'd go slower - right? Might be a 
good thing... 

Did the foot on the floor all the way home thing once in our '78 Westy 2.0. 
Didn't want my buddy in the big Ford F-150 to rag me about having a slow 
ride. I think I got about 10 mpg the whole way... VBG! Steering and 
suspension did not offer enough to manuver out of a bad situation though. 
MUCH happier at ~60 mph!!! VBG!

Want the same top speeds, just more power to get there more easily...
