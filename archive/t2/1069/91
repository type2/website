Pegged the speedometer? The only peg on mine is on the left side and I HAVE bumped it from the bottom more than a few times! Not with the Subey, either - with the 10.92:1 CR T4 motor with 96's and hogged out heads. Oh - and the "modifications" to the L-Jetronic plus having the cold start injector engaged. With the Subey I have become much more layed-back as there is simply nothing to prove! I tend to relax more knowing that at any time I can pass - I don't have to get it done in "certain conditions" that are to my advantage, so I just relax more and every once-in-a-while, let 'er rip! I don't think I have even had the speedo needle vertical (downward!) since I installed the Subey.

I think the number one handling improvement is the wide wheels - not actually that wide, but 1"+ thick center flanges make for over 2" wider track width. It could also be that I grew up driving WW2 Jeeps pretty wildly - like 2-wheel cornering on the street - that makes the bus handling seem like a sports car! The enhanced vacuum in the cranial cavity certainly has added to the adventurous spirit!

 I can do that all day long. I actually peg the speedo on
 occasion at
 4600-4800rpm. But with the bad ball joints, I ain't
 takin my hand off
 the wheel to take a pic.
