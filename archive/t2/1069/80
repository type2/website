Hey all,

I did a lot of research, and different people like different
solutions, but in the end I went with the Caswell Epoxy Tank Sealer.
I wasn't unhappy with the POR-15, but it did fail after 10 years. Not
substantially, but enough that I had to redo it. I also found this
interesting review:

Resources
The two products held in highest regard by the motorcycling community
for both metal and
fiberglass fuel tanks are the Caswell Plating (www.caswellplating.com)
2-part epoxy tank
sealer and the Bill Hirsch Auto (www.hirschauto.com) single part tank
sealer. The Caswell
product, being more viscous, will actually seal areas that are rusted
completely through.

POR15 also makes a good tank sealer (www.por15.com), but in our survey
clearly ranked in
a distant third place. There are also several aviation tank sealers
that work well on
motorcycle tanks. When you use any of these chemicals, be sure and follow the
manufacturers instruction carefully to obtain the best results.

There was no one in our survey who recommended the Kreem fuel tank
sealer. In fact the
users who had tried Kreem were very vocal about their complete
dissatisfaction with the
product. Try to avoid this product

Hope this helps someone.

Ned
