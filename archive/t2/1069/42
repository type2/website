Hi Todd,

The improvements in baywindow braking don't come from Brazil; they come
from the Vanagon. Replace the rear backing plates, shoes, etc with
rear-brake Vanagon parts and they magically become self-adjusting. Karl 
wrote the procedure, you can find it in the library at type2.com. They 
don't really stop any better, but they do increase the maintenance interval.

Stock bus brakes are fully adequate for the baywindow suspension and 
powertrain. If you made the brakes much better the stress of sudden 
deceleration would overwhelm the suspension and you'd wind up in 
trouble; probably shiny side down.

Handling improvements in a bus will generally come from better tires, 
lowered suspension, and beefier anti-sway bars. You really don't want 
better brakes unless these mods have already been done.

Another alternative if you still want a sportier riding bus: buy a 
hardtop vanagon.


Happy Trails,
