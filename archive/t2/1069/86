Subject: Re: [T2] Sealing Gas Tanks

You know every time I see this discussion I still want to say, why do this
yourself?  And I have many times, I'm not being lazy just practical.  The
Eastwood, Hirsch, or POR kit costs exactly the same as what it cost me in WV
to have a quality radiator shop I knew and trusted boil out the tank and coat
it for me.  I had tried all of the above before I realized this.  You will
NEVER get the tank as clean inside as the pro's will folks when they soak it
overnight in a hot tank, and I've done the things like swished gravel around,
etc, etc.  I like to do my own thing, but sometimes it is worth even an extra
$20-30bucks to let the pros do it for cost of your time and effort better
spent on something else.  There are underlying questions of course as well
about how well these will all last, not that the products fail so much, but
the federal government keeps changing our gas and a coating applied 15 years
ago may or may not be up to high ethanol fuel
 today, but generally speaking I have some in service that I did or had done
in the early 90s fine now.

Had the same issue with my 55 Cadillac.  Hirsch's name kept coming back
up and that's what other club members suggested.  I patched a 53 Tank
since it had some pinholes with a kit from NAPA and so far, after 2
years, it's holding up just fine.
