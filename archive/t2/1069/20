Jim, after I told my wife where you live, she said, "Oh yes, that's where we 
stopped in the downtown area and I found that lovely bead shop" There had 
been a lady there that was really nice, and showed Gail some beading 
techniques. After that, we went across the street to a small cafe or bakery 
and had a coffee and pastry. :-)
