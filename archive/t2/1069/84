	As I recorded in my first post on this goodly List 3 y ago,

  Max speed 85 mph in Maori overdrive down a long steep hill (yes 
that's similar to Mexican OD and a few others that might get me in 
trouble ...  ;-).


	By this stage I've built up enough confidence to state the 
others that I know of:

		Georgia OD (as in Dave Dudley's primordial truckin' 
song "Six Days On The Road"), and

	{here I shudder in some trepidation} J*w*sh OD. :-!

	 I imagine there'll be some others  ... :-/
	One might expect to hear Boong OD in Australia, but being as 
how that worn-down continent lacks hills, they probably don't have 
any name for this exhilarating & economical if short-lived way of 
travel.
	I use this 'gear' downhill routinely not only on gearbox 
vehicles but even on my Prius II, which is a minor reason why I get 
21 km/litre  ( = bulk leagues per US gallon).
