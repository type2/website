Subject: RE: [T2] Calibrating speedo

Let me know what you find in there.  I've got a local speedometer shop
and their prices aren't too bad, but if it's not too complicated a
solution I might have a go at it.  Unfortunately I don't have a GPS, so
I'll need to acquire one to test out any changes I make.  I was with a
friend who brought along his GPS when I figured out exactly how far off
my speedo was.

Thanks,

John

I think I'll take apart my extra one and see what it looks like on the
inside.  I would venture to guess there's some kinda adjustment.
