Ahhhh, yes.  That's something completely different.  I'll leave the nitty 
gritty history refresh to Troy, but basically:

When we moved to the new server, it broke all of the custom code that made 
the web reflectors work.    I assume you're looking at 
http://www.type2.com/vintagebusreflect/
and 
http://www.type2.com/type2reflect/



The type2.com front page links were supposed to get changed to point to 
the new "reflector" which relies on much less custom (and often breaking) 
code.  The archive page was updated but it looks like the list pages were 
not.   Troy is looking into this now.


Note that full body archive searches are still broken, and the pre-qmail 
(pre ~~2000 or so) t2, vb, and vanagon list content is still not 
sucessfully imported into the archive.



Note for everyone:  When complaining about a website, it helps a -lot- to 
give the actual URL you're using. ;-)
