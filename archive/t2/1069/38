Subject: RE: [T2] Rusted beam on my 77 ???

Had somthing similar, also a 77, which I'm pretty sure was driven thru salt
water.  Material can enter thru the bump stop perch and will have a tendency
to collect at the bottom.  Rusts from the inside out.  Mine was simply unsafe,
and I replaced the beam.
