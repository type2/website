They're out there.  In fact... I live in one. If I took the keys out of my 
buses, I might not be able to find them. I literally do not know where the 
keys to my house are.  The only time you lock your car is during September 
in the Wal Mart parking lot. If you leave your rig unlocked there then when 
you return some fool will have filled it full of zucchini....

Serious.
