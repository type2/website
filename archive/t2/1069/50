Subject: At what ....speed?

Was just wondering.....at what speed does the 'air foil;, of a
beetle,....cause...problems...for the operator, and ...further.. if a BUS is a
"breadloaf" in motion, at what speed, do "angoromics", really change, so no
matter how much you change the "powerplant", ...you  still  have the basic
"BOX","!  Just sitting at my "keyboard", and...trying...stuff!!  Sorry for the
imposition on your time!
