Subject: Yes,...I know it is not Friday...but

Sometimes when you work on your VW stuff...you get bogged down, and it is not
a mental thing..it is your perspective becomes clouded....which is where I was
prior to today...but a fellow list member..."Captain Hook", came by today to
help me do...other stuff...than what happened...but,  he was able to recognize
the situation I was in, and through diligence and persistence, ..moved me from
where I was stuck in the project...to a better place..to reach
accomplishment...and all it took was 4 trips to the machine shop, 3 trips to
the parts supplier...and a good lunch at the end!  That is what this list is
about..like minds who commit to the VW...we still drive, fix, and love them!
Cheers
Syd
