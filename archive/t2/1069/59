Subject: Calibrating speedo

Has anyone recalibrated their speedo before?  Mine reads fast - 50 is 
actually about 48, 60 is really 55, 70 is 61, etc.  So, the error is 
getting greater as I go faster.  I haven't opened one up yet, but I'm 
guessing there is some kinda calibration spring in there that is too 
loose.  I was thinking of driving with a GPS and then adjusting the 
speedo such that it matches the GPS.  Btw, I do have the correctly sized 
and load rated tires.

Thanks,
Mike
