Subject: Axle shaft - symmetrical?

I just purchased from my FLAPS a pair of axle shafts with CV joints 
already attached(installed) - 2 shafts/4 CV joints.  The part number for 
left side and  the right side was identical.  Shafts appear to be 
symmetrical - i.e. it will make no difference which end attaches to the 
transaxle or to the wheel hub.  I'd feel better if I could get an 
opinion or two on this matter :-)

Thanks,
Pat
