Remember that the GPS has some degree of error - usually at least 3-5m - and at speed I'm not sure how much I'd trust it.  Too many sources of error - atmospheric, geographic, etc.  The GPS could be reading behind you and then in front of you and all over the place and could give you a greatly inflated or reduced speed.

I'd try driving behind someone with a newer car and talking to them at various speeds, and drive a measured mile at a set speed and time it.
