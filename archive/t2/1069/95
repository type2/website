Subject: Re: Calibrating speedo

Mike asked:

 Has anyone recalibrated their speedo before? Mine reads fast - 50 is
actually about 48, 60 is really 55, 70 is 61, etc. So, the error is
getting greater as I go faster. I haven't opened one up yet, but I'm
guessing there is some kinda calibration spring in there that is too
loose. I was thinking of driving with a GPS and then adjusting the
 speedo such that it matches the GPS. Btw, I do have the correctly sized and
load rated tires.

There is NO mechanical connection between the needle and the gear drive. The
needle is attached to the speed cup. The gear drive has magnets that rotate.
The speed cup turns at speed due to the magnetic pull. In order to change the
calibration, you need a special machine to change the strength of the magnets.
If I remember right, VDO uses 4 magnets, US cars use 2. Before they went
digital.....



You can the base setting of the needle by seeing where it sits after you
gently lift it over the stop peg. Look at the bottom edge of the face. See
that little white line about 5mm to the left of the V in VDO? That is the
index point for the needle. Install the needle pointing to that line. Move the
needle towards the 10 and gently lift it over the pin. That will set the
preload on the coil spring.



If it is off of the mark: get a pair of tiny needle pliers to hold the shaft
and carefully move the needle to the mark [be gentle, the needle likes to
self-destruct!]
