Subject: 1972 westy

I've decided I don't care for VW buses anymore and am hauling a '72 pop top
westy to the scrap yard next week after I found out the engine is trash and
needs replaced. if anyone wants the bus I have the title, its free, and I
could even deliver it within a reasonable distance of Tacoma, but I won't be
pulling parts for folks.
