The axle shafts for manual transmissions are the same length.B  The axle
shafts for automatic transmissions are different lenghts and I don't remember
if the left side or right side is longer.

Subject: [T2] Axle shaft - symmetrical?

I just purchased from my FLAPS a pair of axle shafts with CV joints
already attached(installed) - 2 shafts/4 CV joints. B The part number for
left side and B the right side was identical. B Shafts appear to be
symmetrical - i.e. it will make no difference which end attaches to the
transaxle or to the wheel hub. B I'd feel better if I could get an
opinion or two on this matter :-)

Thanks,
Pat
