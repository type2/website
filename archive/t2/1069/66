	An alternative is police radar.  I borrowed a hand-held (but 
had an 'in'  -  the chief of station was a classic Indian racer :-)
	Or, if you see a police car staked out with radar apparently 
going, pull off the road just past him/her and ask politely "if I 
come in reading {speed limit in that zone}, with no traffic in front 
or behind, could you please measure my speed?".  I have found they 
always cooperate.
	This method of checking your speedo relies, of course, on 
belief that this Doppler radar is accurate.  I dare say it is at 
least as accurate as the dynamic GPS reported by several on T2.
	BTW I did it once on a sickle and found the cop had to admit 
shame-facedly that he couldn't get a reliable reading off such a 
small frontal area.
