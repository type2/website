Boiled linseed oil (BLO) will "cure" in a reasonable time. 24-72 hours
at room temperature usually. Raw will go rancid before it cures.

With those other oils, you will need a drier of some kind added to the
mix. Otherwise it'll be sticky for ever. The butane will help, but is
so dangerous. Mineral spirits might do it.
