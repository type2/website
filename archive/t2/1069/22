Hi Ned,

I have often wondered how to deal with my surface rust in these scoops 
myself. My current best theory is to remove the metal panels (left and 
right) on the inside of the bus, above the engine compartment. I have 
absolutely no idea if this is possible or practically feasible. Hopefully 
somebody here may know better.

Regards,
Bruce
