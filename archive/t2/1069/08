People,

FYI: the hard-to-get 411 941 583b dim/flash relay is available as a
Neihoff RL37261 (available new from Kragen Auto Parts, etc. $31,
made in China). Also, online, is Meyle 100 941 0006 (Germany).

I have installed the Neihoff unit in my '71 panel, and the (missing)
flash function now works. You will have to add a 6 inch wire with
female 1/4 inch blade terminals on either end from relay terminal 30
to the 12 volt buss, as this wire is missing in US vehicles.

As an aside, I have been adding short lengths of shrink tubing over
all terminals on the fuse block, headlight switch, and emergency
flasher switch to guard against accidental shorts, as many of these
wires are unfused.

FWIW
