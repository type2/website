Subject: Re: [T2] Small Town USA, where are they?

It is increasingly hard to find a place that hasn't gone
modern and, at the same time, hasn't become a derelict.
If the soil is good but the nearest Walmart is >50 miles
away, then you might find what you are looking for.  Even
if there is some industry, so long as the "industry" can't
be shipped to China you might get lucky -- places where,
say, landscape shrubs & trees are grown and every farm
is competing with the next.  Nothing within commuting
distance of a city, that's for sure.
