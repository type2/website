Hmm,, I remember the fist time I was able to get my 74 Westy over 79.9 mph.. 
down hill,, tail wind ,, pushing like crazy to get home .. it was fun to try 
to break that 80mph barrier...
I had to install a larger engine and trans to make it go. 

Also.. the fastest I have ever been in a beetle is 32ft/sec sqd .. how fast 
is that lol..  can I make that claim..as I have launched off road jumps at 
about 100mph.. but maybe I wasn't 'falling' airborne long enough to reach 
terminal velocity !
Remember V W ads with the rabbit gti vs the old beetle... they dropped the 
bug from a helicopter and said.. that is the only way you can make it go as 
fast as the the rabbit.... 

also I commented on a picture I saw.. a 78 GT2 Beetle at mosport track... 
the hood had a dent similar to what would happen if you bumped the car in 
front. the driver took me to the car and showed me the original hood.. no 
dent...
turned out , the hood would 'oil can' or bubble in under wind pressure when 
he went 130mph .. then pop back out when he slowed down. 

ok,, enuogh friday chattin.. buh bye
