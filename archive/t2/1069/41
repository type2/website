Subject: How I removed a frozen solid star adjuster.

I'm sure this is old hat for some of you, but today while pondering how to get
the star adjuster/screw combo out of it's hole in the brake block my 7 brain
cells left to me by the man in charge finally all sparked in the right combo
and I had an idea. (Man that HAS to be a run-on sentence.) :-)

Anyhoo, after using many different wonder-lubes, using a really BFH and drift,
it was a no go. I then whacked the head of the slotted screw (that holds the
brake shoe) a few times after it soaked for 24hours, and noticed it moved a
bit. Ah ha!
I put the trusty vicegrips on it's head, and slowly wiggled/lubed/swore/danced
around it and was able to wind it out. Here comes the brain wave.

I took a bolt that was longer than the adjusting screw, wound it down into the
frozen star adjuster until it bottomed, then continued to tighten it down.
This caused the star adjuster to rise up out of it's siezed brake block hole,
and VOILA! Done! I then unwound it, cleaned it all up, anti-siezed everything
known to mankind, and all is well.

Maybe not a revelation to some, but man, I was so chuffed about this, I went
into the house and kissed my dog. :-) Then had lunch.
