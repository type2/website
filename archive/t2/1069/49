Subject: Fuel tank sealing

Hey all,

I received my used tank today and am getting ready to reseal the inside.
It's very clean with a little bit of rust and sludge. Last time I did this,
I used the POR 15 kit, and was mostly happy. I had used jb weld or something
similar for the rust holes around the outlets, and that held for about 10
years. This year it started to leak and I found a good replacement. I tried
looking up Richard Atwells writeup, but the server was down, so I did a bit
of searching. I found this:
http://www.caswellplating.com/aids/epoxygas.htmHas anyone used it? Any
feedback?

On another note, when I pried of the JB Weld, the pinholes weren't bad, and
my body guy offered to braze them. The inside of the tank is still perfect.
If anyone is interested in this after brazing, let me know.

Thanks,

Ned

PS, it's a 78 FI tank.
