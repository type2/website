	I see no reason to remove any rust.
	Living in the country where RIPO is mfd, it's easy for me  - 
I just squirt that wonderful liquid onto the top of the rust layer 
and it creeps all the way to the edges, and then loses 70% of its 
mass overnight, leaving a dark brown waxy layer of embalmed rust. 
One can then slap primer or other oil-base paint on that, tho' inside 
the scoops & on down to the engine compartment there's little need, 
even cosmetic.
	For all youse frustrated deprived of access to that fine 
Altex Devoe product, you could try mixing up a rough imitation.  The 
exact composition is, understandably, a trade secret; but linseed oil 
is certainly the main 'heavy' component.  If I had to try to compile 
a 'poor man's RIPO'  I'd put about a litre of linseed oil (sorry, 
dunno between raw & boiled) in a 3-L bottle, and add light oils e.g 
kero, some petrol, and even try bubbling some butane thru it 
(caution!).  The light oils give the mixture the capillary creep 
which fills up the rust layer, and then they evaporate.
