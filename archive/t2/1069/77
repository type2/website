Subject: Re: [T2] VW auto trans

Tougher how exactly?  I mean VW ran 180hp though the same basic tranny in Audi
200 turbo's (where admittedly they failed regularly at 75-100k miles) and
plenty of 120hp FWD VWs where they last fine for 200k, in lighter cars
admittedly.  So what exactly do you want to run into them, how modified of a
T4?   The late bus tranny was used largely unchanged (tranny section that is)
throughout all the FWD water cooled years and all the vanagon years, with
ongoing improvements, and in fact can probably be substituted from any to any
applications.  (I've put 4-5 Jetta units into Vanagon's over the years, would
be no difference into a bus, just I haven't owned one in a bus since 1989)   
Late Vanagon units do have a few more plates in the clutch packs, though are
usually shot as well by 125-150k miles.   Anyway it isn't a bad box, and can
be upgraded a little, but I really don't see the need.  I do have friends that
run them in sand buggies, and they
 can push reasonable HP and torque through big tires and do as well as an 002
probably does.
 
YMMV

I have worked with lots of Domestic auto trans...and I was wondering...if a
person...could build a "tougher" auto trans from the existing parts....and if
anyone had done same...with the VW auto trans..any input appreciated.  Cheers
