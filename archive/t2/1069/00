Subject: Fwd: [T2] Painting inside air scoops

My rust isssues in that area were minimal (I am, sadly, not near a beach) by I just allowed plenty of overspary to go in there when I last painted my bus.? Seems to be protecting it quite well.? In your case, applying rust converter first sounds like a good idea, not sure about media blasting though.? I can see how that could lead to left over media falling out for some time, and possibly getting into your engine.
