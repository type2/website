Subject: fast idle after valve adjustment

I adjusted the valves on my GD engine that came from the 77 donor. 
Somehow I grabbed the .016 instead of the .006 feeler.  Afterwards the 
idle was fast (over 1000) with the idle adjust screw adjusted all the 
way down.  I let everything cool sufficiently and re-adjusted the valves 
with the .006 feeler and the idle is still fast.  What could I have done 
to cause the fast idle?  This is only my second valve adjustment, but I 
believe it was done correctly.

TIA,

dan
