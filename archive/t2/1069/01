Agreed.  That's one of the main reasons I never tried it (media 
blasting).  The thought of leftover sand, walnut shells bits, etc. 
getting sucked into the intake and/or fan made me shudder.

I no longer live near the beach either, BTW...In fact, I think I'm 
geographically about as far away from the ocean (in any direction) as 
one can get in the US. ;)  Dry Colorado air is good for my bus though.

When winter decides to shake its grip, I think what I'll do is stuff a 
bunch of crumpled newspaper into the battery areas and spray the heck 
out of it with rust converter.  It ain't getting any better untreated, 
dry air or not.
