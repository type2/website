This post from Courtney Hook brought a smile to my face.
Its funny how how we folks travel back and forth looking for things and
places.
Perhaps because his name sounds similar to the place I'd like to tell you
about, it raised
the memory in my mind. Or maybe because he said "we always head off from
Vancouver
Island....."

Anyway, after retiring from a 30 year career in the Navy I hired on with a
government contracter
here at Whidbey Island maintaining a number of navy aircraft used as
navigational trainers. From time to time
I'd fly aboard the airplanes checking systems and so forth in flight And as
luck might have it, we would sometimes
fly up to RCAF Comox on Vancouver Island. From the air thats got to be some of
the prettiest country ever. It wouldn't
take much to convince me God lives there. The Canadien armed forces folks
always treated us well on our arrival and
I for one always left with regret.

On one occasion we flew there and some of our "friends"  took us in town to a
place where we were able to purchase frozen fish
(salmon, halibut, etc) at remarkable prices. Far better than at home. So "fish
runs" for navigational purposes became a fact of life
and we discovered the joys of a small place called Courtenay. What a neat
little town.

A few years later our daughter was in college in Seattle. She was also active
in Karate (she holds a 2nd degree black belt earned in Japan)
There was an open tournament to be held in Courtenay (Canadien Nationals?) she
and members of her dojo were invited. The event lasted two days
and we drove there in in my '63 15 window bus. (And you thought there'd be no
Volkswagen content?) arriving on Friday and departing Sunday.
We had a great time in Courtenay with friendly people and pleasent
surroundings. The drive both ways was great fun. We took the ferry from
Anacortes
to Swartz bay, but going home we took the ferry to Vancouver, lingered in the
city a bit, had dinner, then crossed the border back into the states.
I recall some kids approached my daughter and wanted to know if the bus was
hers. "Way cool" was a comment heard on that occasion, then they took some
photos. Probably something that doesn't happen to often to you vanagon types.
Nice memories.
Oh yeah, she won two gold and a bronze at the event in Courtenay.

  My wife and I always head off from Vancouver Island here, and drive the
backroads throughout Washington and Oregon and Idaho. We are always on the
hunt for the little Mom and Pop towns in the PNW that are out there. Some
great places we've been to include Odessa Wa. and Fossil Or. We look for the
little local cafes and local history. Wallace Idaho was cool too, but more
touristy; about as much as we like.
  So the Friday question is: Where are those little quaint towns from "Back to
the Future" :-) where by God, you might not even lock your door?
