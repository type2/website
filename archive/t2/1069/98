Hi Volks,

I am in the process of recalibrating vanagon speedometer; though not 
exactly in the way that you describe, I think it will be very accurate.

Step 1. Document the true speed of the vehicle; to build a table with
the indicated speeds vs GPS verified speeds at 10 KM/H intervals.

Step 2. Calculate the new position of the number increments.
(ie, 30 moves to 23, 40 moves to 28, 50 moves to 38, etc.)

Step 3. Create a new faceplate graphic with the numbers moved to new 
positions to match the true road speed. This graphic will be printed on 
matt black adhesive vinyl with white ink using equipment that can be 
found at most local sign shops.

Step 4:  Install it in the speedometer.

It's not a perfect solution, but it will work for me.

Happy Trails,
