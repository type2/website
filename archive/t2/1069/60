Subject: RE: [T2] Calibrating speedo

That's a little better than mine, but not much.  Mine reads 64-65 when
I'm actually going 55.  I've got the correct Hankook tires, so I don't
know why it's that far off either.  I'll be watching here for
suggestions...

Has anyone recalibrated their speedo before?  Mine reads fast - 50 is
actually about 48, 60 is really 55, 70 is 61, etc.  So, the error is
getting greater as I go faster.  I haven't opened one up yet, but I'm
guessing there is some kinda calibration spring in there that is too
loose.  I was thinking of driving with a GPS and then adjusting the
speedo such that it matches the GPS.  Btw, I do have the correctly sized
and load rated tires.

Thanks,
Mike
