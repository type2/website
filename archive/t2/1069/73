Subject: Re: Fuel tank sealing

Hey all,

I received no response on this, so I wasn't sure if people were tired of the
fuel tank thread overall or if it was never received. I'm leaning towards a
motorcycle sealer, even though I didn't have a problem with the POR one 10
years ago. I'm just disappointed I'm doing it again, so I thought I would
try a different route.

Thoughts appreciated

Ned
