Subject: Small Town USA, where are they?

My wife and I always head off from Vancouver Island here, and drive the
backroads throughout Washington and Oregon and Idaho. We are always on the
hunt for the little Mom and Pop towns in the PNW that are out there. Some
great places we've been to include Odessa Wa. and Fossil Or. We look for the
little local cafes and local history. Wallace Idaho was cool too, but more
touristy; about as much as we like.
So the Friday question is: Where are those little quaint towns from "Back to
the Future" :-) where by God, you might not even lock your door?
