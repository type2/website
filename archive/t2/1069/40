I  followed the really good advice from the group, tightening the plug  
carefully after cleaning the threads.  I did NOT try a tap or  
heli-coils, since the tap set is at my x's and I'd have to buy  another.

Last Sunday, after 300 miles, it shot out a plug again.   Looking 
closely, I see the plug is working out, not stripped.  Likely  this means 
WORN threads but not stripped -- at least not quite  yet.

I'd appreciate quite advice on tap sizes I need ("Horrible  Freight" most 
likely as money is tight) and the size of the Heli-Coil kit.  

I need to move the bus this weekend and would like to travel in a  week. 

Many thanks,

BEN

hello ben  most auto parts sell a plug repair kit that can be put in  with 
motor in place. heli coil is kinda hard as you need to reach in and break  the 
tang off after getting it in place which is hard to see or do with the motor  
in bus. I normally put some grease on the tap when tapping and crank the motor  
over before installing the plug  later  mark  d
