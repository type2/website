Thanks, Michael,

The reason I ask is two fold: First, I have some rust in there but it seems
to be surface rust mostly. I am literally on the ocean, so I do get
affected. Second, I was looking through Richard Atwells respray photos (
http://homepage.mac.com/ratwell/78_Westy/PhotoAlbum53.html) and noticed his
had been blasted. Maybe he can give us his thoughts? I'm not that worried
about how perfect it looks in there, as long as it is the same color and no
major drips.

Is the MasterSeries similar to POR-15? Any thoughts on quality difference?
I've use plenty of the POR (and waited plenty of days for it to
exfoliate....)
