Subject: Brake Booster

Hey guys,

     I know I had asked about a new brake boster before, and it was recommended to me that I get mine rebuilt. But I thought I'd ask this part of my original question again. Does anyone know if the brake booster that's currently sold on the VW Transporter in Brazil, will work in our Busses? Maybe even the entire braking system? I'm just curious because I'd really like to get brand new parts if possible and it seems to me that if they've made any improvements to the braking components on the new Busses, someone should offer it as a kit. 


Thanks!!!

Todd
