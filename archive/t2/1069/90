	{with pic of cycle.  I can't help wondering whether the 
machine just auctioned is actually Munro's as alleged on TV, rather 
than Meikle's.  They were very similar.  Some even claim Meikle was 
'the brains behind Munro'.   Munro's was the world's fastest 
Velocette  -  135 mph.
	Also I doubt the asserted 'world record' by the fabulous 
Munro Indian special. -  RM}

	The 1936 Duncan Meikle Velocette, marketed by Webb's 
auctioneers as a piece of history, went for more than twice the 
$35,000 it was expected to fetch.
	Auckland businessman Kevin Harvey said he was not sure how 
much higher he would have been prepared to go in his quest to ensure 
the bike stayed in New Zealand.
	The life of Munro was "just such a fantastic story" and "it's 
a beautiful bike", he said.
	He intended to put the motorcycle somewhere on permanent 
display in Auckland's Parnell Village.
	Tim Hanna, author of 'One Good Run - The Legend of Burt 
Munro', told Radio New Zealand he was taken aback by the amount the 
motorcycle fetched
	"It just goes to show that Burt has made iconagraphic status 
in this country, he's right up there," he said.
	"There's quite a bit of Burt memorabilia around the 
countryside, it'll be interesting to see if it comes out of the 
woodwork now."
	Munro's story was told in the movie, The World's Fastest 
Indian, in 2005.
	Munro was famous for setting an under-1000cc world record of 
183.586mph (295.453km/h), at Bonneville salt flats, Utah, in August 
1967.
	The record still stands.
	Munro was 68 and was riding a 47-year-old machine when he set 
his last record.
	He died in 1978 at the age of 79.
