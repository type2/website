Subject: At what ....speed?

Permit me to clarifyI have no doubt that excess velocity can be 
attained, but the owners manual for a 72 specd the top speed at 75 mph,
and personal experience has demonstrated that at >80 mph you are no 
longer really steering itwitness the downhill side of the 241 toll road 
in Orange Co. CA.

As an aside, I have been driving VW buses for 45 years...I'm still on my 
second one!
