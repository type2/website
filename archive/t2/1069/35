Subject: Whistling Wings, Nojoqui Park

Found a fix for my whistling wing windows. A 3/16 inch wide x 5/64 thick 
rubber strip glued into the vertical seal between the 2 ridges. The strip 
stands slightly higher  and makes tight contact with the glass where the 2 
ridges did not.

As for the meet at Nojoqui Park, plenty of buses, splits, bays and vanagons 
as well as bugs, squares, notches, ghias, even a thing or two. The best bus 
was the 59 shorty. Of course mine showed pretty well too. The weather was 
great, California sunshine at its best.

One of the bugs at the meet had a unique ignition system. A 36-1 toothed 
wheel was attached to the inner side of the pulley, a sensor mounted above 
that fed into what I believe was a V3.0 microsquirt controller which was 
firing a Fxxd distributorless ignition system. The dizzy was simply in place 
to plug the hole. See a diagram here:
