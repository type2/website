Oh I mean the A1 and A2 FWD years BTW, I'm a bit dated as I don't care for any
VW built since 1993 or so, my Corrado was the last new VW I'll ever own.  Now
the autobox that the Corrado and the Passat introduced and is perhaps still
current? is an entirely different can of worms and was largely worthless for a
very long time, actually was a major step back in reliability, though it was
of course computer controlled and a 4 speed finally.

The late bus tranny was used largely unchanged (tranny section that is)
throughout all the FWD water cooled years and all the vanagon years, with
