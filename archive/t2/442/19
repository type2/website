Subject: BA-6 Heater Parts Wanted

So my quest for a BA- 6 is well under way. I have been fortunate enough to
locate the bulk of the components from another listee in BC. I am in need
of a few other parts to complete my system. I also am looking for a listing
of part numbers so I can at least try to get some stuff from my dealer. The
links in the type 2 library to Ron Van Ness's parts data base are dead, as
are few other links in that area of the library. So Below is what I am
looking for. If anyone has any of this stuff or knows part numbers for it
let me know.

Front ducting leading from the heater itself to the existing ducts in the
front.
Air circulation blower with trapdoor to cabin
Rear ducting to run from existing heat tube to intake of air circulation
blower
Good Belly pan but only if it's local (Northern VA/ DC area) I'll make one
over shipping that beast.

P.S. I still am looking for a good rear table leg with the bracket that
screws into the bottom of the table for my 78.
