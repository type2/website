Subject: RE: [T2] Question about normal running oil temperature

Jhon:

All the tin is there. The thermostat system is missing but that doesn't
bother me at all.

Where should I mount it?. Some sources sell an electric sender that's
installed in the head, it measures engine temp rather than oil temp.
Any suggestion?
