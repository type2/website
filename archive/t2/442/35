Jhon:

Well, here we have a tropical weather, and temperatures aren't greater than
35:C (95:F) year round (some places higher and some lower). I understand the
importance of the thermostat but to tell you the truth, its better if it
doesn't have it.

If the thermostat system is missing the engine will run all kind of crazy
hot/cold, and it must be installed.
