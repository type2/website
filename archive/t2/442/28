Subject: RE: [T2] Question about normal running oil temperature

No yet anywhere.  I installed an adapter just were the light pressure switch
is in order to install a mini pressure gauge and still have a port left to
install a temperature sender which I will do so very soon.  I4m justlooking
for the normal readings.
