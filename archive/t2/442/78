Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line hose clamps

Mike,

I like these, but I also like the originals.  I have used the worm gear 
type clamps on fuel hose and the serations in the gear parts actually 
"eats" thru the hose. 

I can't decide whether the ones you show actually have a "smooth" inside 
or not...please let us know when/if you get some.

The ones here

would actually be what I prefer since I can't see all i want on the 
others.  How do you order and how much are they?

Cheers, dave
