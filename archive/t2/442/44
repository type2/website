Subject: Re: [T2] Question about normal running oil temperature

I was one of those that automatically removed the flaps and thermostat from
my type 1  engines. That was up until I did some reading on Berg's website,
not to mention the type 2 list, about the role of the flaps in ducting the
correct amounts of air to the correct spots in the hot engine. I won't be
removing any more flaps. Why do we all think we know better than the VW
engineers that thoroughly researched the cooling in our buses?
 The thermostat is more optional than the flaps are. An old thermostat can
fail in the open or closed position (I've seen both). Some of the new
thermostats seem to be a shadow of the original quality, like many other
parts that are available nowadays.

<O-kay...  What John is trying to say is that the flaps "force"
(well, not really force so much as encourage) a certain percentage
of air to go through the oil cooler under all conditions when the
flaps are "open".  Without the flaps, the air is "more inclined"
to take a route of less resistance, which is through the heads.
Thus, an engine (talking type IV here) with no flaps is likely to
overheat at idle, all other issues aside.  Note that this will be
more of a problem, not less, in perpetually warm climates.>
