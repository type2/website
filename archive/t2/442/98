Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Farenheit to Celsius conversion

Just remember the Bob and Doug McKenzie all-purpose metric conversion
formular:  double it and add 30.  5 degrees Celsius = 5+5+30 = 40 degrees
Farenheit.  50 kilometers = 50+50+30 = 130 miles.  6-pack of beer = 6+6+30 =
42 metric beers.


hmm looks like Bob and Doug were already hitting the beer! 50 miles should
equal 130 kms, not the other way around otherwise that 5k road race would
really suck.
