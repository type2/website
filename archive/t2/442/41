Subject: seats and stuff

Hey Happy People

Just got the isolator and battery installed (round of applause)
although I had the shop do it (round of low hissing)

lol

Anyway I am looking at picking up some new seats. The front seats
in my 78 van are pretty worn out. What are the odds that the newer
buses (80-90's) use the same seats?  Where might be the best place
in Canada to find them.  Also curious about the back folding seat.. or
should I simply rebuild that one?

Words of advice.. (Im expecting to hear that it's cheaper to rebuild the
current ones and if it's true it would be nice to know)

anything?

Thanks !!

James
