this may cause some of your problems, the solid/hyd pushrods are made of
different material and may expand at a different rate,  swap in "REAL" hyd
pushrods

my understanding is that yes there is a difference and it has to do with
the ramp up on the different cams, but I also understand that brand new
lifters will not damage a cam only used ones will because they have
already been "Shaped" and work hardened from use.

get correct hyd pushrods and try again, I am a strong believer in hyd
lifters so if you really want em I would try to get em to work.
