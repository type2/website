Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line hose clamps

I feel that clamps should be used at the backup and not the sole holding
device.  If your hose is the right size then it should fit snugly as is.
This being said I personally have been happy with standard #4 type clamps.
The secret is to not over tighten and safety wire when possible /
necessary.

Best regards,
Shawn.
