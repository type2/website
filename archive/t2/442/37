Subject: Re: [T2] Question about normal running oil temperature

He did not say he was missing the thermostat, he said he was missing the
thermostat and mechanism. To me that means the flaps are missing, and the
engine WILL run very hot without that item. You folks can believe what you
want, but I am telling you the way it is, and will not discuss this subject
any further. The flaps MUST BE THERE or the engine will overheat.

I've been doing this for years, and do not have time to educate your
ignorance. I'm not trying to be a prick. If you want to educate yourselves
on this, the information IS OUT THERE, I just do not have time to teach you.

There are tons of guys running engines without the flaps that would drop the
engine/oil temps 50 degrees if they would put the flaps back in (that they
removed).
