O-kay...  What John is trying to say is that the flaps "force"  
(well, not really force so much as encourage) a certain percentage 
of air to go through the oil cooler under all conditions when the 
flaps are "open".  Without the flaps, the air is "more inclined" 
to take a route of less resistance, which is through the heads.  
Thus, an engine (talking type IV here) with no flaps is likely to 
overheat at idle, all other issues aside.  Note that this will be 
more of a problem, not less, in perpetually warm climates.

At higher airflow rates, the problem is less clearcut.  I don't 
think anyone here (even John, but correct me if I'm wrong) has 
performed an analysis that includes measuring airflow through the 
cooler with and without the flaps.  I know I haven't.  But I 
suspect that at high RPMs plenty of air will still find its way 
through the cooler.  As proof I submit my observations of oil 
temperature that were taken both with and without flaps installed 
in the engine.  Not much difference observed on the freeway.  I 
wouldn't let it idle like that for very long though.  My engine 
has flaps, thankyouverymuch.

One final note - "cold" is relative.  A 120 degree engine is 
cold!  Yes, it's true.  At 120 degrees, oil will not lubricate 
well and rings will wear faster.  So the climate really is 
irrelevent because the engine will start "cold" whether you are in 
Miami or Nova Scotia.  It still takes time to get up to operating 
temperature and faster (i.e. with working thermostat) is better.
