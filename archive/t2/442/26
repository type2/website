Subject: Question about normal running oil temperature

Hi again:



Alter looking in several manuals, and so searched in a couple of mails in the
archives, can anyone tell me which is the normal  running oil temperature for
a type4 1.7lt engine ??.



Thanks and sorry if this is in the archive  and I didn4t look well.
