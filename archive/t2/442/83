Subject: Different diameter blue brake hose?

I'm trying to run new blue brake hose from behind my seat to the reservoir on
the master cylinder in my '71.  Are there different diameter hoses?  The
length I have will NOT fit over the nipple.  The OD of the hose is as big as
the OD of the nip.  Do I just have to reaalllyy squeeze it on there, or am I
going to break something?  What is the diameter I need?

Have a good one,
Eric
