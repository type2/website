mike,

germansupply.com will have FI hose clamps on our site by next week. i
believe the ones we have found are the best thing available for the job.
they have excellent clamping ability, corrosion resistance, and they do not
damage the fuel line.

here is a photo of the clamps installed:

the only drawback to these clamps is that they can only be used once - they
must be cut to be removed.

i am sorry i cannot send you a  germansupply.com link at the moment, but if
you can wait until next week we will have these excellent clamps on our
site. i am not sure of the price yet, but it will be competitive.

by the same token, the original clamps are excellent. it is a wonder why
people toss them, they don't usually wear out. they do get old and nasty
looking, but shiny new worm drive clamps with perforated bands will not work
better than the crusty old originals, which are a superior design.
