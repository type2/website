Mike,
The clamp pictured look to be an over cranked stainless aircraft type
clamp.
They work fine if you buy the good one's.
This looks like an example of a cheapo which likely would fail.

Some folks prefer spring clamps, some prefer aircraft type clamps.

Make you own decision on this and go with it--


Later,

Terry

does anyone have a good recommendation for hose clamps for fuel lines. I
was looking at Richard Atwell's site and he said not to use this kind:

and that's what I'm using now. Is there another better type to use?
Thanks,
Mike
