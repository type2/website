Subject: RE: Sliding Windows

Yep! They sure do! I installed a set of sliding windows on my 1973 VW
Transporter. I actually got a used set from www.BustedBus.com hahah.. I get
a kick out of that name every time I say it. They sell used Bus parts (as
the name would suggest obviously). The thing is, my Bus originally came with
THREE of those VENT Windows. Only one of them was in REALLY good shape. One
other one was just BARELY re-usable, and the third one I had was completely
rotted out... there was no chance in hell I was going to use it. Turns out,
I got a set of used ones, each one costing $75 dollars. I then paid about
$20 dollars per gasket per side for a total cost of $125 + $40 = $165.
 
I'm really happy with them, they were a little dirty, but still in good
shape. I just read that the Bus Depot sells them brand new, I didn't even
know you could GET them anymore ( www.BusDepot.com <http://www.BusDepot.com>
). Anyway.. if you can spare the cash, the new ones might be the way to go
(seems like a good deal). The inner seal and the plastic clips often go
bad.. so getting a used one, that's something you'd still have to worry
about.
