Subject: Re: [T2] Question about normal running oil temperature

on the flaps that i put on the t4 motor i just installed was a microswitch
that was hooked to nothing on the bus i took it out of and it is operated
by the flap rod.  what is this switch for.  i was thinking of hooking it up
so that i would have a light on the dash when the flaps are in the shut
position so i can tell exactly when they open and consequently know if the
thermostat fails.  any input from you great vw gurus would be awsome.
