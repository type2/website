Where can I find this thing?  It's apparently under teh car somewhere...hm, I've looked in the Bently's and I think I might've found it but I'm not sure.  And how do I know if I need to replace it?  And also the only method for replacing it I've found is pulling the whole engine/tranny out.  Is there another way?  Please let it be easier than that....
