Subject: signet tires???

HI,

Yes, ANOTHER tire thread!

Anyone have any experience with these? They are 8 ply, load rating D, 185/14 
Reinforced truck tires.

My local tire guy has em for $77 a pop installed, and I think I am going to 
give them a try. Supposedly they have some specific tread that will cut down 
on the amount of road noise at highway speeds. Sounds funky.
