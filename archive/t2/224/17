Subject: Oil on bottom of engine

I have a question concerning oil on the bottom of my engine:

last year, oil was spouting out of my engine when it ran.  after dropping it out, and taking it to a VW mechanic, he replaced the lifter tubes, and did a valve job on it.  I put it back in, and all was fine.  However, lately I have noticed oil on the bottom of the engine, almost like condensation....it doesn't gush out, or drip out when the engine runs, and I never see it drip, but putting a piece of cardboard under the engine shows that over a few days (about 4), there are about 4-5 drips.  I have checked, and it honestly doesn't look like any particular place on the motor, just the whole underneath!  What gives?
