Subject: heater smells

so I'm wondering what stock VW heat is SUPPOSED to smell like...! '71
camper, bone stock.

I've hunted and searched, plugged holes, made sure all my tin is there,
hoses hooked up correctly, etc. etc., and still the damn heat smells fumy
to me and gives me headaches (I think...). 

Before losing any more brain cells, I'd like to figure out whether this is
"normal". The heat pumps out tons of hot air - enough to warm everything
on a cold rainy day, but it also makes my eyes ache and my head spin.
Unless it's all coincidence... I haven't taken in a CO tester yet...

Anywhere else to look? All the muffler joints and heater boxes are solid
and secure. 

thanks!
