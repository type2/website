Sorry guys and gals... :^)

I picked mine up from a place in Sacramento, California called Auto Parts 
Headquarters.  It is an All Pro supply warehouse franchise.  You can walk 
into the retail store that is parked next to the warehouse.  I believe it is 
a Dorman product.  Please let us know if someone else carries it, and it is 
available for order online.  Thanks!
