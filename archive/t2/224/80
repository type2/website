Subject: Re: [T2] Compression test

On your first method, if you add either the AFM *or* the double relay to
the list of items to unplug , then the pump will not run.
------------------
Checking the compression is a no brainer. Just crank the engine with all
the plugs out.
The fuel is only going to go down into the cylinders.
