Yes. No double relay, no pump action.

Disconnecting the AFM won't disable the pump during start. Contacts in the 
AFM hold the pump on in the run mode.

The double relay is wired to the battery and to pin 30 on the starter. The 
pump should (I haven't tested it) run if the remote starter switch stitches 
starter pin 50 to starter pin 30. No key needed.
