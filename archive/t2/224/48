Casey (and everyone),

As of last night Nikki's bus was running fine and she was going to leave
El Paso headed for Arizona this morning.  I have not heard from her today,
but as of last night all was well. She bought a new 009 and installed it
with the help of Leo Escandon.  My profound thanks and three cheers for
Leo!!!!
