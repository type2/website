If you have a 74 and a 77 you've already got a Type IV. You might want to
boost it up to 1970 cc with new Crank, Jugs and pistons, using your old
heads.
Your 74 could have  AW engin prefix and 1800 cc.
Your 77 could have GD engine prefix and 2000 cc.
The cases are basically the same.
Get a copy of Tom Wilsons book, How To Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-Cooled
Engine.
Don't get the shaft on E-bay they are only about 14$ on Amazon and
sometimes they pay delivery.
Full retail is only $17.95
