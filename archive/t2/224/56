there was one episode of Bean where he had one key on a long string which
opened the front bonnet. inside the front bonnet was a key that opened
the rear boot. inside the rear boot was a little pouch with a key that
started the car. i think he locked up the car and then the key on the
string fell into a sewer grate and when he pulled on it to get it out,
the string snapped, LMAO! he also had one of those sliding latches on the
door where you put a padlock on it... i love rowan atkinson. too bad
black adder never had an automobile.
