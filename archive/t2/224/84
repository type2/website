Pretty good! But it would be better to put a "kill switch" in there. You can
push start a low compression four cylinder engine and bypass the starter
altogether. You need to interrupt the ignition wire, not the starter switch.
There is a way of putting in a switch that feeds the primary side of the
coil.. both positions on the switch are "hot", but one (the kill side) has a
thermistor in series. Thermistors open when they get hot, and they get hot
when current flows through them. So, shortly after starting up your bus and
driving away, the thief suddenly has to deal with a car that has stalled on
him and can't be restarted or made to run more than a hundred feet or so.
It's not a matter of it won't start.. it won't run, or it won't stay
running. You could put your kill switch almost anywhere on that bus, and
there's a lot of space to search. I think that the hot tip is that you are
not going to want to make it so inconvenient to yourself, or so obvious to
others, that you will fail to use the feature regularly, or that people will
see what you are doing and second guess you. Thermistors are cheap little
components that can be gotten at any Radio Shack, as can the switch. When
you want to disable this feature, a butt splice is all you need. No need
even to cut the original harness.. You could run your own ignition wire. Jan
