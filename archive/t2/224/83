Jan and all the rest of you 5 speed wannabes...

 Listee Mike Gensler plopped a 5 speed Porsche tranny in his bus when he
planted a 2.0l 914 Porsche engine in it.

 Took some bodgering, but the end result was fascinating. Bugger can
cruise at 80 mph without breathing hard, I know, he let me drive it,
shift into 5th and watch the rpms drop. He fiddled with the gear ratios,
seemingly endless with the Porsche tranny, but it works.

 He had a humorous encounter with a New Mexico cop who pulled him out of
an 80 mph pack of vehicles because the deputy just couldn't figure out
how a Bus could be keeping up. No ticket, just questions.

   It can be done.
