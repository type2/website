Air horns... Ah, yes. I have air horns. The previous
owner had a strange sense of humor, which I inherited
when I fixed them. I have two, directly above the
driver's seat attached to the fiberglass roof. I have
the miniature air-compressor configuration. A few
words of warning: Try to get an air compressor large
enough to honk both of them. Mine is too small to run
both horns as a minor triad. It is only large enough
to run the smaller of the two horns. Unfortunately, I
do not know what power my compressor is in terms of
PSI. It is strapped to the underside of the fiberglass
with a metal strip. As far as the horn in the back is
concerned: Do what I'm doing. Put an OOGA horn from
autozone in the engine compartment, under the spare
tire well. If you want to see what my horns look like
(it sounds so dirty) ummmmmmm...
