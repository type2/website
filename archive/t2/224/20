Might be a slightly leaking flywheel seal.
4-5 drops in 4 days is not bad!

after dropping it out, and taking it to a VW mechanic, 
he replaced the lifter tubes, and did a valve job on it.  
I put it back in, and all was fine.  
However, lately I have noticed oil on the bottom of the engine, 
almost like condensation....it doesn't gush out, 
or drip out when the engine runs, and I never see it drip, 
but putting a piece of cardboard under the engine shows 
that over a few days (about 4), there are about 4-5 drips.  
I have checked, and it honestly doesn't look like 
any particular place on the motor, just the whole underneath!  What gives?
