I have one but rarely use it.  In case of an engine fire I want to be able 
to get in there quickly (I know, I know once it's going I shouldn't open it).

Great idea!  Very stealthy - I bet they would never find that.

One more I really like - install a one-way valve in the front brake line up 
underneath the fender.  When it's set, the bus will drive normally until 
the thief steps on the brakes, and then... the bus is gonna stay put, 
probably in the middle of the street.  They sell these things in the back 
of hotrod magazines, at least they used to.
