Bentleys or haynes and follow the step by step procedures for aligning 
the shift mechanism.  The guide on the pax side is part of the box, the 
one on the drivers side is a rubber piece held on by screws or pins.  
They tell you how to measure the distance from side to side at which 
position of the stick. and how to create a gauge to measure with.   The 
link that i gave you on my tech site shows the parts breakout.
