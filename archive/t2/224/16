Subject: Re: [T2] 70 Trans - a bit wordy sorry 

To all those who responded to my post, THANK YOU.

It turned out that the Trans was shot, broken teeth, lots of metal, etc.
When it was out, it wouldn't even turn.
My FLARS put a used one in for me. He also replaced my nearly missing shift
coupler.
When he had the motor out, he found 2 other problems. Which caused which, I
don't know.
My release bearing was hanging and the clips were broken.
Also the ring on the pressure plate had disentigrated.

I got her home today, and WOW, what a difference. The shift pattern is so
much smaller.
I don't even hit the brake lever when going into 3rd.

I am pretty sure that I could have done the work myself, but time was of the
essence.
(I dropped her off around 2p on Mon. Got a call all was ready at 930a on
Tues)
Cost played a part also. I spent far less for the used trans than a rebuilt,
however, I
only get a 30 day warranty.

Thanks again for those who answered. This list is a huge asset to me and Ma
Cherie'.(aka- The Other Woman)
Later,
