Nope!

   being carefull you can find quality parts and you can get a pretty
decent rebuild and when your done you can have what is probably a better
than new engine because you can and maybe will do things that the VW
assembly line couldn't/wouldn't/hadn't discovered yet.

for example, you can clean the intake ports, or hone the oil pump, or
balance the engines moving  parts closer than they did. etc
