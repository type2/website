Also:

cooler adapter

two-piece doghouse duct

71-only front tin with hole for doghouse duct (possible to use bug tin
by extending perimeter with sheet metal to fit bus opening like VW did)

Hoover bit to seal bottom of oil cooler.

4 donut seals for oil cooler

rubber seals for doghouse duct.

And probably a few things that I have forgotten.

I got mine at the wrecker.  I prefer used OEM tin to new aftermarket tin,
even if I have to braze up a few cracks.  The tin involved in this swap
probably won't need any repair, though.  The Hoover bit might be hard to
find, but can be fabricated (see the archives)

IIRC, Ronnie at Old Volks Home recommends a type III tight fin cooler, but
I've no idea where to get 'em.
