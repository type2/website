Subject: Re: [T2] setting off car alarms

as far as being fatal....
I don't think os,
BUT... I have heard 2 schools of thought on it.
(if any bus gurrus could tell me the truth I would much aprecheat it)

1) the guy that bought whtat used to be the VW shop in town (his a dick)
    says "better fix that exhaust son, or you'll burn your heads up.."

2) every VW fanatic I'v ever seen face to face sayes
     "wow your bus sonds great,... loud.. but great"
    (and never a word about cooked heads)

    I have had a LOUD bus sence I got her in '98, (about 60,000 mi ago) and
now I'v finnaly graduated, and got a job (50 miles away, so I drive atleast
100 mi a day in my bus) so I can finnaly make my wife and mom happy by
getting a new exhaoust system: muffler.

all my leaks are at the joints (where the flanges meet) they all join like
() instead of flush...

so take that as  you will....

Mike,
'78 Bus: with loud leaky exhaust. :)
