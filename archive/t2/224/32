Subject: Air Horn?

is it possible to hook up an air horn? if so... HOW? (someone gave me one
a long time ago, but i have no idea how to hook it up)

wavin' and wishin' i could honk at that lady that tried to back into me
repeatedly today,
chris, the muted one

(in case anyone was curious... i was behind this lady in a covered
parking lot. she was stopped, so i stopped. then she proceeded to back
up. i couldnt honk, so i revved my engine... luckily, i didnt see anyone
behind me, so i started to back up... she stopped for a moment... then
started to back up AGAIN! i was yelling at her, and trying to back up
without hitting anything (it was dark, so it was hard to see behind me)
and she KEPT BACKING UP! finally, she stopped long enough for me to back
away from her and i drove past her on the right side... she was in the
dead center of the driving area... not sure why she kept backing up... i
didnt see anyone leaving a parking space)
