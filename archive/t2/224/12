Subject: westy top rattling at high speeds

Hey everyone,

My top rattles at very high speeds (50-55 plus depending on wind)...we can 
stop it by rolling up the front windows all the way so it's caused by the 
top catching the airflow and wanting to take off.

I only have three of the 6 bolts for the front of the top and I havne't had 
luck matching the bolts that go into the lock nuts, I guess maybe I need to 
pull the lock nuts out and find some bolts that would work....

but the rattling come from the back and I really doubt if that will help.

My top doesn't match up with the luggage rack and never has.

Has someone else dealt with this sucessfully?

Thanks in advance,
Daniel
