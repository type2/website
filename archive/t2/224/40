VW did not help anyone with this one.

in 1970/1 VW introduced a new larger sedan/wagen/fastback and it was
called the 411 later 412 this was the new TYPE IV and it had a totally
redesigned engine in it.  this engine (at least in the USA) was also fuel
injected and it really was a nice car (my wife had a 1974, 412 wagen)
  alas the car did not do well and it was dropped after the 74 model
year. However VW did not waste the development cost of the engine since it
was used with very little modification in the Bus (type II) and in the 914
Porsche.    in the sedan the 411 was a 1700 and the 412 an 1800 cc these
engines also showed up in the bus.   a later version was the 2liter engine
and in 1978 it reached the highest state and remained essentially
unchanged until the end of air cooled production in 1983.

so the type I is a Beetle
       type II is a bus (all years even todays Eurovan)
       type III was a "Variant" the larger VW
       type IV was a 411/412

 the engines in a bus were a modified type I (beetle engine) and the Type
IV (411/412) engine.  
 
 and then just to add insult to injury the models are sometimes called a
type 1 (Splity) type 2 (bay) type 3 (Vanagon) type 4 (Eurovan)

see isn't that simple  welcome to the world of VW......;8*Q
