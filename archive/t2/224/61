Subject: Re: [T2] Keeping a bus from being stolen

A bus parked for maintenance at one of my favorite shops had padlocks on 
every door and hatch.

My personal way is to wire in a second ignition switch that isnt so easy 
to hot wire with a keyed lockout for either fuel pump or coil.
The switches on all buses and vanagons up to about 92 come under the 
heading of "beginner auto theft"  if you defeat the steering wheel 
lock.  buses prior to steering wheel lock come under "auto theft for 
dummies"   I was looking at how to wire the westy today and decided i am 
going to use the method we used in the military.  a loop of chain 
through the steering wheel.  The casual thief doesnt usually carry heavy 
tools with them.
