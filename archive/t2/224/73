The tubes will never rust out. They are non-magnetic stainless steel. As are
the afterburner U pipes.
Yes, the flanges themselves will rust away.
Biggest problem with the tubes is vibration from lack of support. Heat makes
the tubes very brittle and a shoke will crack them. Usually always the right
side, just past #2 joint.
