Subject: Keeping a bus from being stolen

I was wondering what do you guys do to keep your busses from being stolen?  I was thinking of making it use a push button starter that could be hidden in the bus somewhere, like behind the seat, or something of that nature.

Also a kill switch that will do something like shut off power to my distributor or something like that.  That would hide back in the closet, and I would only use it if I was parking my bus somewhere for a while, or somewhere I didn't trust.

Any ideas, suggestions or criticisms?  I love my bus but I know old VWs get stolen a bit since they're easy to steal and a source of free parts.
