Would you mind sharing what the old and new jet sizes were?  There is a=20

because I'm talking to a Doktor.  :)

400lbs of gear?  Your idea of "roughing it" must be different than mine=20
(which is more along the lines of a 40-lb backpack).

Hopefully nobody runs their bus with 500lbs over the gross rating.  I did=20

close to exceeding it.
