Good idea.  Maybe put it under the car by the pump but hidden.

I'm a believer in getting a lock for your engine compartment (not foolproof
but good enough for kids).

How about this, a dummy ignition wire going from the coil to the distributor
with no conductor that looks normal.

Back when I had my fuel cutoff I would sometimes forget and it prevented me
from stealing my own bus!  I would recommend this except they will probably
damage something trying to start a bus they can't steal.

You would need to install a three way valve after the pump and hook into the
fuel return line so the fuel circulates, the pump lubricates, but the
pressure doesn't build up.  Just an idea.

Or, take the steering wheel a la Mr. Bean.
