Hi Greg,

I had some time to play with a spare dash pod yesterday, and decided to 
install a AA battery-powered clock into it. You can get a decent 1.5V AA 
quartz clock mechanism from the dollar store and I discovered that 
installing it into the dash pod was much easier than I thought it would 
be. It sure beats paying over $100 to get one from eBay.

I removed the backing plate, drilled a hole in the center and then 
installed the mechanism. The number plate was created using a scan of 
the speedometer, so the numbers are a perfect match.  I printed the 
clock face on my laser printer here at home, tomorrow at the office I 
will probably reprint the image onto card-stock using the $10K colour 
laser and re-install it.

A member of another list I'm on suggested running a remote power supply 
from the glove box to make battery changes a lot easier.

Happy trails,
