Chuck,

On your first method, if you add either the AFM *or* the double relay to
the list of items to unplug , then the pump will not run.

On a remote starter switch, since the bus should be switched off, and all
you are applying power to is the starter motor, the fuel pump (on FI
engines) won't run.
