Subject: Re: [T2] Keeping a bus from being stolen

i have a push button on the front of the driver seat (on the metal UNDER
the seat). it is next to a knob... i think it is the driver seat tilt
knob. but what if the theif isnt a complete moron? won't they think to
look for a button or switch when they can't get the car started? 

in newer (watercooled) cars, i have seen the stock push buttons used as
alarm switches and stuff. in my mom's 85 jetta, they had blanks that
looked like the wiper, headlight and other switches. they installed a car
alarm and made one of the blanks the switch for the alarm. actually, i
think it was just an LED that came on when you flip the switch so people
THOUGHT there was an alarm. there's a cheap idea... if you put an LED in
an obvious place, potential theives could be scared off...
