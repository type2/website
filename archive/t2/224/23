Subject: Re: [T2] setting off car alarms

don't get me wrong, i LOVE setting off car alarms, too. i have straight
pipes on my beetle and when i start her up in the covered parking lot at
the mall, i hear "chirps" from at least one or two nearby car alarms
warning me that they are there. well, i drive around the lot LOOKING for
that car and rev it up to make the damn thing go off *evil giggle*. once
i have successfully set off any alarms i heard chirp, i am satisfied and
go home. i mean REEEEALLY, people... why do you set an alarm on a car you
can't hear from inside the mall? no one cares when they hear an alarm
going off... most people are just annoyed by them and keep walking.
besides, if it is so extremely sensitive that it will go off by a car
driving by... they deserve what they get. 

but when the car is not supposed to sound like that, it worries me, and
that is why i asked what it might be. exhaust leak isnt fatal, right?
then if that is what it is, i wont worry about it too much... just get it
fixed in time. i just didnt want it to be a symptom of a bigger problem.
i did say it was backfiring because i knew you needed all symptoms to get
a better idea of what it might be.

not sure what shape the muffler is in, but this engine was just assembled
with new seals, so i wouldnt be suprised if it is the muffler. now, how
do i check these smog port plugs?

waving and scratchin my head,
chris, the girlie one
