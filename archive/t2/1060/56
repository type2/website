Subject: Oil leak, here are my thoughts - make sense ?

Ok, if I keep my oil down just above the bottom line on my dipstick and park my van relatively flat, it will put a few drops oil on the ground. If I park it pointing downhill on an average grade, it will drop a goodly bit of oil, enough to put a 6" circle on the blacktop. If I point it parking uphill on the same hill, it will not drop any oil. It is dropping it on the engine end of the pushrod tubes, not the head end, on the passenger side. My thought is that it is the pushrod tube closest to the front of the van, and pointing it downhill lets all the oil flow forward to this area where it pours out. Is there anywhere else that could be causing this leak with the info I've given above? I have washed the engine twice now, removed the tin and tried to peak up there with a flashlight, but it is not easy to find the source of the leak. Anyone like to jump in here?
Thanks,
Courtney
