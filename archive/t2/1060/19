Subject: Clunk sound coming from bottom of Steering Column in 71

I had the wife get in the bus and turn the steering wheel back and forth
with me under the bus sticking my finger in the area of the steering
coupling disc. The clunk sound is coming from above it. Can't really feel
where it is as the coupling disc comes close to taking off the finger while
she is turning it. Nothing looks loose but I get a clunk every time I back
out of the garage like I am engaging something at the bottom of the steering
column. Then you don't hear it much until next time you get back in the bus
and clunk (when you take off). 

 

Is there something in the steering column that could be broken? Looking at
the Bentley I don't see anything that could. 

 

Thanks Trey
