Subject: Clutch help?

I have a 69 bus. I've been stuck with this problem all day. I just rebuilt my
engine (spun baring, unknown pistons, long stupid story) and got it all in
today.Replaced the pressure plate since I was in there. She runs like a
champ sitting still but the clutch wont disengage. Ive watched the lever when
someone mashed the pedal up front and it doesn't move more than a inch. It
looks like the cable is stretching but I don't think that it can
do that. Nothing looks bent or anything and it was running fine before I
removed it. I would just put the old one back in but it is almost worn to
far down. Any ideas would be helpful.
