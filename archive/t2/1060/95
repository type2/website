Subject: '78 Intermittent Grinding sound when trying to start

Hello all,

It has been a while. I certainly hope this isn't too much of a newb question
but I have not found a specific answer to this.

We went to move the '78 bus from the old house to the new yesterday and
experienced a grinding sound when trying to start it. It doesn't do it every
time the key is turned. It did start and made the 20+ mile trip just fine.

I had Patty turn the key while I watched the engine and the best I can
describe it is that the flywheel and alternator looked like they were
"slipping" - there wasn't a continuous rotation when he key was turning.

When it started up there was no grinding nor was there the "slippage" I
observed.

I suspect that I'll be told it is the starter going bad but I was hoping to
confirm that with the experts.

Thanks,

Jeff & Patty
'78 "Melissa"
