Subject: Re: [T2] Oil leak, here are my thoughts - make sense ?

Mechanical fuel pump mount leaking?

Push rod tube have a split in it?

Push rod seals shot?

There is a little bolt on the side of the block on older engine blocks 
that relates to the oil pressure relief valve. It is on the side between 
the engine end of the pushrod tubes. Has a torx head.

Cylinder base gasket?

Have you crawled under it right after turning it off and watched the oil 
drip? Makes for a fine afternoon of fun... <griN!>

Seriously - the oil can travel before it drips off. You might look at 
the head-end of the push rod tube. Oil could be running down the tube to 
near the case from the top end of the tube.

All of my Type IV engines have required new pushrod seals sooner rather 
than later.
