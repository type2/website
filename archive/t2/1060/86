Subject: Message in Bosch reman catalogue re: starters and voltage???

Has anyone been able to access a Bosch catalogue to read this? I'm wondering what it's all about? Here is the quote from the online jobber website for the 77 type2 auto trans starter.

BEFORE installing this starter, refer to Application Notice #B-45 in the Bosch reman catalog regarding low system voltage on this application. 

Is this about installing a starter relay? Just wondering.
