Subject: Really Weird

I recently pulled the engine out of my 72 bus to check it out and do some
work. When I reinstalled the engine I put the timing to what the book said it
should be and I had little power, so I set it to 7.5 before tdc and presto it
seemed back to normal.
 
I normally have no reason to get past 3rd gear but I went to use 4th gear the
other night and something weird happened! The lights dimmed and there seemed
to be no or very little 4th gear. I think there are a couple of wires I still
have not hooked up but this has got me stumped.
 
I was going downhill at the time as I hold in the clutch and shift from 3rd to
4th the lights dim every time, brighten back up when I shift to 3rd with the
clutch held in.
 
Any ideas guys??? Thanks again as always
