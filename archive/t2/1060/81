Hi Joel,

You don't actually need a whole transmission, you just need the bell 
housing. Perhaps someone here has a spare; that wouldn't be anywhere 
near as expensive to ship as a whole transmission. Just make sure you 
get the 76-79 bell hosuing, or else your flywheel and starter won't fit.

But as Jamie Rivers said... you would be best advised to check and make 
sure your 79 bus is all '79.... 30 years later you'd be amazed at the 
changes that can happen to a bus....

Happy Trails,
