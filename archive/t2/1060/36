Subject: That was unexpected

 I got the "new" alt in the Guac this afternoon (thanks Dan!!) and noticed
something I wasn't expecting... It's peppier! No other changes were made
except the alternator.

Yay!

heh

What's surprising is that was a genuine Bosch reman that Troy had put in
there. I would have hoped it would have lasted longer.
