Subject: Rebuilt transmission for 1971 Westfalia - Prices - Quality -

I've been making some calls and checking web sites for a rebuilt 
transmission.  I've found one for $1300 exchange price and others for 
$600-$800.  The shipping price from the different companies has been 
almost the same so that's not a factor.  Warranties are all about the 
same; (of course you never know how that's going to work until you try 
to use it).  

Does anyone have a recommendation regarding the company from which you 
purchased a rebuilt transmission?

Thank you,
Pat
