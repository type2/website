did that and it reads lower, about 100 degrees.  I have also read in 
other places that it reads lower as well.  In addition, I am using the 
megasquirt with the temp sensor II located on the head and it also reads 
about 100 degrees lower.  Plus, the two temps are not consistent with 
each other... over the long term they'll stay pretty consistent, but 
they won't have the same response (the one under the plug responds faster).
