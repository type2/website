Sorry for the late reply...

I was right in the middle of a road-trip and I wanted to empty the tank 
right away, pull off the old fill valve and install the new one.  If I 
just left the burner on, it would have taken forever.  I was looking for 
the quickest way to get it done.

Having said that, I still have the tank sitting on the floor in the back 
of the bus because I didn't find anywhere open.  I did do a lot of 
surfing, though :)

Thanks!
Mike
