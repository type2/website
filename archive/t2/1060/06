Several problems with this. I no longer have a Type IV powered bus. It's 
Corvair powered. The last time I had the gauge setup on a Type IV engine 
it was in a Beetle with 911 replica cooling. I was getting ~350 degrees 
steady state. Didn't really matter what I did with the car - even towing 
another car at 55 mph - it read about 350 degrees. Did not have a temp 
gun to check temps back then and the car is apart for restoration now so 
I can't test it. This was with a 1994 era VDO temp gauge.

I might be able to try this on my friend's '78 Riviera. I'll have it for 
a few days to replace everything rubber and fuel system related in a few 
weeks. I could try to shoot temps on the sparkplug and then on the head 
bolt and a few other places around the engine. Engine can't be run now 
because it is losing a significant amount oil through oil cooler seal 
leaks, oil cooler leaks, oil filter leaks, or ??? All I have to go on is 
the puddle under the engine, have not crawled under it to see.
