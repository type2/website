Subject: Running hot- Improvement!

I got my injectors swapped out today and replaced all the hoses along the way,
just to be on the safe side. Also replaced the air filter while I was at it.
Took the bus out on my usual test route and "BEHOLD" ............. The CHT
gauge reads 30 degrees cooler!

Took a loop across town and back on I-40 doing 65 MPH. The gauge read about
360 (Just over 350). Outside temp was 36 degrees. Stopped several times after
that and took readings with the IR temp gun. After several readings here is
what I found:
1. Spark plug nuts run about 30 degrees hotter than the surrounding cylinder
head.
2. Cylinders 3 & 4 run within 4 degrees of each other, of course 3 is the
hotter cylinder. Averaged readings with IR gun are: #3-264 degrees & #4-260
degrees measured at the spark plug nut. #2 averaged 259 degrees and #1 was the
coolest at an average of 256.

These readings were taken after pulling into various parking lots, shutting
off the engine and taking a reading on all plugs in turn. Each time I would
stop, a different plug would be the first to be read as in:
First stop read     3-4-2-1.
second stop read 4-2-1-3
3rd stop read      2-1-3-4
4th stop read      1-3-4-2
I went through this rotation twice for a total of 8 stops.

Tomorrow I'll Adjust the valves and reset the C.O. level and see if I can get
any more improvement. I kind of doubt it will run any cooler but it is time to
check the valves anyway and considering that I tried to set the C.O. level
before I changed the injectors, I probably ought to do it again so I'm not
wasting fuel.
