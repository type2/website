Hi Bob,

In March 2007 I tracked it through the Buskatiers mailing list, and it 
was located in ABQ New Mexico, in the hands of Greg Mogle. His email 
address is(was) watchbus(-at-)swcp.com . My efforts to renew its movement 
were unsuccessful.

I have no idea where it is now. Perhaps someone could contact the other 
Greg and see where it went.

Happy Trails,
