Subject: Diesel Oil in T2

Ok, based on some previous discussions, I'm considering switching over to diesel-engine oil on the assumption that it has more of the additives that AC engines need (zinc, etc).

I considered synthetics, but I drive so little that I change oil every six months, usually at mileage much less than 3000. I suspect that I would not get my money's worth out of a synthetic if I change it every 1000 miles or so.

Anyone have experience withj diesel-engine oil in a bus? Any issues or recommended brands? I use 20W50 now...I assume I should stick with that weight. 

Thanks,

Rick
