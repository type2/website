Subject: Re: fan shroud

Karl, thank you for stepping up.

Dan Bessen has offered one to me, and Dan is local (10 miles) to my house.
A little easier to hand off a bulky item like the fan shroud.

I also wanted to resurrect some local VW bus people in the Northern Virginia
area.  I am encouraged that Dan contacted me.  We need to be a bit closer
than we are . . .

Remember H Steven Dolan, and Maui Haui, and Avocado Tom, and Marcus Schaper,
and Bob (Accessys) R, and John Anderson, and Jack Dinan, and Patrick Flynn,
and Rob Dunn, and Chris Chubb (the first part of the Charlie Ford story)
and Sharon Simpson, and Monk Flemming, [of course Mark Dearing, not because
he is local, but because he is omnipresent  ;-)  ].

And we lost Andrew Stevens to Vietnam (work related - ) and Ray Nemo to
Arizona ,and Carlos Castro to Iraq (Army EOD team lead - a successful
de-fuse of a road bomb is not when you walk away and count your fingers and
see that you have the same number you started with, but when you count your
team members - with the same results) and back home again in Texas,

Now we have Chef_Alvin (Alvin Furtner), Craig Kirwin (and brother?), Nate
Wageley,

Some are farther away now, but If we don't keep the contacts alive today, we
will all suffer in the future.

Also, my thanks to Chris, Bob, and Mike Bentin coming forward.  As they
always do.

So, I have the fan shroud on the way. . . .

And the tail light housings I ordered from Bus Depot on late last Saturday
should be at my doorstep when I get home tonight (Tuesday).  I am moving
forward!!!
