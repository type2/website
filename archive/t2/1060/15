Subject: Re: [T2] Can you spy the bus

Pretty cool to have your bus on TV whether its chopped or not.  Kudo's  
to you man!  I was in an episode of Discovery's "Survivorman" a few  
years ago and it flattered the hell out of me and my buddies.  They  
showed the episode 100 times and Les Stroud, The Survivorman labeled  
his week in the south Georgia swamp in the top three adventures he  
took on.  It made my family and buddies feel better than it did me,  
and that made me feel best.

So...drive that bus with pride but drive it slow and carefully.
