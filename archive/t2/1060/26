Subject: Seeking Alternator Adjustment cover

Hi,

I'm looking for the Plastic plug for the Alternator adjustment hole on
a Type IV engine part number 021 119 295. BusDepot is telling me its
NLA and German Supply shows it out of stock, couldn't find it on CIP1
or AirHead's site. Anyone know where I can find one or have a few to
spare?

Thanks
Jules
