Well, whether it's the real temp or not, it is the agreed place to take 
the temp reading.  That's the tough part - is it really the true temp?  
Anyplace you take a temperature reading is going to be relative to the 
actual temp inside the combustion chamber, which is what you really need 
to know.

That being said, the real way to figure things out is to get an EGT 
sensor and monitor the exhaust temps.  I've been speaking to many people 
and 1150F is about the hottest you want to go and at 1250 the aluminum 
starts to deform.  I will probably get an EGT sensor as I've also read 
that the CHT won't always let you know that you're killing your heads 
until it's too late.

Now, this also leads to the question of why the temps are going so 
high.  I am also running into high temps (420+) so I'm really trying to 
figure out what's  going on.  My heads are messed up due to my high 
temps so I'm changing them out with new ones from Raby Aircooled 
Technology.  However, that alone isn't going to fix anything.  Since 
I've started researching these heads, I've also started to do a lot of 
research in compression ratios.  I've never calculated the compression 
ratio of my engine when I put it together so I could in-fact be running 
a CR that is too high (I've killed two sets of heads so far).

One other test that I'm going to try next is to put higher octane fuel 
in the bus.  If it drops the temps, then I probably found one of the 
major culprits of my high CHTs.
