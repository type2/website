It's good to hear from a fellow 71 Westy owner.  There is a lot of info about
the various transmissions out there.  I will see if I can dig it up for you
and post the URLs.  Before I would ditch the tranny, however, I would really
check out the linkage and clutch and such.  My tranny wouldn't stay fourth and
would go into third all of a sudden and the problem was the pads were the
shift linkage meets up with the transmission.  I changed out the pads and the
problem was solved.  About two weeks later, a fellow club member had problems
with his transmission going into reverse and the problem was also the
linkage.

As for other transmissions, you will find that the 3-rib is geared a bit lower
in the upper gears than the 6-rib in the later models.  There are also some
differences in the way the transmissions line up with the motor and
specifically the starter at the bellhousing.  Here is a link on how I modified
a 6-rib from a donor 76 bus I have into my 71 Westy...

As for bug transmissions vs. bus transmissions, that's a good question I have
always wanted to know the answer to as well.  I do know that the bus
transmissions are heavily sought after and are suppose to be tougher and the
choice for buggies and especially rail jobs.  I am sure someone can chime in
with more expertise than I have.

Hope this helps and good luck,

Michael in Montevallo
