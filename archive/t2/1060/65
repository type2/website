Subject: Transmission differences

I'm having transmission problems with my 1971 Westfalia; it  won't stay 
in 1st gear.

While looking online for a rebuilt one I note that sometimes the 
transmissions are listed as:

Bus 68-71
or
Bus 71 (with Bus 68-70 being a separate category)

Mine is a 3 rib case and I do understand that a later year model 
introduced a 6 rib case.

Is there any info online which explains the differences in the 
air-cooled VW transmissions and if so, would someone help me to find 
that info?

Are any Beetle transmissions suitable for use in a 1971 Westfalia and if 
so, are any modifications needed?

Thanks,
Pat
