Subject: Re: [T2] broken tranny mount- options?

Joel
you can't really go by the year ....  you need to know that you have a 091
bellhousing, or an 002 .

a 79 should have a 091 ... but who knows at this point without looking

fortunatly, it says right on it !   but... you have to separate it from the
transaxle. the numbers on the front... or inside of the bellhousing

or you can check if you have a 228 mm clutch, and a SR87 starter
or you can measure the upper starter bolt boss on the trans .. 85mm
all of the above,, you have a 091 bellhousing.. and that is most likely what
you want to keep

if the starter bolt boss on the trans is 70mm.
you should have a SR15 starter ,,
and a 002 bellhousing.
