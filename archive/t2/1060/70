Subject: broken tranny mount- options? 

'79 9 passenger, manual trannny. 
It's a long story, but basically I broke one of the "ears" off the tranny where it mounts into the rear of the frame, where the motor attaches to it. 
Well, actually, not the whole "ear", just the top 1/3 of it, enough to allow the tranny to drop and the bolt that holds it up to slide through the slot in the top. Instead of looking like a zero, it looks like a "U". 
Got it? 
Ok, so other than this *small* problem, the tranny is in GREAT shape. I know I can just purchase another tranny, but I don't have an extra couple hundred bucks lying around. I also don't really want to buy a good tranny shell and replace the guts with my good tranny guts, because I've never rebuilt a tranny before and I'm not too sure of my skills. It's an option, but not my first. 
So what are my other options? Is the tranny made out of magnesium? Can it be welded? Can I build a support bracket for it? I just bought a welding setup from a friend, so i can put that to good use if I need to... 
I know that you can buy a baja tranny support kit for a bug tranny, but will that fit a bus? Might this work? 
ANY other ideas? 
Thanks,
