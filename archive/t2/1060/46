Subject: May have found the clunk sound (Euerka!) 

Yesterday, I jacked up the front end on stands again and had the wife turn
the steering wheel  looks to be that the noise is coming from the ball
joints on the drag link (resonating up the steering column to the cab). The
rear ball joint at the swing arm lever on the link is popping up and back
(about a = inch) and the front moves too. The Swing arm does not move up and
down  looks very solid.



Should these ball joints move like this? This might explain my steering
wheel not being level too. Are these ball joints the same as the other ones
on the front end? Might just be easier to buy a new drag link at bus depot
than to change them myself.
