>Chris, what kind of readings are you getting with your sensor under the
head stud nut?

In all previous discussions I have seen of head temps, every alternative
location for the sensor has produced cooler readings. The closest to the
spark plug reading was for the sensor glued into the base of a slot next
to the spark plug! ;)

This brings me to another suggestion for high CHT readings. I had
problems with the sensor sealing the spark plug caused by the sensor
ring going oval shaped and so letting hot exhaust gas get to the sensor.
This was evident by the blackening around the flat surface that the
spark plug seals against. I solved it by replacing the spark plug with
another that still had its sealing washer intact. This is easy to test
if you have a spare spark plug kicking around.
