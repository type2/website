Subject: Another Oil Question...

Search didn't turn up much on this...

I've always used 20W50 here in SOCAL, a mechanic I use suggested that a few years back.

The folks over on Samba seem to think that 10W30 is better, as it allows better flow.

The manual says 20W50 or single weights (not going there). 

Occassionaly I do a road trip and need to climb mountains on a warm day, but daily driving is more benign with OAT's never more than 90F or so.

I'm contemplating Brad Penn 10W30, if I can find out where to get some.

Thoughts?
