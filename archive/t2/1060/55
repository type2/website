Okay, I'll climb up into the garage loft tonight. If that doesn't pan 
out, I'll slide the bus over (not running) on a trolley jack and get up 
into the attic and look. I want this shroud to get a new home if it is 
still here. Been following me around for years. Wait - wonder if it is 
laying under the shed??? I'll look.
