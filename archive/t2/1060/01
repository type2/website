Sami,
Thanks for the link. It looks quite informative, but I'll have to read it
again, to tired to absorb it right now. If you read my other post from
tonight, I'm not sure if the cooler plugs helped or not. I'll know more this
weekend. I really appreciate you input, as well as everyone else.
Thanks Sami!

  Let us know what you find out. And I'm open to any other items to add
  to the list, especially the stuff on timing is incomplete.
  Thanks,
