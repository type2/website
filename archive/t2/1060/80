To be able to use your existing clutch & flywheel, '76-'79 is the  
year range.  Transmission code is 091 -- don't let anyone try and  
sell you a bellhousing for an 002 (through '75) or an 091-1  
(Vanagon); the 002 won't work with your clutch, and the Vanagon one  
doesn't have the mounts you need .. I think, don't hold me to that.
