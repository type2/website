Yeah, that should work.  I actually didn't even pulse them or use a 
resistor which is probably bad for them, but what did I know at the time ;)

I would not have the bus running, though - that could be dangerous.  I 
would turn on the ignition, remove the air filter and stick a 
screwdriver in the AFM to deflect the flap and turn on the fuel pump.
