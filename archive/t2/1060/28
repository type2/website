Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel Oil in T2

I've routinely used Rotella 15W40 for years, it is a good weight for a VW in
the mid-Atlantic nearly year round (or was before the ever creeping upward
summer temps.)  That said, even the diesel stuff now is low on ZDDP, so
frankly you are better with a flat tappet engine (VW, your ole Chevy,
whatever) particularly a new or one in the breakin period, to use a good
regular oil (including the Rotella) with a ZDDP additive.  This has been
handled on the list a few times now, and you can still find (as of a month or
two ago) some of the older oils with more still on the shelves, particularly
at older smaller parts stores, but they are getting rare.  The EPA doesn't
care of course...  For up to date recs, google ZDDP, corvette forum and lots
of other places list pretty current reported oil contents.

Ok, based on some previous discussions, I'm considering switching over to
diesel-engine oil on the assumption that it has more of the additives that AC
engines need (zinc, etc).
