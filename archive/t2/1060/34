Subject: Re: [T2] oil capacities

On my 78 it's 4 quarts with an oil filter change and 3.5 without.

That said, just put in a quart at a time and keep checking the oil.  At 
around three quarts you should start seeing it on the dipstick.  When it 
reads full, run the engine for half a minute to circulate the oil and 
then turn the engine off and check again.  You'll probably have to add a 
bit more to compensate for the oil filling up the filter (if you changed 
it).
