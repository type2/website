Subject: Bay Busses in Miami

Hey guys,

      I meant to ask this last week, but I forgot. I was on the turnpike 826
South to Miami and I saw TWO bay busses comming down the opposite side of the
highway. The first one was a pretty blue Bus with a white top that looked to
be in excellent condition. Not but a minute down the road, did I see another
one, also a bay, that was painted up (professionally) with peace signs and all
kinds of pece graphics. It was a mixture of green, yellow, red, etc...

It appeared as though they were driving north from the Calle Ocho exit (8th
street). Do these Busses belong to anyone? I was driving my Crown Victoria, so
no one would have noticed me....
