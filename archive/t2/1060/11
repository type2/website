Because of the location under the tin (inaccessible), I decided to  
move the CHT sender elsewhere.

I had a bolt welded onto the #3 exhaust manifold between the flange  
(where it mounts to the head) and where it enters the heater box.   
The sender fits onto that bolt, and a nut holds it in place.

My readings are about the same as when it was under the spark plug  
(not ideal because the sender gets mangled) and when it was under the  
cylinder stud nut (also not ideal because the sender can fail and you  
have to pull the engine to replace it).  The give-or-take is about  
10-20 degrees, which is not unreasonable.

It is affected, however, by the use of the heater.  Since the  
heatexchanger works on the countercurrent mechanism, that part of the  
manifold gets warmer when the heater is turned on.
