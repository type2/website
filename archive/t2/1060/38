JBWeld. I haven't tried it but you would need to be sure that the sensor is
thermally coupled to the head.

>I'll check for exhaust gas leakage at your recommendation, good idea. That
begs the question, If you got the plug to seal with the gasket in place, why
is it recommended to remove the spark plug gasket in the first place?

Removing the gasket means the spark plug ends up the same distance into the
combustion chamber.
