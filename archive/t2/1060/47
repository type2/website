I hate to throw a potential monkey wrench into your plans, but I have
personally witnessed an unusually large number of engine failures with
Royal Purple.B They were all bearing related failures and occurred
across a variety of different vehicle applications.B  I personally
wouldn't put Royal Purple in my lawn mower, much less my bus.B  A
friend of mine just sold 11 quarts of it on Craigslist for $2.50/quart
because nobodyB we know will put it in their car.B  YMMV as always,

geared towards performance engines, Royal Purple 20W-50. It is about
ten bucks a quart, so not cheap but it should be good insurance.
