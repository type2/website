That relay does wonders.  The Bosch # for the relay kit is WR-1.  The kit
comes with the harness and installation destructions.  A good upgrade for
any Bus/Vanagon from 76.

Subject: [WetWesties] Message in Bosch reman catalogue re: starters and
voltage???

Has anyone been able to access a Bosch catalogue to read this? I'm wondering
what it's all about? Here is the quote from the online jobber website for
the 77 type2 auto trans starter.

BEFORE installing this starter, refer to Application Notice #B-45 in the
Bosch reman catalog regarding low system voltage on this application. 

Is this about installing a starter relay? Just wondering.
