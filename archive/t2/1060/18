Subject: WTB type IV fan shroud for $20

I need a fan shroud for my '78 VW bus.

Hope to find something in Northern Virginia, shipping would be oherwise
repressive.

Anyone near Fairfax VA have a fan shroud in their stash that they need to
get rid of?

I am willing to pay $20 for a GD or GE fan shroud (bare).

I soaked my fan shroud in a a batch of Muriatic Acid, and it just ate up the
aluminum!!!

Live and learn...
