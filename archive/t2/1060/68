Hi Patrick - did you look in the library?

Alot of good reading there.

I'm sure somebody could help you put a Beetle tranny in your bus but I 
think the result would be a real question of durability.

Be sure to watch Craig's List. The is a website called CrazedList that 
can help you to create RSS feeds of any or all of the CraigsList 
websites so you can find a tranny that way. Then there are places like 
BustedBus that surely will have just what you are looking for used.
