Subject: RE: [T2] Cold Start Valve and TTS

On the road, no manual, but from what I recall the the
TTS provides a ground for the CSV (which allows it to
operate).

The TTS only provides this ground when

1) The engine is cold AND
2) For a short period of time after starting.

Sounds like maybe you have a bad ground or possibly a
bad TTS...

- Make sure all your wires are hooked up correctly.
- Remove, clean, and re-attach all associated
connectors.


I think the Bentley manual has instructions for
testing the TTS?
