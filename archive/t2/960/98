everything faster is also more expensive.

don't bother there aren't any that will remove the paint without nasty
side effects

good way to work

Por 15 works, but it is too expensive to paint a bus with.  use it in the
high rust prone areas.

. get all the rust off, and when you think you have it all off, check
again.
. put on aa goood coat of primer (not that red crap either)
. I would then cover with a rattle can coat of some decent color. not
because it is finished but it protects better than primer, primer is to
help paint stick not protect the metal.

getting rid of the rust is the one key thing,
