Subject: Re: [T2]73 westy driving wine

I guess people are assuming an automatic, but I can't
find any reference to it being an automatic, so I will
assume a stick. I will also assume that the noise
(whine) came along recently and got worse rather
quickly. You say it shifts better now, meaning that it
shifted worse for a while and since you didn't say it
shifts perfectly now, I assume it still does not shift
as well as it did before you started hearing the
whine. 

That's a whole lot of assuming that really should have
been included in the query, BTW!

If all my assumptions are correct, I think you need to
replace the front shift rod bushing that is directly
under the shift lever and is reached from underneath
by removing the "skid pan." If you're mechanically
inclined, it's not a bad job to replace yourself. That
is, to replace the bushing yourself. Otherwise, see
yer mechanic!

Of course, if it is an automatic and or any other
assumptions are wrong, it could be something in the
engine compartment, but I still stand by my
assumptions! -BaH

 73 westy has a bad wine when driving.
    
   it sounds like it is coming from the tranny or
 more in the middle of the bay area?
    
   i thought maybe it was low on trans oil so i
 checked and found it should just be changed.
    
   well changed that and it does shift better but the
 wine is still there....
    
   when you press pedal and try to accelerate is when
 it is heard in the floor area or back towards
 back...
