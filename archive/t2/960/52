Subject: A "Thank You ALL" is in order . . .

My Goodness, what a wonderful list this turning out to be!  If I tried to 
reply to all of you folks that have been so kind, I'd never get anything 
finished on ol' Lucky Seven!  So I'll just post a big THANK YOU here for the 
time being and hope to catch up as soon as we can get our act together. 
Personally, I'm working on the INSIDE, and John is fussing with everything 
that will make it road worthy . . . It's in the German Motor Shop at the 
moment . . . a progress report will soon be forthcoming.  I'm just about 
finished with a web page so we can "Show Off" a bit, and will post the URL 
in a day or two.  Thanks again, to all who have responded to us, both on the 
list AND privately . . . I  have a "Lucky Seven" Folder on our computer and, 
at the moment, are saving everything we get.  Oh, ANOTHER thing . . . we 
have subscribed to both the type2-digest AND to the Vanagon List . . . while 
John already knew this, I just learned that ol' Lucky is really a "Middle" 
child, so we're able to learn many things from both lists.
