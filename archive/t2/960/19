hey guys  Kinda what I figure would happen sounds like he doesn't need  or
want us involved LOL   Did somebody just appoint this guy to be the

Actually, it sounds like he feels guilty that it got this far in the 
conversation and he's going to fix the problem without involving 
everyone else (could also be read: burdening everyone else with the 
issue).  Sounds like he's making an effort to see it continue on its 
journey - kudos!
