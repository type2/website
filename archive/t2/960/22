It might be.  Put it in the middle of the tube and pump 'er full!

You'd have to braze a nut to the tube to take the fitting, though

Another approach would be to machine a clamp to go over the forward end
of the cable and tube with a grease fitting to force grease from front to
Back

I've often thought that while the clutch cable was removed that I could just
put my grease gun's flex hose to the front of the cable tube and keep
pumping until grease came out the back end.  I haven't tried it yet but I
may one of these days.
