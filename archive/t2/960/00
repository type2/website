Subject: Clutch - Possible solution???

My earlier post was asking for help in diagnosing a
clutch not releasing. I stated that I had tightened
the new cable as tight as it would go, even stacked
washers on the bowden tube; I expected either the
throwout bearing arms to be broken from the cross-tube
(broken welds) or that something had actually loosened
up like the adapter plate from the engine or tranny
from adapter plate. None of the expected was true.

I had to pry the pressure plate off of / out of the
flywheel. No, not just the rollpins holding it - I
mean really PRY that sucker outa there. On closer
inspection tonight, the flywheel was so packed with
dust that the pressure plate was jamming (my
conjecture). I say this because the outside surface
(about 3/16" thick) of the pressure plate had dust
packed on it to where it was a solid entity. There is
a groove machined around the flywheel that woud be
outside of the disc / pressure plate and the dust was
packed solid in there, totally filling all available
room.

The arms of the pressure plate are pretty badly worn
at the tips (razor sharp!)  and there are a couple
arms that are maybe .040" out of line with the others.
Again, there is no discoloring anywhere from heat. The
disc is still in quite good condition with quite a bit
of lining still above the rivets - probably a good
.060" at thinnest side. The relief grooves in the disc
were not clogged at all.

Has anyone heard of a clutch getting clogged up with
dust before? Is it reasonable? There are relief holes
in the flywheel for (I assume) dust to escape, but
those holes were packed so solid that it took a lot of
pressure to knock the stuff loose. Could this be the
whole problem? -BaH
