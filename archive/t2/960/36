Subject: Re: engine choices.... decisions

I think your choices boil down to the camper special if you are 
mechanically minded and have the "spare" cash or the Busdepot (or 
similar) option if not. The problems I have with the other options are:

- used engine. As you say on your site you could end up worse off!
- TDI. Potentially a huge amount of work modifying, fabricating, 
trialling stuff. The only way I'd consider this option is if you can 
get a kit or the assistance of someone who has been there before
- build up from parts. This can work but is probably best done on a 
second motor so you can keep driving for the years it could take to 
get the motor going!

HTH,

Martin.
