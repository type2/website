And now,  to all of you, I thank you for your concern for the hubcap.    
Since I sort of created this situation by not following through on  my  
plans to take it to Havasu this past January, I am stepping up to  the  
plate and will take care of it without involving any of  you.  Stay  
tuned to the VW community and you will find out  where and when the  
Infamous Hubcap re-surfaces!     ;-)
