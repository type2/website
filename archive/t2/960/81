L249 Dove Grey was used for:

- the intake runners
- the tops of the belly pans
- fresh air flaps
- firewall
- fuel filler pipe
- battery clamp
- engine access hatch
- the heater boxes and muffler
- I've even seen a non-locking gas cap in this color.

I'm not sure about the exact color since my own tank was repainted  
white after it rusted.
