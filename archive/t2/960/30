Subject: engine choices.... decisions

First, I don't wanna start a FART, or a flame war or anything, nor do I
want to violate some list rule.  I'm struggling with what to do with
the inadequate power in my bus, and what is the best way to resolve it
- long term.  I refer to the frankenmotor as "the limper" because it
just never has that fight in it.  If you know what I mean.  I have some
time and some financial resources to do more than patch holes, so I'd
like to do the smartest thing I can.  My hope is that the collective
brainpower of lots of folks is better than my totally frazzled one.

Anyway, I've pretty much spilled the options on a blog
(http://viewfromabus.blogspot.com/2007/03/new-engine-opinions-welcome.html),
so if you have a sec, I'd welcome the opinion.  I know I didn't list
every possible scenario, but I thought those I listed would at least
hit the high notes.  If you have a suggestion that should be added, I'd
be happy to switch it all around to add it.  

If this falls under the heading of bad or "illegal" posting, I
apologize to the list and respect the admin thread kill.
