Subject: Removing Window Tint?

Well I've got all the windows out for the paint job,
and several have a very ametuet window tint film
applied.  It seems to be baked on pretty good,
scrapping with a razor seems impractical, and acetone
doesn't do anything.

Any other ideas on how to get this stuff off?

Or maybe I need new windows; are they even available?

TIA
