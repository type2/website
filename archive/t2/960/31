Subject: [T2]73 westy driving wine

73 westy has a bad wine when driving.
   
  it sounds like it is coming from the tranny or more in the middle of the bay area?
   
  i thought maybe it was low on trans oil so i checked and found it should just be changed.
   
  well changed that and it does shift better but the wine is still there....
   
  when you press pedal and try to accelerate is when it is heard in the floor area or back towards back...
   
  it made me think it was the tranny though at first but now not sure so thats why i am here a asking you all.
  its like turning wine or grind sort of sound.. this is really hard to explain.
