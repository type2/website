it does sound tranny or final drive noise.  does it sound different when
you turn a corner??

is it constant with engine speed or road speed, ?

does it change when you shift gears??

is it lounder or more pronunced when you accelerate or decelerate or
drift?

doees it change when you push the clutch in.. especially at speed

sorry more queestions than answers
