Subject: valve train 

To the List,
 
The scenario - - -
 
I've got a stock 73 1700 type IV motor and recently replaced the heads
with some stock AMC units. Everything went together fine until I put
together the rocker arm assembly and tried to adjust the valve gap only
to find that I had a huge gap to adjust - (approx. 5 mm or 3/8" or
more). If I adjust the gap, (the screw is out almost as far as you can
screw it), the adjusting screw sits on an angle to the valve stem
instead of being flat. On closer inspection, I figured out that the
valve stems on the AMC heads don't stick out as far (aren't as long), as
the valve stems on my old VW heads, thus throwing off the geometry of
the stock rocker arms. If I put the rocker arms where they should be on
the AMC heads - the gap is at the other end of the rocker arm and now
the stock pushrods aren't long enough.
 
 
Now the big questions - - -
 
1. Is this a common problem or am I just lucky?
2. How do I fix it? (I'm on spring break and need to get this bus on the
road hopefully by Saturday)
 
 
Could I use some Bugpack - you cut push rods - and custom make my own
length and eliminate the gap. (I've never done this procedure -
hopefully it's not to hard) or do I need to bite the bullet and pull the
heads and replace the valves with proper length ones? (don't want to do
this if I don't have to).
 
Your thoughts appreciated.
