   'Fraid not...That beam went to another Bus...:-)

This one was from a "project" Bus that sat in a 
garage for years. I was waiting at a light one day
and a couple came up to the driver's window and
said, "Do you want another one?"
Story was the couple's kid had gotten the Bus years
ago and was "workin' " on it and then got bored or
whatever...The Bus was rolled out of the garage and
Dad said, "End of the month...Either the Bus goes
mobile or the Bus goes."
The kid decided he didn't want the Bus anymore, and
I had it towed to my house...Sat in the back for about
two years and I was thinkin' about puttin' my engine
in it when a tree limb made the decision for me. My
front beam had been welded but started to crack a-
gain so I pulled the beam from the (now) donor Bus
and it's at my buddy's shop being cleaned and prep-
ped to go on the runner... :-)
