Subject: Re: [VB] Alternator Pulley Failure

Tom, Matt Roberds  covered most. Here is our story.  We had a stock 1600
SP but we were trying the smaller generator for more cooling. We cracked
the lower pulley and it would have been two pieces soon,  we think that
the pulleys were not in line. If you use a straight edge or a good
calibrated eyeball to see if you line up.
We do run our belt more loose than most, they seem to tighten as the
motor get to temperature.
Also there is more than one generator backing plate (same for alternator
??) That changes the offset.
So the only common parts were the alternator, backing plate, fan shroud,
fan?? two each  failure motor.
P & C
