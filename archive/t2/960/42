Subject: RE: [T2]73 westy driving wine

ok so sorry for leaving out some things...
   
  yes it is a manual trans.... no i dont think it is the rear wheel bearings cause of this..
   
  if you are using a gear no matter 1st through 4th it whines at you.... when pushing gas pedal but if you are drifting or cruising  there is no whine but here we come up on a hill or a place where we need to mash gas again....
   
  you feel the bus engage to go from cruise to pushing the bus again and theres the whine again...
  it is not as loud at 50+ though...
   
  hope that helps me determine a little better whats up?
   
  thanks for all the replies will check back after work this evening...
   
  it does not shift well someone PO has did something to the shift plate so i gotta readjust that this weekend...
   
  then it should shift grrrrrreat....
   
  there is no whine at idle or cruise just when you need more gas and then you can hear it in the floor again right in the middle of bay area of the 73 not San fran... LOL... some of you guys are so hilarious.
   made me smile this am...
  peace and have a grateful day yall.
