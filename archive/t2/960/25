Subject: Re: [T2] Re: The Hubcap

I wasn't going to post anything but since not all the info is here  
for the list to base their opinion on, I am posting. It can go either  
way in my opinion. I setup a date with him and he wasn't able to  
follow through for whatever reason.  I was headed down that way  
anyhow and it would have worked out.  I was willing to pay for any of  
his gas if needed and I was going to drive over half the distance to  
his place to meet him for the exchange.  That plan actually, can  
still work very easily for me.  For him, I'm not sure.  I am on the  
fence about his true feelings (emails can easily send the wrong  
tone.)  I can see though where he would be upset for not calling me  
back, and thinking that I drove a lot of the way just for him.  When  
the fact is that I was headed partially down that way regardless.

I have no hard feelings either way, but as I have told others, I'll  
probably step aside on trying to help with the hubcap.  As many have  
said, there always seems to be some disagreement or bitterness about  
where it's going, how it's getting there, and who is taking it  
there.  I still hope one day to see this very iconic piece of  
history.  The stories and places it has seen are priceless I'm sure.

Peace, Troy
