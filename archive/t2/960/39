Here's something not mentioned.
What are the wheel bearings like? Checked?
Front ones are easy to check / do if necessary.
Sounds are decieving :)

73 westy has a bad wine when driving.

   it sounds like it is coming from the tranny or more in the middle of the 
bay area?

   i thought maybe it was low on trans oil so i checked and found it should 
just be changed.

   well changed that and it does shift better but the wine is still 
there....

   when you press pedal and try to accelerate is when it is heard in the 
floor area or back towards back...

   it made me think it was the tranny though at first but now not sure so 
thats why i am here a asking you all.
   its like turning wine or grind sort of sound.. this is really hard to 
explain.
