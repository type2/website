Hello Paul   I can give you some other choices. First Rabys are  overated and 
way too costly. I know for a fact that his blow up also and he  has had his 
problems too.Boston Bob might be a better choice. I would find  a 2.0L and 
build my own.Adding a different cam, bigger valve heads, and maybe a  slightly 
bigger bore. Then adding either a megasquirt or late FI prefered. You  could go 
with dual carbs but they can be troublesome for some. Adding a crane  ingnition 
and a header. At this point you should be close to Rabys numbers at a  much 
lower cost. Later  Mark Dearing
