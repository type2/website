Here's my take on things. Troy can back me up on this too.

The stock 2.0 FI engine is a heck of a performer. I can keep up with
traffic on 99% of the hills around here in CO. I easily keep up with
highway traffic. Accelleration is quite acceptable, even at partial
throttle. No need to mash the pedal all the time like I needed to with
my 73.

The extra torque from the longer crank makes a world of difference.
Consider just building or buying a tight 2.0 and go from there.

(Of course, I still dream of a high HP watercooled engine... )
