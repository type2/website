The *crank* doesn't have the two dots. The cam-drive gear that's pressed on
the crank does. And they're almost impossible to see because they're really,
really little.

If you had one of those crack-detector kits with the talcum powder and the
red oil, that would work well to help you detect the two dots. You spray the
red oil on the place you want to check for cracks, gently wipe it off and
spray the item with the talcum powder; any red oil in cracks will show up
immediately. Painting the gear and wiping off the paint while it was still
wet (it'll stay in low spots, like the two dots you're looking for) would
work too.
