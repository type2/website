Subject: would this have made my bus overheat??

We leave my parents place in SF and we are heading down to LA in my new
78 westy.  It was really hot during the day (this was about 2 months
ago) and we pulled over for some gas.  I noticed that while we were
driving, there was hot air coming out of the lower front vents... 

So I looked at the cables and noticed that they were broken and/or not
connected.. "shoot" I said, .. it was darn hot!  So, I stuffed some
paper in the bottom vents where the air was coming out..

Then, while driving through bakersfield, we lose power and later on I
find out that 4's lost compression.. granted, it was very hot outside,
and we were going about 70, and I totally did not think about the engine
temperature, but would the paper in the vents have caused the overheat? 
I was looking at my engine today and I noticed that the cooling air that
circulates around the engine has vents that connect to the heat
exchangers..  hmmmm...

Also, I'd like to get new heater cables so I can get it all the heating
working again.  I have some cables broken and I also have a broken
sleeve that holds the cable (the one that selects the air to go to the
windshield or your feet).  What's the easiest way to go about fixing
these?  do they just pull out?

Thanks!
Mike
