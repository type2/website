I recommend it HIGHLY!!!!, too. Last year a misfired pumpkin flew backwards
into the crowd -- oh, the humanity! (No one was hit, everyone just watched
it fall and kinda edged out of the way.)

There's a big campground not too far away. Looked pretty nice. Met a bunch
of the east coasters last year. Sorry I'll miss it this year.

OBC -- Wendelin is supposed to be home next week. Cross your fingers. When
everyone hears the earth-shattering WAHOO! then we can pop open the
sparkling cider. Everybus in April is lookin' GOOD! :-D
