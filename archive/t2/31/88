Subject: Re: [T2] help..oil leak (digest mode)

I noticed you have a similar setup to mine. ('73 bus, '77 engine 2L, auto,
weber progressive.)  I had a similar problem with oil leaking, although not
as bad.  It turned out that the oil pressure sensor was not tight enough.
In my fear of stripping it out, I left it too loose and it leaked as you
described until I figured it out.  Can you go back without too much trouble
to the original set up and see if the problem continues?  You won't have the
pressure sender, but you'll be able to get somewhere you can find the
correct parts.

Good luck.
