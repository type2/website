Subject: help..oil leak (digest mode)

hello again folks!

i am currently in huron south dakota and experiencing
problems once again (not a surprise though.)

my 75 westy (w/78 engine, weber prog. carb., AT) has
been leaking oil over the course of our trip. we were
averaging about 1 pint per gas tank fillup (approx.
180 straight driving miles.) now it seems that the
leak is worse...now a full quart upon fillup.  oil
drips from the bottom of the engine until it is cooled
off.

according to my gauges, i've been maintaining 40psi
while on the highway and around 200 degrees when the
outside temp. is around 40 degrees F.

i believe some of the oil is coming from the new oil
pressure sender i installed (from the brass converter
fitting to the sender.) i believe the brass fitting
might be cracked.

so, item #1...what is the exact thread pitch and size
for the brass fitting?  i bought the vdo extension kit
and the fitting came with it.  i might have to buy
another, but it looks like going to a hardware/auto
store in these parts supply mainly american cars.

also, if it is my oil cooler...can the cooler be
removed with the engine in?

and finally...in case i have to suck it up and take it
to someone...can anyone recommend a good aircooled
mechanic in the eastern part of south dakota OR in
omaha, nebraska (my next stop.)

thanks so much folks, i've come so far, yet i am still
running into problems.  i just don't want to kill my
engine.

missy:) (i am in digest mode, so please email me
directly as well!)
