all good points well taken.  a butt weld done with oxy/acet, i left a
small-so-hard-to-tell ridge which is adaquate for me.  i hope it holds! it
is hidden by the mirror. i've been kinda torn since i hauled this truck out
of the trash: is it a work truck - how far should i take it?  today its a
work truck. i gotta hope its done....remember the john muir frontispiece!
if it does crack again, i will remember the MIG and do thank you in advance.

i was hoping to minimize re-opening the wound, so i drilled a hole with a
#53 bit at the bottom of the stress before welding hoping to ensure the
crack wouldn't travel. right now i'm fighting the urge to put the door back
together having sprayed paint six hours ago <grit>.

i did all the removals myself. i'm particular about my boneyard treasures.
i found the wcm door panel clip boots are hardly good for one time use
only. during removal i found they all buckeled and ripped upon installation
of the door panel. ya hit the tips of them with grease, and gently run 'em
through the holes in the door with a twist on a stick half the diameter of
a wooden skewer, BUT upon installation of the door panel, they fried on me.
i'll try greasing the clips this too time.  wcm supposedly sells orig vw
boots at a buck a piece. sheesh.     - steve
