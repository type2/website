Subject: knocking noise in front axle

Hello Volks,

My 71 Westy makes knocking noise in front axle when going over even a small
bump...I can also hear the sound occasionally when not going over bumps. The
noise is small, not *clunk* sound. I am new to bus and looked at the axle
diagram and there are two tie-rods and a sterring damper and steering
knuckle. I noticed a small leak on the steering damper. I am also thinking
the steering gear box... The sound is not from CV joint, I think. Does
anyone have any idea where I might look?

Thanks!
71 Westy
