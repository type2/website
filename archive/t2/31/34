Hi all,
Well, I finally have my rebuilt engine spinning in the bus.  Can't get it to
fire though.  It worked before I rebuilt it, and it has new rotor, dist.
cap, spark plugs, wires etc., so I doubt it's spark related.  One thing I'm
not 100% sure of are the fuel connections at the fuel pump.  I don't smell
fuel so am wondering if it's getting up to the carb.  I may have the fuel
connections reversed.  THe pump has a larger and a smaller fitting.  I
forget now which one I connected to the fuel tank and which one to the carb.
If one of you should know which one is for which, please let me know.
Neither the Bentley, Muir, nor Haynes talk about the different connections.
Thanks,
  --Robert
