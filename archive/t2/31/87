Subject: Little piece under rear side window.

There's a little piece of sheet metal that runs along the belt line under
the rear driver's side window.  It has three screws underneath.  I have
removed these, but it is still attached.  I can't see or feel any other
fasteners.

Can I remove this piece, and if so, how?

Thanks,

Grant
