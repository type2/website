Subject: heater box recall ended years ago

I posted the other day about the failure of both of my VW replacement heater 
boxes.

I've received a few messages asking  about the recall.  

The offer from VW to replace these parts ended back in 1997.  I doubt you 
would have any luck contacting VW.  I doubt they would even admit that they 
ever offered free replacements.  I also believe the Senior Engineer (Mr. Yves 
Le Coz) at VW that was in charge of this program has either retired or moved 
on.

I know of no information that was ever made available from this program.

I suggest if you are concerned about this subject search the archives using 
keyword Asbestos or Le Coz.  I have nothing further to offer.
