There was no factory option that I know of, but there was a
dealer-installed system with a self-contained evaporator/blower/fan that
either went under the dash or against the ceiling behind the driver.

These systems were rather Rube Goldberg in design,. but they did work
after a fashion.  I live in SoCal, and don't really think the hassle of
rounding up the parts and installing them is worth it.
