Mike,

You absolutely, positively *SHOULD BE* correct!  In any sort of sane
universe, Red should *NEVER* be negative!

Now... real world....  A lot of parts stores sell generic battery cables
with a red plastic insulation.  No doubt, the manufacturer would say they
are *supposed* to be used for positive leads only.  The problem is that
there are a whole lot of... err... umm... err... IDIOTS!!!! out there and
unfortunately the difference between genius and stupidity is that genius
has its limits.  On a twenty+ year old car, the only way to be sure is to
(a) check the stamps on the battery and then
(b) make sure that the cable from the negative (-) side gets bolted to the
    body.

I sure do wish you were correct, Mike, but I have seen way too many
sub-genii in action.  Maybe it's because I live in Washington, DC :-)
