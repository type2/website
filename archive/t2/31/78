Corrosion!

Clean the cable terminals by disconnecting them and soaking them in a hot
solution of Bicarbonate of Soda.  Just take a cup, fill with boiling
water, put in a spoonful of soda, stir, and dip the cable end in the cup.

Clean the battery terminals by carefully wiping them with a paper towel
saturated with the same solution.  Keep it out of the cells!

Dry everything completely.

Coat the battery and cable terminals with petroleum jelly.  Do a good
complete job of this.  Exposed surfaces will corrode.

Reassemble.  Your corrosion problems should be over.  If you disassemble,
add a coat of petroleum jelly to the mating surfaces to preserve the seal.

I've done this for decades and it is the best way to keep corrosion at
bay.  The little "anti corrosion rings" they sell at the FLAPS are not all
that good.
