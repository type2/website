To the list & William,

From what I can remember the 71 Westy had the A/C behind the driver seat in 
the jump seat back where I keep maps books.  It was black and had two vents 
how this could ever keep a bus cool I do not know.  For the stations wagons 
they had from 68 on an under dash unit. But no air to the back of the bus.  
The compressor were located in the fender well never a clean look.  I think 
they were all aftermarket.

My thinking is if you use the over head in the Westy it will not look right 
the head liner resting on the top of it give a finished look.  You might try 
a Westy rear Vanagon unit.

My 72 (1700cc) had over head. The compressor was on the block, as the pancake 
was used in the; 914, 411 & 412. The condenser run must most the belly of the 
bus. It work just OK the bus did not have the h/p for the A/C you could feel 
it kick & when it came to hills off it would go.

Well, that about what I know about A/C & the bus.
