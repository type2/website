Or a Corvair (Trans-Vair) conversion.

Choose your flavor: 95 HP, 110 HP, 140 HP, or 180 HP turbo.

I recommend 95 HP (cools best) or 110 HP (if you've just gotta have more HP.)

The difference is in the compression ratio.

Higher compression ratio = higher HP = higher heat = more chance you'll 
cook your engine on a hill.

Just pokin' at 'cha.
