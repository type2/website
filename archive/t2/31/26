Subject: boiled linseed oil or raw linseed oil for rust treating rocker panels?

Sorry for the cross post and to Chuck, but can anyone verify which linseed
oil to buy? I think it was chuck who told me originally about this. I'm
going to pick the linseed oil up tomorrow and treat my 79 Westy inner rocker
panels before the snow flies. :-) I read the two labels (raw oil and boiled
oil) and the raw linseed takes quite a bit longer to dry. Is that desirable?
I'll be spraying it through a garden sprayer to get all the insides covered.
Both appear to be the same consistency of about 10 wt oil it would appear.
Thanks!
Courtney
