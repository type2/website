I'm not sure how this plays into the parts you are talking about, but the
'70 camper that I am buying this weekend has one that is behind the driver
on the ceiling... and has parts that are currently disconnected in the back
driver's side engine compartment.  I was hoping to find something out there
aftermarket...  I know that there are kits for some hot rods, but the real
question is fitting, and horsepower loss.

Anyone seen these for VW?
