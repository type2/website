Dave,

They are M6 bolts.  I have not got the length on hand, but do not
remember them being real long.  I would buy M6x10 or M6x15.  Remember the
washers!!!!  Buy a box of M6 flat washers.  If you have the plastic scale
and screen, you need the washers to prevent the screen from distorting/
cracking (it's really good practice in any case).

If you don't have access to a store that carries metric hardware, the
diameter and length are the same as the tin screws, so a set of spare tin
screws will hold it in for a while.
