Subject: No 4th gear

Hello list,

I have a 75 bus, manual transmission. It will no longer stay in 4th gear, 
popping out when under the slightest load. The weird thing is that I lost 
4th after driving in 3rd up a steep, windy road. Any way, I'm assuming that 
I need a rebuilt transmission but I was wondering if it is possible to crack 
open the case and replace the worn out parts myself. I'm not looking for a 
long time permanent fix just the cheapest. I don't know anything about 
transmissions so fixing it myself is probably out of the question but, I 
would appreciate any input.

Thanks,
Darin
Ashland, OR
