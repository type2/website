We got back from  Indigebus Sunday evening. Had a great time, met some nice
people. We drove through HEAVY rain Friday but it had all but stopped by the
time we arrived.  We had to 'baja' a mud pit on the final approach to the
gate but made it through OK. What nobody seemed to anticipate was the cold
temps that came through behind the front. Friday and Saturday night were
both near freezing and we woke to lovely frost all over everything both
mornings.

The 'east meets west' part of the event was a success, with busses rolling
in from Florida, South Carolina, California, and points in between. There
were about 16 busses present, ranging from a 57 double door splittie to a
turbo diesel synchro Westy. Several other splitties attended as well as bays
and vanagons. The campfire music never really got rolling but Shawn did
favor us with her "Working On A Marijuana Farm" song. The 'Fan Belt Toss'
was fierce, requiring a double elimination to name a winner. The sponsors--
West Coast Metric, Rocky Mountain Motor Works, Roy Rogers VW, to name a
few-- were generous and all the prizes were a big hit, even the gag prizes.

I'll leave the rest of the report for Snoopy and Shawn when they get back,
but I do have to mention that if you are ever traveling on US 60 through
Missouri you have to stop for gas in Ellsinore. At the junction of US 60 and
CR 'V' there is a station with "Grandma Hindal's Bakery" attached. The
bakery is run by a very nice Menonnite lady and, man, can she bake!!! Worth
stopping even if you don't need gas.

'Thanks' to all the good people we met with at Indigebus and I hope to meet
up again at future events.

Regards,
Dave

PS: Rivka ran sweet and cool the whole way out and back, even after taking
the hills heavily loaded with all the camping gear.  YAY!
