There are actually three places that "gunk" on the battery terminals can come 
from.  The most likely is from the battery itself.  Especially if it is an 
older battery.  The seals below the terminal posts go bad and allow some acid 
to leak through.  Clean all you want and the stuff will still come back.  
Second is from the terminals on your car itself.  Could be cheap aftermarket 
with impurities in the lead that seem to attract all that mess.  Third, it 
could be the environment your battery is in.  If it's humid and hot that just 
speeds up the process.  Water or saltwater would make it even worse.  Some 
people coat their terminals with petroleum jelly (Vaseline) or use special 
paints that you can buy at any auto store.

Hope this has been helpful.
