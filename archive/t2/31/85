Hello,

Lurker named Milo here.  I've got a problem in my '69
Westy that 
I probably shouldn't have, but nonetheless - I do...

I left it at a friend's house for a few weeks, came
back, and the
battery was dead.  Simple enough I thought - I hooked
jumpers up
to it from my car and it started right up.  But as
soon as I unhooked
the jumpers, it died.  This is stange I thought!  So
off I run to the 
store, fork over some bread for a new battery, and
think - I hate 
buying a new battery but this is simple enough, quit
complaining...  
Little was I to know!

I get back, and notice that the red cable in the back
of my bus is
indeed, hooked up to the negative terminal, and that
when I jump
started it, I had the + from the car hooked up the -
of the bus, and
vise-versa....  Well, that explains why she wouldn't
stay running.
And man, was that battery hot when I took it out of
the bus!

After second guessing myself a few times, I conclude
beyond a reasonable
doubt that yes - the red should go to the negative
terminal, etc.  Man,
was that hard to do though!  Something about hooking
red up to negative
that really goes against the grain ya know.

My problem is this.  My red light is now on, and I
seem to recall 
somewhere that what I've just done is reversed the
"charge" in the
generator - not sure if that was Muir, Usenet, the
list, etc.  But
I seem to recall reading this.  The archives couldn't
bear this out
however.  Hell, maybe I dreamed it sometime, but it's
my hunch.

Anyone have any suggestions from previous experience? 
Did I fry my
Voltage Regulator, ruin my generator, or just put a
magnetic hex
on the gennie that could be removed by a shop w/ the
right type
of magnet.  Any and all suggestions would be greatly
appreciated!

Geez, if I'd have just shut the key all the way off
before taking
off that one night none of this would have
happened.... *sighs*

THANKS!  Milo
