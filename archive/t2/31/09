Subject: brake shims

Hi all,

     I was replacing the front brake pads on my 82 westy & there were no
anti-squeal shims in the calipers.  I have the Girling calipers.  Anybody
have a set they could sell me?  These shims not only prevent brake squeal
but they also keep the pistons oriented correctly in the calipers.  I am in
the Portland area if anyone locally has a set.  Thanks.
