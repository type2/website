Subject: 70 bus still for sale in S. Calif / Pictures

I still have my 70  bus project / parts for sale.  I need to get it out of
here soon so if it's not sold by the middle of the week then I'll have to
part it out and take what's left over to the scrap yard.   I bought  it to
use for parts for another bus I had.
It's a sunroof bus, has front seats and a rear seat, no middle seat.  The
body is decent on it.  The glass is complete, doors are good, hatch is good,
has dash and steering column, front end, no engine
or trans.  I'm asking $150.00 but am open to offers.  I'm in Hesperia,
California.   See links below for pictures and email me directly if you have
any questions about it.

John
