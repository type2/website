Subject: Why retrofit a smaller oil pump in a dual port ? (aka PO rant)

Hi dear list,
I found a flat camshaft and an oil pump with 21mm gears in the AE
(seems original) case of my dual port type 1 engine - that is for a
1971 bus.

What a pain ! Why would some random "mechanic" retrofit a flat cam and
smaller oil pump in MY bus ? I am pretty sure that '71 got 26mm oil
pump gears and dished cams only. A 26mm  oil pump does not work with
flat cam, it needs dished cam. My bus has been getting unusually hot
oil even though the heads seem cool. It could well be that getting the
right oil pump (stock) could fix that.

Do I need to change anything on the crankshaft gear when going from
flat to dished camshaft ?
