I have the DVD. It has been restored and re-mastered from the original 
film.  The sound track on its own is worth the money, and the film 
overall makes your jaw drop and puts a huge smile on your face at the 
same time.
Here are the guys who re-released it >>

Bus content:
I am still collecting a few bits before the big switch from Bosch FI to 
Megasquirt FI and Ignition control on my aircooled California Vanagon.  
You can look forward to being able to purchase many good used bits of 
the original FI system as soon as it warms up enough to do the work.
