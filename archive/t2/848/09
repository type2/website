Subject: An interesting electrical phenomenon...

72 bus, 1700 dual carbs.  An interesting thing
happens. I am trying to set the timing with my timing
gun. I hook up the inductor clip around spark plug
wire #1, red terminal on gun connected to battery
power, black terminal on gun to ground. When I squeeze
the timing gun trigger to make the light strobe, the
engine begins to cut out. I release the trigger on the
timing light, and idle goes back to normal. WTF?!?!?!?
Anyone have any ideas about what kind of ghost has
gotten my machine?????

Peace, John Baker
