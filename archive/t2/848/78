Subject: Aluminium or Magnesium case for type 1

I'm seeking feedback on aluminium replacement type 1 cases - versus
new AS 41 replacement cases.

It would seem obvious that aluminium is a better choice, since it
lasts longer and VW actually used it starting with the type 4. I've
found two people (John Conolly and this list member who complains
about his "crapcase" who dislike the aluminium case)  but I did not
quite get why they are no good for type 1.

So anyone has aluminium case and likes it ?
