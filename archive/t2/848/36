Subject: GWB's Carbs (Want carbs!!)

I've finally given up on these stock Solex's. Bits of rubber or other gunk
are in places I have no way of chasing down. No matter how many times I tear
'em down and clean them out, I get 10 seconds of idling then it dies. I
suppose if I had a hot tank or something to dissolve the rubber it might
work. But I'm pretty much done here.

To top it off, the throttle shafts are leaking badly. (How did I not notice
this before???)

So here's my dilemma. I have negative funds and need new carbs.

But I do have stuff to trade! If someone has a good pair of carbs (any
brand, as long as they're running well on a type 4 engine), and wants
something off my list, please let me know!

Here's what I have (off the top of my head):
79 2.0 engine (unknown condition)
79 A/C complete kit (pulled from same bus)
Box of PDSIT's and the two that are giving me grief on the bus
currently.They're mostly in pieces though from comparing bits, and swapping
jets and such. Includes the air filter and linkage and whatnot.

I'd prefer to give up the PDSITs and the A/C before the engine however.

The A/C includes the interior "T" shaped plastic unit with the vents and
controls, the hoses, the two condensors, the pulley and compressor brackets
and the compressor. I'd replace the hoses and compressor as a matter of
course. This stuff is bulky and heavy and not shippable. The interior
plastic bits have some cracks from age, but seem in pretty good shape
otherwise.

I really want to get the bus rolling. It's killing me to have it hiding out
in my garage. :(  If you can help, mail me offlist.
