I think you need the '79 shiftrods.

"I can't get the shift rod and tranny to meet all the way up."

Are you saying the shift rod is too short?

I've got a '79 engine and tranny in my '74 and I had to bend the crossmember
by the shift rod fork thingy just so I could get it into 2nd & fourth. Now
the gear shift is further away from the dash than before.
