I haven't used them on a Bus, but had a pair on the Bug I used to 
drive.  I was very happy with 'em, even the "crappy" EMPI linkage that 
people love to dis.  I quit syncing the carbs after checking them 
monthly for over a year and never having to touch anything.

In fact, I loved the whole engine in that car .. the timing and valve 
adjustments were like the carb syncing; after checking monthly for over 
a year I just gave up 'cuz nothing ever changed. :shock:

I miss that car.
