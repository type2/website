Subject: Where in the $#(-at-)$#(-at-) is the Fuel Filter on a '77?

I looked in Bentley, and on the VW Fiche. Of course, the mention the fuel
filter, and have it on the diagrams. I can't find the bloomin' thing.

Yes, this is a stupid quesion, but where is it?

(I spend too much time working on our Vanagons.....Bays are a whole
'nother world to me)
