Subject: Explain to me like I'm a 4 year old...

Hey Y'all,
I am working on a 72 westy with 1700. I have removed
an old Weber and installed the stock dual carbs, but
now I have about 50 vacuum ports to deal with!  The
two big ones on the lower part of each manifold I have
figured go to a "T" and then to the brake booster. But
there are two smallish vacuum cans with ports on the
upper part of both manifolds as well, what goes here??
 It has a dual vac dizzy, which I am familiar with on
single carb engines, but I have never worked on a dual
carbed bus, so can someone please explain to me like I
am a 4 year old where all the vaccuum lines are
supposed to hook up on a dual carbed engine. Please
include location of "T's", Dizzy advance port, Dizzy
retard port, etc. Thanks!!

Peace, John Baker
