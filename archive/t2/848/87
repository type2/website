Subject: Tire wrench

I found a really great tool the other day:

The tool I've been using for the last 15 years is the typical 4-way  
lug wrench from Sears which costs $10-$15. I can never get enough  
leverage on it so I end up using the top half of the handle from my  
floor jack to help back off the lug nuts.

The last time I tried a telescoping tire wrench I was left  
unimpressed but something compelled me to try the Hazet version for  
$35. This is the first one I've tried that effortlessly removes the  
lug nuts and tightens them up to torque spec by hand. Somehow it's  
the perfect length and shape.

It's 380mm in the stored position and 535mm when expanded. It's got a  
typical German tool finish (not chrome) but it's exceptional at its job.
