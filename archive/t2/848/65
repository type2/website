"I can't get the shift rod and tranny to meet all the way up."

Are you saying the shift rod is too short?

I've got a '79 engine and tranny in my '74 and I had to bend the crossmember
by the shift rod fork thingy just so I could get it into 2nd & fourth. Now
the gear shift is further away from the dash than before.
