<<The pressure plates are generally considered fairly balanced from the

just an assumption.>>

The flywheel is just about the only thing that needs to be periodically
balanced in a clutch assembly.

You can resurface the flywheel, have it lightened, and have it balanced.

The pressure plate is balanced from the mfg. and doesn't require
anything more than you already have.

By the time it would need to be re-balanced it would be in need to be
replaced anyway.

Throw it out--buy new.
