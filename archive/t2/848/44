Subject: Re: [T2] Why retrofit a smaller oil pump

My books do not agree about oil pump gear size for the various years.
Bentley chapter 5, section 17.
"Two camshafts and gears have been used on single-carburetor engines.
On the early-type, three rivets hold the gear onto the camshaft,
whereas the later type has four rivets. The change was made to
accommodate the larger oil pump introduced in May 1971"
later
"Caution the late-type single-carburetor engine oil pump, which has
26mm gears must be used with the four-rivet camshaft. The early type
pump, which has 21mm gears, must be used with the three rivet
camshaft. If the parts are mixed the oil pump will either not fit or
not supply lubrication."

Wilson p.53-54.
"For '70 only a 24mm pump was supplied in August '70 ('71 model year)
an 26mm oil pump was introduced."
Photo legend page 54 "Flat or three-rivet cam is used with 17mm and
19mm oil pumps, fitted to 61-69 engines. Dished or four-rivet mates
with 24mm and 26mm pumps used from 70-79."

My bus was manufactured 09/1970, so according to Bentley the 21mm gear
oil pump is stock. PO, forgive my rant... Let us consider the channge
of camshaft as an upgrade. It seems that Wilson is off regarding the
1970 oil pump size, or maybe that applies to bug only.

Bus depot sells both 21mm and 26mm pumps as "original" for 1971.
