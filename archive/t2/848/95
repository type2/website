Subject: Re: [T2] Warning : What a bad clutch driven plate will do to

From what i understand about balancing, they balance everything together, 
too.(crank, flywheel, pressure plate , clutch, rods, pistons) for all that 
work you did do, may be for naught if your pressure plate is heavy on one 
side :(( .

At least that is the way my local street rod shop does it.............
