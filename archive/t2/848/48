Karl,
I am glad you are onboard this thread. After my research I think that
not all 1971's came with dished camshaft gear.

I believe "early 1971" came with dual port and flat cam and 21mm oil
pump. While "late 1971" (starting in May 1971 - Bentley chapter 5,
section 17) came with dished 4-rivet cam and 26mm oil pump. This
matches with the Bentley but Wilson got it wrong. My 1971 is an
early-1971, manufactured in 09/1970.

My wild guess is that VW discovered in May 1971 that the dual port
engine with its larger carb and doghouse oil cooler could also use a
larger capacity oil pump. So the "late-1971" got the 26mm oil pump and
that is the last upgrade that would go in the early baywindow.

not all 1971 busses made equal.
my 1971 to get an upgraded oil pump.
