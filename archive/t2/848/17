Subject: Paris - 1978 - Not totally bus content...

"On an August morning in 1978, French filmmaker Claude Lelouch mounted a
gyro-stabilized camera to the bumper of a Ferrari 275 GTB and had a friend, a
professional Formula 1 racer, drive at breakneck speed through the heart of
Paris. The film was limited for technical reasons to 10 minutes; the course
was from Porte Dauphine, through the Louvre, to the Basilica of Sacre Coeur.

No streets were closed, for Lelouch was unable to obtain a permit.

The driver completed the course in about 9 minutes, reaching nearly 140 MPH in
some stretches. The footage reveals him running real red lights, nearly
hitting real pedestrians, and driving the wrong way up real one-way streets.

Upon showing the film in public for the first time, Lelouch was arrested. He
has never revealed the identity of the driver, and the film went underground
until a DVD release a few years ago"

On the last minutes of the film, just pay attention to the right side under
the trees (they are parked by the sidewalk)...
It reminded me, Billy P. accident "Guy runs a red light in a pickup and is
halfway into the intersection by the time I see him because I'm too busy
verifying the fact that I have a green light before proceeding thru...."
