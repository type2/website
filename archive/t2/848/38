I think you said you had problems with the AFM,(had to
put it back together after a backfire)this may be your
running problem,(the air flap could be bent) change
the AFM with a good one, this may fix your problems.
Also check closley for air leaks, on the air hoses and
intake manifold. If you have afterfiring(backfiring
out the tailpipe)check for exhaust leaks. Phil
