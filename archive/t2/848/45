Well,, If you have a flat camshaft , you need to replace it anyway... no 
questions asked... did it go flat from not enough oil? ,, maybe your 
bearings are toast too... best have a look inside.

Many time people use what they have on hand... spare parts lying around will 
do.. until they get it all back together and find out it doesn't work ....
Parts are sooo mixed - matched on aircooled VW's

If your bearings are starving for oil ,, they would get hot, I am sure,, but 
wouldn't a simple oil pressure gauge tell you if the pressure is low... in 
fact , the dash light would tell you that the oil pressure is low,, and 
there fore the volume of oil the pump can push may be inadequate, and you 
need a larger pump.

Is you oil pressure dash light working,, does it flicker,, or come on at 
idle?
