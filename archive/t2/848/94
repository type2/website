Subject: Warning : What a bad clutch driven plate will do to your bus

What a clutch driven plate that looses 3 springs and being
perfectionist will have done to my bus

1) december 2005 clutch driven plates looses 3 springs, clutch grinds
->engine drop 02/2006
2) while the engine is out, take the tranny out to have it rebuilt
3) while engine is out, remove left head to fix #3 spark plug thread
4) while the heads are at the machinist, have them surfaced
5) while engine is out, replace the worn oil pump (you've seen my long
posts about that)
6) to fit 26mm oil pump instead of 21mm, need to get a dished cam
instead of the flat cam
7) split case to install dished cam
8) while case is open, do the stuff right -> align bore and cut thrust end
9) while I am at it, balance rods (3 were within 2 grams, one is 21
grams heavier)
10) while I am at it, balance pistons (3 were within 2 grams, one is 8
grams heavier)
11) to preserve the freshly cut case, balance flywheel and pressure plate
12) to preserve the new bearings and optimize oil cooling replace the
old -full of gunk- oil cooler

hopefully there is no 13 !! Summer looks promising :-)

Cheers - Arnaud
