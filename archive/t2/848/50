Hi Mike,

At the driver's seat, just push the shifter forward to get it to reach
your tranny.

Just hook the brake booster to the same place you had it on the 78.

Other vacuum should be the same as you had it on the 78.

 OK here's the deal.  Last month I installed a 2.0 w/carb and tranny from my
 78 sunroof bus into my 74 Westy.
