 Well,, If you have a flat camshaft , you need to
 replace it anyway... no 
 questions asked... did it go flat from not enough
 oil? ,, maybe your

LOL..... no not quite!
He left out the word 'gear' after camshaft.

2 styles of the gears: flat faced and dished face.
This requires 2 different styles of oil pumps.

The 1971 bus dual port engine should have a dished
gear.
The 1970 and back single port should have a flat face
gear.
