Subject: Kadrons on a 1700-1800 Type 4 motor ?

Has anyone put Kadrons on a stock 1700-1800cc type motor in a 72 up bus  ?
 
My friend found a Westy Camper but the carbs are missing , it does have the  
stock manifolds,  
He has some Kadrons from a bug motor  to use , 
 
Anyone do this before ?
 
Thanks for the info
