Subject: Bus sightings

Have sighted two TV ads here in Aus that include busses.

One is an ad for a garage door company which shows an
aging (what else?) hippy couple in front of a blue bay while
they admire their garage door.

The other is an ad for English chef Jamie Oliver for his"Italian tour"
series which ends with a beautiful maroon & cream splitty being
driven through the Italian countryside.

Loverly to see!!
