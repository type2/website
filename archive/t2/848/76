Subject: used LT 195/75R14?

due to a poorly-placed trench cover on the street, one of my 
nearly-new bridgestone rd-603 tires is now toast. still holds air, 
but has big ugly bulge and cracks... NOT safe.  as the bus will be 
parked for an extended period in 3 months, i'd rather not buy a new 
one, so i'm taking a loooooooong shot that someone migt have this (or 
a similarly-sized) tire that they aren't using. maybe you didn't like 
it, excessive tread wear, whatever.

pmail me.
