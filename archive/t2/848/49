Subject: Shift Rod Adjustments

OK here's the deal.  Last month I installed a 2.0 w/carb and tranny from my 
78 sunroof bus into my 74 Westy.  I did not change the shift rod.  I've read 
that most of the time the 6 rib tranny is longer and a new hole needs to be 
drilled into the shift rod to shorten it.  I'm not having that problem.  I can't 
get the shift rod and tranny to meet all the way up.  The holes never line up?? 
Anyone have any good techniques for this??  or what should I check?  
I would also like some info on checking my brake booster and vaccume lines??  
Any VW backyard machanics that would like to help me with these things I'm 
willing to buy beer and pizza.  I live in Coventry, Rhode Island.

Thanks in advance
Mike Q
