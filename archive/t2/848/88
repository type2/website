Subject: Re: Backfiring thru carbs...Real fire!

 >72 Project Westy, stock dual carbs. When I start the
bus, it will idle nicely for a few minutes, then it
starts backfiring up thru the carbs, like REALLY
backfiring, you can see the flames shooting up. What
are some causes of this??? Timing?? Run too rich???
What else??

Sounds like it could be a vacuum leak resulting in running too lean. 
It runs ok while the choke is on richening the mixture then backfires 
when the choke switches off.

Cheers,
