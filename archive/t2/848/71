The intake valve is open during the ignition event. It's likely a valve adjustment problem, timing or like Don says the ignition wires are mixed up (or all three).

When the wires are mixed up the engine usually pinks. If you can't hear it you can visually verify it by turning off the engine and noticing that the last thing the pulley does before stopping is turning backwards a little (spark way too early -> negative torque).
