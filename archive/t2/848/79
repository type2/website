Richard,

Thanks for the heads up on that. I was just on your site, learning from
all the wonderfull information you have there. Thank you!

I just replaced the cap, rotor, and coil. Also fixed some really crappy
wiring on the regulator (not related to this problem). As soon as I can
find some points, those are going in as well.

I'm headed off on a test drive to see if any of those things helped.

Jon
