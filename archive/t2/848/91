RUN LIKE >SATAN< WAS AFTER YOU!!
cuz he is. i have spent more than THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS over the 
past 3 years on my aluminum case.... 88mm pistons, mild cam, heads 
done by a porsche 356 man. it was s'posed to be my 'forever motor' - 
it has been a NIGHTMARE since day one; leaks, required 5 machining 
trips, hours of prep work, 3 teardowns. still leaks like a seive, for 
one. NOTHING fits right on it, it is 30 pounds heavier than Al/Mag, 
and holds heat, o runs 15 degree hotter on a GOOD day.

uttter CRAP, and mine was supposedly 'hand-picked' by the importer as 
a GOOD one. all the true engine builders i have talked to (including 
Crow, who laughed at it) won't touch one.

if i'd ever had $1K to replace it after my initial investment, i 
would have, but i'm broke.  instead i dump a few hunnert here and 
there when something ELSE goes wrong on it.  for now, its valve train 
geometry, but i don't care...  i'm running it til it breaks, then 
setting it on fire.  spread some iron oxide on the case and make a 
thermite bonfire!

on the other hand, my DESIGN was good; bus made it up the big 
mountain on I-17 on way to jerome in FOURTH gear nearly all the way!
