I have a Bra for my Fiero, and one for my GrandAm. I personally don't
particularly care for Bras myself, but they are invaluable to protecting the
front-end of your car from road debris. I usually put them on when I take my
car on a long road trip, and then remove them and put them in storage when
I'm not using it.
