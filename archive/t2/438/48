I am not an expert as I have not dealt with the differences between the
California and Federal wiring in early air-cooled vanagons for many years.
I do remember from dealing with a failed transplant some years ago that
the double relay for the California models was very different from the
double relay for the Federal models and that the two were not at all
interchangable.  As you switch between the two you will certainly need to
match the fuel injection wiring harness to the double relay and the ECU.

                             OOK!
