Subject: A new old-style VW camper from Brazil?

Saw this ad on www.dubs4sale.com and wondered... are they still making
old-style VW campers in Brazil? Anywhere else? Looks like a new late '60s
camper. I WANT ONE!!!!  Price in the ad, unfortunately, was 16,000 British
Pounds! Are these regularly seen in the UK? There's a picture on dubs4sale.
I know the VW Beetle, still made in Mexico until production ended this
summer, was not allowed into the U.S.
 -- pete in U.S.
