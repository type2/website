Subject: RE: [T2] Car Thieves

This is true, they had a big thing about it on the DC news a few months ago.
They recommended that you keep a piece of paper over your vin number. This
way thieves will not have access to your number. It seems to be very easy to
get duplicate keys if you "know" somebody at the dealership. No dealership
will give a duplicate key with just a vin number legally.
