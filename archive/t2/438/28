AS far as I am concerned the 68 has always given me a royal PITA when it
comes to gremlins as far as easiest to fix work on and maintain its got to
be a pre 67 splitty the mail tray comes out and all is right there looking
at you also with only one massive gauge to worry about its pretty simple
deal  compared to the layout and PITA dash on later bays. The 67 is first
year of 12 volt so its the best IMO. I have been having a problem with my 68
westy blowing fuses lately just kinda started all of a sudden so I guess it
times to climb under there with a flashlight and hope that its something
obvious. it seems my turn signal starts the train reaction off fuse blowing
because its always the first to blow then different ones seem to go in a
matter of minutes any ideas of where to look first any info gratefully
accepted. CHAD
