Subject: Another dilema!!

Well I changed out my cold start vavle, It was toast (literaly burned up),  
the screw were loose and looked as if it leaking fuel on the manifold.  Anyway, 
my question is, since my bus won't start still,  Can i check my timing 
eventhough the bus isn't running?  tonight I am going to adjust valves and attempt 
setting points, Never done this before.  Pretty EZ?

                      Thanks for all the feedback!!!!!!!!!!!!!
