Subject: Anyone know where I can get a bull bar?

I want to put a bull bar/brushgaurd on the front of my 76 Westy- there are
lots of deer here in NW PA, and I don't really want to become intimate with
one. Not only would it destroy my Westy, but it would probably cause some
serious injuries to myself, wife, or our two small children.

I'm looking for pics, measurements, or someone who has experience with these.
Hell, I'd even buy one if someone could make it nice and pretty for me.

Thanks,

Nik
