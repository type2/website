Subject: Bus painted

If you've been following along my bus was recently painted and I've put most
of it back together. The finished photos are here...

http://homepage.mac.com/ratwell/78_Westy/PhotoAlbum58.html

...and there are links for the bodywork and painting at the top of the page.

There are over 1000 photos of the bus up on the website and the restoration
is almost complete. Many thanks to everyone help me get this far.
