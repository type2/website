Subject: Re: [T2] pump, tank, what's wrong?

My neighbor recently had the exact same symptoms with his '79. He could hear
the pump cavitate intermitantly and then it started to blow fuses. The
reason for it was that a piece of  rubber from the fuel filler neck had
broken off and fallen into the tank and covered the outlet. When the little
piece would float over the outlet, the pump would starve for fuel and cause
it to overheat and make noise. I dont think he had to pull the tank all the
way out but it sure didnt seem like he had a good time fishing that little
bit of rubber out. He belongs to this list so maybe if he reads this he can
give a more detailed description of how he did it.
