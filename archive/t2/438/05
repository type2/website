Subject: New Westy - Resetting EGR Light...

Listees....

Let me introduce Orange Julius, the newest addition to my VW family:

http://daniel.atiba.com/pics/westy.jpg

She's an 82, got her in San Antonio TX and she drove all the way to 
Nashville without catastrophe. She's totally orginal and unmolested inside 
and out. Even the drivers seat apolstry is in great shape. The nicest VW 
i've owned thus far and she was only 1500 with a rebuilt engine that leaks.

The only problems i've been having is it had a weak idle, but today Alex 
from the list helped me out and we tested for vacumm leaks and all kinds of 
stuff and adjusted the idle and now it's running excelent.

However, the EGR light is on and I can't find the reset button, can someone 
point me in the right direction??

Thanks in advance!!!
