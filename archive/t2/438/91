Subject: luggage rack seal fit

I bought the westyrubber kit from Bus Depot and have had a 2/3 experience with it. The poptop seal is really good. I had the opportunity to compare it to a generic mcmaster seal sold by another vendor and the neoprene bulb is a unique location on the BD seal just as Ron has agrued in the archives so many times. Kudos.

The flat seal is also a very good fit although I think the ends could have be cut a little straighter. It's black on white up there so a sloppy cut really stands out.

My only complaint is with the luggage rack seal. Before my installation I was reading Samba and came across this post:

"I have installed several of the BusDepot seals.  They work well except for the luggage rack seal.  I understand why it shouldn't actually act as seal, but this design allows too much air under the front of the luggage rack when driving.  This causes vibration and a loud howling noise at highway speeds.  I have tried to adjust the fiberglass up and down to widen or narrow the gap, but it doesn't help.  I now place a piece of black foam in the gap near center of the windshield which keeps the fiberglass from vibrating.  I have had this problem on all three I have installed".

I have the same problem as there is a lot more air coming into the bus which isn't a bad thing at time but the extra noise is bothersome.

What have other people done? Some vendors sell the simple vinyl clip like BD which is shaped nothing like the original seal with the steel clips. Others sell the clip with the neoprene bulb. I'm thinking that the bulb is the best solution to get air out with some parts cut out to permit drainage. If you're not sure what I'm talking about, go to www.mcmaster.com and see page 3181.
