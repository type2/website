well someone always needs another opinion. i have had the bra on zapper since 1988. 
i never take it off it took
there were no signs of abrasion or wear till about 7 years into it. and it was just 
around the top edge and under the tire. now i also have little varicose rust veins 
but my vinyl has not faded and my bus looks a lot better with her bra than with out.
;-)
i believe if you wax the car and normally let the underside dry out by loosening the 
edges it should work great.  btw richard it looks like a great color match!!  great job.
