Subject: Mudfaps too low

I just mounted my logo'd mudflaps using Jamie River's bracket making plans
and they seem to be scraping in driveway entrances. I've seen the stock
brackets up close so I think the mudflaps themselves must be too long.

I looked at several pictures of busses and they all seem low but this
brochure shows them mounted up higher:

Has anyone run them through the band saw and cut them a little shorter?
