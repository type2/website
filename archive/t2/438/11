The relay is called "the heater blower relay" and is J14 located on
current tracks 4-6 on the Bentley diagram or at:
http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring/bus-76.jpg
for a 1976 bus.

Looking at the diagram there is no black wire listed but please note
that Bentley is not perfect.  You shouuld also know that the location and
function of that relay changed significantlty during the late 1970s and
that very few buses get to be 25+ years old without any modifications to
their electrical systems.  Under the usual regime a black wire should be
unswitched 12v power.
