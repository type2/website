Subject: Fuel pump ?

i installed my mechanical fuel pump the other day before reading the
bentley and then on reading type2 web page i noticed where it said to fill
the pump with grease.  is this procedure correct for the t4 engine also and
if so,  what brand and type grease do the gurus recommend?
