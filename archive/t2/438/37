Hi everyone,
Well living buy the the lake has proved I don't really use my van as much as
I would like to.  So I'm putting for sale here so I can start a new project, 
then to the aution sites but would love to see some one who will use it.  It's
an 81 seven passenger 4spd with 9k on the motor newer parts installed: fuel
lines, fuel pump, dis cap, rotor,  points, condenser, fuel filter, afm, fuel
line and grommets above tank,  newer tank,  shifter bushings,  rear bumper, 
newer paint the good ppg stuff but not perfect,  air filter, plugs ect.  Runs
good leaks some oil  compression test in april showed about 130 all around. 
Slider door has a crack in zink filler.  No cheap bondo was used only zink
filler
and was not a rust bucket before body work.  Would like to sell quick.  Make
a reasonable offer and it will be yours.  VT does not require a title so check
you local laws.   Would make a great parts runner or convert to a camper. Van
is in colchester VT. 
Thanks
Kevin
