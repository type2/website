Subject: cv joint vibration?

Hi- I've got a 77 Bus. I replaced the boots and repacked my cv joints on the 
right side. I now have a vibration when driving, it is most noticable at around 
45 mph and above. the only thing i can think of is that maybe i switched the 
orientation of the CV when i put it back in, would this matter? thanks
