> Just saw the headline "Bombing at UN's Iraq HQ" on www.msn.com and saw a
yellow/green VW Bug in the rubble.  It looked like it could still run but on
the lighter side at least it wasn't a Bus.

It's been in most of the video shown on the cable network news feeds.  From
what I could see, it looks like it caught at least some of the blast.
