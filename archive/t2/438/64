Subject: Re: pump, tank, what's wrong?

Hello,
Yes, I too would like to know what I can do to fish something nebulous outta
the fuel tank as well.  My bus is undergoing an >>extremely<< frustrating
problem where a couple weeks ago it became increasingly starved for fuel to
the point of me getting nothing when trying to accelerate to shift
(although it idled fine).  My tank inlet was diagnosed as having been
clogged by a foreign object a few years ago, and it was blown out with air
at that time.  I believe this is a reoccurrence of the same problem.
However, I haven't heard any noises from the fuel pump as others have
described.  Anyway, I can't go on not wanting to drive my bus for fear of it
happening again and stranding me in some inconvenient place (which I know
that if it can happen, it will) and don't want to wait for it to happen
again.  So, if anyone out there can provide guidance on how to remove
foregin objects from the tank, I'd love to hear it and would greatly
appreciate it.
