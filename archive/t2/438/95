There is an adjustment on top of the AFM, sometimes under a blue cap that has to come out. The screw can require a flat blade screwdriver or an allen key.

Turning CCW, undoes the screw letting more air bypass, leaning out the mixture. CW makes it richer.

I think folks just lean it out until it stumbles then turn the screw the other way. It's not very accurate that's for sure.

With the analyzer (just spend 1/2 hr on labor at the mechanic shop) you can set the %CO according to the label on the engine lid (or listed in Bentley). General wisdom says that 1% and below is too lean and makes the heads run too hot resulting in valve problems and premature head failure. A %CO setting of 1.5-2% seems to be safe balancing fuel economy with power while still allows you to pass smog tests if that's an issue for you.

You would want to check the results from your setting at idle and at 2500rpm and higher to see that you're not leaning on high in the rpm range. I don't know how the set until stumble method can help you achieve this.
