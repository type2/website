I had a similar experience recently although with the bigger engine.

I don't enjoy the Interstate highways as I prefer to drive 65mph and still find I get passed by everyone. The trucks are the worst because I can't stay ahead of them despite the regulation that they drive 10mph slower espeically at night in many places and the road spray from them is terrible. At least with the shocks and sway-bars I've got setup the bus is far more controllable at those speeds especially on sweeping curves.

The speed limits up in Canada were 50-55mph and the bus was clearly built in an era to drive those speeds. In a few places like Hwy 1 and the the Coquihalla the speeds were 65-70mph and a little tougher to keep up especially with grades and long sections without patrols. Putting around town at 30mph was a real pleasure espeicially in Victoria with good weather and the windows down.

On the trip back US101 took must longer but I found my speed dropping to 55mph many times and not noticing.
