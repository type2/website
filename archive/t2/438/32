Subject: nose replacement

Sure, its a long shot, but what would you estimate a full replacement of the 
nose section on a bus?

just the outside skin I guess.

Someone crashed into me and pushed in my nose, and the estimator is looking 
at around $2500 to get a new nose section and have it installed and painted.

does that sound about right?

maybe I should be emailing the metwiz while im at it.

except im in SF, so id never actually be able to get it there to be 
repaired. Id just like an idea if this is about right, or if im getting 
lower or higher what it should take.


unfortunately, with my current mechanic woes, I may have to take this money 
and put it into that instead, but I hate the idea of driving around with my 
nose bumped in.

note - my headlights are still forward facing and working (as well as the 
blinkers)
