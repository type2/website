Subject: gear oil

It had been mentioned to me that there is a rumor about GL-5 gear oil being
potentially corrosive to VW trannys, and that GL-4 was the way to avoid
this. Well, having already replaced my awful, rancid old gear oil with the
only kind available to me at auto supply stores, GL-5, I took this matter up
with my mechanic.

My mechanic was intrigued, but he didn't know. He called a local shop that
does nothing but VW tansaxles, Ron's Transaxles, for research. Here is what
they had to say...

Late Rabbits and Dashers have some sort of a molly-synchro unit in their
second gear that is damaged by GL-5 formulations; it corrodes them.
According to these folks, though, our T2 Volks have naught to worry from
using any of the readily avilable GL-5 formulations (synthetic or otherwise)
out there. GL-5 or something called RedLine are what are recommended for our
old Dubbies.

I understand that oils and such have Fire potential on the List; I am not
intending to start a flame war. But, I felt this was valuable information to
pass along from people who do nothing but VW transaxles. I couldn't find
GL-4 anywhere, and it was driving me nuts with worry. I actually had a
nightmare about her gears corroding through last night. (Don't ask me how I
wound up inside the transmission, but I did.) Now, I am unconcerned and will
contiue on with what's already in there.

Cheers,
