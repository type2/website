Hiya Don,

Your best bet would be to try your local (hopefully cooperative) VW dealer.  
Many of the smaller parts are still in inventory.  Your local dealer will have 
exploded views of the sliding door hinge link assembly.  So, all you have to 
do is point and say, "I want".  That's exactly what I did to get the small 
return spring in the front door latch.

Another thought is your local full service Ace Hardware store.  These stores 
are treasures!  They will have a full assortment of springs.  All you'll have 
to do is find a close match.  Been there - done that- was great.

If those are no goes, then you might be doomed to buying the the entire SDHLA 
from a boneyard.  And that's an expensive proposition at around $50.00 for 
what amounts to (for you) a spring.
