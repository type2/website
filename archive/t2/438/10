Subject: Fuel pump re-build kit

I want to re-build the fuel pump in Ashley's 1600 Type 1 engine. Volksworld
magazine showed how to do this in a recent issue but didn't bother
mentioning a supplier. This is probably because the re-build kit is NLA
according to most people :-((

I know I could just buy a new pump but they don't look right and I'd rather
re-build the original VW item on my engine. I suspect it isn't pumping as
well as it should do and anyway, it's one of the few bits I haven't worked
over so I'd like to do this before it needs it.

Has anyone got a kit they would sell or the name of a supplier ?

I'm in the UK but postage or trade of parts (no you can't have a new bus,
even though we can buy them !) can be arranged.

Thanks

Phil
