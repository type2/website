Subject: '86 Camper GL for Sale - Montreal, Quebec

Part II

BTW the price of my '86 is $10,000 CAN / $6,000 USD for those who are
interested.  Also the PO re-built the engine recently before passing away,
so all is in tip top shape.  This will be a good one for whoever buys it!

Also to clarify the missing symbol is the small one in back, and actually
the VW is still there but part of the volkswagen came off somehow.  These
are 10$ new to replace.  Also the screen is very good and can be left, but
there is a 1.5" cut in the middle which you can happily leave forever if
you want.  Like I could fix it soon but would rather just leave it and keep
the price a wee bit lower.

Thanks and please don't hesitate to contact me.
