Thanks, Dan . . .

Yes, I have the 'mexican' blue coil.  It looks so pretty!!

I will do that first, swap off this pretty blue coil for the work horse that 
was on the VW before.

While my friend and I were playing with the compression checks the first 
time, the ignition was left on for a bit of time.  I asked the other VW'er 
if the coil was hot.  He put  his hand on it and went >>>  HOT!!!   I took 
his word for it  ;-)

It is just funky that the VW went bad just after I put the plugs in, but 
considering the circumstances (NGK plugs out because of reduced MPG, and 
Bosch Platinum in because I believe in them...) it could be the coil was not 
providing enough "whatever" to the NGK, and was just dying on the new Bosch 
Platinum's.

I will try this first because . . .  it is the easiest test to do !

Barry sends many thanks, this may be the answer....
