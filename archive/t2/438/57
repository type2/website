Subject: Re: [T2] cv joint vibration?

The only orientation is on the outer part of the CVJ. There is a groove near 
the edge on the outside. The groove on the upper CVJ needs to face the 
differential. The groove on the lower one needs to face the wheel. I don't know if 
that would make the noise though. Did you inspect the joints before you put them 
back together? It seems to me that when you start working on or replacing 
parts, it just never stays confined to the orignal ;o).
