Subject: RE: [T2] Car Thieves

I think this is a hoax. For example, if I loose the key to my truck, I have
to give them a key plate code that came with the vehicle. I don't think any
dealership would be stupid enough to hand out the key to a car with out some
sort of verification...
 Not to mention, what if the owner of the vehicle put a new ignition switch
in...I suppose the car can be hotwired though :-(
