Subject: Re: [T2] installing an O2 sensor and A/F meter

Paul,

Just finished going thru this last week on my new engine.
Go to a muffler shop that does "custom" work and buy an o2
bung from them($3.00).  It is the right shape and depth and
sealing surface for the sensor.  You could probably take your
manifold to them and they would weld it in for you for a reasonable charge 
as well.

Forget midas and seeburg...they are just replacement parts places.

I did mine like one of the other guys(Scott Lyons) I think and put it in
the exhaust manifold for #3(72-74 heater boxes)...would have been easier
if I had kept my 78 exhaust system.

Cheers, dave

It looks like typical spark plug threads.  those are 14 mm?   Do I have to use a special weld-on or can I weld a nut that is the right size?
