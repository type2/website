I won't even pretend to know anything about any VW later than '71, but I =
had an experience worth telling about.=20
One night I went out with our daughter in the '67 VW sedan, and along =
the way, pretty far from home, the engine started running really rough =
and wierd. I was on a pretty dark stretch of road, and I came to a stop =
at the side of the road. When I had determined that the bug would idle =
by itself, I put on the hand brake and went around back and opened the =
engine lid. What I saw amazed me.. Lovely little blue sparks were giving =
me a light show all over the engine compartment. There were a few places =
at which the spark plug wires had begun to ground out and were arcing =
against the engine shrouding. I only had to reposition those wires a bit =
and I was able to get back on the road. Neoprene, rubber, plastic and =
other materials are great insulators until they break down. Heat, oil =
and age do them in. I replaced the spark plug wires in the next few days =
and I had no more problems. It was scary breaking down on a dark road, =
but if it hadn't been dark I wouldn't have found the reason for the =
problem. Those plug wires may not have a visible fault in them, but the =
neoprene has to have absolute integrity to pass 10,000 or so volts to =
the spark plug without allowing some of the current to jump to other =
potential grounds.=20
In your case, it could be a problem with the primary wire leading to the =
coil or the spark plug wires are failing.=20
It is really the same with all things that break.. the owners and =
operators are dumbstruck when something goes wrong.. as if it never =
should, just because it worked fine the day before. Sometimes playing =
back previous activities will reveal the problem and cause.. sometimes, =
it will lead you up a wrong path.=20
In my experience, a temperature sensor is a ground-sending unit that =
would have nothing to do with ignition, but if you have computerized =
ignition, all bets are off. I only know the old stuff. Maybe you =
unknowingly brought a defective wire up against a potential ground when =
you checked things in your engine compartment.=20
Most oil and temperature senders send a ground. Anywhere that that wire =
lead can be grounded can give you a false alarm or problem like this.. =
We recently got a big-time oil light alert, all over a grounded lead =
which had been rubbed or damaged. Very frequently, there is a tiny =
opening in the wire sheath that we can not even see, or a rubbed, =
cracked or melted bit of wire sheathing that is not readily observed. =
Examine all wires closely, rolling them over and feeling them.. These =
can cause mysterious blown fuses, rough idling and ignition problems. =
Remember, a car is an object in motion, and as it moves around, things =
shift slightly.. a damaged or loose wire can come into and go out of =
contact intermittently. Because of this, it is not uncommon that we =
inspect or do something in the engine compartment and we unknowingly =
push a defective wire into contact with the chassis, engine or other =
source of a ground.=20
One more thing regarding inspection of wires in DC circuitry.. Sometimes =
you can find the bad spot when you feel a hardened or discolored section =
of wire, so pay close attention to those.=20
