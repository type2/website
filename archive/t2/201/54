Subject: What n Where does this go?

Listers-

Trying to put back together an 82 2.0 that the PO has carb'd 
(many questions to come on this) and am trying to reconnect the electricals.
I have a round plug with three connectors that appears to be coming from the
tranny (but I know diddly about any VW engines). Here's a really poor
