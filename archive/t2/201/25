Depending on how you look at are we in it.  One of winnebagos products 
is the Rialta (VW) and they do all of the eurovan camper models.  The 
modern westy.  There is also an increase in restoration and purchasing 
of older models.  Look at what has been happening to prices on 70s and 
80s  T2 aircooled campers in parts of the country.  Look at how many T2 
camper and variants are still around and look at how many were 
produced.  Massive when you consider population at that time. Also most 
larger RV's are diesel not gas.  Most of the newer winn and star 
machines (small ones) are all diesel based usually on a HD van base.  
All larger ones are based on passenger bus carriages with diesel engines 
on them.  The bare chassis with engine is delivered to a plant that does 
the work to spec.  Whether it is a band touring bus or a family camper 
home.
