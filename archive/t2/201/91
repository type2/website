Subject: Re: [T2] adjustment screws

Thanks for all the replies.  I've searched around for the screws because the
dealer doesn't carry them.

I've learned that some after-market screws aren't hardened to match the
valve stems: they are too hard and cause valve stem wear prematurely.  The
Genuine VW screw has the correct hardness.

How can I tell if this screw is the correct hardness?
