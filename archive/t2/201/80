Subject: towing capacity

What if any is the max towing capacity for a 70 with a 1600dp?
I am looking at towing a small 15' fiberglass boat and a utility trailer
with a riding mower. (at different times of course)
Also I need some technical help with an outboard motor question, does anyone
know of a good site?
Later,
