Subject: Re: [T2] "T" fitting

catalog shows that part number in use from 212 2000 001 to 217 2300 000 
which is aug 1 1971 to 31 july 1977.  there were two evap canisters 
which is the change made with the 78 model year.  If your bus was in the 
last few months of the 77 model year, same as with any vehicle, dont 
trust the books. get a visual on what you have.  if you dont see the 
same evap canister then your bus probably has the other setup that uses 
a different t fitting which has a generic number rather than a VW part 
number.  It appears to located right near the cannister which is a 
upright cylinder.
