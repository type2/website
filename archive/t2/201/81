Hi... I just now joined the list. My husband and I own two '71 Type 2
Transporters...(Soon to add a third...yes, we are addicts, but this is a =
20
year transportation plan).
In response to this question, how to measure engine temps painlessly, I =
have
found something excellent!..
It's a small handheld Cooper brand remote IR sensor with a laser spotter =
and
a digital readout. I paid about $65 for mine, and I got it on eBay. When =
I
first bought it, it was more of a toy than anything else, and I didn't
really know what I would do with it.. I kicked myself for being =
frivolous
and wasteful. But it happens that I soon bought the second of our buses =
on
eBay shortly thereafter, and it was up in Couer d' Alene, ID (We are in =
Los
Angeles), with a blown engine. We took a turnkey engine up there in the
first bus, installed it in a day, and camped on the 1,600 mile trip =
back.
Thankfully, I had the foresight to pack the little remote IR sensor..
Nothing eventful happened on that trip with either bus, but that sensor =
gave
me a lot of peace of mind, because we went through some really KILLER =
heat
on the way back through southwestern Utah and through Las Vegas. We were
able to check our engines ACTUAL temperature at every stop.
The IR remote sensor also made for many fun science projects, comparing =
the
engine temperatures between the two vehicles in different conditions =
(almost
identical at all times), different locales on the engines, and we even =
used
this thing to measure the temperatures of thermal features in =
Yellowstone
National Park!.. 100% ecologically safe, other than the AA batteries =
needed!
If you want to get one for yourself, you might try eBay, or I have heard
that Radio Shack just came out with such a unit. There are also huge =
devices
that do the same job but look like a policeman's speed gun. I would =
avoid
those, unless you're trying to impress someone. But the little handheld =
is
about the size of a banana or sweet potato, and it is very, very cool!   =
