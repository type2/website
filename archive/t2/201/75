Hey there Rich,

July is a slow month show wise in the Northeast, but LiMBO has
Transporters by the Tunnel happening July 19th - 21th. It's in the
Berkshires (in western MA), so it sould be that long of a ride for
you.

The flyer is here: http://www.bcn.net/~limbo/flyer2001.html

LiMBO's main page is here: http://bcn.net/~limbo/ check out their
events page.

Another good source for Northeast show info is : 
http://www.gti16v.org/shoinfo.htm#shoindex

Yep, I know the last link is a watercooled site, but hey, you get
your info were you can (and I think I'd look good in a corrado 8-)

Hope this helps,
