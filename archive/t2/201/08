Subject: scored flywheel

I'm in the middle of a rebuild and decided to change the clutch while I'm
at it.  After removing the clutch (which was pretty well worn), I
discovered that the flywheel was full of score marks.  Should I have the
flywheel resurfaced?  There aren't any gouges or anything like that... can
the flywheel be cleaned?  How does one tell that it is time to go to the
machine shop?
