Subject: This seems to be the answer re GL4/GL5 trans lube.

Interesting. With the 12 volt current grounded to the motor/transaxle
and body, and disimilar metals mating up in the gearbox, this reminds me
of the sort of electro-chemical corrosion you find in a marine
environment, usually mistakenly called electrolysis. When two disimilar
metals come together in the presence of an electrical charge, one of
them  is usually going to want to corrode, or be sacrificed (I think
it's the metal that conducts current best, but it may be the other way
around). On a boat with disimilar metals mated below the waterline
(props to shafts, say), one usually attaches a zinc diode, which becomes
sacrificial and is eaten away so the working metals will stay healthy. I
recall early aluminum-hulled racing sailboats in particular had problems
of this nature. All this makes me wonder whether the GL5 is just somehow
a better conductor of electricity, or maybe the GL4 a worse one. Either
way, somehow the zinc seems to have become sacrificial with the addition
of whatever was in G5 that was not in G4.
