Subject: floor pan replacement and part question

Hi Listees!!

Now that I have my 72 westy home, I have started to dive into it and look at 
what all needs to be done and in what order.  In both the driver and 
passenger sides, where one's feet go - what I would call a floor plate, or 
floor pan, I can see daylight - it has rusted through and needs to be 
replaced.  I do not want to go the fiberglass route, and would rather cut out 
and weld in a replacement.  My bus is a 1972.  Wolfsburg West has a 1973-1979 
floor plate for $125, but none for my year.  The Bus Depot has what they 
call "Belly Pan, Under Front Cab Area, 68-79 Bus" for $34.95, but there is 
not a picture.  Is this what I need?  Why is there an overlap of years 
between the two parts?  Why is there such a price difference?

Thanks Always!
Jen
