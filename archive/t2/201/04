Subject: Re: [T2] PAINTING?????? WELDING?? GAHHH

I did the same with good results. My paint job is about 2-3 years old now. 
The bus lives outside on the sunny side of the house in the carport. The 
Paint is holding up well except where I have damaged it with my little 
one's toys or my toys, etc.

You can pay someone to do it for you, or spend a bit less money to learn to 
do it yourself (and buy some tools) and have a skill that you can use on 
every vehicle to need to paint in the future. The first one may not be 
perfect but with some care I think most of us will get a good driver paint 
job.

Be warned though - it is alot of work. It is hot, noisy, and dirty work. I 
would not spend the money on the best materials for the first paint job - 
just average materials. Yes the best materials are the best BUT for me the 
best materials would not have looked any better than the economy stuff.
