Subject: gauge and carb questions


Esteemed list,

In hooking up my VDO oil pressure gauge, the needle pegs anytime it gets
+12V.  Is this a bad gauge?  I now have 2 that do this.  Has anyone else
experienced this?

I need help with the wiring of the CHT gauge as well.  There are only two
terminals on the gauge: + and - (not counting the light bulb).  I would
expect 4 terminals: +, -, and the two from the sender.  From the VDO sender
there are two wires.  Does the sender go in series? Which side?

These have stumped me for a while.  I have had these 2 gauges since 1999
have always just used a sump sender for oil temp.  I would prefer to get
these working, esp. oil pressure so I can test pressure before firing up the
new engine--I am now a member of the "idiot light doesn't go out" club when
I crank it.  I know the VDO dual sender has a higher cutoff than stock
though, I am tempted to give it spark anyway (after I fix the problem
described below), because I know there is oil flowing through the remote
filter.  Per list CW when I start it I will run it at 2000 rpm for 20
minutes to break in the new Engle 110 cam.

Also, I installed a used Solex progressive on my fresh rebuild Type 1 in a
'70 Westy.  Does anyone know what car Solex progressives were new on? Anyone
ever used one of these?  The fuel inlet banjo fitting is leaking and I need
some seals for it (right now all it has are metal washers but I assume there
has to be something there). Is there a cheap solution for fuel gaskets, some
readily available rebuild kit or variety pack?

Many thanks in advance,
Will
