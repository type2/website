Me too. I echo your thoughts exactly Todle. Except for the mountains, not
many here in Southeastern NC.
I would also like to know what is my best choice to monitor temp.
after driving for about 2 hours in heavy traffic, I filled up and checked
the oil. I could barely hold the dipstick. If I remember that is a very
loose rule of thumb as to whether or not the engine is too hot.
Later,
