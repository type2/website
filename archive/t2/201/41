Ok, I finally figured out that I had my vac lines on my dizzy backwards! =
 Now, that they are in the right place, my bus does something odd.  when =
I start it, it idles at about 750-900 RPM then after about 30 secs. it =
jumps up to what i am guessing 1200 RPM or so.  Any thoughts on what =
would cause this?  How dependent is idle speed on vaccuum?  Could this =
also have something to do with the fact that I adjusted my fuel pressure =
regualtor?
