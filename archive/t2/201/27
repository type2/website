Subject: oil temperature--engine temperature--My experiences FWIW

Recent posts on oil temp and Gene Berg senders made me think I should share=
 my experience=2E  This is my experience w=2F my 1970 Westfalia=2E  I am no=

Several years ago=2C I replaced my 1600sp w=2F a 1600dp =28the dp had semi =
hemi heads--a modification designed to reduce compression to something in t=

1=29  My GB dipstick sender and my VDO sump sender always gave different re=

2=29  For oil=2C 225 deg=2E F  plus is too hot=2E  According to GB and nume=

 this problem=2E  However=2C if the oil is 225 deg F in the sump=2C its lik=
