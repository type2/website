Subject: Re: [T2] Bus pulls to on side

>>Bus slighty pulls to the right while driving. Pulls relatively hard when
braking. Any Ideas?<<

sounds like you might need an alighnment. but it's not necessarily your
suspension that is causing the problem.

just a guess but a sticking brake caliper could be the culprit. stick/drags
some while driving and sticks/drags much more during braking, which can
cause the behavior you describe. specifically check the right side - are the
pads (or shoes if you have a 68-70) worn further down on that side? but
check both sides just to be safe. now this doesnt mean the caliper is bad -
check the flex hose. it can get clogged & cause the caliper or wheel
cylinder to stick. AMHIK. ;-)

>>Are there any good websites for a step by step inspection of the front
end?<<

not sure but the best thing that worked for me was a suspension course at my
local community college. i learned alot about cars in general & had a cool
teacher that let me rebuild the front suspension on my last bus.

hope that helps,
