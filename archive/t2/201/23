More information from a Type3 page.  I guess MT1 means manual transmission?

Notes about fluids

Standard VW Type 3 Transaxle
        GL-4

Automatic VW Type 3 Transaxle:
        GL-5 for the Differential
        Dexron I, II or III ATF (or Mercon) for the Transmission
Use synthetic whenever possible!

Additional notes:
Since we were getting a variety of opinions on the GL-4 vs GL-5 debate, I 
emailed Bob Hoover. Here is his response:
