Will,

All of the VDO oil pressure gauges I have seen do this when they first
come on and you havent cranked the engine.
Once you crank it it should start reading the correct pressure.

Esteemed list,

In hooking up my VDO oil pressure gauge, the needle pegs anytime it gets
+12V.  Is this a bad gauge?  I now have 2 that do this.  Has anyone else
experienced this?
