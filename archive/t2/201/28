Smaller pulley faster fan but more power to spin it.

And the reverse for the larger pulley.

Seems like Berg said they tried several different pulley sizes and the 
stock size worked best. Least power, best cooling, etc.

I think he was saying that due to the increased power requirements of the 
pulley, the engine made as much more heat as the faster fan carried away. 
No advantage.
