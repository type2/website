Subject: Re: [T2] VWofA hassle;  new aftermarket crankshaft pulley

Saw that pulley.  Intrigued me as to why would that be better than the 
other way.  then i for some reason flashed back to physics and 
remembered that the larger pulley on the primary will increase the rate 
of turn of the secondary but with less power needed at the primary than 
if you shrank the secondary to do the same result.  dont remember the 
fancy equations for it though.
