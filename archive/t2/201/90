Subject: Idle and Stuttering - 78 2.0L F/I

I'm no expert, but maybe your investigation could at least be narrowed
down to one cylinder. I would let it idle until it warms up, then shut
it off and try disconnecting one plug wire at a time as you restart. If
you pull one of the plug wires and nothing changes, you've found the
problem cylinder. So then check that plug, distributor cap contact and
the cap itself for cracks, plug wire and plug wire end for cracks. Also,
look in the engine compartment when it's dark and see if you can see any
spark jumping to ground while your rev. Also be sure to check the No 11
ground from the FI controller where it grounds to the case to see if
it's gunged up. That can cause almost anything. If all that looks good,
I'd try a tank of Chevron with Techron, or a tank of any good gas with a
bottle of good FI additive before I did anything else with the FI
system, because like for you, they're magic to me.

Good luck!
