Subject: Later Westy Table "pivot leg" FS

Greetings List -

The Junkyard Dogs were kind to me, and I bought a later Westy table "leg" 
and anchor mounts in case someone needs it.

It's for the table that pivots into position. I don't know which years, but 
if you need one, you'll know what I mean. I do not have the table portion. 
There is one leg (with the 90 degree bend), and two anchor mounts. $20 
unmarked (US).

Please, let's try for the So.Cal. bussers first (I hate shipping things). 
I'll re-post in a week or so if no locals want it.

P.S. More STB stickers arriving within a week. Do you have yours?
