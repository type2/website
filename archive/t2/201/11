Subject: Re: [T2] Back brake stuck onto wheel

This also happens to me on occasion.  Usually when its humid out or
rather hot also.  Like Andy states, the only way I have been able to get
them to break loose is by putting it in gear (1st seems to work better
than reverse) and throttle up until it pops.  I know this can't be good
and hopefully this will go away when I rebuild my brakes.  I also tried
tapping on the with the mallot but that didn't work out.
