Subject: Re: [T2] Gauge selection - design - advice

OK, so I have called three vendors with my questions on the gauges and 
options available for each.
So far, answers given to me have been plucked from out there in "not so 
bright" land.

It looks like I am really needing the wisdom of the list to walk me through 
this selection / installation recommendation process.
