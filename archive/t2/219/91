If your 83 westy is aircooled then you have a 2L  H4 type CV engine.  
The  83 year from august to december was the last of the aircooled 
vanagons.  The engine and setup was identical from 80 to 83 for the 
aircooled vanagons.  in 83 model  year the watercooled engine was 
introduced (with heads that failed more often than aircooled heads.)  
Basically there were  very few changes between any of the 80 to 83 
westies.
