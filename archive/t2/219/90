The 1.9 is the 83.5 waterpumper if I'm correct. The vanagon became watercooled halfway thruough 1983.

Bentley Publishers for the offical VW service manual.

Run what's specified by the Bentley as stock. You'll be happiest. Welcome Andrew, this list is a great resource, I know cuz I started as a total newbie. Believe in what you're told here and you'll come out all right. I'm not one of the experts, but you'll figure out who they are, and I regurgitate their wisdom. It's worked for me.
