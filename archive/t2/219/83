I've got $150 in my kit (NOS second hand), $200 for the engine and tranny 
(running engine, ~60K miles), $100 for misc so far.

I've shopped very carefully and waited for the right deals to come along. I 
have not bought my exhaust parts yet or any misc tuneup parts or rebuilt 
the carbs yet. I'll also need a rebuilt crnak pulley and rebuilt flywheel 
for another $150.

On the other end of the spectrum the transplant kit new is $650, the engine 
rebuilt just so is $2000+, rebuilt tranny $750, and misc $250. I'm 
estimating the numbers.
