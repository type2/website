Subject: 83 Westy engine identification and extra books

Hello, I just joined the list, thanks for having me.  

I just purchased an 83 westy and I am having trouble
finding good information on the engine.  Per the
library, I found that the CV stamped on my crank is
correct for that year, a 2.0L.  However, when I go to
the parts store, they ask me if I have a 1.9L or a 2L.
 Is there any way to tell if it is a 1.9 such as a
marking or distinct characteristic?  

Also, I have the haynes manual for an 80-83 air cooled
vanagon.  Although much of the book is useful, the
engine in the book does not look the same as the
engine in my car.  Most notable is the book has the
air filter directly over the center of the engine,
while my engine has the airfilter to the far right of
the engine compartment. Is there a book that has a
more specific slant toward the engine that I have?  

Finally, where would be the best place to get a hotter
bosch coil, the sites recommended don't offer the
hotter red and black coil.
