Subject: Oil Temps.

Further to the recent posts regarding oil temps, the original sticker in the
engine bay of my '77 bus (2.0L) states oil temp. to be between 50 and 70deg
C (~150-180F). In my experience this is unachievable!! Even the beetle (1500
type 1) which runs much cooler than my bus the oil runs around 75C (~190F).
They must have extra good air for cooling in Germany.
