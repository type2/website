Subject: Removing the side cover necessary to replace side window?

I'm outside looking at the rear drivers side window that some idiot smashed
for me, and the side cover runs along just underneath it on the very edge of
the seal. Is it necessary to remove it to replace the window?? Also, if so,
it appears to be pretty much arc-welded on there, I got one screw out, need
to remove the other, then what???
Thanks,
Courtney
