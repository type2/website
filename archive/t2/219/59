Subject: goodbye bus!!!

well i just got back from selling my bus :(

anyway, the new owners are heading from Raleigh-Durham up
to Dayton, OH.  so, A.I.R.S. members be ready.

i hated to give it up since it is such a solid running
bus. i just need more camping space for me, the SO & the
rugrats.

so the search for a new bus begins...
