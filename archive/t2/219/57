Subject: *&(%!! vandals smashed the side window on my Westy.

Any tricks to replacing the drivers side rear window (behind the little vent
one) on my 79 Westy? I see I have to take the cabinet out to get all the
little bitty pieces etc., but does anyone know what rubber part no. I need
for this window? I can get one for 40 dollars at the wrecker if I show them
cash (heh heh), no paper trail for the taxman.
