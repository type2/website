As long as you can stay ahead of the leak you can drive it forever. I drove 
my Type IV powered Beetle from VA to TN towing a Hyundai. The bolt for the 
thermostat cable on the Type IV was gone (didn't have the thermostat 
controlled warmup) and it leaked the whole way home. I lost a CASE of oil 
in the process. I could not figure out where the oil was coming from (and 
didn't 'til a year later when I pulled the engine down - DUH!).

That Hyundai (got the car on trade, good deal for me $$$) was COVERED in 
oil. Took a long day at the car wash to get it all off. Bet that car NEVER 
rusted after I sold it.
