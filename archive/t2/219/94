Subject: Cackling sound during deceleration

My engine seems to idle and accelerate smoothly.  When
I take my foot off of the gas, it decelrates until it
gets to the the lower end of the rpm range, then makes
a slight crackling, cackling sound.  Is this a problem
of backfire, valve timing, or something else?  Keep in
mind I am in colorado and the air is thin up here.  If
I did have a rich fuel mixture, how do I adjust that?
