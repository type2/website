Great show on pbs from time to time, GM bought up the bus companies and then
convinced the municipalities how much more economical and flexible bus mass
transit was.Cities poured money into buses and none into maintenance for
tracks so it was easy to point out how much better the ride was in a bus.
Like always politicians become a victim of their own greed.
