I wouldn't freak if the oil temp reaches 225F on a hot (95 F) day loaded with 
camping stuff day driving through hills, though it wouldn't be my favorite.  
I'd change the oil and adjust the valves when I got home, and hand check the 
end play.  they say 220F is okay for yr oil, but it breaks down about 225 or 
230, and how accurate is your thermostat?   engine should be okay if the oil 
lubes everything properly right?  

thermostats open at 65 or 75 C (some do one, some the other).  your engine is 
warmed up at about 165 F, so you dont really want it cooler than that.

<< I have asked about oil temps before and have gotten so many different 
answers
 ranging from "oil temp should be AT LEAST 210*.." to "best range is
 180-200*.."
 So, here is a VERY specific question I would like to ask the EXPERTS:
 On my way home from HCBF (thanks Buddah!) I was driving my 71 Westy (1600 DP)
 through the mountains of Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky. Outside air temps
 were HOT like 94* fahrenheit. When I would cruise the bus at 55 MPH the oil
 temp hovered right around 220*.  On the long uphills it would goto about 225*
 or if i tried to push it to 60 MPH, it would also climb to about 225*. 

So is 220* too hot for my 1600 DP??

(normal day-to-day in outside temperature below
 80*, the oil temp seldom reaches 200*, usually hangs out about 195*.)
 The bus ran great the whole time, 10 hours one way! My only concern was 
engine
 temp, so I'd like to know once and for all if I should be concerned about
 this. >>
