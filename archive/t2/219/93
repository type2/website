As you know, the Vanagon switched over from an air-cooled engine (2 litre,
actually 1970cc's) to water-cooled during the 1983 model year.  If your
Vanagon is air-cooled, it should have engine code letters "CV" stamped on
the case right near the oil breather.  You have the "2L" engine.

This book actually has complete information for your vehicle, but it also
has information about Europe-only vehicles that don't apply to your car.
When reading the manual you'll need to keep track of whether it's talking
about USA or Europe models.  The "Volkswagen Vanagon Official Factory Repair
Manual" published by Bentley covers your vehicle, as well as all other
"flavors" of Vanagons produced.  The best manual out there, in my opinion,
for a novice mechanic is the Clymer "VW Vanagon" manual; it's specific to
USA air-cooled Vanagons and has step-by-step proceedures, where the Bentley
generally doesn't since it's mainly a referance manual for VW mechanics.
Frankly, I have all 3 manuals and sometimes refer to them all!

Why would you want a "hotter" coil?  The standard coil provides sufficient
spark to ignite a proper fuel mixture in a mechanically-sound engine and
there's nothing to be gained (and $'s to be lost) by changing the coil.
