Subject: [T2] *&(%!! vandals smashed the side window on my Westy.

>>Any tricks to replacing the drivers side rear window
 (behind the little vent one) on my 79 Westy?<<

yes. do yourself a favor & just get a one-piece glass like is on the
other side.  the seal is cheaper & you won't have
any rust issues with the little vent wing window.

just MHO.
