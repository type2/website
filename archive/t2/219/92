Before running that new pump from what you described i would first 
manually turn the engine to get the maximum  exposure for the push rod.  
then measure that height for approx 1/2 inch exposure.  If it is higher 
than that you will destroy another pump.  and as the pump is already at 
max..no fuel out.
