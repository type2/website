Hoping to reach Billy with this.
If your 82 Westy has an FI, try the wireloom from the 82.
I've got an extra 80-83 wireloom but I'm not sure it will fit a 79, I
know it will plug into a 78 AFM with 7 pins. They all pretty much use the
standard components like resistor, double relay, control head, temp
sender, thermo time switch and idle compensator valve.
