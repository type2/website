I had heard a number of times that General Motors actually bought up all
the cable-car and trolleys in the US and ripped up the tracks -
specifically to encourage people to buy cars. But I can't find any
supporting info on the web right now... Plenty of info on the cable car
tracks being paved over in San Francisco.
