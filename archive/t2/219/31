I read that GM was guilty of buying the Red line and putting it out of 
business and in other cities they created bus companies to kill off the 
trollies and then killed the bus companies.

If we had a local trolley of bus line that would get me back and forth to 
work in a reasonable time I'd ride. Won't happen in my small town. We 
commute 7 miles each way.

All in the name of selling cars to you and me and everybody else. Makes me 
feel alot better about driving my "IMPORT" cars. Remember that idea that we 
need to buy domestic to maintain the US economy - well that my friends is 
what the US car makers can do when they rule the roost.
