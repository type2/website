Well this is a sad story. me and my bus today were driving to my girlfriends 
house when a little girl ran into the road. luckily the car in front of me 
stopped and the little girl was fine but me and my bus were not so lucky. i 
couldnt stop fast enough and my bus ran into the other car. well this all 
brings me to my question. what would be the best way to fix this. so you can 
get a better understanding of the damage the steering is pretty messed up 
and the pedals feel really strange. the front end is about 6" into the car. 
get it? so whats next? get it pulled as best as possible and bondo the rest 
or get a new front panel and weld. does anyone know of any good places in 
the southern california area?? any help whatsoever is really appriciated.
