Subject: Bus Sighting movies Update

OK I finally tracked down the Charlie's Angels movie here at work. The 
curiosity was killing me. And sure enough a type 2 gets wiped out in the 
car chase scene. I got a quicktime movie of it once in real time and 
once in slow mo. The quality is pretty poor since I was recording with 
my digital camera aimed at my portable dvd player here at work, but you 
can see it get smashed. From the looks of it, breaking it down into 
frames it looks like at least 2 buses sacrificed their lives for this 
shot.   :(
What a waste of a good bus!

Here's the link to the .avi files. the files are a bit large one is 1MB 
and the other is 2Mb.
