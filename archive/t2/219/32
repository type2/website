It is well known here in the Chicago area, that old man Richard Daley
Sr. took a large under the table contribution from a undisclosed tire
company to compell the 
CTA to discontinue the street cars----

Now Jr. is talking about building a street car system that travels
around the Loop to help keep the air clean down town.

I remember the electric buses that ran on overhead wires--
I have no idea why in the hell they got rid of them them--no stink for
sure--and quiet.

It's a crazy world we live in --things that work just don't make it--

I had heard a number of times that General Motors actually bought up all
the cable-car and trolleys in the US and ripped up the tracks -

I heard the same thing but it related to GM selling rubber tired busses.
Most drivers also hated the exposed tracks because tires were pretty
poor back then and running parallel on tracks killed tires pretty
quickly. All just rumor though.
