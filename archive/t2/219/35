The shims are supposed to be under the pulley nut (behind the big washer) 
or between the pulley halves. To adjust for a smaller length fan belt you 
put more of the shims between the pulley halves.

To adjust for a longer belt you put the shims under the nut and washer.

It just changes how high the belt rides in the pulley by changing it's width.

Your adjustment does not change the position of the alternator/generator 
pulley in relation to the crank pulley b/c the rear half of the pulley is 
always in the same position.

Get thee a copy of John Muir's "How to Keep your VW Alive". It has 
EXCELLENT explanations and procedures. Some of the procedures and 
explanations have been updated by this list and others like it (better 
solutions found) but it won't do you wrong. I would also buy a copy of 
Bentley Publisher's VW service manual for your vehicle. Both books together 
will save you hundreds if not thousands of dollars during your VW 
ownerships b/c if you are motivated you won't ever pay a mechanic to do 
repairs for you again.

I learned much of what I know from those books before the age of the 
Internet but I continued to buy good books and increase my tool selection. 
Now with this list and the Internet I could have learned much more much 
faster.
