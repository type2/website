I had the same experience.

Remove the air deflection plates on the bottom and do an inspection.  It a
good time to clean them of their oil and grime anyway to see how long you've
had a leak.

If your push rod tubes are leaking it will probably look like this...

...oil drops hanging from the case.

There are 16 seals altogether and everyone recommends replacing all of them
at the same time.  With your hydraulic lifters, opinion sways towards simply
removing the rocker arms with a wrench, change the tube seals and then
torque them back to 10 ft lbs. (no valve adjustment required if you know
your clearances were previously set right).

You will probably have to find a torque wrench in in.lbs. with 120 in. lbs.
in the middle of it's effective range to tighten up the rocker arms
properly.  Or you can calibrate your hand by drawing a scale on top of the
muscles of your wrist like Muir explains. ;-)

There are two sizes of seals. The seal on the case end (smaller size) are
made of black rubber and seems to harden over time.  When the engine is hot
is makes a good seal but when you turn it off, the seal contracts and leaks
out oil for about 5 mins.  It's probably not leaking while you are driving
if that is what is concerning you.

The seal on the head end (larger) is made of orange silicone I believe.  It
tends to stretch over time and probably will eventually leak but I don't
think as bad as the small seals.  Someone with experience can chime in.

To repeat good advice I took, buy 16 Viton brand seals as a set: these are
Porsche quality and worth paying a teeny bit extra for.  The seals should be
brown colored.

Sure, if you keep adding oil.  I drove 3,000 miles my last major trip with
leaking push rod seals all the way.  Take a look at what my air deflection
plates looked like...

...they had been leaking for years probably.  Some wasps made a home in my
bumper. Shoo!
