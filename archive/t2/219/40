Wouldn't the paper dissolve with the oil and heat? At least get squeezed out?

File them down. A good file, slightly oiled, works wonders quickly. File on 
one motion (away from you) only as dragging it on the metal as you pull it 
back will only dull it.

I would strongly advise you to visit a machine shop and see what they 
think. Almost sounds like flywheel damage b/c it was not tight and came 
off. Did this happen while in your care?
