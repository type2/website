Subject: Oil leak/Case tightening question

During reinstallation my 1600dp suffered an unfortunate imbalance and
tumble. After reinstallation it had two oil leaks along the bottom of the
case. By judicious tightening of the bottom case bolts I ended one and
slowed the other from 8-10 drops a day to 1-2.

I would like to put an end that one altogther too, but I am getting nervous
about additional tightening. I'm probably already at about double the 14
foot pounds recommended by  Bentley.

My question is: should I declare victory at 1-2 drops? Or risk another
tightening? In my mind's eye I have this horrible image of a bolt head
twisting off leaving me with a much more serious problem than a small oil
leak. Anyone have an idea how much torque these 8-M bolts can take?

Thanks,

John Rogers
