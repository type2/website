Subject: Oil leak: how much is too much?

Hi All,
I have a 78 bus and just wondering about the oil
leaks? when I shut it off it will leak for 5 - 10 min
about 10 drops or so, I've driven it (-at-) 100 miles and
it went through 1/2 a quart. It is leaking from the
left side of the engine I presume from the push tubes.
Any advice? Will it make it from CA to Chicago?
