Yes, the air is blown from the fan through the canister to the air cleaner.
Air is also sucked from the breather lines by this air flow.

It's either blowing air into the tank or sucking it out.  Hooking up a
vacuum gauge will eliminate the guessing.

That's weird.  It should be on the left side of the engine sticking out behind the flap that is assembled inside the fan shroud.  It's part of the top left engine tin.
