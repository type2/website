Hi Jason:

I installed the 1847V on my 82 Vanagon distributor (2.0L type IV), 022-905-205S and did not need the
spacer plate. I found that I needed to rotate and push down hard on the black sleeve to get it to engage
the point cam completely. I can't see Bosch changing the mechanical part of the distributor too much
between our years.

Has you distributor ever been rebuilt? There should be two metal and one phenolic shim between the
distributor shaft and the body. If I remember correctly this is about 0.050" (0.008 + 0.034+0.008) on
mine. Maybe someone put more shims here to take up the axial play when they rebuilt it and hence the
reason the point cam stick up further.

Sorry if this was no help. Good luck.

Regards,
