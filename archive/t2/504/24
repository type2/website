Subject: extinguishers

With seeing the unfortunate burning of Chris' bus it has brought me to start
thinking of another extinguisher to add to the bus. I have the small can that
comes stock in the westies but know that it will most likely never be enough
to put out an engine fire. I did a quick search for Halon's and found a five
pound reconditioned for $119. I assume that a five pound extinguisher would do
the job but I'm not sure about the reconditioned part.

Does anyone have experience with these or any Halon alternatives they would
like to share? What would be the best place to purchase either of these?
