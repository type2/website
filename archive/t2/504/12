Hi Andy

Part of your search problem might be the terms,,, aux dual battery
isolator relay are the popular 'merican terms.

To answer your question about the load on the alternator,, If you use a
relay as an isolator, connected to the blue alternator wire, and connect
the aux battery to the main battery using wire no bigger than 10awg,, you
will not have any problems overloading your alternator or starter
problems...

There is a HUGE difference of opinions on this topic, and I just ignore
flames now,,, you can look at my webpage, search the type2 archives and
make up your own mind...
Here is what I recommend

Hope that helps
