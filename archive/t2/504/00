Or if your regulator is shorting it'll pull a battery down over night--
Pretty common happening--

Pull the wire at the alternator--let it sit over night--connect it in
the morning--and see what happens-

Bet the Bus will turn right over--

go to a pawn shop or radio shack or your tool box and get yourself a
multimeter and set it on the smallest currents/amps setting. pull a
battery connection off of your battery and hook up the meter between the
battery cable and the battery. if the battery is draining like you
suspect you'll see a number of some value on the screen.   write this
number down and then start pulling fuses one by one until the number
goes to zero. once it is zero then you'll know at least what circuit
path the drain is in. like another person said, if you have a modern
radio it takes a bit of current when off but not too much and it would
take more than a couple weeks to drain a good battery.

Is there a way to tell whether or not "juice" is being sucked out of
your battery when apparentl nothing is on??
