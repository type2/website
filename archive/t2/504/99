Chris, I've been fortunate enough to avoid fires in the three instances of
petrol ( gas to you Yanks ;^) leaks in Tigger, of the three instances, only
one (1) was the rubber hoses, one was when the screws on the face plate of
the mechanical fuel pump worked loose, so she was dropping fuel from the
pump ( NB: This could have been due to improper assembly when last put
together by the shop, not necessarily a generic pump problem. ), and BY FAR
THE WORSE was when the press in fitting in one of the carbs ( Tig's dual
carb, of course ) pulled out of the carb itself, the petrol was literally
POURING out of the engine bay, luckily there was no spark, or the whole back
end would have gone up.

When I posted this to the list, one of the more experienced people ( can't
remember who, I'm afraid ) advised this was quite common, and that he ALWAYS
wired the hose fittings to the carb when working on busses to prevent it,
needless to say Tig's fuel hoses are wired to the carbs now.

My point here is that it's not ONLY the rubber hoses that need attention,
but having said that, I'm with the others who have expressed the opinion
that busses are no worse, generically, than any other machine of their age,
and that with proper care, maintenance and attention, they're just as safe
and reliable as most other things on the road. Due to a series of events
last year, Tig's my only transport now, and she's doin' just fine ( she
always handled and stopped better than the "town car" ( late model
Corolla ), but DOES have problems with low clearances in parking garages ).

FWIW
