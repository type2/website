Since this topic is still open I have a question, more of a verification of my thinking.  Here is link to how I have my relay setup,  hella relay .  With the relay hooked up this way, is it correct in thinking that the 2nd battery gets charged from the main battery (trickle down) only when the alternator is outputting?  So when my bus is not on, the two batterys act independently and I can run whatever is hooked up to the 2nd battery without worry of draining the main battery.

 

Thanks,

 

Stephen
