yes you can pick em up at home centers for about 20bucks,  BUT it is a bad
idea.  the fuel tank and the fuel pump and the engine are all attached
different ways and vibrate at different times and amounts. there needs to
be flex in the system, an all ridged fuel system would soon break
somewhere. either the line or more likely one of thee fittings.

get good fuel hose and stick with a maintenence program to keep it in good
shape, and of course carry your extingusher
