And then there is the Sears SAE equivalent that seems to fit pretty good. 1 
& 13/16" = $20. Remember you pay shipping sometimes with mail 
order.  Metric would be better of course. I do think my Sears socket came 
with the lifetime warranty. Much easier to use when it is over-the-counter 
vs. mail order.

I bought an import "short" extension and slide bar from a local supplier 
for less than $10.

Seems like I heard it is not particularly good to beat on hubs and other 
bearing supported shafts. For than reason I bought sockets for my Beetle 
and Bus after first using the "beater" wrench sold through some of the VW 
aftermarket suppliers. Seems like I may have lost a rear bearing b/c of one 
but I can't say that with surety.
