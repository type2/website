Subject: RE: [T2] Leisure battery and charging

I have been operating for years with a 30 amp relay I purchased at
radioshack.  I mounted it in the stock location and used all the same
wires as the stock relay.  I used 12 gauge wire to connect between the
batteries.  I measured the charging current with this setup after
completely draining my aux. battery and the highest current I measured
was 36 amps which quickly dropped off to around 10 amps within 30-45
seconds.  If you're running a deep cycle battery it should be no
problem.  Note that 36 amps is more than 12 gauge wire is rated for and
the wire did heat up slightly.  I view this as a good thing because the
resistance of the wire is limiting the charging current.  If you use
anything larger the charging current will be even greater.

To answer your question:  An isolator prevents the aux battery from
draining the starting battery.  A relay will not do this.  If you leave
your key on with the engine not running the starting battery will charge
the aux battery on it's own until they reach equilibrium.

I know many on the list may think an isolator is the way to go so you
can't ever drain you main battery.  If you have the dough to waste go
with an isolator.  You can't go wrong.  However the relay has worked
just fine for many others and has treated me well for years.
