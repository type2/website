Subject: Re: [T2] Burnt bus fund

I personally feel that if you work to maintain a bus that it can be as
dependable as anything.  Everything needs maintenance newer vehicles just
cost more.  It took me a while to convince my wife of that but I finally did
after replacing a bunch of stuff on our 95 subaru.  I personally carry a
fire extinguisher in every car I own (I think I have 2 in the bus), not only
for me but when I see people that need help on the side of the road.  Its
something you cant help when you are bitten by the VW bug (or bus) and you
just cant get the love of them out of your system.  My wife and I always
smile when we see VW busses of any kind in movies or in real life.  I hope
Chris can get the fundage needed to get another bus.  I didnt see a link of
where we can send money to help out.  Ill check earlier messages to see if I
can find one.

Oh just for fun.... I found out that with the rear seats out that I can fit
a 4x8 sheet of plywood in the back of my 73 bus.  :)

Long live the Air Cooled!
