Vincent,

I can assure you that they *are* a hazard.  I saw an aerosol
paint can actually blow up inside a bus on hot summer evening.

The guy was in our club and had come to a meeting at 6:30 or so
in the sout, in August...temps were around 95-100 or so.  He parked his 
bus, with the windows open came inside and had supper.

After he went back outside and opened the door to his bus, the can blew 
up!  It had been in the floor toward the back .

It was *not* a pretty sight!

Cheers, dave
