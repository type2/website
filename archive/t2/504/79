Subject: Re: [T2] Pertronix installation help

Jason,

This is a common problem according to the tech guy at Pertronix. As I recall
I just trimmed/enlarged the hole with an Exacto knife and file until it
slipped down and allowed the rotor to be installed. Pertronix has a web site
with a tech phone number. Also found out that gap size is not critical -
mine was much larger than suggested by the directions and it works great up
to 7600 rpm in my old race car.
