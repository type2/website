Chris and All,

Here is the utimate fix---on any rust problems.

Remove the rust the best way you can--( I love my spot sandblaster--)
Clean the area with Duponts Metal Prep.

Blow a coat of Duponts Vari Prime Acid etch primer on it---

Scuff with 320 paper

Now here is the key to longevity--

Get a quart of Dupont's Uro Prime--
It's a 3 part ( going to be a 4 part ) urethane sealer / primer.

Add a flex agent to it--( this is the extra added part of the primer )
and blow that on the area.
Now you have a bullet proof primer/ sealer that will wait until you
paint--and will hold down anything under it --almost forever--

Standard primers are made ot of talic--or clay --to allow them to
fill---but they will attract moiture if it isn't sealed with paint--
And because of the caly or talic--the stuff is brittle--and has a
tendancy to shink over time--

Now--if and when you paint the vehicle---add the flex agent also to the
paint--
This will retard any stone chips--door dings-- and make the paint last a
bunch longer--

This is the hot primer / sealer / paint set up--and it does work
well--and will hold down any futher rust, corosion, and prevent paint
chipping.--

Good Luck---

Terry

How bad is surface rust? Is it best to sand and use a "rust-reducing"
based primer, ala 3M? Lots of ppl thru the archives indicate the a
regular primer may 
be just fine. 
Etching primer I believe is the proper primer. Kills the rust as I
understand. Maybe Terry K. will jump in as that is his specialty (paint
that is).
