Hey people,

I just wanted to say that I am glad to be a part of the type 2 list
and I am very happy to see all the great people who help one another out.
I am unfortunately not in the best position to assist monetarily but I hope
that
I am able to help others out in different ways, it feels good to share
knowledge and to help one another. I love driving my 72 van, its a passion.
Each person has their own reasons for driving a
van and each reason is significant to that individual.
I have learned to fix my van, therefore saving lotsa money.
To me it is fun and challenging and cheap and safe because it doesn't allow
me to speed
and drive crazy like other vehicles do.

Thanks Type 2 and the list.
Darren
