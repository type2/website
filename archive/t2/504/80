yes you can pick em up at home centers for about 20bucks,  BUT it is a bad
idea.  the fuel tank and the fuel pump and the engine are all attached
different ways and vibrate at different times and amounts. there needs to
be flex in the system, an all ridged fuel system would soon break
somewhere. either the line or more likely one of thee fittings.

Got bucks? Try someone (Summit Racing, for example) for pricing on
stainless steel braided Aeroquip fuel lines...An extra "loop" should be
enough to compensate for any vibration or movement...Just a guess
here, but does anyone know if the VW fittings are the same as some
Porsche's ??
