Subject: Re: [T2] isolators and regulator info - Thanks Guys!

I hear what your saying and no fear I wasn't going to use 14 gauge
wire. I am going to use 10 gauge.  I like the idea of a switch to
be able to boost yourself.  But you can do that easy enough, just
run a different line of 4 or 5 gauge wire to a switch separate of
the relay.  Wouldn't take any extra time.
