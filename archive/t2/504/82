Subject: Re: [T2] Pertronix installation help

Jason,

Try the easiest thing first....   Wrong rotor?????
Non oem distributor???...evil PO put different dist in?

I believe that the 1847v is the exact same Pertronix that I installed
in my stock 78 distributor.

I was probably using a 009 rotor in it though...

Going back and looking at the pics, I still don't think the sleeve
is down far enough.

Measure the sleeve and then measure from the bottom of where the sleeve 
will install upwards....mark it with a magic marker or something.

Push rotor on...does it cover up the mark after it is on?..then
something is definitely not right...triple check dist number 
and check for correct rotor.

Just went and looked and Ronnies page 
http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ignition.htm#B7576M
says rotor should be 

 Rotor: 04 033

His page also shows that my dist uses the exact same cap
and rotor as your distributor....I have the spacer plate installed.

I can't decide it that is what you have or not....

Cheers, dave
