Toggle the relay.  Not the same thing as a switch to connect the two batteries.

Wherever you want to put it.  Maybe on the dash.  All it does is supply 12V 
to the relay to activate it.  You do understand the basic principle behind 
a relay, right?  A relay uses a small current to switch a large one.  The 
small current is provided by your switch and/or your fuse box.  The large, 
switched current is between the positive terminals of your two batteries.
