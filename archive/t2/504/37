Primer's also differ in how they seal. Some of the basic primers 'breathe' 
and moisture can get through them.  Other primers bond and seal the surface 
so moisture can't get to the metal.

3M makes a good etching primer that is waterproof and you can get it bulk 
and in a small spray can if your doing some little things at home. I think 
it guarentees the surface unpainted for 3 months or something yet people 
have left them out for a long time and no rust.

rust specs?  I think it's where (as indicated by others) that part has been 
pinged/dinged or otherwise and the paint lifts slightly breaking the bond to 
the metal. If it can get air it can get moisture. Roof spots? Thing about 
roofs are depending on if your putting stuff on top to haul around or not, 
for some reason people think it's neat to bang on the inside of the roof 
(inside vehicle), kids too :)  Maybe that has a small impact, who knows.  
Maybe it's simply the extreme coolness of the vehicle which causes some 
fractures of some sort due to the overwhelming release of awesome energy ;)
