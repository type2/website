Subject: Re: [T2] A focused question regarding charging batteries

So what is really happening is that the switch/relay will allow the 
batteries to be in
parallel once the van is running. The charge is going to both batteries from
the alternator, into the main and from there into the accessory battery.

In the picture of the link you sent me :

The wire from the regulator (blue) is merely the switch activator to open 
the relay
right?

With an alternator the batteries are separate always and charged 
independantly
regardless.

So the reason for people using a marine switch with a relay is so you can 
guarentee
that you can turn off the accessory battery from the whole loop while the 
van is
running or turned off yet still access it from anything directly connected 
to the
access. battery?

I think I am starting to understand..
I wish I hadn't asked ;)

just kidding
