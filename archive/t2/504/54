i think this does.-----
To eliminate the multi-battery drain problem, a Sure Power isolator
acts as a check valve between the batteries, preventing current from
flowing from one battery to another. Each battery is isolated and acts
as an independent power source. So no matter how drained your
accessory batteries become, they will never drain power from the
battery you're depending on the start your engine. When the current is
used from battery #2, the check valve (diodes) stops current flow from
battery #1. When the alternator is charging, current can only flow in
one direction, from the alternator to the batteries. Each battery then
determines the amount of current which flows into it by its own state
of charge, based on the voltage regulator setting. With this system,
the alternator is protected, the batteries are protected and your
family or passengers are protected. The balanced circuit electronic
isolator is absolutely the only way that proper isolation and control
can be accomplished and every multi-battery problem is solved.
