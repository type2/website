Steve,

First of all, welcome back!  Glad to see you back on the list.
Down to business... the shaking needle on the gauge.  This has been a 
mystery to me also as long as I've had a vacuum gauge permanently mounted 
in my bus (many years).  I don't think mine shakes as badly as what you 
describe, but it was bad enough that I installed a damper (restrictor) in 
the vacuum line to smooth it out.  Restrict it enough and you can get a 
nice smooth reading.  I have heard (and believe, btw) that the shaking 
needle indicates a valve sealing problem.  I have had this problem even 
with freshly rebuilt 3-angle job MSHP heads.  Once when I had the engine 
apart I lapped the valves again and it still didn't help.  Not sure what to 
think about that.  I do have a theory though... I suspect leakage past the 
valve guides.

Really?  I thought that was only on 1974 model busses.  You're talking 
about the switch that only allowed advance in 4th gear, right?

Then it will probably be no suprise to you that this is a manifold vacuum 
port.  :-)  The advance port is visible in picture #2, the brass-colored 
fitting just up and to the right of the nut that holds the carb to the 
manifold.

Yes, but I would eliminate those trouble-prone boots and use the port on 
the left carb.  It's closer anyway.

On to an important point - no matter where you hook up to manifold vacuum, 
you are getting it from both carbs.  This is because there is a crosspipe 
between the manifolds (grey pipe in picture 1).

Ya big whiner.  :-)
