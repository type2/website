Subject: Seat restoration project

Hey folks...

Well, 8 days later my seat restoration project has produced one 
restored seat (sans new upholstery).  You can find the procedure I used 
here:

The time is extended by 2 overnight "wait to dry" steps, and one 3 day 
"wait to cure" step.  The task is not that difficult, but be prepared 
to have a sore back at the end of the day :-)

Thanks to Richard Atwell for also documenting his seat repair 
procedure.  It was an extremely valuable resource while I worked on 
this project.
