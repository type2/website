Put a 15amp (or whatever your particular relay happens to be rated at) 
fuse between the relay and the Aux battery.  Because the fuse will pop 
if the current draw exceeds your relay rating (assuming you properly 
matched the fuse and the relay), that should prevent damage to the 
relay in your scenario above.

It's probably useful to stick an ammeter in the circuit if you're doing 
any sort of repair (or fresh installation) work on your battery 
isolator set-up, because then you can see *exactly* what is going on.
