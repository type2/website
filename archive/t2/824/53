Subject: Re: [T2] Connecting rod sizes?? Type 4

Yes as Mark said, there is a difference, the
difference is the early ones are 1.7-1.8L 66mm stroke
C/S, the later ones are 2.0L 71mm stroke C/S Different
size rod journal's on the big end. The specs in the
book tells the story. The rods are made to look
different too, the 2.0L has a buildup on the piston
pin end that the 1.7 & 1.8L don't have. Phil
