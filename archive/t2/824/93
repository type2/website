Subject: charlie ford tv star

saw charlie yesterday on tv. survivorman, se georgia swamps, altahama
basin.
i turned it on just because I know thats charlies home never expecting to
see him.
but there he was, they called him "3 rivers charlie", taking survivorman
out into the wilderness and chatting about nature.
I couldnt wait until the end to see if charlie got more air time on the
pick-up.
pretty excellent.
