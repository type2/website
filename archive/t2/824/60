Subject: Re: [T2] Connecting rod sizes?? Type 4

I was just reading the GWB saga, went to the GWB web site and saw this!!

Vehicle: 1973 Volkswagen Transporter Westfalia
Engine: Stock 1700 Type 4 cut for 2.0 pistons and cylinders
Location: Colorado

I wonder what else was done to make this work...  (darn, and I threw away a 
good 2.0 crank because it was too heavy to keep moving about the garage..)
