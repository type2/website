Please define "HUGE".

Sorry to be a stick in the mud, but the reason for cross-drilling if to
produce slightly improved performance with cold brakes in wet conditions.
The holes allow water to escape quicker and prevents the pads from
"hydroplaning" on the disc surface.

I've experienced this phenomenon on a motorcycle with undrilled rotors
and it was rather disconcerting.  The solution was to simply keep the
front disc warm by dragging the brake a bit.

I've never experienced this on a car, though.  The pad forces and
protected location of the brakes make it a lot harder to get the disc wet.

What I have seen with drilled rotors is rather uneven wear.  Cross-drill
your rotors and figure on turning them with every set of pads.  Otherwise,
new pads won't seat correctly.

Cross-drilling will have a tiny effect on cooling.  The holes just don't
add that much surface area to the discs.

I think a better solution is simply to drive slower.  It's a bus, not a
911!
