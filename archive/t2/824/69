You'll probably get more qualified responses from the list, but here's
my take anyway. I, too, have a centermount Weber 32/36 with a ACN SVDA.
When I first got the dizzy, I was told that the diaphram would take a
little while to settle in. Its pretty stiff out of the box, I guess, so
it takes some time to get in its groove. I got mine in Spring (March
'03, I think) and it took a month or so before it really responded. I
figured the cold weather probably slowed its settle in period.
I've read that the vacuum signal from the weber is not terribly strong
and some folks ream out the vaccuum port a touch to increase the
signal. I didn't do this. I'm not convinced it was necessary, but then
I never got a vaccuum tester on there to prove it.
I wish you luck with the Weber. Now that I have a pre-heated air
solution for mine, it isn't too bad... until the weather gets below 45
degrees...
