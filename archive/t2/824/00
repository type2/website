Subject: Clutch ...

Justin --
          I was looking in the last digest, but since no one else has appeared 
to reply to your question --

In my experience, clutch release failure is most often due to something in 
the "system" that transmits the force from your left foot to the release 
bearing.  I would guess a frayed clutch release cable; or accelerated wear 
in/around the hook that pulls the cable; or a loose eccentric at the trans end; 
or (most expensively) a broken weld at one of the arms that actuate the 
throwout bearing.  Fixing this last case requires engine removal just to begin 
the surgery; but there is often an accompanying noise that gives a clue.

If you take your vehicle to the typical garage gonniff*, he will nick you for a 
couple of hundred quid and replace the clutch no matter what is/was the root 
cause.  Anything you can do to get an honest diagnosis beforehand will help 
you.  Please advise:

1) Did this problem develop suddenly, or over some weeks/months?

2) Is there any new noise, and if so, how does it relate to pedal location?

3) Does the pedal feel spongier near the floorboard than it did previously?

4) What's the odo reading; the general condition of the mechanicals; and do you 
know when the clutch was last replaced?

Cheerio

On our 1977 Type II the clutch seems to be dragging even when the pedal is
"To the Metal" and makes 1-2nd changes very hard ..

I vaguely remember someone saying that VW clutches "Go" like this IE:- it's
knackered .. (Whereas I always think of clutches going the other way
IE:-slipping)

As I would not do the clutch myself can the assembled advise .. Is it
POSSIBLE that the clutch is out of adjustment (I guess the wingnut..) or
that the cable is stretched ?    If it is then I'll play silly murfens with
it .. othewise it's off to the garage :)
