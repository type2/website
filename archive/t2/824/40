Thanks, John.

With your info, [rod journal] I did a quick scan of the archives and I got 
this bit of info:

"VW used the same crank in the early Type4 engines (1700/1800) as was
used in the later (2000) engines.  The larger displacement was
achieved by using an "offset grind" on the crank.  The result was a
longer stroke, and a smaller journal."

Every bit of info helps; it gave me something to research, and I will need 
to read Tom Wilson a bit more
