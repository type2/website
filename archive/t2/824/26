Subject: Re: [T2] UV Leak Kits?

<<Anyone ever use on of those UV leak kits to detect oil leaks in there
Bus or perhaps cooling system of their other driver.>>

I sure have and the UV leak detector works well, but only if the leak is
in an accessable area for the lamp, and it's not a slow leak.

I have waited for up to 6 weeks for a leak to show up on a engine, and
it was so remote that it was very hard to detect it's origin.

Yes--it work's well if it's a good leak, in clear area for coolant, oil,
and AC work.


Take Care,
