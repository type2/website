Subject: FI bus Cranks too long after days of sitting

Nyssa drove home (800mi) and parked her bus here a few days, and when I 
went out to move it, it cranked way too long before starting (about 7 
sec), a bit slow but typical for the 20 deg it dropped to in nj..  Since 
it has Pertronics and ran/started fine after that (good spark), I wonder 
if if this is something in the pressure regulator- isn't it supposed to 
prevent the fuel in the rail from draining down?  When we switched her 
fuel tank last summer, i replaced the return line and checked the 
pressure-ok.
