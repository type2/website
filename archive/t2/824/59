Subject: Re: [T2] POR-15 instead of underseal

<<<Rust Bullet works great for me. I've used it for the heater control
boxes and have tested it on some underside portions of my 78 Westy. I
thought the instructions and procedures for POR 15 were harder to follow
than Rust Bullet.>>

I've been reading this thread for a couple of days, and want you POR
believer's to know this.

The stuff is just a polyisocianate paint that smother's the metal from
the air, and that's all.

I tried it on some heavy equipment as a test.
The front and rear fender's on a Daewoo 250 rubber tired end loader a
year and a half ago.

After I applied the "rust converter"  I shot a heavy coat of urethane
bed liner on top of it to keep the rocks and other heavy material from
fracturing the surface of the converter.

I also applied a heavy coat of just the bed liner on top of the roof (
it was surface rusting ) and I removed the floor mat because t was
rusting under it and did the bedliner thing.

This machine pushes snow, and loads salt into semi's in the winter.

Here's the results;

The 4 fender's haven't rusted again---

But neither has the roof or the floor of the cab.

Now is the fender's not rusting because of the POR product or the bed
liner?

I didn't use anything else but the urethane bed liner on the roof or the
floor of the cab--and there is no rust appearing either.

So, I think that the bedliner alone is the ticket for undercoating or
top coating anything you don't want to rust again.

It would be perfect for the bottom of a Bus or Van.

I have done the bottom's of my Bus, and both my Van's 3--4 years ago,
and the stuff is still there, looks clean as a whistle, and also acts
great for a sound deadener. 

I think the rust converters are a waste of money and time in this
application.
