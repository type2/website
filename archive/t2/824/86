Subject: Re: [T2] Interesting oil leak. Need some opinions

Courtney,
You could be right! Sounds like the leak I had on my 75 after the rebuild. 
Remove the tin from under the passenger side cylinders and wash things off 
real well at the car wash. Park it so it leaks the most, then blow baby 
powder at the suspected push rod tube. The powder sticks to the oil but 
blows off clean metal easily. If it is a leaky pushrod tube seal try this. 
Make sure you have cleaned out all crud you can where the offending pushrod 
tube enters the engine and head. Adjust some vice grips to barely grip the 
pushrod tube then try to turn the tube while pushing it toward the engine. 
If the vice grips slip tighten them only slightly. You do not want to damage 
the tube. I think the last time I did this I cushioned the jaws with some 
rubber cut from an old inner tube. The idea is to get about 1/2 turn on the 
tube and try to seat it into the engine and head better than it is. 
Sometimes the wire bail that's supposed to keep the tubes seated doesn't do 
as it should. It might be a good idea to check that the next time you have 
the valve cover off.

Oh yeah, I should have said this first. WARNING! Have some new seals on hand 
before attempting this procedure. One of three things will happen.
1. The leak will stop because the tube needed to be seated.
2. Nothing, because the seal has a crack starting in the hardened rubber.
3. The leak will get worse, because the seal was glued to both the tube and 
the engine or head and turning the tube caused the little leaking crack to 
rip out making things worse.

If #1 happens of course your done. If #2 or 3 happens you needed to change 
the seals any way. Change them all if this is the case. If they are too 
dried out you will wind up changing them all one at a time any way. Might as 
well stop that drippy demon in his tracks all at once.
Hope this helps,
Tom
