A local response counts a well qualified - I'm in Lake Oswego as well.
If you've seen a white 74 lurching along Country Club or Kruse Way you
will understand my interest in your air preheating solution.

I was planning on keeping this on the road all year, but I'm getting 
the idea fast that it is unlikely unless I change to dual carbs.

I have seen reference to electric intake manifold heaters in the UK.
I was thinking of getting my parents to send some over and see if 
they would make this thing drivable.

In the meantime I'll try to learn patience.
