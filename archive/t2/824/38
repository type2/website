If you installed a set of cross-drilled rotors, even on a porky slow bay,
you would notice a significant difference.

I have owned many different models of vehicles and raced many as well. In
every application there is a HUGE difference.

(I know this is absurd but)
If you are in doubt, find a pal with a track pass and drive two cars, one
with cross-drilled and one without. Still in doubt? Drop a fifth-wheel
behind a Cummins Dodge and drive it with x-drilled and without. I've done
both.

A fully loaded Westy is going to have the same performance improvement.
Simply put, the brake stays cooler during braking, any braking, at any time.
Thus, the braking force is constant and does not fade. The rotors wear fine
and extend the life of the pads and rotors because they keep them  c o o l e
r. Only really crappy units have problems.

Sorry to disagree, but cross-drilling rotors does NOT have a "tiny" effect
on cooling. Thousands and thousands of racers, towers and performance
enthusiasts can't be wrong and companies like Brembo, Stillen and Willwood
wouldn't exist.

Is it appropriate for Bus owners? Probably not, but it is a viable option.

But I do agree, you should drive a bus slower and gear down if you are
heavily loaded, no matter what type of brake system is used.
