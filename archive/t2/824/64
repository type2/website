Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch ... (I Love you all ..)

A VERY helpful trick i learned last time i adjusted my clutch - take a
motorcycle tie down and hook one end around the torsion arm (or whatever
suits your needs on the drivers side of course) and the other hook around
the clutch arm - then tighten the tie-down and it will pull the clutch arm
towards the front of the bus and allowing you to EASILY turn the clutch
cable adjustment bolt :) I guess this really helps if you need a signififcat
amount of adjustment, i.e. if you had just installed the tranny, cable etc.

I was ecstatic when i figured this out, and thought i might share this with
all of you.

Happy bussing,
