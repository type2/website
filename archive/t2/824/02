Subject: Un-responsive clutch

Over a year ago I helped a friend put a new clutch,
T.O. bearing and engine in a 72 project westy. Test
drove it afterward and all was fine.  HOWEVER, he
never got back to the project for more than a year and
finally realized he never would, so the bus is now
mine!  I got it running again, BUT when I push the
clutch in I am getting no response. Cable is there and
adjusted properly. It shifts into all gears and
neutral fine with the engine off, but with the engine
running, and clutch applied it just grinds like crazy
and SLAMS into gear (I almost ran over the cat!!) It's
as if the clutch doesn't even exist!! Remember, it
worked properly a little more than a year ago and has
been sitting outside since. Sooooo, is one of the 2
following scenarios likely:
1) Somehow the T.O. bearing popped off the release
armc inside the bellhousing??
2) The clutch plate fused to the flywheel from sitting
so long??(If it did this, would it behave as I
decribed or would it act like the clutch would never
relaease??)

If #2 is the likely scenario, are there any tips from
free-ing the clutch without pulling the engine???
