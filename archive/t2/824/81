Darren,

Ummm...painted a whole Karman Ghia roof 4 years ago with por-15 after 
sandblasting it.  

Sat outside for the last 4 years...no rust anywhere.....I probably didn't 
follow instructions very well...wonder what the difference is?


There is green mold on it, but not any rust anywhere....oh, and I does 
look just like they said it would if left in the sun...kinda dull looking.

Pics if anyone is *really* interested....I am at a loss to explain why it 
works well for some people and terrible for other folks....seems weird!


Cheers, dave
