Justin said.... I will be jacking the bus up and getting
underneath tommorow .. Someone said in a private mail to "Screw the wingnut
six turns tight" and that if it makes any difference then it's an adjustment
problem..


Justin, I see no reason not to try tightening the adjuster, as long as you can 
support your vehicle SAFELY.  If after six turns you can shift OK, I would be 
concerned that some of the strands of the cable had broken or rusted through... 
meaning the remaining strands of the cable might break at an inconvenient time 
in the future.... YMMV.  But give it a try SAFELY.
