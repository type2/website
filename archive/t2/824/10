The prevailing belief in vanagonland is that when  you replace the clutch
master cylinder, it is not long before the clutch slave cylinder gives up.
Seems to be the case more times than not. Mine had the same kind of
symptoms not so long ago.  Take a look and see if you can notice any
leaking before you go for the master cylinder. It sits up above the
transmission. Can't miss it.

It is not a picnic to replace, but its not as hard as so many will attest.
I did mine about a year ago and after studying on it and figuring out how
best to attack it, it turned out to be less of an ordeal than I imagined.
Being an air cooled, the tin around the engine made it a complete, 'from
under the van' job, and there is just one bolt that is in a really lousy
place. Once you get it loose, either from perseverance, or by cutting up a
wrench to a custom size, its pretty easy to replace.

HTH, and good luck with it :-)
