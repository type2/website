Subject: fuel lines

Hello Richard-
I read through your article on fuel lines, but need to find out proper 
lengths needed for a single carb. Can you send me these or point out a 
site to figure this out. I am having a fuel delivery issues and think 
that some of the hose pieces are too long. I am also going to check for 
clogging.

I had a leaky hose between the gas tank and the first run of metal 
tubing, which I replaced with same length as was there. So I know that 
was part of the fuel problem. But still not getting the fuel up to the carb.
The pump is fairly new, but I will also be checking this.
Thanks for all your great references materials :-)
