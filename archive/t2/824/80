Subject: Re: [WetWesties] Aftermarket Oil thermostat/oil coolers - Long

Since the coolers were mounted in the luggage rack before i bought the bus,
and the holes were cut in the pop-top, I have no intention of moving them to
a better/different location. When the coolers were still hooked into the
system I had little plastic covers that i could "snap" into place that would
cover the coolers (not 100% though). I lost them during my spring break trip
last year down the Oregon coast in 75mph side winds (that was scary).

I had been contemplating aluminum or some kind of metal cover for the
coolers - but never fabbed anything up.

If you haven't seen where the coolers are mounted take a look at this pic:

(Above the windshiled) You can even see one of the coolers had the plastic
covers I lost
