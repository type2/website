Subject: Re: [T2] 71 tail light bulb holder?

Unlike most American makes (and some Japanese ones as well), VW or SWF (the
OE maker) never offered this separately from the reflector.  You may have to
find a good one from a used reflector assembly.

IMHO, the time, energy and $$ spent looking for that elusive item would be
better spent buying a new reflector assembly.
