Subject: Re: Broken Easy Out

Chuck,

Sorry about taking so long to get to this.  I'm on 
digest mode an a little behind.  

I, too broke off a screw extractor in a 6mm tin screw in 
a cylinder head.  I tried the same thing you did, only 
succeeded in ruining the cobalt drill bit.  My wonderful 
wife suggested a fine point diamond dremel bit.  I did 
that (the diamond bit wasn't cheap) and ground out the 
tip of the screw extractor and finally removed the 
broken off screw with a left-hand twist drill bit like 
Steve Dolan suggested.  Learned a lesson on that one...

Hope this works.
