Hello,

I just thought of somthing else. We learned in class
that the the gas companies use different blends of gas
in colder months than they do in warmer months. The
blend that they truck to their stations in the winter
is made to vaporize at a lower temperature than the
gas produced for the summer. Try getting your gas from
a different station when you fill up next. The station
that you are using may still be using up some of their
winter blend. This can cause vapor lock. That is just
a thought. Good luck!
