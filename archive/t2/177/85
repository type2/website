Hi family....i just wanted to thank everyone on 
this list, for all the help and love that u all 
have passed my way, these last few months. our 
70Westie 'the rainbow wagon';) is up and runnin 
smooth. gettin her packed up for a long 2000mile 
drive from the NW>midwest. we're hittin the 
rainbow gathering up in the gr8lakes region this 
coming month. then movin to iowa to be with the 
family. our route from E.Oregon includes 
E.Washington>Montana>S.Dakota>IA>Wisco. 
anyways, this is our first long trip in our 
volksie. but with all the know how, and 
connections that i've picked up from this site, 
i feel confident in makin our journey home. 
i've printed off a list of all the AIRS members 
that are on our trek back home. for road 
reference, if needed. 
but with the karma thats been following us 
lately, i'm sure we'll have clear skies ahead. 
well..off we ride into the sunsets of life. and 
i'll be gettin ahold of U Omaha folks when we 
land back home. 
take it slow and Be Care Full on your journeys, 
me friends. and we'll see u on down the road. 
*Shine On* -Chris
