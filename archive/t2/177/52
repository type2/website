This weekend my wife and I went up to Crystal Basin between Sacramento and
Tahoe to do a little camping in my '77 Riviera with side tent :) for a
friends birthday. There are quite a few large hills on the way up, but the
engine did great. Oil temps got a little higher than I would like to see
them, which will hopefully motivate me to get the extra oil cooler setup
before we head up to Quincy for High Sierra in a month or so.

On the trip back down the oil light suddenly went on, and the pressure 
gauges droped to zero. I shut off the engine as fast as I could, and 
pulled over into a small bare patch on the left side of the road fearing 
the worst. I got out back, and looked under the bus. Everything looked 
fine, and I certainly didn't see a huge oil slick in the road. I wondered 
if the dual sender I had installed had gone bad. I decided to swap it for 
the stock sender to see if that would solve the problem. I went to pull 
the wires off the dual sender only to discover that the conector on the 
light had sheered off and the wire was touching the other sender port and 
the case, hence the light and zero pressure reading.

I removed the bad connector and stripped and reconnected the wire. 
Restarted the engine, and the light went out right off, and pressure went 
back up, and we where on the road again. Sure had me worried for a bit 
there though.

Leson learned: Don't use cheap connectors, and always check the wiring 
first.
