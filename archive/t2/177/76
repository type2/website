     Hello all,  I've decided to switch to an alternator on my rebuilt =
1600.  Will my stock generator stand work?  I've heard or read something =
that an alternator will not fit without modification.  Or that it will =
hit the fuel pump or carb.  What's the real deal.=20
 Thanks,  Marcus=20

Enjoying this Bus weather!
