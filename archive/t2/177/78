Subject: Re: [T2] alternator/generator stand question

>     Hello all,  I've decided to switch to an alternator on my rebuilt 1600.
Will my stock generator stand work?  I've heard or read something that an
alternator will not fit without modification.  Or that it will hit the fuel
pump or carb.  What's the real deal.
 Thanks,  Marcus

You WILL need a new stand. The alternator has a fat section that will not
clear the stand. The correct stand has that part machined off.

Some people do not replace the fuel pump. Yours will fit if you leave it on. I
tried to replace my old one with the alt in place but it would not clear. Had
to take the alt loose to get enough clearance. Once was enough. I bought the
correct off-set top pump and pushrod.  If you do get the new pump, MAKE SURE
you get the shorter pushrod. It is 99.5mm. The wrong [long] one is 104mm.
