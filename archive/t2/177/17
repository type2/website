Why not hang the engine from each cylinder at a time and tap the piston 
with a wooden block and hammer forcing the piston to come out?

You have to catch the engine with some cardboard and old rags or carpet and 
a sheet of plywood of course. I wouldn't let it drop more than an inch or 
so. Repeat for each cylinder. Use the engine's weight to your advantage.

Maybe heat the cylinders with a propane torch.. An oxy/acteylene torch 
would work but you'd have to be careful not to melt anything.

Suspend the engine using vise grips hanging from wire loops on a cross bar 
of steel or wood beneath a step ladder (or something similar).

Not very scientific...
