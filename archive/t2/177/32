The key word here is "probably".  It depends upon the tire size.  To be
sure, look at the "Max Load" rating on the sidewall.  If it's more than
that specified for your bus (generally 1540 pounds) you're good.

I agree.

Doubled?  Wow!  Last time I bought tires the difference between C and D
was $7 a tire for Bridgestones.

I tried the Laredos (before I realized that they were not strong enough)
and got really strange tread wear patterns on the front tires on my '71.
Replaced them with Bridgestones and they wear fine.  I kept the half-run-out
Laredos for use with tire chains as they are smaller in diameter and
narrower than the 185R14 Bridgestones.
