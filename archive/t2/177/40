Subject: carburator clogged

does anyone have any suggestions as to unclogging the accelerator pump holes 
in a 34 solex. when I look in lower housing where it has the hole entering 
the pump it looks solid instead of a hole, is there suppose to be a hole. I 
can't blow air through it. Also I pulled the injection pipe off and tried to 
blow air through the hole to the pump and nothing could go through. What is 
the best way to clean this out and if drilling what size, thanks
