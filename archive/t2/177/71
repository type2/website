Subject: Valve adj. wrench

I bought two new 13mm wrenches (12 point and a 6 point count on the boxes) 
just recently from Lowes.

They are the brand that they sell with their lifetime warranty.
I think their brand name is "Kobalt", or some such.

The reason I bought these specific two wrenches was because of their 
geometry (flat shape, properly offset for a valve job)
The wrenches were pretty inexpensive, and have proven to be pretty proper 
for doing valve adjustments.

I think I like the 6 point wrench best for doing valve jobs.
There is ample swing room for a 6 point to find a fit when doing valve 
work, and a less likely chance to round off the valve lock nuts which, as 
we know, are going to be frequently wrenched.

Generally, I would prefer the 12 point design for most jobs.

I have decided to carry them in my "most needed" satchel of tools that I 
keep behind my driver's seat.
A pair of leather gloves in the same satchel serve as knuckle savers.

As a side note, I just bought a 2nd set of brand new 12 pt, (9mm thru 
17mm), still in the wrapper, Sears Craftsman wrenches up at Dayton, OH the 
other week for $15.00 at a ham radio geekfest.
I had purchased the same identical set a couple of years ago for an amazing 
$10.00 at a muscle car show.

Good tools can be had at nice prices; so always keep your need list with 
you, and a folded 20 bill tucked away for safe keeping.
