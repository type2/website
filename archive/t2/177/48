Just wanted to straighten out my mistake. I said that I gave Dan a Bosch 
filter to put on his Binz. I just looked, and it's a Mahle! So my 
apologies to Bus Depot and Dr. Tim. But, hey, what do you expect at 4 in 
the morning! I was sleepy, and we had OCTO and The Classic to attend.

Mahle: Good
Fram: Bad
