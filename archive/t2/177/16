Subject: Re: [T2] what is that noise???? noise 1

Could be. Do you drive your van regularly?

Sometimes the light surface rust that builds up on the rotors when a 
vehicle is parked will cause this.

Also the brake pads moving around a bit will rub the caliper a certain way.

They make a grease that you can put between the caliper and the pad and 
silence some of this noise.

Car Talk actually had a caller with the same question this weekend.

You can listen at cars.cartalk.com

Sometimes some real information there, most of the time just entertainment.

You could bleed those calipers and maybe help the situation. Mechanically I 
can't think of a single reason air in the system would contribute to this 
problem but go for it. A little extra maintenance never hurt.
