It wouldn't be hard, with a custom bellcrank on the clutch pedal and a
dunebuggy master and slave cylinder.

My other question is... Why?

In 8 years I've had one clutch cable failure and I was back on the road in
an hour.  The only car I had with a hydraulic clutch blew both the master
and slave cylinder in the same time, each time a drive home without clutch
and a several hour rebuild and bleed experience.  No fun at all.
