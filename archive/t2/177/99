Subject: BINZ bus road help  asap

   Dan Kinsey just called and is going through Ventura on 101 north. He
broke another wavey washer on his engine, got it fixed and is looking for a
VW shop somewhere between Ventura and Paso Robles to try and find some solid
rocker shafts and/or ratio rockers to install. If anybody can help him out
his cell number is 321  795  5003
