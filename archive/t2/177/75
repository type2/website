Subject: Re: [T2] Valve adj. wrench


Guys,

I figure my wrench that I use for that is expendable(non returnable), so 
years ago I took my closed end 13/15mm craftsman wrench and heated it up 
to red hot with a torch.  I put a offset in it of about 1/2" for doing 
valves.


15mm end    ---------\
                      \
                       \__________13mm end

The bend is about an inch or so from the 13mm end.


Has worked great since 1972.  If the tool doesn't fit the job, and you are 
going to be doing that job a lot, then make it fit.....

Cheers, dave
