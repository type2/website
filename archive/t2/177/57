Subject: Re: [T2] fan removal?

It's actually easier to do with the fan in the shroud.  Use a screwdriver
to lock the pulley against the generator housing and reach around with a
36mm socket and a 6" extension on a ratchet.  It breaks right loose.

Out of the car, it's the same prodecure except there's nothing to hold the
generator.  If you have an old generator stand or a strap wrench you can
use it to  hold the body from turning but then it's a 3-handed operation.

Taking the fan off in the shroud is a _much_ easier way to get the thing
out.  No lifting the shroud and worrying the fan through its hole.  Only
difficult thing is getting the lower generator tin screws out if they are
cheese-head screws.  Use a little pair of vise-grips to remove and replace
the screws with hex-heads.

Installation is the reverse of disassembly!
