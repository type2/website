Hello,

I don't have much experience on this matter but my
auto shop teacher was explaining to us how carburetors
worked and this sounds like it could be a problem with
the choke sticking open making the mixture too lean to
start the vehicle. Any thoughts???? 

One question, when you try to start the vehicle after
you have cut it off, when it finially does crank, does
a large cloud of black smoke come from the tail pipe?
If so, your idle cut off switch is probably not
working. One more thing, check your spark plugs for
blackening. Your spark plugs may be fouled out.

Well, that is all I can think of. Good luck. If you
have any more questions, I will try to contribute what
I know. Have a good day!
