Subject: welding under body parts?

Hi all - Would like some advice on welding the parts underneath the bus, like 
the jack supports, sliding door runner, and rocker panels.  (Been searching 
the archives, and am considering trying it myself.)  All I need doing is the 
actual welding repairs, the finish work I can take care of with my 
brother-in-law.  I guess my questions are, (1) What's the going rate to get 
the above parts repaired at a repair shop?, and (2) Is it something I could 
try to do myself?  I've worked on my own cars for years, but never with any 
welding or body repairs.  Thanks very much for any suggestions you can give 
me.  Larry
