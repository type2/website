I cant figure out how to get this Accelerator cable to come off me 

Automatic Transmission linkage... Its stuck on there, it looks like a 
little cup 

that slides on to a post.... but something is holding it on. and I'm not 
sure 

what it is.  I've sprayed it to death with wd-40, I used to whole 
can over 

a period of a week.... I heard that if you are not too careful that you can 


actually break the linkage and you have to remove the tranny to fix 
that....... 

please help  me get this off....
