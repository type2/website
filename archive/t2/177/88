I, too, have a '72 1700cc with original carbs.  They are very simple to work
with and are very reliable.  I can buy rebuild kits and other parts when
needed.  I even purchased a complete replacement set from a list member for
$50.  You can even order a set of rebuilds from Advance Auto Parts.  I
recommend keeping the originals.  You could order a rebuild set and rebuild
them to get yourself familiar with them.  I decided that I liked these carbs
after I rebuilt mine.  One problem that folks here have mentioned that I
have not yet encountered is the need to replace the throttle body bushings
when they get worn and fail to seal.
