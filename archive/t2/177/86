Subject: temp guage/multi-meter

i just purchased a multi-meter from Walmart, for 
timing our bus. and on the meter there is a 
Celsius temp guage. with a few adaptions, like 
described on the meat thermometer/oil temp 
section in the library, i should be able to use 
my multi meter to read my oil temp. right?
