yes if you break it you really are "scr*wed" ask me how I know.

ok,  is the cup loose on the post??  can you move it up and down ??

first get it loose if it is not.  

the cup has two spring wires on either side these are what hold it on,
they are inside and can't be seen.

I have used a pair of needle nose pliers that have a taper to the point.
and use them like wedges on either side, you must evenly apply presure to
both sides at the same time

                                   _
                                 / O \

make sure it is real loose before you try it is on REAL tight.


good luck
