Good afternoon everyone

I took my Westy to some RV place to look at the stove/propane tank.
I explained what was happening to him (he didn't actually look or listen =
to it) and he said the diaphram in the regulater was faulty.  He said the=
y don't make that particular shape regulater anymore, but the same compan=
y makes the same thing but not rectangular.  Not too expensive for a new =
regulater, but a lot to install it.  Is this something I can do on my own=
?  Has anyone tried this before?  Playing with propane has me concerned. =
 Is this safe or do I need special tools?

Also, evertime I put a fuse in my H2O pump it blows almost immediately.  =
I've tried fuses for different amps and they still blow.  Is the pump no =
good?

Also, he said that my oulet wasn't working because I need a new breaker. =
 Anybody know if you can buy just the breaker?  Anyone have a part number=
?

Any help is greatly appreciated
Thanks,
Kyle
