Hydraulics provide no more mechanical advantage than a mechanical system.
they have a bit less friction, but a bus has a very straight shot to the
clutch and has virtually no friction anyway.  If you're looking to
hydraulics to reduce pedal effort, you'll have to carefully engineer the
cylinder sizes to allow a greater mechanical advantage.  The problem then
is getting enough disengagement so that the clutch will not drag.  It
would be a whole lot easier to simply shorten the lever arm of the cable
hook on the clutch pedal.  Any competent welder could do the job in an
hour.  You'll get the same effect at a lot less cost and hassle.

My wife is a skosh over 5' and easily handles the stock clutch in our
'71 bus as well as the cable operated clutch in her '69 bug.  I think it's
more a matter of what she is used to than any defect in the bus.

Since my wife came equipped with a bug and a squareback when I met her I
didn't have that problem :)
