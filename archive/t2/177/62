Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump

Matt,
My '72 had an electric fuel pump installed and the
mechanical was simply taken out of line, but never
removed.  The only draw back with my set-up was the
NOISE that the electric pump made, upon further review
I suspect that was a result of the mounting location. 
You might want to ask other on the list the best place
to mount the pump so that it doesn't hum so loud in
the cab.  I couldn't even hear the engine over the hum
of the pump, very distracting to backseat
passengers...
When I swapped engines, my "new" engine had a working
mechanical fuel pump, so I took the electric pump out
of line.  It is still in place so that I can switch
fuel lines and go to the electric on the road if the
mechanical fails.
Best of luck,
Billy Ray
