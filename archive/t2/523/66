If all you want is repair PA Speedo is probably as good as any. But don't
expect any cosmetic work from them. I sent my Type 3 Ghia speedo to them
and when I found out they wouldn't do the cosmetic work I needed I had to
get it shipped back to me in parts so that I could paint the bezel and
polish out the plastic face. Since then a fellow T34 Registry member found
a source that will do the whole enchilada - and they're cheaper. Its
called Foreign Speedo in San Diego. A writeup with picture can be seen by
going to type34.org and searching on 'Gauge Restoration'.
