That's what I thought.  It looked like the same stuff that I use for making
mold boxes.  Looks exactly like a plastic version of corrugated cardboard.

It's called Coroplast.  It's used for making a lot of things, like portable
signs (another source for it, sign companies) and even for making radio
controlled air planes (AirCore line of RC planes).  Comes in a variety of
colors from gray and black to white, red, green, blue, etc..  Did you find
some clear, too?

Neat idea.  The lights look very cool.
