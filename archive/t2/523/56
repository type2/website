Subject: Busses & Breakfast Burritos

My family is looking forward to our first camping season with our 73
Standard Bay and I understand camping just cannot be done without the
requisite Breakfast Burrito. Without recreationally showing my ignorance,
let me admit that I have absolutely no clue what those are. What are the
ingredients...how do you make them...help. I know...not as interesting a
question as how to get my pencil eraser out of my fuel line...but can you
guys help me so I can impress my family?
