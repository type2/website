Thanks! Im hoping the police don't mind the blue (or incoming red)
either.. shouldn't really as long as Im parked.

Nope, the are flexxed into position and screwed in.
No movement and no sound.  The material isn't the kind
that would rattle really.

You think that's cool, wait till it's all done. :)
I have a couple other little things Im doing when it gets
warm again.. (got cold overnite).
