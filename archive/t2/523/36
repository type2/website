Subject: RE: [T2] Win a cool looking bus! 

Guys and Galls.  The Mojo bus (either Mo or Jo or both) will be in the Las 
Vegas area during 12 - 21 March.

Get this:  the Nike public affairs gal said that "they're not running right 
now" ! ! !  Like, why can I relate to that  ! ! !

Anyone out there that can grab some pics on the insides of the '67's and 
share them

Sounds a lot like the JVC van.  THAT was the ultimate BOOM BOX ... $10K for 
the restoration and $10K for the sound system.   Does anyone know where that 
JVC van is now??
