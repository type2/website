I have a one relay method for connecting the aux battery.  Just remember to
use a relay that us designed for constant use...your marine and boat supply
can show you one for under $50.00.
Here is my method, modifying Dougs ascii art.

What this does is connect both batteries together when the key on in the on
position, so that the alternator will charge both batteries.  When you key
is off, it disconnects the batteries from  each other, so that you are just
pulling the power from your AUX battery if you are using your
battery/sink/etc when the engine is not running.

My friends at the Marine store would also suggest putting in a large (30-50
amp) fuse/circuit breaker between the relay and the aux battery just to be
safe, but I haven't found it to be necessary.
