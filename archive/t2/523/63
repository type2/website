I much prefer Palo Alto.

Watch out for Hollywoood Speedo. They ran me around and billed me for the 
privilege. Confirmed by phone, "Can you fix this speedo, make, model, 
year??" NO PROBLEM!! Shipped it to them, they looked it over then shipped 
it back saying WE CAN'T FIX THIS, then billed me $25 plus return shipping. 
Total waste of money for ZERO value received?? In essence, NO PROBLEM was a 
bald faced lie. Anyone might get away with lying to me once. No one get's a 
second chance.
