Subject: Re: [T2] vanagon fuel pump?

I had a look at the fuel pump, on a coworker's early '80's aircooled
vanagon.  I jumpered the fuel pump to the red (top) lead on the pump with no
luck, there is a small spark and the pump hums but it definitely isn't
runnig.  I tried running it both backward and forward, I would get a spark
and hum but it appears to be siezed up.  Does it sound like I'm on the right
track for justifying replacing it?

It looks like this van will be mine shortly (the owner is willing to swap my
85 Toyota pick-up for it), it is a full westy complete with gas heater,
fridge, stove etc. and has the usual rusy spots by the fenders and driver
side camper vents but is clean underneath.  It has recently overhauled
engine and auto transmission, brand new gas tank etc etc.  The tranny is
still slipping (needs adjustment???) a bit and then it wouldn't start thus
the owner is frustrated with it, he's had a lot of work and $$ put into it
over the years and he's not a wrencher himself.
