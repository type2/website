Or perhaps the issue is with asking for highly skilled, quality work for
"VW" prices?

The VW community at large never seems to want to pay quality money for
quality work.

I've been quoted between $120 and $200 to repair and recalibrate my
speedo, and these prices sounded very reasonable to me.

To do it properly requires special tools, special knowledge, and /time/.

If you get such service as the T34 guy got, with face and needle
restoration as well, expect that the shop will have 3-4 hours into the
unit.  At $150 dollars, that's less then $40/hr for skilled labor,
shop time, and materials...and that's not bad. IMHO.

I pay more per hour to get tires mounted and balanced, but still find it
hard to find quality. (20$ tire, four tires takes 15 minutes, 20 on the
outside...you do the math.)
