Subject: Re: [T2] Neon roof pics

The material is a vinyl or plastic sheet that comes in the same size
as plywood.. 6x8 or so.  Two options, white or transparent.
I can't remember exactly but it's around 14-18$ Canadian a sheet.
My memory is vague on that part.. not too expensive.

Pretty flexible.  It wasn't just flat, it was about a 1/8 " wide,
kinda hollow in the center. With lines.  I should take a pic of
the stuff from a side angle.

shows the lines.

Under the stuff I put up insulation.. you can see all the stuff
under the same link:

I stuck the insulation up with liquid nails.. it even has a vapor barrier.
All from Home Depot.
