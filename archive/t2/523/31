Subject: 2.0 air-cooled FI rebuild - upgrade just a wee bit?

I searched the archives to see what popular wisdom was on raising the 
displacement on a fresh rebuild by going to 96mm P&Cs.  I found a few 
older references with mixed feelings on the subject.

What is the take on this in 2004?
Are there high quality/reasonable price 96 or 95mm P&Cs available?
Is this going to compromise the reliabilty?
Is there an easier way to gain ~ 10% HP while I am at the rebuild?
What about Porsche 2.0 P&Cs - they're crowned, no?

Thanks for the help,
