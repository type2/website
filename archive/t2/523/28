Subject: Re: [T2] plastic hose clamps

I'll go ahead and pull them all off and clean the seating area.  Any 
problems with putting some weather-strip compound in there.  I figure I 
won't be taking these of again for a very long time and I want a super 
seal.  And if I do need to take them off, weather-strip cement isn't 
that difficult to break free.

Thanks,
Mike
