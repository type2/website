I would stay with the factory setup. You won't find another clamp that will
do a better job. There are rubber seals on the non-return valve that may
need replacing. I believe they are available from the dealer. I would not
use any rubber hose anywhere in the booster circuit unless it is the steel
reinforced type designed for vacuum applications. The plastic hose is
usually fine, it is very strong and doesn't deteriorate.
