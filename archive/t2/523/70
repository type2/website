Subject: Differnt Speedometer question

I have an issue with my speedometer where it shows the miles per hour speed
roughly 5 to 10 miles faster than it should.  I've replaced the speedometer
with one that I know was accurate in my last bus, but I still have the
issue.  What should I start looking at to get this problem corrected?

Thanks,
