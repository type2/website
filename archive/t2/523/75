Hi Volks- I am a goldsmith.  One of the tools I use is called a
"burnisher",  which is a curved steel pointed tool. Stick the point
under the rim of the bezel and slide around the bezel (gauge). It will
lift the bezel smoothly.  Then there is a tool called a "bezel roller"
that is half mooned shape that will roll the bezel back into position.
I will be glad to loan each tool to whomever needs it, keeping in mind
that I have one spare of each. Makes bezels a snap...... TBear
