You could go around the lip and can this way twisting and bending the lip out but it will leave a jagged edge. I make the initial twist and then with slow firm pressure drag the screwdriver along while rotating the can. When you are done the ring will fall off, you can paint the needle with your favorite color, and if need be clean the insides. 

---> The idea is to move the metal over, to persuade the metal to move rather than stretching it.

By sliding the screwdriver along the metal is being moved. By doing a series of twisting movements, some of the metal is getting moved but right at the tip of the screwdriver the metal is being stretched which will make it hard to get the ring to roll back into place smoothly later. It will go back together but it will also looka nd feel rough. Once I got the hang of it it's tough to tell the the instrument has been apart... Wahoo!

Start with a partial twist, just enough to get the screwdriver "ramp" in place. Go all the way around and then again past the starting point. Viola! 

Looks like this could be done a few times before metal fatigue sets in becomes a problem.
