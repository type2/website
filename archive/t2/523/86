I doubt this list would exist if there wasn't such a DIY attitude wrt vw repair and we wouldn't be having this conversation.

And the reason for this is that VW parts are generally inexpensive compared to the cost of repair related to many other makes and models. For example, I can buy four new road wheels for $260 or spend a similar amount getting them repainted by skilled labor. Or I can paint them myself in an afternoon. Which way is better? I'm not trying to argue that here.

If no spare part can be found in the area, by all means get the repair done by skilled labor.
