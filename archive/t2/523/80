Ted,

Time to decide how important correct speed is to you then.

There is a procedure to adjust the speed shown given the
correct tire size, but it requires tearing your speedo apart and
then calibrating it on a table with the correct rpm's matched to
your tires.

I've done it on a bug speedo a long time ago and it is just a "touchy"
trial and error type of thing.

Or as several folks have pointed out, send it out to the speedo shop
and pay for the rebuild and calibration service.

Cheers, dave
