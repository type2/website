Subject: some questions from a beginner

so i am looking for a safe car i can maintain myself for my family that is 
also fun. i think a bus fits well with what i am looking for.  i am making a 
few basic assumptions about buses from what little knowledge i have.  maybe 
you all could correct me if i am mistaken?  i understand it is fairly easy 
to remove the engine and that aircooled engines from volkswagen are fairly 
simple to fix/wrench on/maintain.  i also understand that it recieves fairly 
good gas mileage and if cared for is very dependable.  please tell me if i 
am wrong!!!.  i am looking into buying a project bus not for complete 
restoration but for making a daily driver with road-trip capabilities.  so 
what am i looking at mpg wise on the average type 2?  what should i be 
looking to pay?  i have made a list of what i want in this bus and i 
understand that some of it will have to aftermarket labor and parts.  here 
is my list.  if you could direct me as to what parts/kits i might need, 
books to read, classes to take etc, i would greatly appreciate it.

-i need a dependable daily driver capable of sustained 70mph speeds - i 
understand there are dual carb options and special transmisions...where, 
how, what?

-i need heat and possibly a/c. - are there kits for this?

-i understand that sway bars are a good idea - anything particular i am 
looking for in a good sway bar?

-if the mpg is less than 25mpg what can i do to improve this?

-about how much time a month am i looking at to keep it in daily driver and 
highway speed shape?
will i need any specialized tools?

-how safe is a bus in accident situation? rollover?

-relatively how expensive is it to purchase parts for a bus '68 or up?   
thanks for your help!!!
