No doubt. Getting any of them to do a VW speedo for a non-Porsche price is
the hardest part. These aren't local club members willing to lend a hand,
they are business people.

There is also Rick Borth at <http://www.speedometer.com/> in Texas. I passed
on him as well but you might have better luck.
