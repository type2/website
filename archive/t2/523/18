Subject: Ingition Switch Replacement on 73 Bay?

All this recent talk about weak links in the starting of a bus has got me
thinking I should replace the electrical portion of my ignition switch.
I've done it on 914's a couple of times and know you can replace just the
electrical portion without jacking around with the part the key goes into
(no new key needed).  I assume it's the same on a 73 bus, but if anybody
could point me in the right direction for a step-by-step method for doing
the deed I'd really appreciate it!

Thanks.
