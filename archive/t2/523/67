Does anyone know of a good mechanic that knows busses in Northern Indiana or
NorthWest Ohio area?
I am wanting to be able to confidently take my bus on longer trips and want
to combine working on it myself with having a knowledgeable set of eyes take
a look and do the hard stuff as well.
Thanks,
Duane
