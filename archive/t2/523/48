Subject: RE: [T2] 2.0 air-cooled FI rebuild - upgrade just a wee bit?

  If you increase your displacement you will have to abandon your stock fuel 
injection system.  I have read in the Bosch Fuel Injection book that there 
is a "rising rate fuel pressure regulator" available, but I have never heard 
any reports on it, nor have I been able to track one down on the internet.  
There are high quality pistons and cylinders at www.lnengineering.com that 
will help your bus run cool too, but reasonable prices?  Well, probably if 
quality is what you care about.  There are several aftermarket fuel 
injections systems you could go with if you do increase your displacement, 
but they are usually big bucks, and a lot of work.  There are some recent 
posts on DIY FI here, might be worth checking out.  Jake Raby at 
www.aircooledtechnology.com seems to prefer increasing displacement with a 
longer stroke, which makes sense, but man, I've got to think that without 
the L & N cylinders that thing is going to be hot.  Still, I want to do it.  
I'm lazy and sloppy though, and apparently Jake isn't, and that's why his 
engines work.
  So, in conclusion, you should drop five grand on a stroked, aluminum 
cylindered, counterweighted, Haltech FI equipped bus, like I want to do, or 
enjoy driving slowly up hills like I actually do.  I feel your pain.
