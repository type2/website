Ted,

The correct tires????<grin>

Tell us about your tires!  VW speedo's run directly off of tire
rotation speed.  Larger or smaller tires will cause problems.

Stockish bus tires are supposed to be about 25.7" in diameter
and get approx 808 revolutions per mile.

Go pick your tires out on www.tirerack.com, and then choose to look at 
"Spec's".  


Cheers, dave
