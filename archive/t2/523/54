Subject: Idaho Falls to Everybus???

Hi Volks,

Is there anyone on the list attending EveryBus who is close to Idaho 
Falls?

There's a guy there selling a set of 15" steel rims that I am 
interested in, and was hoping that someone could lend a hand with 
shipping.

Failing that, if someone near EveryBus could accept the shipment I 
could pickup at their location when I'm down there.


Happy trails,
