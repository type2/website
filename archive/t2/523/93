Subject: RE: [T2] Removal of ignition lock?

ok i'm working from memory here so bear with me. plus, when i did this it
was on a '72,
so there might be some differences.

look underneath the ignition switch at the underside of the steering column.
there should be 4 screws that hold the steering column in its upright
position.

remove those 4 screws & pull the entire thing towards the driver's seat.
you'll see a push-button type mechanism & that is your steering lock. push
the button in to disengage the steering lock.

for safety, make sure the bus isn't going to roll or move during this
procedure!

good luck,
