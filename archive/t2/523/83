Subject: AIRS call;  standed bus driver;  Bishopville, South Carolina

hey folks;

I have not spoken with this person yet, but the call for help was passed to 
me to post to the lists.

LAURA BLUE has been stranded on I-20 in south carolina,  in a littel town 
called Bishopville, in between COLUMBIA and FLORENCE.

She is driving a Sage green 1976 Westy................. it died on the side 
of I-20, and I have not gotten the full report on what happened.

She needs some assistance if any list memebers are near her.

her cell phone number is   910-612-3729

thanks, buddah
