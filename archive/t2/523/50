I do. I stopped by and asked about just changing a faceplate and I was quoted $100. You can find a used speedo for far less than the cost to rebuild both of those.

The owner is really nice and he's got a lot of parts and can do the final calibration etc. but judging by the Mercedes, Porsche and other expensive cars he services he probably doesn't see alot of VWs.
