Vintage VW buses exist therefore there will be mailing lists for them just
like there are for every other make/model/brand of vintage vehicle. I don't
think "DIY Attitude" is a requirement for a list to exist! But most every
list will have some DIY'ers on it.

compared to the cost of repair related to many other makes and models. For
example, I can buy four new road wheels for $260 or spend a similar amount
getting them repainted by skilled labor. Or I can paint them myself in an
afternoon. Which way is better? I'm not trying to argue that here.

I suggest the cost of doing quality resto work to guages is about the same
be it a vintage VW Bus, Porsche, Ford, Fiat Etc., I would also suggest the
it is equally inexspensive to do "previous owner from hell rattle can
restoration in an afternoon" be it a vintage VW BUS, Porsche, Ford, Fiat
etc. Theres no real cost difference between the makes and models. Any cost
saving is a result of being cheap, thrift, frugal whatever you want to call
it. I would also suggest those road wheels are equally exspensive wether you
mount them on a bus OR ANY OTHER VEHICLE they will fit.

Regardless if you run a rat bus or a rat porsche rattle can techniques may
be justified.

Are complete brake jobs cheaper to do to a bus versus a 76 ford van, or do
all those brake parts cost about the same? Sure its a lot cheaper to just
rattle can your booster and armor all the hoses but that doesnt help you
stop
