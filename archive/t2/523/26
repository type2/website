Subject: plastic hose clamps

Is there any good reason to keep the plastic hose clamps on the booster 
vacuum tube joints?  I'm thinking of cleaning the joints and switching 
them to metal hose clamps.  Should I chop the joints and use rubber hose 
with metal clamps instead?

I need to get all my vacuum connections really tight because I have a 
couple vacuum leaks that are giving me a high idle (not using l-jet).

thanks,
Mike
