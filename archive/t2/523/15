Are you running a Pertronix unit?  I had a very similar problem in my 73
that I suffered through for 2 winters.  Finally, after replacing virtually
every FI piece with either a new one or a known-good one I replaced the
distributor which had a Pertronix in it and the problem went away.  Maybe it
was the distributor, maybe it was the Pertronix.  I've never tried that
dizzy again without the Pertronix so I can't say for sure...
