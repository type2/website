Bus content:
Feeling pretty jazzed over my nice clean, crack free, rock chip
free, windshield.  The world looks so much cleaner now.

Non bus content:
what the heck is a tempeh?

P.S.
Why is it that I never see any west coast camping get togethers?  I
know for a fact that there are some bus oriented camping groups here
in Oregon,.. dunno if they would accept the presence of a lowly
standard non westy bus driver though.  I see meets and cruises up in
Washington state, but nada in Oregon.  Go figure...
