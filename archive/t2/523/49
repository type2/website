My '78 FI bus would start, run like a top for 3 seconds, then die.  It would 
not re-start for a few hours, but when it did, it would do the exact same 
thing.  I replaced the air flow meter to no avail.  It turned out to be a 
broken spring on an intake valve.  Or was it exhaust?  I slept since then, 
but a quick peek at your valves should tell you if that was the problem.  My 
spring was broken in two different places, and came out in 3 pieces.
