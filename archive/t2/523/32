James,

I got to thinking and did a flame test with a piece of Coroplast.  It burns
like a candle, readily supports a flame; and the drips from the burning
Coroplast stay lit until they hit the sink bottom.

Be careful, Dude.  In a bus fire this stuff could turn the experience into a
literal "hell" of a time.

Dang, I was hoping for a quick fix to my roof problem...
