Sorry, sounds like a lack of communication. The nose SHIPS from
California. But it's MADE in Brazil. You asked where they came from,
meaning originally, and he apparantly misunderstood the question (duh
:-) and told you where they ship from.  

Klokkerholm/Denmark does sell a nose, and periodically you'll see it
listed at other vendors as being "made in Denmark." Unfortunately, it's
the same Brazilian nose, just imported and rebranded by Klokkerholm You
pay more because you bought your new bus nose a European vacation,
paying to have it shipped from Brazil to Denmark to the United States.
Save your money and use it for your own European vacation. :-) 

As for the gauge specs, I'm afraid I have no info on that.
