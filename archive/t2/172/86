Subject: Clutch in my 79' Westy

Mountains burnt my clutch out!! I'm dying having to share my wife's Jeep 
with her again. Anyway, can I replace the clutch without dropping the 
engine? I don't have a lot of tools, a garage, or an engine stand, so I'd 
like to make this replacement as easy and painless as possible. Any and all 
advice would be appreciated.

Thanks in Advance,
Jared
