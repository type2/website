Getting close to the structural limit of the bus according to the doorjam.

Good points.  Is the GAWR values on the doorjam are to be adhered to then a
1400 lbs spec tire at maximum inflation would be almost at it's limit when
the bus is fully loaded, and that's standing still.

So I guess the rule of thumb is to use D load range tires if you plan to
totally load your bus down regularly if you worry about safety.  My
experience has been a loaded down bus handles better anyway. ;-)
