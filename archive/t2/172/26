Inquire about parking arrangements.

I was there in 1994 for the Navy Fleet Week and parking appeared to be 
limited and safe parking was even more limited.

I think your best bet would be to park out in one of the boroughs and ride 
the subway or busses into the city.

We walked, rode the subway, and took a couple of taxis.

Saw so much, missed so much too. Wished we had gotten away from Manhattan 
and Soho and Greenwich but we were all small town Southern boys and none of 
us knew what to make of it all. Overwhelming.
