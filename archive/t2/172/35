Subject: The Woes of the Fuel Filter Change: THANKS

Hi Again,
I just wanted to send out a big thanks to all the folks who responded to my
fuel filter/gas bath question.  Thanks for taking the time to donate your
experiences and ideas.  Looks like I'll be gently using my small vice-grips
(or will maybe buy one of those special fuel hose clamps) from now on, with
full intentions of installing some kind of fuel valve later on down the
road.  Thanks again!  Happy trails.
