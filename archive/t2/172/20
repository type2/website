Subject: [T2] Guage Locations

Bus Boys sells a three gauge faceplate that allows you to mount three gauges
in the dashboard space under the radio. It involves cutting the dash. When
installed correctly it looks factory. I've seen photos of it on various
peoples websites. I'll keep an eye out for a photo.
