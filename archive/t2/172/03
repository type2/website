I have ball valves on both sides of the ring line on my 78.

the location is almost impossible to reach, I take the engine out and
change the fuel filter a lot more often then that custom 5,000PSI
industrial metal flex hose that I have to/from my tank does!!

also use em as security shut off switches when leaving my bus on a lot for
any length of time (like at the airport)

and super simple when the engine needs to come out or the fuel filter gets
changed.  only the fuel in the filter itself ever comes out
