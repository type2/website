VW parts department computer shows it as "obsolete."   Which means there 
might be a few still on shelves at dealers somewhere. The part # is 022 129 
967 AC.
California Imports catalog offers an intake boot elbow for buses 78-79 and 
same item for Vanagons 80-83, cost $39.95,  without a listing for earlier 
model years. The diagram shows hose nipples at different locations than for 
my 76. But it might fit otherwise.

Fixing the old duct or finding a used one is the path I was forced into. 
And fixing the old one only took a few hours. It is presently doing its 
task and the engine is running again.

And a marvelous enthusiast in California is sending me a used one. Thanks 
all for your help.
