WRONG size!
The correct size is 185R14. With no center number, the aspect ratio is 82. The
aspect ratio is the difference between the width of the tread and the sidewall
measured in %. A 82 tire has a sidewall that is 82% of the width of the tread.
i.e. if you had a tire that was 10" wide, the sidewall would be 8.2". With a
75 series tire, the same 10" wide tire would have a sidewall 7.5". Here is a
site where you can put in the correct size and then the replacement size and
see the difference:

However, 82 is not listed.....you have to use 80.
Your better choice would have been 195/75......
