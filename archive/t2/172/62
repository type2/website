I was wondering what years volkswagen switched styles
of speedos and gas gauges. My 74 currently has one
that looks like the one on a 71 I just sold. It's got
the oil and generator lights( not alternator), and all
of that stuff. I think that someone swithched the two
gauges into the plastic panel because there are little
label light things next to the heater and fresh air
levers. So what I'm trying to get at is what are the
guages in a 74 supposed to look like and what other
years had the same so that I can start looking for the
correct ones,
TIA,
Later,
Tyler
