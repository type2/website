In a perfectly controlled static environment, you're right - a tire rated at 
1000 pounds would be strong enough.  But when you start taking in all of the 
conditions that your bus is subjected to every day then you start to realize 
why you need to overkill this problem.  Some of those factors include:

    1.) Carrying extra gear/people.  I've been know to put 300-400 pounds 
behind my rear seat and another 600-800 pounds in the floorboard.  This is 
bound to increase the rear axle weight from 1860 to 2500 or more.
    2.) Going over bumps, rises, and dips in the road.  If you stand on a pogo 
stick, it doesn't compress much, but you start jumping up and down on it and 
you'll see the difference.
    3.) Going around corners.  With the high center of gravity on our buses and 
the lack super-duty sway bars (for most of us), you really side-load those 
tires when you go around corners.  Add a nice dip in the corner while you're 
already loaded up and hold on!
    4.) The ever-popular and always-feard cross-wind and blow-by from freight 
trucks (and Suburban drivers who are convinced that triple digit speeds are 
safe).

Any of these conditions will increase the weight on one or more of your tires.  
But when you start stacking these conditions together, you can see why you 
really need some tires that'll handle 1.5 to 2.0 times the empty weight of your 
bus.
