Subject: Fwd: Re: [T2] The Woes of the Fuel Filter Change

I struggled with this problem for years and stumbled onto a nifty 
solution.  On page 74  of the my Sears Craftsman Power and Hand Tool 
Catalog,  there is an item called

6 piece combination Line Clamp and Plug Pliers Set.

These are plastic plier-like gadgets that clamp neatly onto a fuel 
line and prevent even a dribble. I have two sets. When I go to test a 
line or to pull an engine, I place one on the braided line that 
emerges from the fuel tank.  I sprinkle others around to make the job 
easy.

One of the best investments I ever made. It simply eliminates the 
problem of down-your-arm-and-into-your-face.
