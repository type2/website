Aspect ratio is the ratio between the section height (distance from rim to
tread) to the width of the tire.  Smaller numbers are squatter tires.  If
the number is omitted, the aspect ratio is 82, the highest commonly
available on a radial tire.

A 185/75R14 is too small of an aspect ratio for a bus.  The engine will
turn more times per mile and your top speed will be less.  This will not
be evident from the speedometer, since it is affected as well.

Load ranges vary with the size, but the maximum load does not.  If the
maximum load is greater than 1540 pounds it is sufficient for a bus.

Generally, load range D tires aren't much more expensive than load range C
tires, so you're better off to get the stiffer tire.  Your handling will
be better.
