Subject: Guage Locations

Hey, folks,

I am finally getting around to installing the guages I bought for my 74, and
after a bit of fiddling it has become apparent that I officially hate the
plastic 'pods' used to mount them on top of the dash. There just isn't any
good place for those pods to go. I originally bought the pods because I also
have never been a fan of hanging the guages below the dash. So, how have
others solved the mounting problem? I have four guages: oil pressure, oil
temp, head temp, and volts. Any suggestions are gratefully accepted and
pictures, if available, would be a plus!

Thanks in advance,
Dave
