Joe, I have drive dead-booseter buses too, and it is not impossible.
First, of course, it helps to be expecting it :-)  Nothing like the assist
just not being there all at once!  Second, I am certainly not "ripped"
either... well, OK, once or twice, but it's been years since my last frat
party (oh...  not that kind of "ripped"? :)  I exagerate *a bit* on the
500 bl. leg press, but I know plenty of people who would not be able to
manage a normal stop in a disc brake bus w/o the booster, and I would
bet that it really would take a strongman to manage to lock the brakes in
a panic stop situation, no exageration.

As someone elses posted, that rebuilder in Dallas does good work
reasonable.  And they are not limited to VWs... my father sent a GM
booster to them and it was ~$100 vs. the grand that GM wanted!
