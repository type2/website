Subject: My bus runs! YAY!

Hey... After months of crap, a new head, new oil cooler, lots of other 
little bits, and most recently a fight with timing/vacuume/idle 
speed/why else doesn't it run, i finally hooked up my vacuume lines 
correctly and got the idle set pretty close to right and drove it around 
town beeping at people.  It runs better than it ever has, and it's 
quieter then ever, i actually had to turn off the radio and lean my head 
out at stop lights to be sure it was still running.

So i'm excited about that.  But i have one question.  Does anyone know, 
or can you go to your bus and check, the vacuume reading of the brake 
booster at the intake manifold?  Mine won't hold vacuume, but it'll let 
me pump to almost five psi with constant pumping....  I don't know what 
that means.  The bus stops fine.  I'd like to know how to test the 
vacuume line that runs under the bus, because i don't want an extra 
vacuume leak...

Thanks
