first off, thanks to all that helped with my previous question on hose =
placement.  Now, I need to make sure that my dizzy is working right.  I =
pulled the hose off the carb for the advance and sucked on it, and the =
plate moved about 3/4in.  It snapped back after I let go. (normal?)  And =
the retard side showed no movement when I sucked on that hose. (normal?) =
Any help would be great. =20
