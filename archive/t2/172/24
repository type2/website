Subject: purple headlights

Yeah I've heard they are illegal too, but I do have the purple lights as =
aux lights in the assembly, the headlights are regular clear, I only turn =
on the purple lights when I am at a campout or show or goofing off around =
home. Last week I did have the purple lights on running around Phoenix and =
a cop was at a light accross an intersection and was checking me out very =
carefully, but never turned around or anything...got lucky I guess. I =
didn't see any DOT stickers on the assembly when I put them in. I'll have =
to be more cautious. -Mark B.
