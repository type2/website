Hi Volks,

I would be interested to see the numbers putting just *one* wheel on the
scale and then having two people simulate a cross-wind by pushing really
hard on the opposite side of the bus.

I'd be willing to bet that crosswinds, braking and cornering loads can
increase the weight transferred to a particular wheel very substantially;
which would account for the load rating.

My bus has handled so much better since I got a decent set of Continentals.

Happy trails,
