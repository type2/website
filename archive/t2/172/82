You know, I keep hearing about manifold icing in weber progressives but I've
never experienced it. Not 10 years ago when I made a single carb rig out of
a Pinto carb, a welded steel box for a manifold and a set of FI runners. Not
in my 73 with a weber setup, and not now in my 1.8 ltr 74. What am I doing
right? Believe me, it isn't due to any secret, arcane engineering on my
part; all I did was install and tune as best as I could without re-jetting.
All three of these busses were based in KY and traveled north and south of
there in all seasons.  Is carb icing really that common a problem?

Just wondering,
