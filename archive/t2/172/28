Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Filter Change - cutoff valve

I saw a couple of VW busses in Italy that had the tanks on the roof. Bulky 
and not aerodynamic at all but these were delivery vehicles and seldom were 
running around at very high speeds.

Most of the vehicles I got the chance to see under to hood were converted 
had a propane "ring" inserted between the carb and the air filter. At the 
flip of a switch the electric gasoline pump would switch off - - the carb 
bowl would drain and when the engine stuttered a bit the other switch would 
get flipped to allow the propane service to start and the vehicle would 
continue on unstopped.

Created a dual fuel system for occasions when one fuel or the other was 
unavailable. Propane was considerably cheaper than gasoline and there was a 
tax-free black market openly operating.

Diesel was another fuel that could be bought tax-free if you were a farmer 
and used it in your tractor. A friend had a large tank of it at his house 
for his car - and he was certainly not a farmer. He bought surplus from a 
farmer friend. His friend made a bit of money and my friend saved alot of 
money.

Understand that the gasoline was $4.50-$4.75 in 1993! Their gasoline cost 
about the same to produce but the difference was in the taxes. Italy had 
many socialized programs to pay for - socialized medicine for one - and 
these crazy taxes paid for it.

Maybe 4 or 5 Westy stove tanks under the vehicle in parallel would be a 
good way to transport propane under a VW bus?
