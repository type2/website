Subject: VW Infringement?

With all this talk about VW going after people selling what is copyrighted
by VW--"Anything" With Their LOGO--shape of the Bug--etc. etc. etc. and
using attorneys to enforce this law-- Then, can this be carried a step
further--And that step is--

Stopping us from selling our Used VWs? As All our used VWs vehicles have the
VW logo on them. Is this the next step?
