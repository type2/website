Subject: 71 high roof and 81 ASI camper

   Here's the deal of the century if you are looking for a high roof 71 bus,
camper interior gone appears to have no rust and is straight, supposed to
run and drive, it's red and faded, very straight and rust free(from looking
at the pics. Now the deal 600 dollars or best offer. PLEASE do not contact
me. The bus is located in Apple Valley, Califorication and the lady who owns
it wants it GONE, here's a contact number in AZ to get hold of her 928   505
8331, I have put this on the list first before anywhere else.

   Now, I hace a 81 Vanagon , blue, ASI camper, semi runs, everything works,
fairly clean bus $750.00 dollars MUST be picked up in Lake Havasu, will try
to get some pics up soon, if not gone before. Core value on the parts is
more then I want for the bus.
