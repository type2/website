I've got a single Webber progressive in my '74. It sucks when the weather
gets below 70degrees because of the fuel/air mix freezing in the VERY LONG manifold.
But it is quite easyto adjust is 50% less likely to fail than a dual carb setup. And you never
have to worry aboutbalancing the carbs.

In the 70s the Webber Prog was pushed heavily as a way to increase
fuel economy. The best performance, fuel and power, would come from a FI
system - but that canbe a headache.

I'm in Florida right now and would love to trade! My Webber Prog loves this
hot weather and the dual webbers would be right at home in Tennessee!
