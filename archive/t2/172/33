Add me to the 3-gauge top-of-dash pod fan list.  Like Russ, I put mine over the speaker holes, near the left edge.  Instead of velcro, I drilled one (1) 
hole for the left mounting screw and ran the right screw through a speaker grill hole.

Angle is pretty good although not perfect -- but much better than below the radio, unless you tilted the gauges.

When the pod first goes up, you're like "I can't see the road!" but it really doesn't affect your view.
