You really got me thinking about using rubber in the repair of that cracked 
"S" duct.  There is a  rubber duct that connects the intercooler to the 
throttle body in my 87 Audi 5000 turbo quattro. I have such a duct on my 
desk right now, to replace the one in the Audi when it fails. It looks like 
the Michelin Man, with a series of bulges and constrictions along its length.

It has a diameter about the same as the 76 bus "S" duct, and it IS designed 
to flex, which was the problem with the bus duct. They do the same thing in 
the way of connecting a vibrating/bouncing engine throttle body to a fixed 
chassis part. The Audi part flexes just fine but fails eventually because 
it carries some oil from the turbo, and it runs in a hot environment. The 
bus part doesn't flex very much, and fails because it flexes mainly at one 
point, and the material eventually breaks there from the flexing.

I would have to adapt the Audi part to fit the bus throttle body inlet, and 
I would have to mate the Audi part to the upper third of the bus duct, to 
retain the two hose inlets in the bus  part. But it WOULD flex better than 
the bus part. Maybe there is some other flexible connector out there 
somewhere, like in the plumbing department of a home repair store (Lowe's?) 
I have seen big flexible connectors sitting on their shelves as I walked 
the aisles looking for vacuum hose replacements.

Thanks for the stimulating thought. Hope to hear from you. Discussion is 
good.   Doyt Echelberger
