Maybe, I've heard that those without DOT cert or
stamps or something are illegal, but I doubt that
Deputy Dog knows anything about it.  But that
same deputy does know that your forward facing
lights can only be white or amber.  Not blue,
red, purple, green, or anything else(at least
without an emergency vehicle permit) in all the
states with which I am familiar.
