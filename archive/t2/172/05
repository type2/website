Ed,

There is no nut there on a T4.  The "nut" is a steel insert pressed inot
that corener of the case.  the bolt head you need to unscrew, rom
underneath, is indeed pretty inaccessible, but with a 17mm socket on a 6"
extension, it is reachable.

The secret is to fly to California, go to a junk yard, and pull it off
yourself.  It will be ~$50 + $200 airfare (if you find a good sale...  $75
if you wait til September and fly Southwest's intro offer).  Probably
buying it piece by piece, you would rack up that much from a mail order
house (and you miss the trip to CA :-)
