Ah.  Another problem that I weighed myself a few years back when I put FI on my 
73.  I thought about this long and hard since my original tank was in perfect 
condition and the FI tanks I had access to were moderately ugly.  I finally 
decided against it because of the increased turbulance and in-tank vapor this 
would cause.  

If you're not sure what I mean, try pouring Coca-Cola into a glass by pouring 
it carefully down the edge of the glass.  Not too much foam.  Now try pouring 
it from 15" above the glass.  OK, so gasoline doesn't foam like Coke, but 
you're still going to be creating a lot of air bubbles.  Not to mention the 
increased vapors floating around in there which seems like it would cause the 
gas to evaporate faster and create more gas-smell outside the bus.

I still say, if you're going to go to all the trouble of fitting FI, why not 
spend a few bucks for a decent used tank with the proper tubes on it.
