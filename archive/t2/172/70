Subject: VW Swap Meet Sunday (6/9) McMinnville, Oregon

VW/Porsche swap meet this Sunday at Parts Obsolete in McMinnville,
Oregon.

See http://www.partsobsolete.com/Swap%20Meet%202000.htm for more info.  
(Calendar says 2001, but I called the shop and they verified that it is
this weekend in 2002.)
