Subject: Re: [T2] Whats a tent worth?

If its perfect--no stains, no holes, no rips tears, or non-woking
zipper's, with All the original steaks, and guy ropes, original bags for
both the poles and the tent, and in a non faded brilliant color----

Your looking at anywhere between 6 to 7 hundred---

Deduct for any of the above mentioned condition----

There is a gentleman in California, selling these tents for 11--to 12
hundred---and gets it---and they are almost perfect as new---

He wanted $200.00 for just a set of original steaks, and guy ropes---and
got it----!!!!

The tents sold for $475.00 when purchased from VW as an accessory when
they were new---

So considering inflation, as well as collectability--and the fact they
add to you Van--Bus's total resale value--- so what ever they are worth
or sell for is a good deal---and is an asset to your vehicle---

Its a mad, mad world we live in---:>)

Terry
