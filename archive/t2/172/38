Mark,
I have H4's with 80/100w. crystal blue bulbs, and many 
a police officer have passed me by.  I'm sure if I was 
calling attention to myself, that situation would 
change.

When you think about it, there are many things that 
some of our busses run that are illegal, but it's 
always up to the discretion of the officer.

It's also a matter of choice as to what we run on our 
busses, stock, hi-perf, or illegal.  Of course, the 
consequences are our choice, too.




Later,
