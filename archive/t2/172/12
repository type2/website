Subject: Re: [T2] engine stand

I bought the 750lb one myself.  The head and little arms didn't work
very
well with the VW config until I mounted them to an old Type 2 bell
housing, then it worked very well, as long as you aren't splitting the
case.  

For that job, someone gave me (Dubbers are some of the best people!)
another engine stand with the real (half case) head. 

I've got both occupied right now.  I'm messing with my first VW engine
build on the half case mount and trying to figure out a compression
problem on the harbor freight stand.  Starter motor mounts right up. 
I'm looking for a good remote starter switch to crank it.  I just don't
like the touching to wires together biz.
