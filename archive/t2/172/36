That's exactly it.  No "DOT"  in the glass and it's not legal.

That being said, I've never heard of anyone with properly aimed headlights
with proper bulbs being pulled over.  The proliferation of different
headlight styles means that you can get away with a lot more than you used
to, as long as you don't glare or have an odd color bulb.
