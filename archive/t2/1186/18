Actually the choices are quite easy, like Tim mentions go to Tire Rack.  I
would say the 93 load raters that are on it were indeed not up to it (mind you
though no one would have thought twice putting them on a 5000lb Audi sedan or
wagon), but TireRack lists several good choices in 195/70 or 205/65 R 15 XL
load for Eurovans.  You can pay anywhere from $90-170 each.  They are all
unfortunately Conti's or Michelin's as you would expect and I don't personally
care for the Vanco2,4, or Agillis (the ludicrous $171 choice) much, but better
than no load crap.

I'd look to see what Nokian might currently offer (they
usually have an all season, not just a snow) and see what Ron lists for the
Eurovan on Bus Depot (I looked a Vredestein for $180 ooof)  You want to search
wherever you look for a listing for '93 or '95 EV or EVC.

Could be a Hankook
or something out there as well.  The Vanco's are the budget choice as I see
it.

When you go non-stock like
that, it gets very difficult to find the right
stiff truck type sideways you
need. It is nothing like simple keeping up

TireRack is one tire seller on
line that has a search engine. Plug in your
size, see what fits in commercial
tires for trucks and vans. Could be lots
more choices in 15" than for the
stock sizes, I would expect.
