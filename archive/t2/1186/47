do you have those.

full mileage is still bad but  playing with the AFM has gotten it a little 
better.  still can't find the "real" problem I have been compensating by 
adjusting the AFM.  but if I put my new AFM on with factory settings it 
goes back to it's old terrible fuel mileage.

thanks I haven't forgotten your advice just reach a frustration level 
where I have been driving it rich and watchiing things. it runs cool etc 
still mystified.

thanks
