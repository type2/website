Subject: Weber and Motorcraft carbs and intakes for sale

My 72 bus came with two single carb manifolds to go with the AW code 1800
engine, and my case has a clamp in the center bolt that matches an eyelet in
the bottom of the manifold. Both manifolds have an MB cast into the bottom.

It also came with two 2 barrel carbs. I had a closer look at them and one is a
Weber 32 36 DFAV, it looks to be new or close to it. The other is not marked
other than an 12R 5765 B cast into the upper housing and Motorcraft in what
appears to be the electric choke housing. I was thinking that it might be for
a Capri or other Euro Ford but Google found me a link below that suggests it's
from an early
Pinto:

I'm going with an Empi twin carb kit on my bus engine so I will not need these
carbs or intakes.  Plus I need barn money b:

So to recap what is for sale here:

A used Motorcraft 12R 5765 B 32/36 carb, probably from a Pinto. Get it while
it's hot! (see what I did there? worked in a Pinto joke)

A new or nearly new Weber 32/36 DFAV carb.

(2) MB intake manifolds/risers that fit a type 4 1700/1800 and the above
carbs. May fit other engines, I can't say.

I'll be fishing around for reference sell prices on the web but feel free to
send reasonable offers off list. Worst I can do is say no.
