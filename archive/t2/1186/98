I think the difference is that ring because I was sent the wrong unit 
and they just sent out a ring for me.

The vacuum advance distributors have an extra plate on the breaker 
plate, so it raises the sensor up.  The ring then spaces off the magnet 
disk so it doesn't hit the sensor.  You will also need to take your 
rotor to a sander and shorten it a hair, otherwise the cap won't fit.
