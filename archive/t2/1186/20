Subject: re: Ignition Switchnfailure

Yes, Jim,
That info did help... a lot !
The ignition part has been acting up for several years now, and replacing it
has always been put off for the obvious painful reasons.

The spring return does not work. I have to return the key back to the run
position after cranking.

Is the return spring in the main cylinder unit, or a part of the separate
ignition switch component?

From what I can see, removing the steering wheel is necessary in order to
replace even just the ignition switch component, argh ! (correct?)
