Subject: Bolt for Sliding Door Handle

My sliding door handle fell off of by '79 Bay  :(

The bolt that holds the
handle in place had worked its way out and now has a new home in the wild
somewhere.

I've looked around some UK websites, but I can't quite seem to
find that bolt.  I think the bolt also used for some other parts on the bus as
well.
Can anyone tell me what search phrases I should use for this bolt or any
suppliers that have them in stock (even in the States).

Thanks,

Josh
