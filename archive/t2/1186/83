Sorry for the late reply on this - I was on a road trip.

Funny thing - how come nobody asked what your air/fuel ratio is?

So, I'll ask, what's your AFR?  It doesn't really matter if the 5th 
injector is leaking or you have other injectors stuck all the time as 
that'll be reflected by your AFR - so, *that* is where we have to start. 
  If it's running 16:1, then you are in-fact lean.  If it's running 
12:1, then you're actually running rich - however I quickly scanned 
through all of these emails and haven't seen any numbers.

So, let's start at the beginning and then go from there.  When you drive 
a cruise, what is your AFR.  When you floor it, what's your AFR?  Heck, 
you might just have a perfectly running engine and a fuel leak dripping 
fuel on the ground for all we know ;)
