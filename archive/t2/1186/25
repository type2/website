Hey, I'm running Michelin Harmony on my CR-V with a 95T load range. I 
have them on both of my daily driver cars - 1st gen CR-V and VW Cabrio.

Not necessary good on heavy snow - they are a good, long wearing tire 
for basic all-seasons use. Like I said they last forever and they stay 
smooth unlike two sets of OEM Bridgestones that the CR-V came with from 
the factory. Wore out the first set in 45K miles, figured I'd give them 
another try and that set was lousy too - noisy and rough the last 1/3 of 
the tire's life. The Michelins have repeatedly been smooth and lasted 
way longer than those Bridgestones. Have used Bridgestones on 
motorcycles with good luck. Not so much on my 'V.

When my 15" Mercedes wheel equipped bus is back on the road and I need 
tires, I'll be looking at these again. However that said there may be 
better options.
I looked up a recent Chrysler Town and Country minivan which we all know 
to be heavier than our old VW Westies. They specify 100T tires.
I can't get any results looking for a stock VW van 14" wheel size of 
course b/c nobody puts wheels that small on a vehicle that large anymore.
95T is according to Tire Rack 1521 pound per tire on the size I am using 
for my CR-V, and 122 mph which my bus will never achieve - nor will my 
Honda. The Cabrio could but won't... LOL!

FWIW I bought mine locally from a Mom 'N Pop with excellent service and 
BEAT the prices at Walmart and Sam's Wholesale by a little.
Since the Mom 'n Pop supports various events and organisation around 
town I feel better spending my money with them anyhow.
This local Mom 'n Pop covers their walls with pictures of local stuff 
they help support.
The big box retailers here don't.

I've used the Type II supporters too for everything but not tires yet.
Have used TireRack before but they were more $$$ in the long run.
No tax but I did have to pay for shipping and installation.

Yeah, discussing tires here is like discussing politics and religion. Or 
sports... LOL! Let us know what you buy.
