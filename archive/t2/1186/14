I got my covers, and the non-return flaps, a few years ago from Busted Bus.
These were new, not used, ones.

According to the invoice I have from 27 April 2009 the prices were:

Type 4 Non-return flaps	$29.99
Type 4 Left channel cover	$24.99
Type 4 Right channel cover	$24.99

I'm pretty sure those prices are not the same now.

I am fitting together everything on my Type 4 engine and I am much more
familiar with the uprights.   I do not have and cannot find the parts
between the heat exchanger and the fan shroud in with the parts I got with
the bus.  Please see the photos below for details.

I assume they are important and I need them.  Does anyone have some spares?

TIA
