Porsche 914 uses the same seal.  Never had a melt-down/fire with the
original seal on that or any Type 4 based Bay I've owned.  Then again
if it was 30+ years old and falling apart.....

As John said, the Vanagon seal is more of a "pinch weldt" seal
surrounding the engine.  Probably offers a better seal against heat
and keeps the cool air in the engine bay which is considerably smaller
in height than the Bay Window.  The Wasserboxer does not have, nor
requires a compartment seal.

If memory serves, the Vanagon seal is longer than the Bay seal, but is
MUCH more expensive (when you can find it) at around $150 verses $40
(Airhead has OEM, not a repro)
