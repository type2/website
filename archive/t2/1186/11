Subject: I'm missing something - Type 4 content

I am fitting together everything on my Type 4 engine and I am much more
familiar with the uprights.   I do not have and cannot find the parts
between the heat exchanger and the fan shroud in with the parts I got with
the bus.  Please see the photos below for details.

I assume they are important and I need them.  Does anyone have some spares?

TIA
