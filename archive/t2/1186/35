Subject: Re: [T2] rear bump stops

OK, so I've looked in the Bentley and even with a picture there's no
description of how to remove
one...Before I tear what's left of mine apart does anyone know how to
get one off without destroying
it...I've got a replacement on my parts Bus but can't see how it's held
on...What am I missing...?-(

To answer my own question...It's held on by a ball and socket connec-
tion...A wide screwdriver just pops it off... ;-)
