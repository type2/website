Subject: Starting to say goodbye

It looks like I am moving by early or mid next year back to New 
England.  After a lot of discussing this with my SO, it seems to make 
more sense to leave Green Bean here, hopefully with a List Member who 
will love her as I do.  The thought of watching this CA bus perforate 
with rust is not appealing to me, as I'll likely be in a city and 
needing to park it outside with all that salt.

I have not set a price yet, but I am taking her to two more music 
festivals here in CA before I sell.

I want to get another VW-type vehicle when I get settled back there but 
this next year I need the money and a simpler life.

Is there a way I can figure out what is a fair price to offer her for?  
She is in daily driver condition but is *NOT* restored.  Yet rust is 
minimal, and a lot of work has been done on her in the last couple of 
years, including clutch, flywheel, heads, brakes, etc.

Anyone having thoughts on this, please feel free to contact me on or off 
list.

I've loved the fellowship on this list during my last 11 years as a "Bus 
Driver".

BEN
