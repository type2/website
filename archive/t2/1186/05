I would have expected that the Vanagon still used the same foam as the 
70s Transporters. Learning something today - thanks John.

Wonder if VW switched b/c they realized that rubber was better than a 
foam that may or may not be more prone to catching fire.

ANYTHING that reduces the fire risk of these old vans is a good thing.

I'm going rubber unless something better lands in my inbox. Maybe rubber 
with a layer of mylar on the outside to reflect some heat back outside?
