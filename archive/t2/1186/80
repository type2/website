Subject: Free air conditioner

I have a DPD under dash air conditioner to give away. It is 
complete. It was
removed from a '77 bus in Seattle.  Compressor and the 
two condensers under
the bus do not work, but the other components seem 
to be ok.  New compressors
are available, and the condenser motors may be repairable by Philbin in
Portland.  I live near Yakima, WA and you would have to pick it up.  I would
need at least a week's notice.
