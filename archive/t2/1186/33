Subject: tire pressure guage

Hi Folks,
             I'm looking for a new tire pressure gauge.  Currently have a Snap
On round-dial, mechanical model (bought in mid 80's) which works great.  Just
need another.  Any recommendations from the list.  I prefer a non-electronic
tool for this application as it will be left for months at a time between
uses, but am open to all suggestions.  Thanks. jon
