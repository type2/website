glad you added that winky! lol.. Bob already confirmed he would have smelled 
a gas leak if there was one... well,, on the floor anyway.. 

AFR info is out of the realm of "wild ass guessing".. so that information is 
not allowed.  ;) 

let me guess it is a fuel leak into the oil, the oil is thin and burning so, 
the oil level isn't increasing,, and the ogr [oil gas ratio] is low enough 
the plugs don't show ... hmm,, ok,, Back to you
