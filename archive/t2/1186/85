I guess the question is, where would oil leak into the gas, since it is FI 
there is a seperate fuel pump.  so other than past the rings, which are 
fairly new but before the problem, where else would gas get into the oil.

then considering I'm using Mobil 1 15W50 synthetic how would I know since 
that stuff is like water anyway.  but there is no gas smell on the 
dipstick, have checked to see if there was burnt smell, no, or it looked 
funny, it didn't,

so where would gas be able to get into the oil??  as I said other than 
rings at that is usually the other way round, oil being burned?!?!
