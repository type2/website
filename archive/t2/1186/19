Subject: Ignition switch failure

1970 Westfalia, all stock

Well, the 42 year old ignition switch has finally failed to the nth degree
failure.

I understand replacing same is a bit of a struggle, but it's finally gotta be
done.

So, any suggestions on sourcing, and then keying it to fit my current key?

This failure did make me do one thing, (always put off) ...
I wired a remote start switch in the engine cavity, which is very necessary
now, but later, will serve as a remote start for future engine work.
