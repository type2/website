No, it doesn't - I was just using "meter" as a general term for the 
whole system.  Do you have the gauge hooked up?  It should be pretty 
straight-forward.

You should still be getting some numbers out of the unit - or have you 
not hooked it up yet?  Air leaks are going to make it look lean - I'm 
curious how rich you're running, and if you're getting rich numbers with 
air leaks, then we know you've got a major fueling problem.
