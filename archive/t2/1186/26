Subject: 79 Bus with 81 engine - Hot Start issue 

Hey Gang,
B 
Ibm working on a 79 bus with a Vanagon air cooled engine.B  
B 
The timing is set right (8.5 btdc) and the engine starts and revs right up
when cold.B  It does rev a bit high but not too worried about that right
now.B  It has great pickup andB power going down the road.B  Engine is smooth,
no misses and as much torque as I can get out of her.
B 
Here is the issue,
when I park it back in my driveway and try to start it again once the engine
is hot, it just will not kick over.B  Let it sit for a while and it starts
again.B  Fuel injection should be flawless and kick over everytime.B  What to
test or replace?B  All the manuals and emailsB talk about cold starting
issues.B 
B 
I have read some of the archives and Ibm having errors trying
to reach the Type2 archive list, but I am reading information on the TEMP 2
sender.B  
B 
Does the Temp 2 sender affect the starting issues when the
engine is hot?
B 
I will also double check the fuel pressure with my gage to
get the readings for acceptable pressures.
B 
Any hints as to where I should
try to diagnose this?
B Thanks, 
JoelB
