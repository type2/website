Okay, I'm really grasping at straws here but have you bounced around on 
your favorite search engine and looked for descriptions and symptoms of 
a slipping auto transmission?

Torque converter or clutches?

Does your rpms match up reasonably well to specific speeds i.e. does 
your 50 mph rpm match someone else's 50 mph rpms with an auto box? 
Wonder if your van accelerates at the similar throttle positions i.e. 
torque converter hooking up correctly, 3rd gear clutch pack not slipping.

I really hate grasping at expensive problems b/c there might somehow be 
a simple and inexpensive explanation.
