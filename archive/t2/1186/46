Thanks for the info!!!!


Ah, and I had just ordered some M6 bolts to try. 
'Doh!

Someone also mentioned that there is a square washer that goes with
this bolt.  I don't have one which may explain why mine bolt kept coming
loose.
Do you happen to know the part number or dimensions for this?
Otherwise I suppose Loctite, locking washer, or plumbers tape will have to do.
I also searched on the part number you gave me, and it is listed in the usual
VW suppliers over here, but there are none in stock!
I'll be using my local
fastener supplier again.
