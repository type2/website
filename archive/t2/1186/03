Me too... Sounds like something I want to upgrade to something more 21st 
century and fire resistant. Wondering if the after market replacements 
are made of the same stuff (or better or worse) than the OEM stuff from 
the 60s and 70s.

Corvairs use a rubber gater around the engine that is held down with 
steel strips screwed to the body and engine. I've seen them DIY'd out of 
inner tube rubber. Would be very easy to adapt to the VW engine and body 
with nothing more than screw or poprivet holes.

Any other ideas? What does Porsche or Tatra use?
