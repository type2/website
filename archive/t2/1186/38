I like the ones truckers use.. they measure to 150psi usually,, I run 48 psi 
in my Yokohama tires... and the 35psi guages don't cut it.

has anyone investigated a Tire Pressure Monitor System ,, where the valve 
stems would be changed out, and some user friendly receiver would go near 
the dash.. driver ....

My daughter had valve stem caps for the correct tire pressure,, but she said 
they caused the tires to loose air! she wasn't happy with them and took them 
off... maybe just a cheap model..  Has any had luck with the valve stem cap 
style?
