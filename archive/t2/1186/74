is running solid on all 4 cyl,  valves are all working within spec (hyd 
lifters)

engine is a Boston Bob rebuild, one of his last, but ran fine for about a 
year before this problem started, and it wasn't sudden it has been slowly 
getting worse, I have "dutchmaned" it by readjusting the AFM but it is 
way off stock now but fuel mileage is helped by doing that, but I'm pretty 
much out of adjustment range on the AFM now, AFM is set way "lean" but 
still running rich.  yes I'm turning things the right way, everytime I 
adjust the AFM the mileage goes up for a while but then drops back.

I have a known working spare AFM and with that on the MPG is terrible.

so the AFM is not likely the problem.
