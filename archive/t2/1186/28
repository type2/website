Subject: RE: Ignition Switch Failure

Bob, the return spring is in the electrical part of the ignition assembly.  No
need to replace the lock itself or do any rekeying.  The switch is a slight
pain to replace, but not terribly difficult once you get everything apart.
Most of the usual VW parts suppliers should have the switch assembly.  BTW,
thanks for the compliment!
