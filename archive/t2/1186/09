Subject: RE: [T2] ignition temperature of foam gasket

This is what I was trying to get to the bottom of.  Did I do anything wrong
that can be prevented in the future.  As Martin suggested I will be
installing the heat shield that is above the exhaust.  I am assuming that
what we are talking about here is not the rock shield that bolts onto the
bumper but something that sits above the muffler and below the foam gasket.
Thanks for the replies.

<I think the rubber is just more durable than foam. No reason for the foam
to get hot. OP must have done something wrong to get a fire.
