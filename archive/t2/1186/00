Subject: ignition temperature of foam gasket

A few weeks ago I was running my 1973 Westie 2.0l, dual carb through the
mountains of Vermont and New Hampshire, taking it pretty easy.  She started
running a little rough so I stopped to fuel up and to check things out.
After fueling up and driving away from the pumps to park, my wife who was
outside the bus noticed something small and smoldering drop out from under
the back of the bus.  When I opened the engine compartment the rear of the
foam gasket that seals the engine compartment (engine tin to body)was on
fire.  Thanks to the advice of this list I carry three fire extinguishers
and put the fire out with just a few squirts. The rough running was due to a
vacuum leak.  That morning, before the fire, while putting oil in the engine
I spilt some and it got on the foam gasket (yes, careless I know) very close
to where it was on fire.

 

My question:  Will/can oil lower the ignition temperature of the foam where
it sits just above the exhaust? 

                             Or was the foam gasket too close to the
exhaust?

 

Thanks,

Tom
