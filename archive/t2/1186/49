Have you checked your fuel pressures? Higher pressures would spray more 
fuel through the injectors. Might indicate a bum fuel pressure 
regulator, might be the lack of vacuum at the fuel pressure regulator 
hose or the hose attached to the wrong place up on the intake side of 
things. Can't remember if the pressure regulator lowers fuel pressure 
during times of high vacuum which would seem logical since you would 
want lower pressures, less gas when you are coasting down a hill or to a 
stop.
