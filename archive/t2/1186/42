Okay, I lied... One more. (maybe)

Mercedes W126 (a big Mercs)

Unladen Weight:         4001 lbs OR 1815 kg
Gross Weight Limit:    5015 lbs OR 2275 kg

Notice how close that is to the max VW van weights of:

Unladen Weight:        ~3300 lbs
Gross Weight Limit:   ~5000 lbs

Again, this one of the potential donor vehicles that a VW Transporter 
could use.

Easiest fix? GoWesties' 15" steelies that uses the VW Bus center and 15" 
rim at ~$100 a pop.

But it's isn't the only option. However if going with Mercedes wheels 
consider the cost of changing lugnuts and the work of changing the 
lugnut seats to the Mercedes style.

For myself I still like the idea of the 15" steelies but I also really 
like the alloy wheels too that used wheels from a Merc offers on the 
used markets.
