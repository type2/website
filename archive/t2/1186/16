Hi, the Conti Super Contact TS 740s (-at-) 205/65/15  93T..are showing 'age' while
my van goes from Garage Queen to .."reality'..and I would like to find a tire,
similar to the one listed, that fits the AUDI rims I run.  I do not wish to
start a 'tire war'..just point me in a direction that I can find this
info..please.
Cheers
Scoggy
