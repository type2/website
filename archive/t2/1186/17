When you go non-stock like that, it gets very difficult to find the right
stiff truck type sideways you need. It is nothing like simple keeping up
with what is available for the stock size wheels. 14 inch wheels ain't
sexy, but they work fine with the spec tires.

Just stick to searching for 15" truck tires that will fit, C or D load
range. Don't waste time looking at Audi car tires or any car tires for
that matter.

TireRack is one tire seller on line that has a search engine. Plug in your
size, see what fits in commercial tires for trucks and vans. Could be lots
more choices in 15" than for the stock sizes, I would expect.
