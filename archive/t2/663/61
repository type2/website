Subject: Simple Question (push rods)second time around

What problem would there be from using solid lifters
and push-rods on a hydraulic cam. I built the engine
thinking I had a set of hydraulic push-rods and
didn't, so can I just drop in the solid lifters and
use their push-rods without any severe problems. Phil
