Subject: Lil' table that mounts on dash

So ... I just got one of those little tables that mounts on the dash between
the seats of my 78.  It's in excellent shape and came complete with leg and
brackets and screws (thanks Bill M.)  Anyway - anyone know of any pics posted
anywhere that will show me where these brackets go.

This table is exactly what I needed for setting my laptop on when driving.
Now if only I could find something similar for the Cabriolet and the 60.

jdd.
