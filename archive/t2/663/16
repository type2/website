Subject: FW: [T2] Heater lever

List,

Would it be illegal to make a mold of the levers and then make them from
something metal or possibly something out of injected polymer or something
like that?  would that be breaking the law in the U.S. because it was copied
after an original design?  Would VWoA draw and quarter a bus driver because
they made their own heater levers that age better than the originals did?  I
have enough for me now,.. but who knows how long those will last and I find
myself in that boat again....  last time I went looking for these I was
either able to find the blue air lever and not the heat levers,... or I
could get the heat levers and not the air lever....  I know that somebody
repro's these because Rocky Mountain used to sell them when they were still
alive and kickin'.

  What do you all think of how wonderfully built your heater levers are?

  Here is a sure to be funny question,....  how many heater levers have you
as a bus driver already broken from normal use..  I think that mortality
rate for me alone is something like 5 heat levers and 2 air levers in the
last 29 years.
