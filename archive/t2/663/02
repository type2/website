It was not me.  If I had to choose between only metric or only inch
wrenches, I would STRONGLY recommend the metric wrenches.  By some chance
of calculation, most metric wrenches are a couple hairs larger than most
inch wrenches and the metric wrenches will "work".  The quotes are there,
however, to indicate that in critical situations using metric wrenches
with over-torqued, rusty inch-sized fasteners will produce pefectly round
nuts/bolt heads.  Below are some common inch to metric length conversions:

1/8" =  3.2mm
3/16 =  4.8
1/4  =  6.35
5/16 =  7.9
3/8  =  9.5
7/16 = 11.1
1/2  = 12.7
9/16 = 14.3
5/8  = 15.9
11/16= 17.5
3/4  = 19.05

If you *have* to use inch-sized wrenches, use the cheapest ones you can
buy.  There are two reasons to do this:  first, they will have the
greatest tolerance and, second, there is a fair chance they will be softer
than the nut and will strip first.

A typical trip to the machinist with a stripped nut/bolt will cost you
about $50.  If you wait for a sale a decent set of Sears Craftsman sockets
and wrenches in both metric and inch will cost you $100.  If nothing else
think of the proper wrenches as being worth two trips to the machinist.

OOK!
