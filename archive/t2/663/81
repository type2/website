Subject: Friday: Bus sighting at Disneyland show

My company paid for us all to go to Disneyland last Sunday. Since it
was just my wife and I, kids at the in-laws, we decided to see the
show "Golden Dreams" starring Whoopie Goldberg
(http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/parks/attractions/detail?name=GoldenDreamsAttractionPage)

There's a segment where they blast to the 60's with flower children
all over a park. And in the middle of all this is a late bay bus
painted up hippy style.

Ok, they screwed up with the year of the bus, but you only get a
glimpse of it, so nobody will really notice.

Fairly decent show after all. But the song at the end is WAY too long. ;-)
