Subject: reward for stolen seats

Hey volks,
People in the Boulder, Denver area may know of my yard space in Boulder 
(very visible from the road). Anyway I went out to the yard today and 
noticed that the front seats out of my '74 had been stolen. These are great 
original black basket weave seats with head rest. They will fit I believe 
all years up to '76.
If anyone sees or knows anything about these seats drop me a dime and I will 
make it worth your while.
Any info at all gets you 5% off any order of in stock parts
Any believable info gets you 10% off any order of in stock parts
Any serious leads that result in me almost getting arrested for harassment 
gets you 20% off any order of in stock parts
Any info that leads to the recover of my seats and ultimately public 
humiliation of the idiot who stole them gets you $100 worth of free in stock 
parts
If you bought the seats and you didn't know they where hot, you can keep 
them and get the $100 reward I just want to humiliate these people.
