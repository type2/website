As was mentioned, you can adjust the output via the linkage, some are
threaded and some have a pin. If you have the pinned one you may need to
 play around shims (washers) to adjust the output. This varies the stroke of
 the accelerator pump.
 A few things to note, I have found many blocked outlets and seen many of 
the
 brass tubes into the throat damaged which limits output, so check that 
also.
 The brass tubes also often fall out or leak where they press into the body
 of the carb, so make sure they're firm and not leaking.
 Next later carbs (~75 or so) had a bypass which opens ~14degC (from memory)
 which reduces the output of the accel. pump. It looks like a brass bulb
 poking out next to the float bowl drain plug.

 As for float level???? The normal shim is ~1mm so removing it completely
 should raise the level, if not you can bend the brass tag the float hangs
 from to further increase the level. Not sure why you say you can't??
 Anyway, a few other points, I've never found one with a low float level
 (unless there's other problems), so look a little further. Are you 
supplying
 ~4psi fuel pressure to set level? (or raise a fuel line up high and fill it
 like that). Are there no blockages in delivery, sticky needle/seat etc?
 I have also found the top carby gaskets vary in thickness which affects the
 level also. Lastly I suppose you are measuring correctly? From top of alum
 (not gasket) to fuel level with float still in and carb level?

 Hope that helps some.
 Regards,
 Richard
