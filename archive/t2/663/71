Subject: Muffler Questions

Arrgh it never ends. I guess that's what I get for having a lucky streak
with only maintenance being needed for about 6 mo.s  Anywho, I need a
new muffler. I'd love to get a fancy ceramic coated header and muffler,
but that's not in the cards now. My CDI and new alternator sorta ate the
budget for a while. What options do I have for going cheap? Can I go to
my FLAPS and get something??
 
Advice needed please. If I don't get it done Saturday, I'll be sleeping
in it. Oh yeah, its a 1776 with an aftermarket exhaust.
 
TIA
