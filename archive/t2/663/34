There are two separate issues here. One is that anyone can fabricate
anything they want to repair their own bus. The second is whether you
are going to sell those parts. Yet an entire aftermarket parts
industry thrives on making reproductions of OEM parts. How is that
arranged?

 I doubt it. Besides, they fired Continental (the legal firm) that caused all
 of this trouble in the first place.
