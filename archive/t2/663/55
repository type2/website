Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 Bruck Oil Cooler

  BRUCK, Germany is actualy made in China (at least most of the Bruck parts I have seen and sell), so far I have 
recieved oil coolers, starters and soon generators and 009 copies (I have been told). As far as quality,as good or 
better then Mexico or Brazil. Just like the Pierberg 34 pict 3 carbs. These are also made in China by Pierberg, 
Germany. So far I have had excellent results from these and you can beat the peice. They also have the correct 
accelerator pump linkage to clear the alternator. The only downside I have found is the jets are not marked as to what 
size they are but all standerd Solex jets fit and work.

the Type 4 engine.

>The cooler looks like it's been in storage a long time because the ports for the oil cooler seals are crusty. There are 
no markings on it and the holes for mounting on the studs were a tight fit. The cooler is also slightly different at the 
end where the securing bracket mounts. The bracket won't fit without a little trimming of the cooler (won't affect it's 
cooling ability or structure IMHO) but I have to wonder what non-German bus or ever other Audi/VW model this unti 
was really intended for. For some reason it has the same kind of foam seal the beetle coolers come with.

well it holds oil after I mount it to this 72 engine.
