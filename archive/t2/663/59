no NO no, do not use a generic fuel pump, the ones on the heaters is a
pulse pump.  not sure how similar the BA-4 is to the BN2 but the blower
fan had a reducing gear set and points and  every time the points closed
the pump sent a small measured charge of gasoline into the chamber, as far
as I know all ebersprachers used in VW's had this system.

if you put + and - to the two terminals do you hear a click.  do this off
and on to see if the pump works, then find the power source for it.

I am pretty sure the archives has a wiring diagram for this heater
