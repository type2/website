It seems ok to me. These carbs have 50k miles on them.

I've blown through all orifices with air. I can't see inside or have any idea how much cleaner should come out with the air.

The new float valve is the same height as the old one except it doesn't have a ball bearing at the end. I tested both valves and they give the same float level.

It's marked 7g, weighs the same and does not leak.

Wait a second. If the float can't rise then it will displace more water but when I take off the top half to look at it the float will move and the level will change...I should compare the gaskets.

Still only working on the left carb, using the right one as an assembled reference...

I'll post the rest of the photos tonight. Thanks for all the help so far.
