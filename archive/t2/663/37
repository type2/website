I've owned both, and in all honesty, I'll never buy another standard if I
can help it. The auto had all kinds of power and I can't really think of why
I'd want to shift and replace clutches etc. :-) Of course, mine was a 79 so
had the 2L engine.

as others have mentioned it is a big job, and really not worth the hassle,

HOWEVER if you do decide to do it, I will buy the shift linkage in it's

entirety from you, maybe other parts too. just contact me before removing

the auto shifter parts they are easy to mess up, I'll give you some tips,

 

but personally keep the auto tranny bus, or is the auto tranny what's

messed up?
