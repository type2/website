That sounds like a great idea, I'll try the feeler gauge method.
A few weeks back I bolted the muffler and heat exchanger together
(without the gaskets) and filled down the high spots but i remember
being able to see through, as in the feeler gauge would fit the flange
gap in many places. It wasn't a large gap though, although i know
its more of a concern now.

As for your question about torquing the nuts to spec. I've got this
wimpy 4 inch wrench so I can't get much leverage. Now I only use that
on the top nuts as any other wrench is to long and wont fit without
smacking the tinware. On the two lower nuts I can fit a normal sized
wrench on and get proper leverage. I'd of used my torque wrench but
it won't fit into the opening behind the nuts.
