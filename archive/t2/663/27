Subject: Mid-Atlantic VW in Disputanta VA (near Petersburg)

Does anybody have the phone number the place that used to be Mid-Atlantic
VW in Disputanta?  I believe the proprietor's name is Wayne.  I will be
driving by there this holiday season and I would like to stop by and look
at some interior parts for my 73 Westy.  As of a month or so ago it looks
like they still had plenty of parts busses there.

Thanks,

Mark
