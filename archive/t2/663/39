The arm attaches to a rod which has three settings but the test procedure doesn't say to take that into account. It just says to pump quickly.

The tab is almost flat with no bend at all. I bend the tab and only got the level "up" to 16mm. The float is the stock 7g unit (confirmed on a scale) and for the fluid level to come up another 3mm the float would hit the top of the float chamber.

There doesn't seem to be enough room to make any more adjustments. One idea I had was to add some spacers under the shaft that holds the float in place but to raise it up at the hinge but the spring retainer on top would get crushed by the upper body.

I wish I had an 8.5g float to experiment with but I understand the PICT floats are rectangular. The other option is the weigh down the float some more. Any idea how much more weight and what to tie to the float (it's plastic)?

The other 68-71 carbs have a much lower float level. Of course they are totally different but as long as the main jet at the bottom is covered as well as the pickup for the accelerator pump what does it matter what the exact level is?

Does anyone know of a fuel proof glue that can be used to secure the float to it's metal tab? This one is loose compunding problems further.
