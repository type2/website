Leaks are a big issue. Cylinder head seal is a big one. Water pump
seal. On vanagon a failed water pump bearing will allow the impeller
to score the block, making the block useless due to coolant
turbulance. Many odd shaped rubber hoses NLA according to bus boys.
Look at the long plastic hose carrying coolant from engine to front of
vehicle. Mine was cracking apart (stress fractures) where the rubber
hoses attached with hose clamps.

Everything else just standard used car procedures.
