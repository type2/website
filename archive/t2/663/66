Subject: Solex 34mm Dual Carbs instructions wanted

I just purchased some Solex 34mm Dual Carbs from CBPerformance and they 
provided a poor couple of paragraphs designed for a carb expert.  Is there
an official instruction booklet or something similar that comes with this
product.  If so, could it be found on the internet?
Cheers,
joe
