I'd check everything else but it you can't get it solved, put the pin that holds in place and look for corrosion or pitting. 

The old Italian carb man that you showed me how to rebuild a carb in Naples when I lived there always pulled the check ball out. I didn't speak enough of the language to ask why and get a verbal answer I could understand but he indicated it was due to corrosion to the aluminum seat or partial blockages. Nothing like a game of charades to explain carb rebuilds... <grin!>
