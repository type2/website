It is CONCEPT CAR, not a production vehicle. Industrial designers are the
responsible for most car styling that gets done nowadays, not engineers.
Yes, the engineering disciplines of a vehicle manufacturer play a huge role
in the design team, but not so much at the concept stage, and this concept
car was a submission by a design studio for a competition. You can't judge
it as if it was a product. That is why it is called a concept. I am an
industrial designer, so that comment really hits a nerve. The people who
create the design concepts for vehicles are usually more "artist" than
anything else. Then the design team really takes over, made up of all the
disciplines of the manufacturing process, from marketing through to
production. 

I think it is a beautiful presentation, some very well thought out ideas,
and very true to the original concept of the westfalia model, right back to
the very first ones made. I give it two thumbs way up.
