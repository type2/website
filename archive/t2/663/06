He is right by fellow list member, and one of the best VW mechanics in the 
area, Mark Dearing of Salem Imports.

Phone number is 540 389-8587
Adress for a tow truck is 1113 Florida St
Salem, VA 24153

Many of us in the SouthEast will drive hundreds of miles to let Mark work on 
our buses.

Good luck,
