Dave Bolen bought a few sets from me a while back.  Any word on how they've
worked out, Dave?

The set includes two red and one blue.  I used two "rebuilt" broken heater
levers (from my own bus) to make the originals (a red one and a blue one).

The sets sell for $12.00 plus $5.00 USPS shipping.  If you order several
sets, I think the mailing limit is four, it's still only $5.00 shipping.  If
you order from an international location, the shipping is going to be
whatever it actually costs.

The levers are cast in polyurethane resin.  If your linkages are working
properly (not binding or hanging up), the new ones should work well.  At
least the prototype castings have in my own bus.
