I don't think I'm getting across to people. The maximum stroke is less than spec. There is no more adjustment.

OK.

I checked that.

I've seen that in Bentley. It's not a feature of the 72 PDSIT carbs.

The stock shim was 0.5mm. Removing raises the level only slightly and doesn't allow the float valve to seal properly.

Because the float hit the celing of the float chamber. It's as if the Bentley 12-14mm spec is incorrect.

I'm not using the pump. Bentley says you can fill it without.

Not that I've found.

Yes.

My first measurement was almost 19mm without the gaskets in between the body halves. Then I realized the mistake and measure it again at 17mm which was still too much.
