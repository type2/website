On carbs in general, not sure on your solex, the pump linkage is
threaded so that you can increase or decrease stroke volume by
changing the length of the link arm.

It's not possible to un-shim the float valve to raise the level. Because of the design of the float chamber, bending the float support doesn't seem possible either. Stumped...

So you are saying you can't use the normal method of bending the float
tab where it contacts the needle? I'm assuming this is what you mean
by you cannot bend the float support.
