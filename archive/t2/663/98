Subject: Yoko 356 tire comments

In relation to the tire thread currently going on, I actually drove my bus 
last weekend to get a Christmas tree.

First time in the rain, so I tested my brakes and Yokohoma 356's for 
braking and handling in the rain.

No hydroplaning to speak of.  This was tested at about 50mph with deep 
ruts in the road holding probably 3" of water or so.

And a couple of "panic" stops from 50 mph resulted in *no* sliding or loss 
of control of the bus.

It just squatted down on the front end and **stopped**!  My wife was 
impressed as I would have thrown her out of the seat except for her 
seatbelt.

I don't expect to ever test on ice or snow, so can't comment there.

Cheers, dave
