Subject: Aircooled to Watercooled What to look for?

As the previous post, I am lookign at an 85 Vanagon GL. I would like to know 
from any of you out there that do that watercooled dance, what to look for. 
Leaks, problem areas etc. Allso do any of you have any good Vanagon Sites 
you could send links to? I really need some more transportaion and this one 
is great from what i can tell. Although I don't really know anything about 
Vanagons. I will have to start with a new Bentley for sure. Any help greatly 
appreciated.

Aircooled Type II content: This past weekend I semi-organized the garage and 
drove el Verde around the block again. Soon it will be time to chase that 
vacuum leak down once and for all. Then another new windshield, shocks, 
brakes, and a few misc. other things to really get her on the road.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
