Subject: RE: FW: [T2] Heater lever and Hi!

I thought someone on the list was already reproducing these or going to. 
Where are you? We need levers.

Hello volks I have been away for a while. I have been getting settled here 
in Austin, TX. Tonight I am going VW shopping. I am looking at an '85 
Vanagon GL. I know this is a Water Pumper and el Verde will be upset that I 
have put her off once again. Maybe if I could find her some new heater 
levers I could pacify her for a while.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
'77 Westy Deluxe, "el Verde"
