Richard,

I set my kadrons up at one point using the "secret patented" gene berg 
instructions and it seems that the amount delivered from one Kadron was 
supposed to be about .7cc(IIRC).

I can't imagine a 34 2-3 needing more.  If you have it on the stroke that 
delivers the most, then that is about it.

The only other possibility is that indeed, the check ball is leaking and 
you have to open it up and resurface where the ball seals.

I have repaired  the surfaces on some other carbs just by using a close
drill size and hand turning it lightly...just enough to clean up the 
surface.

Cheers, dave

There's no position I can choose to get it into spec.
