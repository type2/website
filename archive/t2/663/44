Of course I won't be actually 'driving' with the table in place - but pulled 
over on the side of the road.

So ... I just got one of those little tables that mounts on the dash between 
the seats of my 78.  It's in excellent shape and came complete with leg and 
brackets and screws (thanks Bill M.)  Anyway - anyone know of any pics 
posted anywhere that will show me where these brackets go.

This table is exactly what I needed for setting my laptop on when driving. 
Now if only I could find something similar for the Cabriolet and the 60.

jdd.
