Subject: Re: [VB] What is your diagnosis?

Yes I meant TO bearing , pressure plate, in addition to the clutch. I
think the TO has been making a noise for a while and figured that was
the culprit. Wrong. Oh well.

Thanks for everyones input!

Hey Mark, Have a best manufacturer recommendation for the clutch kit?
I am going to flaps tomorrow and need to know good and bad!
