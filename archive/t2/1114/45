Subject: ADMIN: Rancho Transaxle Spam (was Re: [T2] Eastwood products)

I just got this spam from Rancho Transaxles.  It appears that they 
harvested my address from the type2 list without even bothering to 
change the subject line.  I imagine I'm not the only one.

I called over there just now, gave them my name and politely asked for 
the name of the person I was speaking to.  I got a very rude "no" in 
return.  I suppose they are too ashamed of their behavior (or their 
products?) to give their names.  Needless to say, they will not get a 
dime of my business and I would encourage listmembers to likewise use a 
*reputable* transaxle rebuilder such as AA Transaxle instead of the 
spammers at Rancho.  The offending address will be removed from the list 
shortly.
