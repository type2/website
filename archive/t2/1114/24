Subject: exhaust manifold

I'm trying to install the exhaust manifolds on the Raby Camper Special.
The passenger side fits just fine, but the driver's side pipes do not line
up with the studs and looks like the pipe is hitting the side of hole the
pipe slides into. I was told to grind the pipe to fit, but it looks like I
can't grind enough before I go through the side of the pipe. Another
suggestion is that I grind the head to fit the pipes. I'm not too sure about
that because they are new head and the exhaust manifolds are OEM. Someone
else suggested that I re-drill the holds on the ears. Again, I'm not too
sure about this. I posted this problem on the forum section of the
Aircooledtechnoliogies website.

Any advice?

Bob
