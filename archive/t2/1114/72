Subject: driver door glass

So, I am finding out that you cannot get this glass anymore.I figured since
I was able to get the windshield glass for my '71 T3 a few years ago, the
glass on the door should be just as available.

 

As has been suggested, I'm looking for used glass, I see a few options, but
I'm not sure about compatibility. I am replacing the window on the driver's
side(left). The glass that goes up and down, not the vent/wing window. This
is for my '69 singlecab. What years/makes are compatible?

 

Thanks for the help.
