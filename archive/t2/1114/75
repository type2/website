Subject: Re: [T2] Sourcing a new windshield

I never had problems with good ole Safelite, were $99 up to a few years ago,
up to at least $160 now.  Have a seal from BD ready for em.  As I'd posted a
couple weeks back, was a guy in FL on *bay with NOS German listing em for even
less than that (perhaps $99 I don't recall) the rub being he wasn't interested
in shipping, I don't recall specifics, searching from 3-4 weeks ago would
likely find my post and the then current auction numbers if you are anywhere
near enough for a drive.

After sustaining a rock hit, my windshield is cracked, and the local repair
guys say it must be replaced.  I have been doing quite a bit of research, and
have been reading many stories of improper fit on the replacement glass that
is currently out in the market.

Can anyone recommend a specific maker and/or part number of glass that is
properly shaped, and not prone to fit (and subsequently, leak) issues?
