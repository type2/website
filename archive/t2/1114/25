The manifold on the other side is OK.

Take a look at the heads, is there any weldment in the way? If not, just
file the holes for the studs in the manifold, and tap it on with a rubber
malet. If that does not work for you, return the head and try another one, I
am assuming the head does the same thing on the other manifold?
