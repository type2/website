Well, the shop I am going to right now, does not use bondo. So I think he
can beat the door back into shape. I'm not sure how he can do it, but we'll
see.

Replace as much as they will let you. Don't let them beat the door back 
into shape and fill it with Bondo. Make them find an undamaged door at 
least as good as the one the other guy damaged. Don't let them close the 
case or sign anything until it is done right.
