Subject: Re: [T2] Front Turn Signal lens (early bay)  question

Say, when I was at home, my neighbor got some of the lens cleaner that 
they sell at Dollar General Store and it did a marvelous job cleaning 
the lenses on his old Dodge Intrepid.  Somebody had recommended it to 
him and I was skeptical.  His lenses were so dirty yellowed that I 
wouldn't have felt safe to drive it at night.  But it really cleaned 
them up.  He did have to take some 600 grit sand paper to one 
particularly nasty section, though.  Ciao...
