Subject: RE: [T2] exhaust manifold

Bob the other obvious question, before one blames the heads (which is
extremely unlikely,) is will the "good" exchanger/manifold fit on both sides
(if the engine is still out with nothing in the way you can probably try it
"backwards."  If it will then the problem is obviously the exchanger/manifold,
which is almost always the case.  I sort of consider one that actually fits
out of the box the rare occasion, not the norm.  And do seek out someone with
a nice long bench belt sander to touch up those flanges if you can.

Take a look at the heads, is there any weldment in the way? If not, just
file the holes for the studs in the manifold, and tap it on with a rubber
malet. If that does not work for you, return the head and try another one, I
am assuming the head does the same thing on the other manifold?
