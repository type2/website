Hi Bob,

I have been using Rust Converter for years; I used it extensively on the 
westfakia 10 years ago and the areas I treated with it have aged quite well.

Unfortunately, there were rust spots blooming that I hadn't treated, and 
those started to erupt a couple years ago. So I will be going back to 
the process soon enough, and I expect to be using rust converter this 
time around as well.


Happy Trails,
