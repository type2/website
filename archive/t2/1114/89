Using the handy-dandy parts fiche, here are the original VW numbers (fits
68-79 Frt Cab Doors):

211 845 201 B  Left Side
211 845 202 B  Right Side

Slight curve makes them left and right specific.  Maybe you could get a
local glass shop to make and temper it.

VW obsoleted availability in the US and Canada in November 1997.  However,
it was continued to be utilized on the Mexican made Type 2s thru the mid
2000s and is still installed on current Type 2s made in Brazil. There's just
been little or no demand for replacements.  No incentive or sense in
stocking something that isn't asked for.  I'm not surprised that PPG or
Pilkington or even Safelight don't list or have it.  Most aftermarket glass
suppliers never did, even for Bugs, much less Type 2s.  Their bread and
butter are American Iron.

Given the thousands of Bay Windows sold and still around in the USA, finding
good used pieces shouldn't be dificult at all.  Recently replaced one on a
friend's 71 with a  very good piece from the vw recycle yard in LA's SF
Valley.  The owner there has them properly stocked on the shelf to prevent
scratching - takes more room, but is better than finding them stacked in
pile or against each other on end at most other yards.  Back in the day (80s
& 90s) I carried some in inventory, only "pick of the litter", no
scratches.  Maybe sold one or two a year.

First place I'd call would be Chris (-at-) Busted Bus in Colorado, then Jan Blair
(-at-) Blair & Sons in Arizona or Derek (-at-) Way Out Salvage in Arkansas

Now Crew Cab area glass and even Truck Rear glass, there's a challenge.  Not
many of those sold in North America.
