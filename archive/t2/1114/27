I, at the suggestion of Bob Donalds years ago, always overdrill the holes a
bit (and its tough, they are hard) then a good high grade washer (I just use
an american Grade 8) then a proper solid copper or bronze nut (I made 20-30 of
my own from 1/2" hex stock years ago.)  Also always a good idea to dress the
surface of the flanges on a long belt sander if you can so they are both even
(they usually aren't anywhere close on a new Dansk or a used OEM heater
box/manifold.)  Clearance stuff as needed, either the head and/or the manifold
flange for a nice fit.  And anneal the O-rings if they ring as hard, they must
be annealed/soft and aren't always new.  I have some old ceramic based sealant
I also bought from Bob 15 years ago I coat the rings with, though I don't
recall the name of it, a British product I think oddly, and it was crazy
pricey ($40 for a tiny tub, but I've used that tub countless times and I
assume it is still good though I haven't looked
 at it since the move.)

suggestion is that I grind the head to fit the pipes. I'm not too sure about
that because they are new head and the exhaust manifolds are OEM. Someone
else suggested that I re-drill the holds on the ears. Again, I'm not too
sure about this. I posted this problem on the forum section of the
