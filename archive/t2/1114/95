A business, sure, but not much future in it - especially return clients. 
Heard the market was kinda dead.  Plus there's the whole thing about it being
unsafe - prolly involved in a fatality or two (dozen)...

Seriously, tho... 
that disclaimer they make you sign is horsedung.  I've driven busses that have
sat for years, they have issues, but as long as you know about them and are
safe... well...  

What concerns me - WHY did the owner remove the window
glass, and what is this about "water damage"...  something kinda funny about
that...  History or not, that's something that you normally don't do.  Esp. on
a bus that has other mechanical issues far more important than the window
rubber.  

Honestly, I'd stay away from it - not because of its alleged
history, but because there's something not really up and up about it - There's
something strange, and it's not the busses history IMO...

That's not a bus, that's a
start-up business.  Or a re-start business.
