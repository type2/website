Subject: New 71 bus how do i know which country it was made in?

I got a new to me  71 bus how do i know which country it was made in?

It's a little beat up, but who's isn't

I thought I would find a plate of some thing that says made in Germany, but it
could have been somewhere else in this world.

thanks

Eric

-71 bus with a single port-

-and some other crap-
