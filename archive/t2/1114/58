Subject: Rear apron sources

Hi all,

My westy got rear-ended before I bought it. surprise) I found a source for
the rear apron, but the rust got into the area behind the apron on the
passenger side (the hump part the surrounds the rear of the engine) and
chewed it up. What is it called and where can I find a source for it.

Thanks for the help.

Bob
