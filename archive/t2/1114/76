It has been said that

> Sandblasting is ideal.

and I would like to question whether blasting back
to bare metal is the bestest option.  I blasted the
floor of my bus.  It did not have holes before I
blasted, but it had a few dozen after.  I'm not
confused that the floor was REALLY rusty and that
what sandblasting was doing was proving it, but
sandblasting metal reminds me of sanding wood
home flooring -- you can only do it so many times
because the very act of sanding / sandblasting
removes substance and, in the case of wood home
flooring, sanding is a last resort rather than a
first option.  I am wondering, in other words,
is chemical stabilization of what metal you have
left in whatever shape it is still in isn't
uniformly better than blowing everything suspect
to kingdom come.

[ Epilog: After blowing holes through the floor
everywhere, I used a lot of epoxy putty to seal
them new holes back up.  This was otherwise a
POR15 job with all their prescribed prep and
all that.  Mostly it worked.  Some of it didn't;
you just can't get at all the places you need
to under the bus equally well. ]
