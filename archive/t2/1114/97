Subject: dead bus side of I-95

yesterday evening I stopped to help a fellow busser on the side of 
I-95South just South of the Susquehanna river. it was I believe a 68 
unfortunately I had my wifes car and few tools. stuck around for about 20 
minutes but he was super flooded.... and he said he was fine and told me 
to just go on.. wonder if anyone has been by there and seen if he is on 
his way again??  hated to leave someone after dark in the rain but he 
swore he was ok...
