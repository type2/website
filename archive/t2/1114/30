Subject: RE: [T2] exhaust manifold

Can you snap a picture of where it interferes Bob?  The question is will the
one that doesn't fit all the way down not fit all the way down on both heads? 
And will the one that does fit all the way down fit all the way down on both
heads.  If so, it is the manifold, if not it is the head, as the heads are of
course totally interchangeable.  Not impossible to be the head, but darn
unlikely compared to being the manifold.

I tried fitting them on opposite sides and backwards and they only fit one
way. The one that won't fit all the way down does fit over the studs. The
rear studs hit the back of the hole in the ears and the front studs hit the
front of the holes in the ears.
