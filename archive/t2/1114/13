Subject: Front Turn Signal lens (early bay)  question

Need to clean mine - does anyone know if the orange lens comes out of the
clear housing? Dirt and grime between the inside orange and lens cover-
ugly. I want to pry it out but something tells me that it snaps in place and
might not be able to get it out "safely" without cracking.

 

Anyone ever remove one? The lens is in great shape but dirty.

 

Thanks
