Hi Bob,

I subscribe to the Eastwood newsletter for the tech tips, but I
haven't bought anything from them. They seem to be a rather pricey
repackager of common products.

It's hard to evaluate their proprietary products since the chemicals /
technology is not disclosed. I rather suspect their rust converter is
the same as the commodity-type products sold through FLAPS.

My experience with that type of rust converter is that the penetration
is inadequate, even with using a wire wheel to remove the surface rust
first. Sometime after doing the work and painting over it with the
Dutch Boy anti-rust formula, rust stains seeped through, and after
pulling up the resultant flakes, it became evident that the rust
converter had converted the upper layer into primer as advertised, but
then that flaked off because the underlying rust prevented a good
adhesion between that converted layer and the metal underneath.

After doing my research, I've decided Rust Bullet is the way to go.
POR-15 is only an encapsulator, not a converter. Rust Bullet is both,
and I have more confidence in it's technologies, though also
proprietary and not disclosed. They are used by the US Navy though,
which may or may not be a confidence builder since sometimes seemingly
anything can be sold to the military (like Slick 50).
