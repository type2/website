Subject: rental aggravation...post accident

Well I got the appraisal from the insurance company and now need to order
some parts.my body guy says he can fix it, he just suggested it might be
better for me to get the parts-as I have better resources for finding this
stuff. So I think I've found most stuff online, but was not sure about the
glass for the driver's side door. I don't need the vent window, just the
main window. Should I be able to get this at any local glass shop, or do you
guys recommend a special place to order glass?

 

The insurance company authorized a rental for me. I told them I needed a
pick-up. It took a few days to find one. Now I have one. It is a Ch*vy
Silver something or other. I now understand why people are so angry in these
vehicles.this thing sux. The bed is half the size of the bed on my
Singlecab. The truck itself is humoungous.I feel like I am going to hit
everything and everyone while driving down the street. It is quite
depressing. I miss driving my single cab, but now that it is raining, it is
sitting in my driveway all wrapped in plastic.
