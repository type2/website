Subject: bad news...accident

Well I guess it was inevitable, as many folks here in Boston asked
incredulously-you actually drive that on a regular basis?

 

I got hit. While driving, not far from my neighborhood, a guy in a huge
chevy van decided to change lanes without using the enormous side view
mirror he had. So, basically he hit my Singlecab  from the side. Most damage
is to front driver' side door. Glass shattered all over me. A bit of a
shock. 

 

Insurance company seemed ok, they called me the same day, and immediately
said-"we know our guy was completely at fault. Get a rental truck if you
want." Appraiser came last week, I should hear his estimate today.

 

I'll probably be searching for door repair parts soon, and bringing it to a
body shop this week, to see what they say.
