Depends on your budget and the condition of things you find in there.

I think pressure plates are changed out too often.

I generally try to make a throw-out bearing last longer too, though
sometimes I have ended up with a little bit noisy one when idling at a
red light as a consequence.

Might look, too, to see how the engine main seal and tranny input
shaft seal are doing while you are in there.

Look at the starter bushing in the bell housing too.
