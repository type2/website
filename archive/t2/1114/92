Subject: Re: [T2] driver door glass

Was writ:

"Using the handy-dandy parts fiche, here are the original VW numbers (fits

68-79 Frt Cab Doors)"

 

Does this mean the glass has to be from another single cab? Or does "Frt
Cab" also refer to regular buses?

 

And by regular buses, I do not intend to demean other buses, or to claim
that my single cab is special, even though it is ;)
