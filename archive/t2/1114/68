I agree,

being firm, but nice can go a long way. Remember the adjuster holds the 
purse strings and you can catch more flies with honey.

Replace as much as they will let you. Don't let them beat the door back
into shape and fill it with Bondo. Make them find an undamaged door at
least as good as the one the other guy damaged. Don't let them close the
case or sign anything until it is done right.

Remember they inconvenienced you, you're not inconveniencing them. Their
insurance customer damaged your vehicle and resale, not the other way
around.

FWIW all of the accidents my vehicles have been in where it was the
other guy's fault turned out fine without any rudeness from me. They did
the right things from the get go and all I had to do was be nice.
