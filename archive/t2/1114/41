David,

Do you think it was the sandblasting that made the difference or the Rust
Encap.?  I have used a product called Rust Mort over bare metal before, to
convert any microscopic rust areas to ... not rust (?) then a zinc primer
then paint.  The rust mort is good after all loose rust is removed via wire
wheel, sand blasting, etc, to get any unseen rust converted.  

I have no long term results yet as all my work has been done in the last few
years.

Good job on the windshield frame!

Mark

<I also want to add that as of today, there is *still* no evidence that 
the rust has returned.  That's over ten years.>
