Excellent suggestion.  These can be found built into a table in some head
rebuilding shops.  Used to flatten large surfaces quickly (-$).  Does not true
to a reference plane, but that isn't the issue in this application.  A carbide
fly cutter in a mill will do the same, or better, but takes more set up and
machine time (+$). jon
