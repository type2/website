Subject: Sourcing a new windshield

After sustaining a rock hit, my windshield is cracked, and the local 
repair guys say it must be replaced.  I have been doing quite a bit of 
research, and have been reading many stories of improper fit on the 
replacement glass that is currently out in the market.

Can anyone recommend a specific maker and/or part number of glass that 
is properly shaped, and not prone to fit (and subsequently, leak) issues?

Thanks!
