BTDT.  Sucks, but at least you got the bus home safe...

All of the clutch peices?  Yes, I agree, you should.  :P

Do you mean replacing the pressure plate, TO, etc? If so, Dolan will 
tell you yes to the PP and I'm leaning towards agreeing with him
these days, esp. if you don't know the last time it was replaced. 

Otherwise, you might check your endplay and adjust as necessary.

Cheers,
