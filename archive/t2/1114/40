Eastwood generally sells good shit, sometimes at a not exceptional price,
usually a fair but not great one, but generally good solid stuff.  I like TP
tools in Canfield OH better in general for things that overlap but that was
because I used to drive over to Canfield.  Regardless I'd trust anything
Eastwood sold, but look for the same thing elsewhere for less.  Never tried
their rust converter, but as I've long said, I'm not a great fan of POR or any
of them.

what about thier "Rust converter"  they are showing a side by side test with
Por 15 which I and I'm sure others here use.
