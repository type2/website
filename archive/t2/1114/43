I've used the Loctite/Duro Extend product long in the past (20+years?) with 
excellent results. Stopped the rust inside my front doors. Just squirted in 
the bottom and brushed it around. Poured in a good dose so it stayed wet for 
quite some time allowing it to convert all the rust. It self seals with an 
acrylic compound. There has been no appearance of any more rust.
