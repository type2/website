Among the few problems that arose while upgrading headlights & steering
coupler was the fact that my rear turn signals were not working correctly.

 

I took apart  a bunch of the wiring in the back, and saw all the splices by
the PO. I need to clean a bunch of those up, but the real problem was the
connector under the dash (labeled T1 on the wiring diagram) had become
disconnected. So I reconnected that, and tail lights work properly now. 

 

Next up, correcting the wiring in the engine compartment done by the PO.
