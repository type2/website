Subject: Re: [T2] Rust Proofing Tangent

Yeah, I thought that was odd too. Treat then patch, not patch then treat. 
However Aluminum is slightly sacrificial to the steel so maybe there was a 
little protection there.

I've lost the thread and can't catch it searching- but in the recent
rustproofing discussion I think recall reading where on listee (Joe Average
maybe?) had used an aluminum-impregnated filler after cleaning loose rust,
then brush applying his rust deterrent/ converter... why use the filler
first? I can imagine using the filler first then applying the deterrent to
possibly prevent oxidation of the aluminum in the filler (as well as rust on
the prepped metal), but I can also see using the rust deterrent first so as
to treat the prepped metal more thoroughly before covering it with
filler...?
