Subject: 70 bus steering question

Hello
the front ball joint of the steering drag link of our bus is broken!
(1970 Bus 1600 ccm engine)
we could still drive but there is so much free play and some noise.
my question is :
could I buy a replacement of the front end of the trail link - just
the ball joint which screws in the drag rode ?
any universal replacement part from other car ?
as far as I know this is the part - the drag link asd a whole :

I know that some mechanics offer recycling of the ball joint -
something thta I wouldnt try at home - am I right ?

Cheers !

Martin from Sofia
