Subject: RE: [T2] rental aggravation...post accident..seat pads?

No, It is not totaled, actually it is not too bad...just a little bit to the
main cab, but the front door has some damage, and broken glass. I'm not sure
if any internals on the door are broken. We'll find out when they take the
door apart.

The front seat got a tear from the shattered glass, so I'm sourcing that as
well. I figure I may as well replace the pads at the same time. Probably
horse hair pads, and trying to determine what seat color I want to put in. I
have black now, and I think that is original. I prefer the salt & pepper
color, which I have in my '65. Just checking out my options right now. The
driver's seat actually has a broken spring as well, maybe I can get that
fixed at the same time.

I have a rental for now, I just need to order the parts.

My local window shop got the front for mine, installed for me supplying the 
seal for $150.

Have fun with the insurance company, and don;t settle or sign anything till 
your satisfied, don;t do anything to it until you all settle the vehicle 
claim, these can take a month or so.  You got a rental till it's fixed.  Did

they say it was totaled?
