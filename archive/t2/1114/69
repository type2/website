The way it was explained to me a million years ago was that the filler 
needs to attach directly to the steel metal to adhere properly.

THIS IS WRONG... Then I checked USC's website for the official 
instructions. Wrong again... LOL! Well sort of.

www.uschem.com/products/docs/TDS_ALL-METAL.pdf

I was taught to put filler over bare metal to minimize adhesion 
problems. The filler is only going to stick as well as the paint under 
it or as well as it sticks to the paint.

The USC (USE brand All-Metal) instructions say the filler can go over 
well-aged paint. Rust converter applied yesterday prob is not aged very 
well. GRIN!

Unless it has changed Bondo is a polyester filler that does not seal 
anything like moisture out which can allow rust to form under the 
filler. You have to top coat it to seal out the moisture. How many 
people topcoat the backside of the repair? It is also the reason that 
folks who use Bondo to patch a hole often find that the patch bubbles 
and falls out some time later (year+ later). Rusting continues inside 
the filler...

The aluminum impregnated filler is an epoxy based filler. It is 
waterproof. If it squeezes through a rust hole it seals the metal on 
both sides. Once it's there it is really hard once cured and has to be 
shaped with a grinder where Bondo is really soft and can be worked 
easily by hand.

What are everybody's thoughts?
