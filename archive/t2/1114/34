I've used the spray can version of their "Rust Encapsulator".  I've only had it on some small spots for a few months, so not long enough to see any real effect of time.  I got the silver kind and it is like a clear spray paint with metallic particles in it.  One word of advice, do not get on their product email lists.  They are heavy into sending marketing stuff.
