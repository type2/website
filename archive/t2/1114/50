Nope.  Hannover, Germany, probably.  Wolfsburg hasn't made
any Type 2s since 1955.  If it looks like a normal '71, it was
probably made in Hannover.  Brazil still made Splitties then,
Mexico and South Africa I don't know about but would guess
they made something other than then-current-model Bays (if
they made any Type 2s at all then).

Airhowlingly yours,
