Replace as much as they will let you. Don't let them beat the door back 
into shape and fill it with Bondo. Make them find an undamaged door at 
least as good as the one the other guy damaged. Don't let them close the 
case or sign anything until it is done right.

Remember they inconvenienced you, you're not inconveniencing them. Their 
insurance customer damaged your vehicle and resale, not the other way 
around.

FWIW all of the accidents my vehicles have been in where it was the 
other guy's fault turned out fine without any rudeness from me. They did 
the right things from the get go and all I had to do was be nice.
