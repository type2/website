Subject: Carburettor leak!

Hi, 

Need help with my carburettor fuel leak. Worked from fuel tank, replaced
fuel pump, fitted all new gaskets to carburettor but it still seems to be
leaking from the external nuts/spindle that holds each of the flaps inside
the carb in place. It is a Solex 30 PICT 2. (I can send a diagram if you
aren't sure where I am talking about!!)

If this isn't repairable, does anyone know where I can get a replacement
that will work with the governor that is fitted etc?

 

Thanks guys

 

Busbaby!
