Subject: Need a part :-)

Well, after getting rid of a whole bunch of stuff (thank you to everyone who
stopped by!), I find that I need a part.  I need the wiring sub-harness from
a 1976-1978 bus that goes on the *left* side of the double relay.  This
harness primary function is to get power to the fuel pump, but also has
wires going to the coil, the starter, the fan above the engine and a ground
wire.  Does anyone hae one of theses that they could spare?  I'll gladly buy
it if you do!

Steve
