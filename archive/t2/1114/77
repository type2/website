It is ideal, sort of.  In the long run, "encapsulated" or not rust will return
from those areas, whatever the miracle product.  Clean metal is clean metal,
there is no substitute.  The proper repair however would be replacement, or
brazing (TIG brazing ideal for those little holes), either followed by etching
primer and proper topcoats will restore originial performance.  Anything else
will fail, be it in 2, 5, 10, or 15 years.
 
Of course so did the OEM finish in 10-15 years so WTH, who knows I guess.

and I would like to question whether blasting back
to bare metal is the bestest option.  I blasted the
floor of my bus.  It did not have holes before I
blasted, but it had a few dozen after.  I'm not
confused that the floor was REALLY rusty and that
what sandblasting was doing was proving it, but
sandblasting metal reminds me of sanding wood
