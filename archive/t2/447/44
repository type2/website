Subject: Need advice on adjusting Rear Torsion Bars

Well the old Bus is dragging its rear a little bit and could use a boost.

 I have a Haynes book on the transporter, but the instructions on adjusting
the reat torsion bars are a wee bit obtuse for me.

Any advice from someone who has actually performed the torsion bar adjustment
would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

 Mark
