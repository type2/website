Subject: Listie Locations,

Hmm, Joe Fortino's post asking about listies in LV kinda got me 
thinking, it might be nice to plot all the listies locations in the 
world. Maybe break it into Countries/States/Provinces and Cities.

Anyone else interested to know who is living in the same town etc ? 
Want to know something about a specific city ? Might be a nice resource.
I cant see it being too much work to tabulate locations/names and 
e-mails ...
