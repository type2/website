I think that VW usually said that cruising speed=top
speed or close to it, in the owner's manuals.
You should be able to cruise all day at 70mph if the
bus was in all-around good shape, with a top end near
80, if I remember okay.  My 75 with a 79 FI engine
does fine at 70+, keeping up with the flow of traffic
on the local interstate hiway. And 70 is fast enough
for me, although she will go faster if I ask.

Jim, in Menomonie, WI, 
(thinking about bodywork and paint for the 75, who
looks kind of shabby sitting next to the 65 double
cab, all shiny and white.)
