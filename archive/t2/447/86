Just bleed the brakes starting at the wheel furthest from the driver. Bleed 
like you have air in the system but don't let air into the system. Bleed 
until the fluid is clean and clear. Repeat at the other wheels.

Really consider new rubber brakes hoses (from the frame to each wheel) 
before this project. Muir's Idiot manual explains it pretty good for the 
newbie. Follow that up with the Bentley manual for further study.
