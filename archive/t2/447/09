Subject: SUMMARY:  Friday survey: Stuff that doesn't break.

Hi Volks,

I had 10 responses to the survey, so it's a long way from a 
representative sample.

Reportedly unbroken bus components:

Original Seat Belt mechanisms
Ashtray
Brake Drums (they might wear out, but don't "break")
Steering column
Door striker plates
12V accessory socket
Upper rear hatch
Rear axle spring plate
Gear Shift knob
Headlight trim rings


Happy trails,
