That's the fluid dispenser for the flame powered anti-carjacking system 
that was pioneered in South Africa and some found their way into North 
American busses in the mid '70s until the legal community got 
involved.  With a push of a button, the system shot a burst of flame out 
from under the car to roast the tootsies of your friendly neighborhood 
carjacker.


Just kidding. ;-)  could it be the windshield wiper fluid reservoir?

The south african anti-carjacking system is real, but none made it into our 
busses (that I'm aware of)
