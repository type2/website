> the bolt pattern is the same for the Mercedes(and Audi!!)

The Audi wheels with the 5 x 112 pattern also come in 12mm or 14mm versions just like Mercedes. I believe the
newer Quattro has 14mm holes. [4000 and 5000 cars are 4 hole]

Here is a UK website that lists bolt patterns......

Not sure that you will find many Seats in the USA.....

I believe the bus wheel offset [ET] is 38. Mercedes S class bodies [140, 215, and 220] use 14mm wheel bolts
but the ET is way too high.
