Subject: RE: [T2] Painter's photos

Richard,

Where/who is your painter? About how much $? Did they do anything to the
undercarriage? I'm planning on tearing Pumpkin II down to a shell and four
wheels, then turning it over to a good shop with some bus experience.

Thanks,
Rick

My painter was kind enough to send me a CD of photos he took documenting
some of the work done to my bus and some of the rust I didn't get to see.
