Subject: Flushing brake systems

Speaking of flushing the brake system, this is on my list of things to do
soon. How does everyone else do this? I read the procedure on Type2.com, but
I wanted to hear from others on the list and see how they have done it and
what problems they ran into. It looks like the easiest would be to get some
type of one way setup so that I can do this alone. Does anyone know where to
get the proper kit for a 73 Westy?

Thanks,
Corbett
