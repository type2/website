how about using flat-faced lug nuts! DUH?  ;-)
We've been going over this all(in theory, and buying
lugs/studs etc...) for the vanagons for a while...not
hooked up any of the wheels as the centers on most need to
be enlarged for the sychro hub to fit...but soon. the
mercedes fit right away if I recall...not remember ing the
offset info right now....some of teh aftermarket bbs style
ones we have have large centers..there's lots of stuff out
there on mercedes and audis to look at..go to pick-n-pull
or similar and have a loook-see
