September 12, 2003 - Jerome Jamboree XIII
Jerome, Arizona
The one and only Jerome Jamboree. Biggest bus show in AZ. Camping, swapping,
car show, and more. Raffle grand prize is a 1966 hardtop deluxe! come on out
for 3 days of fun.

Caravan to Jerome:
It leaves at 9:00 AM on Friday from the same old Home Depot on Thunderbird
Road, just east of I-17.
An additional concern is that the "OFF-Ramps" to Thunderbird Road are
closed,
so people need to exit I-17 one exit early and make their way to the Home
Depot. The "ON-Ramp" is open, so the caravan departure should be fine.

There is also an 'unofficial' caravan leaving from the same Home Depot
on Saturday morning at 7:00 AM.
