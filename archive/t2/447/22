Subject: Is this bad?

The other day I went to pull out my E-brake and instead of it going out about 4 or 5 inches, which is what it normally does, it went out a good foot.  Does that mean it's broken?  It still prevents the bus from moving when pulled out, and nothing seems to be wrong with it, but it made a rather loud bang when I pulled it out that time, so I got a little worried.
