Borrowed coil installed, good spark from it.  Still doesn't start.

I guess at this point, I need to check that the cylinders are actually 
getting fuel, so this is where I get to learn about the Bosch FI, I 
guess.  I went hunting for loose/disconnected wires and came up empty, 
so I guess it's time to go through the FI diagnostic procedures in the 
Bentley manual.

Sigh, and I just had the fuel lines replaced by my mechanic when it was 
there having exhaust work done.

Does anyone have suggestions of "usual suspects" for fuel system 
problems?

Also, I'm having trouble spotting the fuel pump/filter... I thought it 
was underneath the Bus logically in front of the #1 cylinder... could 
be the angle I'm looking up due to the Bus being parked next to a curb. 
  Can someone describe the precise location to give me a better chance 
of finding it (I have a '76)?

Thanks!
