Subject: Microfiche Value?

Volks,

Germansupply.com recently purchased the inventory of a VW repair shop in
Pickering, Ontario. We got some excellent bits, but that is another story.

One thing we didn't get in the purchase was the microfiche, which covers
most VW's from the 60's to the present, also lots of Audi models. We thought
it was part of the purchase, but we were mistaken, and now the owner wants a
fairly large sum for the reader and all the slides.

If anyone knows what this stuff is actually worth, I would appreciate any
input, as we really want to have the fiche, but don't want to overpay.

Please contact me on personal email if you have any comments which may help
us decide.
