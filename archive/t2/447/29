Subject: Engine is ticking : (

Listees,

My bus was still having some trouble holding an idle, so I adjusted the idle 
screw again to make it idle faster. Now it makes a ticking sound. Could the 
valves need to be adjusted or do you really  never have to adjust them b/c 
of the hydro lifters. I hope someone has some ideas on what is causing this 
and what needs to happen.  This is on my 82 Westy with a 2L Type 4.
