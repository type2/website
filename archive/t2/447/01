<< well, i got home depot down to 75$ on 4 big ol' pieces
of corian in a nice teal color to match what i'll be
painting my bus.  i just started playing with it a bit
tonight and was using a masonary blade on the table
saw to cut it which i noticed it loading up a bit so
if anyone knows of a better way to cut the stuff
please pmail me with an answer.  anyway, i'll be doing
all the tables and counters in my bus in corian which
should make for one cool interior.  they told me at
home depot that the stuff sells for 55$ a square foot
usually so i think i did pretty good.  the pieces i
got if the one huge one hadn't been busted in half
would have been over 3500$ new so to say the least, i
won't be getting the stuff put in my house any time
soon.  wish me luck as i try to work this stuff this
weekend.

Glue/clamp/affix a guide rail to the Corian and use a 
router with a carbide straight bit. A dust mask is a real 
good idea as well as a buddy with a shop vac. I have two
inch bits that'll cut through the Corian, but they're 1/2
inch shank for the two HP router. Make a shallow cut
and then repeat, dropping the bit with each pass. 
You can also cut Corian on a table saw, but you need at
least an 80 tooth carbide blade and a steady, constant
feed to prevent the blade from gumming up. By mason-
ry blade, I hope the guy at Home Depot didn't sell you
an abrasive blade...They don't 'cut' they grind...
Either way, there's a spray lube available at woodwork-
ing supply houses for the bits and blades that helps
to keep 'em clean...
