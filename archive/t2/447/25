I suspect one of your cables broke or popped loose from the actuating 
lever (inside the drum).  Put the e-brake on and jack up the rear 
wheels -- might be only one of them is actually holding; if so, there's 
your culprit.  You can also crawl around under there (car on ground!) 
to see if one of the cables is slack.

If you're lucky, maybe one of the cables just came off at the front 
adjustment point, but I doubt it.  Try to isolate the problem to one or 
the other side.  You'll have to pull the drum if the cable is broken or 
has come off the rear attachment.
