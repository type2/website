yes to a point, it goes round and rouund when the engine is turning
to check spark from dist, put on cap and pull a spark plug wire, put a
screw driver in the center so it touches the contact in the center LAY IT
DOWN ON THE engine with about 1/4 - 1/2 inche between the metal shaft and
a grounded part of the engine, DON'T TOUCH IT, crank the engine there
should be a spark between the metal shaft and the ground.
