Subject: Listie Locator

In hopes of compiling a "Listie Location" Database what kind of data 
would be appropriate ?

Name, Location (Country, State/Prov, City), E-mail, Webpage, Vehicles 
(like the sig's) .... anything else ? Thoughts  ?

It wouldn't be any trouble for me to setup and host a form to submit 
and sort all the data into a nice "locator" so if there is a consensus 
on what should be on there I can set it up and post a link. A little 
fill in the blanks sheet rather than sifting through mail. Maybe the 
final product can go on the type2 site ? I dunno, its just a thought.

Steve
