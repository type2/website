Hi guys:



Was out of the office for a couple of weeks.



This is to confirm someone's question about the type of engine in my bus:
It4s  a T4/ 1.7lt double carbureted (I eliminated the 2 carbs and installed a
Bug Pack single manifold kit) .  The guy that sold it to me eliminated the
thermostat.





Regards
