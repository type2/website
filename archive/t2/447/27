none that I know of, but.....have been thinking of swapping
brake drums/discs for ones with the old wide-five pattern
and gete the polished empi-5-lug style. They really look
good on the buses(not as good as on a splittie, but still
better than anything else that exhists...but as noted
below, the bolt pattern is the same for teh Mercedes(and
Audi!! My friend and I ahve been hourding the audi ones and
AI will be finding out shourtly what needs to be machined
out. regarding hogging out the holes for teh acorn nuts?  I
say stay away from that, get the nuts/studs that are
designed for the wheels(mercedes/audi and life will be
easier(AND SAFER!!!)

Paul(hoping to end up with the chrome 14" mercedes on my
'78 westy, b ut may end up with one of the 15 or 16" audi
sets instead...we'll see!)
