Subject: Late Bay Sliding Door - Swap wanted

Anybody [local northern Virginia] need a truly excellent Mixico beige '79 
sliding door??

I need a sage green slider for my '78, and I hate to spend good money to 
paint this Mixico beige door if someone out there has an excellent sage 
green one to swap.

Or, I will take a '72-73 [key in handle] rust free / damage free slider for 
the Mixico beige, suitable for painting.

TIA
