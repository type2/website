Hiya Rob,

Insofar as production goes, VW was (is?) a rabid supporter of the "one size 
fits all" philosophy.  So, all Busses, left hand drive or right hand drive, got 
the tracks on both sides.  In 99% of those Busses only one track was ever 
used.  But there were a few double sliding door models made.  IIRC most of those 
Busses were European models.
