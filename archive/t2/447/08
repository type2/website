Subject: Hole in floor for Sink Drain

Question:
I have a 68 Westy and have removed the sink cabinet and jump seat to replace
the vinyl with laminate.
There is a 2" hole,for the sink drain,in the floor and I need ideas on how to
reduce the size of the hole to bring it closer to the approx. 1" drain tube.I
looks like there could have been a seal that reduced the opening but that's
long gone. Any ideas?
