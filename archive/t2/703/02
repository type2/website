Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Injection

I am still looking into the Megasquirt, but I have a friend that is installing
it on his 2000 Mustang GT motor next month. We are going to install it on
truck first to get the fuel part working, then onto the Mustang. The
megasquirt will be used to control the spark and fuel on the Mustang. This
system seems to be very good and dependable from what we have read on the
forums. We will see when it gets on the Mustang. Just from what I have seen of
the software and the board, I am sold on it.

The ability to hook up the PC to it and control everything in the fuel system
is very nice and something that I would want to have on the bus. Since the
system is fairly cheap, we both plan to have an extra "brain" with us at all
times.

Is their anyone in this mailing list that is running the megasquirt on their
bus right now. I have heard a lot of talk about it here, but I have not heard
anyone actually running it. The website has several busses listed as running
it, just looking for people that actually are.

Thanks,
Corbett
