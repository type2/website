I couldn't find a source for the old style molding either so I used the "T" 
type. I replaced all the cabinet molding with it. It almost hides the gaps 
because it's a little more rounded than the old "T" type. One caution 
however: Make sure you get molding that has the same width stem (the part 
that goes into the groove) as the old molding. I got molding with the stem a 
little thicker and I ended up splitting the cabinet parts that were quite 
narrow. I had to glue and screw the laminate back together to hold the 
molding in. In the end it worked out okay.
