Subject: Looking for advice on sealing gas tank

This is the second bus that I have to seal the gas tank on because of
rust.  At least this time it is with a carburated bus.

Anyways, I am having a shop pull the engine, pull the tank, then I am
comparing that tank with another I pulled from my 78.  The best one I will
take to a shop to get "Boiled" out.  Does anybody have any experience with
this process and what does it entail?

I ordered a kit from caswell plating http://www.caswellplating.com that
appears to be a two part epoxy sealant and the website details the process
for prepping the tank.  They say that it would be ok for a little surface
rust to remain in the tank as the epoxy adheres better to that.

The kit treats two five gallon tanks.  Considering our busses have a 14
gallon tank, would one treatment be enough, or, should I treat it with two
treatments for good measure (I have two cans/treatments).

Also,  how have people kept the selant out of the nipple holes and other
place that it would stop up and prevent fuel flow?

Any Help Would be Most Appreciated!
