Sounds like you're having fun!!! 

I'm going to have to pull the #3-4 head on mine to remove the busted
stud. Problem is that the (-at-)#%^&^#(-at-) Not-So-Easy-Out busted off inside
the busted off stud. And, of course, those things are harder than
diamonds and nearly impossible to drill out. It'll take a machine shop
to do the job. Sigh.

So 3 bolts on the left head hold the exhaust. 

It's been super sturdy all the way here in Colorado from Cali (plus
all the driving around I did there) so I'm not too concerned. Just the
exhaust leak is what sucks. It's small since the other stud on that
port is fine, but I can hear it.

I've been looking at places to live here and found what may be just
the ticket: 3 bdr house with garage and driveway for $995 a month to
rent. That will give me a place to drop the engine. =)

I just wish the bus fit in the garage. <Homer Simpson> Stupid High Top
