Subject: Re: [T2] Fiberglass tops for Westies

Hi Brian,

As far as I know, no-one is making new tops for 68-79 buses. The only 
source available now is from another bus. I would recommend you keep an 
eye on eBay or thesamba.com  for a parts bus nearby, and transfer the 
top from it.

Installing the pop-top from a 68-73 westy or a high-top would be 
easiest on your vehicle. The 74-79 westy roof would be more difficult 
due to the blind install of the luggage rack brackets, and the fact 
that the upper cot would not fit in its usual orientation.

Last summer I helped Adam Narraway replace his 68 westy roof with a 
Sportsmobile pop-top, the swap took 4 people about an hour to complete. 
Installing the tent was done later, and took Adam a couple of hours on 
his own.

Happy trails,
