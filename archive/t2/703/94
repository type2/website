Subject: Re:Cracked bosses, busted exhaust stud, what's next?

Volks,
    Back when we had our 77 I was able to drill out, and replace, 3
broken exhaust studs in place.  Step one was to center punch each of
the broken studs as close to the center as possible.  The I drilled up
the middle of each stud with successively larger drill bits.  If
memory serves me correctly I started with a # 40 bit in a dremel tool
and went up about 5 sizes on each pass.  Once the bits were too large
for the dremel I used an electric drill.  Once I got to the point
where the walls of the remaining stud where very thin I used a scribe
and pulled them out of the hole.  It's not a physically demanding
job, but it does take a lot of patience.
