Subject: Re: [T2] Well, maybe

I cleaned the threads, squirted some loctite on it, and torqued it to 
22 ft/lbs (264 in/pounds -- I love my Craftsman click-wrench).

I'm not all that confident; not a lot of good solid thread (bolt 
wobbles around until the last couple of turns). But maybe it will hold. 
And if it doesn't, all I have to do is drop the engine, take off the 
fan and shroud, and tap in an M10. I could do that now, but I've done 
enough damage.

Beats starting over.
