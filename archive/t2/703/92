Aaron,
    The problem with your bus sounds to me like you have a vacuum
leak.  Check all of the hoses and fittings to make sure they are
seated properly and don't have any rips or splits, or other defects
We used to have a 77 and that's how it would act when a vacumm hose or
fitting wasn't on tight.
