Don't run it for too long. The break in procedure is necessary to make sure enough oil gets to the cam.

- adjust the valves. I would do it 1 turn for breakin.
- check the compression
- crank the engine over to verify oil pressure
- check the timing and dwell while you crank it over w/o fuel/spark
- have some clamp pre-tested that will keep the throttle locked open.

Your neighbors (in the next county) won't like the sound without the muffler.
