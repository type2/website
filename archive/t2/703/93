Tony,

Really, really LOL!!!!  My wife came running to see what was going on!

I must admit that the youngest one stuck with it for the longest time 
tho....speaking of which, I am going to use some bandwidth here cause I am 
just bursting with pride...yeah...I know, sounds corny, but get this..

He won the Fulbright Scholarship and will be gone to England for a year!

SO, I guess he lived thru it ok and didn't get any brain damage!...LOL!

Cheers, dave
