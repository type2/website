Subject: RE: Bearing replacement

Thanks for the recommendation John.  I have a brass drift somewhere from
when I had to replace a fuel pump on a Voyagers gas tank, picked it up
because I was worried about spark and fuel vapor.   Now if I can just find
the thing, I think it's buried in my basement somewhere.  Getting those four
bolts off of the spring so that I could remove the bearing housing was a
real treat!  I havn't cussed that much in years.

The best thing I've found to use is a brass drift, not a
punch. With
the punch you risk scoring the walls around the bearings. And the other
benefit is that you can use a brass drift to install the new bearings.
The brass is much softer than the bearing metal, and will distort and
deform long before you'll damage the bearning. Trust me--it's way better
than a punch and the only thing better still would be a nice press to
push those suckers out. I've used a punch too many times, and it
_always_ results in damage to the bearing, to the walls...
