Subject: It runs

I've got some problems with lifters that aren't rock hard yet, and so 
it's difficult to get a good valve adjustment. But it runs.

Getting ready now for the 20 minute run at 2000 rpm. What's to get 
ready? I think I'll install the muffler. And I have to open the garage 
door for the first time in three years (windows won't cut it).
