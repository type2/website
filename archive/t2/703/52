Subject: Directional Signal Reflector

When I got my bus last year, the reflector on one of the directional signals
had a blue tinge to it. I thought it was overspray.  I just got a used
reflector and it has the same blue tinge. any thoughts as to what this is
and what can be done about it?

 

TIA
