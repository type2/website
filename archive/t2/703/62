Subject: Engine install update

The engine is in and all bits connected. I was working on the last concern
when Mom Nature said it was time to quit for today. We now have about an inch
of snow in the last hour and it's blowing up under my carport. Too bad, it's
been tolerably cold all day and I got a lot done.

My last concern before I crank it over is the hydraulic clutch. This is my 80
Vanagon. It seems that the slave cylinder is not fully retracting and keeping
the throwout bearing in contact with the clutch when the pedal is up.
Previously I tried bleeding the system using a vacuum gun after installing the
new slave cylinder. Today I tried attaching a hose to the bleeder and putting
the other end of the hose in a jar with enough brake fluid to cover the end of
the hose. I would then pump the clutch pedal while watching the fluid level in
the reservoir. Still have the same problem. I don't thing the hose that goes
from the chassie to the slave cylinder is bad, With the bleader open I have
good flow. Also it worked fine with the old slave cylinder. I'm wondering if
the problem is that I'm not able to hold the pedal down and close the bleeder
at the same time while working alone. Does the spring on the pedal cause the
master cylinder to draw the fluid out of the slave cylinder causing the slave
to retract? There is no spring on the clutch actuator arm like on my 75.
Bentley does not show a spring on the Vanagon there either. Hopefully I can
get my neighbor to help me by pressing the pedal while I work the bleeder. Has
anyone ran into this problem before? I don't have experience with this kind of
setup so any advise is appreciated.
