Aaron said: 

Hello there, I have a 78 Westy with a type IV F.I. engine....    I have
recently rebuilt this motor and have maybe 1000 miles on her....
 
We went to Edisto Island on the 18th and she drove down great....   We got
there, had a great time(go to Freeze Yer Toes if youve never been)....  She
started great leaving too, but when we got to a gas station on the way back,
she started up fine and I was waiting for all the other buses, and saw my red
dash light were on, and the bus died.....    She would not start up, I had
just gotten fuel, so it wasnt that...

I believe you answered your question in your last sentence!

I would totally drain the tank and put in fresh stuff that ran fine before you got 
the tankful of the stuff that killed it. At least start there first..... sounds like you got 
a lot of water in your gas.
