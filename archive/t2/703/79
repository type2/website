hello Tom  On a vanagon you can bleed the slave from the engine compartment 
by hand. Just reach in and move the slave up and down with your hand , hold it 
in the up postion and poen the bleeder. We have been doing these this way for 
years now and only takes one person to bleed  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
