Subject: the end of winter (as we know it)

My bus was hit in the parking lot of Krogers last weekend. It was
snowing like a bi*#! . But the wife was sick in bed and I had to get
groceries.  Her car (CRV w/130k miles) was in the shop. I cranked up
the bus and drove into the white haze. In the parking lot the iron
offender left a dent reminiscent of a rear mounted spare tire in the
nose of my bus, but didn't leave a note. No damage to any surrounding
parts but a half round punch about 1/64 deep to the right of the
insignia and a scrape on the bumper. Got an insurance estimate today
and into the body shop on Monday. Big sigh.

The insurance adjuster was thrilled to see a nice looking original
bus. She wrote a check that should cover the work and a little bit
extra :-) (I laid on the charm) The body shop is 1/4 mile from my
home. Double :-)

Between the last snow and this one I checked the action of my steering
box. Had a friend turn the wheel while I observed. Small crack in the
coupler.

There is several degrees of vertical rotational input before on the
steering column before any horizontal output. The column wasn't
exactly centered into the tube as I lay on my back peering over my
bifocals.

I think the box is bad and would appreciate any insight into the task
that lies ahead. I pray for warmer weather soon to get the job done
right. ( semi apologies to Hineline) Hopefully before the swallows
return the Capistrano.

I've had a couple of offers from T2 lister's for replacement steering
gear (thanks!!)But wil probably go with a rebuilt from Bus Depot
(email in the offing. Are you reading Ron?)

PS I've been ebaying some Healey parts and making some donations to
the list. Recommend that everyone give a little bit too.
