Mark,

Lordy! thanks for the plug<grin>....when you were talking about it putting 
your engine back together, it was like listening to myself years ago.

And, in addition, the cleaning parts is absolutely correct.

Many years ago, when I had a shop, it got to be a game with me as to how 
long it would take to do teardown and clean an  engine in preparation
for rebuild.

Remember, these were T1 engines...T4's were just arriving on these shores 
so there wasn't much variation in parts to worry about.

After finally getting to the point in my life(thank goodness) where I 
could actually afford a parts washer and sand blaster, I can honestly not 
believe how I went so long with out them.

They are absolutely essential...and since I have also discovered powder 
coating, I am consider spending the *really* big bucks to get a semi 
professional sand blaster box....I use mine *all* the time.

Beats the ever livin' daylight out of washing parts in 30 degree weather 
in kerosene and then spending hours trying to wire brush it....hmmmm maybe 
that's why my two sons really aren't in to working on cars much...at one 
time, they spend several weekends heping me do just that.

Cheers, dave
