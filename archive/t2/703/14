Subject: When bolts and studs break off

Open note to self:
In re: when bolts and studs break off

Walk away. Turn off the lights, and lock the shop. Stay away for at 
least 24 hours. Kick back with a bottle of Baccardi and cokes. Rent 
"Monty Python and the Holy Grail." Watch it while kicking back with the 
rum. Stay up late, sleep in late.

Twenty-four hours minimum. A week is better.

Immediate action to resolve a screw-up like this only compounds. Every 
time.

YMMV, but don't count on it.

Mark
