(Keeping in theme...)

Seriously, I do love the high top. I've still got ideas rolling in the
back of my head for a swappable top. I've already got killer quick
releases picked out. Kind of like the cam QR's on bicycles except
using screw heads instead of levers. I just need to come up with
something waterproof and solid for the top. I'm seriously considering
glassing my own top. If I can do a surfboard, I can do this.

I'm thinking reinforced polyester mesh, stretched across the top of
the bus and held with bows to keep the stock curve, fully glassed, and
reuse the aluminum relief strips all around so I can use the same
holes and such. I refuse to drill any NEW ones.

I'm just going to have to build a frame that is a mirror image of a
stock hardtop. That will be the tough part. Glassing is relatively
easy. Heh.


We shall see... Like I said, this has been rattling around the back of
my head since I discovered I couldn't get into one of the parking
structures I needed to get into. And the idea of being able to drive
the bus while the high top is off and being refurb'd is appealing too.
