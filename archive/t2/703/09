Engine was off the stand, on the cart. Ready to install fan, shroud, 
tin, FI, clutch. First I had to put the center bolt on the hub. 
Thought, I don't remember it being this long. But the bolt was on the 
big washer for the hub. Wrench it down to within 1/4" of tight.

Snapped off. Drilled it out, tried tapping in new threads. Tap snapped. 
Played games for an hour or so, but that's it. Crankshaft is spoiled. 
Engine comes apart.

Grumble, grumble.

Mark
