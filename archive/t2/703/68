Subject: '71 headlight switch

I just got a new headlight switch from Bus Boys that seems to be called 
out as the right (replacement) part currently available. But the spades on 
it are different enough from my original that I'm confused and concerned 
about making it work. The original uses 57 while the new one does not, the 
new one has 2 extra spades - 58L & 58R, and the 58b spade on the new one 
is a tiny half as wide version. If anyone out there has made this work I'd 
appreciate a little help.
