Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pressure testing

Hi Alejandro,

I bought a $50cdn VDO tester from GermanSupply.com last year to help 
troubleshoot my FI install on the westfakia. The fuel line is clamped 
over the outlet port in the 3-4 fuel rail, it does not thread into the 
fitting.

That guage works great for me, and helped out a lot when 
troubleshooting.

Happy trails,
