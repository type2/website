Subject: Well, maybe

Greg, Michael Knight, and others gave me some ideas and encouragement 
about how to fix the hub center bolt without a tear-down. So I figured, 
what have I got to lose? I couldn't made it worse.

I got in there and rooted around with a tungsten bit on my dremel. 
Eventually, the broken tap end gave up. I redrilled and tapped to 5/16, 
just a bit larger than the standard M8. It seems to be okay. Haven't 
torqued it yet, though.

So thanks, all, for suggestions and commiserations. It might all work 
out yet.
