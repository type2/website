None do.

Yes. It has a barb on the port exactly for ths purpose. Even the factory
pressure tester attached using hose and a clamp.

You need a pressure release valve to minimize mess but I wouldn't buy a
gague from the autoparts store because for the $40-50 spent you only can
make use of the gauge itself as the fittings are designed for US cars.

Making your own isn't difficult. I felt I could make a better version that I
could buy:
