Sounds like it might be the #2 temperature sensor.  I had a similar problem with my 81 Vanagon, same engine type, and nearly drove me crazy trying to find the problem.  Swapped out the temp sensor with a new one (it's one one on the third cylinder, next to the fuel injector), and it solved the problem.
