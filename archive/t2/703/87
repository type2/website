I only searched for the "home use style" because I've been considering one
for kitchen use. You brought up another possible use.

There should be industrial equivalents out there that would do larger
pieces (and avoid the fight with the significant other every time s/he
finds the "Seal A Meal" out in the garage).

Another idea is to investigate industrial "saran wrap". Wide rolls that
they use to wrap pallets for shipping. That stuff grabs and seals GREAT
(Mom brought some home from work to help with a move one time). Might have
to use stiffer than "cardboard" stock for smaller parts though because you
"stretch" it on and it shrinks back up some to form the seal. It would
crush any weak backing material or warp it to the point that you would have
a "plastic covered bowl" with parts rattling around rather than being
wraped to the backing.
