Subject: fuel pressure testing

Hi all,

I'm still trying to track down the weird intermittent stalling problem on my
76 Westy (it's getting to be pretty frequent), so I was going to invest in a
fuel pressure gauge to be as thorough as possible in my tests and diagnosis.
However, I couldn't seem to find any fuel pressure gauges that would thread
into that itty-bitty-teeny-tiny hole that is left when you unscrew the little
screw in the fuel rail between 3&4 injectors. Am I supposed to use the fuel
line that I've seen included in the kits and a clamp to attach the line to the
fuel pressure gauge, and simply clamp onto that little piece of metal fuel
line that the screw goes into? Any recommendations on a high quality fuel
pressure gauge? Is it a good idea to get the kind that has the extra tubing
and valve that  lets the fuel in the tester be dumped into another container
of some sort?
