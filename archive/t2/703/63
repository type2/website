Subject: Engine install update

My last concern before I crank it over is the hydraulic clutch.
-------------------------
Crank the engine without the rotor or otherwise disable the ignition until
it pumps up oil pressure.
Make sure the idiot light is off before you apply spark.
If the engine binds for any reason stop cranking.
Binding engine can be caused by crankshaft shim spacing on front of engine.
Left out shim washer on the fan end of the engine and the fan binds on the
fan housing.
