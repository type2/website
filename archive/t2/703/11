Subject: Hubcap Clip Attachment

Hello,

I understand a lot of folks use pop rivets to attach new hubcap clips to
their rims rather than using the steel one provided with the clip kit.  Can
anyone tell me the size of the rivet they used? Would a 5mm diameter rivet
be ok?  Also, since the back of the rim lies on the face of the drum, do you
normally pop rivet the clip from the inside of the rim?  That is, the head
of the rivet between the rim and drum.  I ask this because the 5mm rivets
are a bit longer and would not allow the rim to fit flush against the drum
unless I smashed them flat with a hammer...I just want to do it right the
first time!

Thanks,

Scott
