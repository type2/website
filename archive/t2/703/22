Yeaaaa Mark!

How many folks here remember when Dremel tools were first available?

They gotta rank right up there with screwdrivers in the tool box.

Mark, think about this...before Dremel's were invented...I broke the 
crankshaft/flywheel bolt off at the shoulder on a T1 engine with red 
locktite all over the threads.

Took me several hours to get it out without hurting the high$$$$$
Gene Berg crankshaft.  I took it out one very small piece at a time.

bus content:...that engine eventually ended up in a 67 bus and I *never* 
used a stock T1 flywheel bolt on an engine again.

Cheers, dave
