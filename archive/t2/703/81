I'd probably send out the case for cleaning given the number of times it
needs doing. The rest I could take care of with gun barrel brushes etc.

I'd like a sandblasting cabinet also but for a few bucks it's much easier,
quicker and overall a better prep job is achieved.

I had the same problem until I discovered proper fitting non-powdered
nitrile gloves. When it's the right size and thickness and you are not
allergic to it they start to feel like hands again.
