 I just got a new headlight switch from Bus Boys that seems to be called 
out as the right (replacement) part currently available. But the spades on 
it are different enough from my original that I'm confused and concerned 
about making it work. The original uses 57 while the new one does not, the 
new one has 2 extra spades - 58L & 58R, and the 58b spade on the new one 
is a tiny half as wide version. If anyone out there has made this work I'd 
appreciate a little help.

Every few years this comes up and rears its ugly head. I scream everytime 
it does! The last time was around July 2001. There is a long thread about it in the archives.

Your original headlight switch was part # 211 941 531 PLAIN with no letter after it. 
Correct?
Now the replacement you got has an E on the end. Correct?

Now Joe at BustedBus should chime in and say "there never was a plain 211 941 531 
light switch, all my books say 211 941 531 E". Wrong, yes 71 was plain and yes VW 
subbed it the E, but it is a BAD sub because of #57.

Here is a work-around for the problem, right out of the archives [funny how the list has those.....]:

Here are some thought about dealing with replacement switch problems.

58 is juice to the fuse box for the parking lights.
57 is juice to the parking light indicator on the instrument pod.
58b is juice for all three dash pods (speedo, clock, guage cluster)

When you pull the knob out one click all three of the above get juice so you get
dash lights, indicator, and outside parking lights. Pull it out again and you
get headlights too but 57 looses juice. 58b has the rheostat control.

Replacement switchs do not have 57 for the indicator lamp. You simpley put a Y
on spade 58 and the indicator will be on when the headlamps are on too but this
may not be a bad thing when driving in the rain during the day because you might
not forget the lights are on when stopping the vehicle.

If you rheostat on your original switch goes bad you can reroute 58b to 58 and
will have power to the dash pod lights and bypass the scratchy rheostat (fire
hazard)

Good luck
