Subject: Re: [T2] Engine install update

Thanks for the advise Mark but I don't quite understand. If I got it right I
think you mean:
1. Push up on the arm (clutch engaged position), Open bleeder until arm
reaches the top, then close bleeder
2. Pull down the arm, drawing fluid from reservoir, till the arm is as far
down as it will go.
3. return to step 1 until system is fully bled.
Is this right or do I have it backwards somehow?

  hello Tom  On a vanagon you can bleed the slave from the engine compartment
by hand. Just reach in and move the slave up and down with your hand , hold it
in the up postion and poen the bleeder. We have been doing these this way for
years now and only takes one person to bleed  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
