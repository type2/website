I hope you checked your fan belt as soon as you saw that the the generator light
had come on.
Good work ! You managed to get an easy fix done!

Just remember,, when the fan stops working on the type1 aircooled engine because
the fan/generator belt flew the coop.. then your coolant is gone, and your in
jepardy of overheating your engine.

This isn't as critical with a type4 engine as it has the fan attached to the
crankshaft and will continue to cool the engine even if the alternator belt
breaks
