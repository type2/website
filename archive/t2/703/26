Subject: Frozen distributor?

Ok. I'm going to have to pull apart and clean my distributor. The
advance is "stuck" in below freezing temps, taking 5 minutes or more
to start working AFTER driving (sitting still and idling to warm up
doesn't seem to work).

Pulling it apart and cleaning it isn't a problem. I need to know what
lubricant can be used on the advance weights and such without issue in
well below freezing temps?
