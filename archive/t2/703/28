Hey folks,
     Thanks for all the help I've been given so far. The bus is almost up and running great..... except for a few little things.
     I'm thinking that I might need an old priest and a young priest, and some holy water, maybe a crucifix. I think my electrical system is haunted. Or at least some contacts are dirty or something. 
     I learn that the oil and gen warning lights are the most important things, (other than guages and those dice that hang from the mirror) so I should get mine going, because neither were working when I bought the bus. But one day when I start the bus, Badaboom, the gen light comes on when I turn the key! Happy day, one less thing I have to root around under the dash board for. So I start rooting around under there anyway. The Gen light stops working. I pull the connector off the back of the bulb in the dash, put it back on, and glory be, the oil light works but the gen light doesn't anymore. Now the oil light consistently works, but I can't get the gen light to come back on. Also only one of the turn signal indicators works (the left one comes on whether I've indicated a right turn or a left one.) Someone installed an aftermarket head temp guage under the dash, and that also seems to be haunted. Sometimes it works perfect, but other times, it jumps straight up to 600 degrees when
 I start the bus, and then slowly sinks back down, but jumps right back up when I rev the engine. Do I just need to rewire? Methinks I probably don't have the know-how yet, so if there are any magic hints that help with problems like this, they would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you all ahead of time.
 
                                                                                      Skyler
