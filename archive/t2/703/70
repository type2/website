Subject: Engine is in, lessons learned

I put the engine in the bus yesterday and hooked everything up. The 
battery, though, sat neglected for three years and wasn't great to 
begin with. No amount of charging has helped. So I didn't get to pump 
up the oil and test fire the engine before my time-honored 4:30 
Saturday deadline to close up and shower for dinner.

Lessons learned and reinforced:

First: Engine building is mostly about cleaning. Organization comes 
second, obsessive attention to tolerances third, and mechanical ability 
comes in dead last. It's mostly about cleaning, and cleaning is 
tedious, tedious, tedious.

If I had it to do over again -- and I hope I don't, at least for some 
while -- I would invest more in things to aid cleaning: (1) a parts 
washer and solvent; (2) a bench-mounted pair of wire wheels; (3) a 
source of hot running water. I also wouldn't allow myself to do what I 
did this time, which was "just in time" cleaning. I spent far more time 
washing my hands than I did actual assembly. (I know: gloves. I can't 
get the hang of wearing and disposing of gloves. There's all kinds of 
generational/libidinal/Freudian stuff going on there, but let's not go 
there.)

Second: Engine building is mostly about cleaning. The best thing to do 
is to get it all out of the way before doing anything else.

And third: Engine building is mostly about cleaning.

See? Pretty tedious.
