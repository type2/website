Hi Joseph,

My advice would be to use the $$ to do a complete review of the running 
gear of the bus. Take a good hard look at  the CV's, transmission and 
the engine. Then have a close look at the steering and suspension. A 
leak-down test on the engine wouldn't be a bad idea, and buy an extra 
fire extinguisher just in case.

If there's cash left over after completing the items above, pay it out 
to put a positive balance on your VISA card, that way you can convert 
it into parts, labour or accommodation in case of emergency.

Happy trails,
