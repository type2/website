Real men don't use relief valves... ;-)

I love how you did that. Pretty sweet. When I was troubleshooting the
FI in my old 280z I bought an adapter from the Nissan dealer for $20
to use with the guage I rented from a FLAPS. I dunno what sizes are
involved with a VW FI but I have a hard time believing that the
factory expected the dealer to use a clamp.

Not that it couldn't happen, though. Heh.
