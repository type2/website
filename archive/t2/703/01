I agree with Mike,, I use the wire nuts also,, maybe as I am an electrician,,,.
YMMV
I don't push them,, but they are an option I might mention when asked what I
use.

I like the way Mike called them "U-squash-it" connectors ,,  as that is what
they do. LOL

Any connector that can keep pressure on the wire while the current or
temperature changes is a good connector.. any thing that doesn't have a "spring"
effect will come loose ,,sooner or later, as in almost all automotive
connectors.

I know they are bulky, and you can't splice a harness together with them,, but
there are some very valid places where they can be used on the vehicles we
drive.
ymmv

If you look at the design of the square wire spring wire nut,,, or something
like an ampact connector.. both have a way to flex and rebound ,,,keeping the
pressure on the conductors.
the wire nut has a spring that flexes.. the ampact is a 'C' shape with a wedge
inside,, the C is also a spring.
not a big deal in small current automotive connections,,
I don't recommend the ampact on our vehicles,, I was just pointing out there are
some places that style of thinking can cross over , wire nuts are certainly one
style that makes sense to me.

 that good on copper ends, as they can oxidize and conduct poorly.
