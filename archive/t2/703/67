I have never dealt with Vanagon hydraulic clutches. But what you describe is
exactly how a hydraulic hose tends to fail (before it blocks entirely): it
allows flow, when pressure is build up in the system, but it does not allow
for backflow when the m/c side is depressurized. That is why brakes with bad
old flex lines lock up: they allow the brakes to engage, but not to
disengage.

Again, I do not know about Vanagon hydraulic clutches, but do not rule out
the hose. Another thought: on a Mercedes we had a similar clutch problem and
it turned out that the clutch had to be bled the other way: instead of
vacuum on the slave cylinder side, the fuid had to be pumped into the system
by applying vacuum to the m/c side - still don't know why, but it worked. I
guess a quick glance into Bentley shold clarify if Vanagons use the same
procedure.
