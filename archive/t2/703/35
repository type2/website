A quick update on the molding:

well I just spoke with Outwater Plastics who unfortunately gave me a
dead end. The rep recognized the profile of the trim, but had not seen
it in many years. Apparently no one makes that anymore. Really a shame
Anyone know of something else that can finish the edge of plywood and
also allow the gap to be hidden?
