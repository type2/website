Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pressure testing

I actually went to the junk yard and picked up a fuel pressure test port 
off of a ford.  I put that in-line with my fuel rail and now I can hook 
up my craftsman fuel pressure tester up to the port which is MUCH easier 
than slipping a fuel line onto the stock VW test port that you refer to.

In regards to your problem, I had a similar problem.  For me the problem 
turned out to be one of those little round pieces of paper that are on 
the top of the fuel injector cleaner bottles.  Every now and then that 
paper would fall over the take outlet and block it.. drove me nuts!  
Ultimately, had to take the tank out, but ended up replacing all the 
fuel lines in the process.
