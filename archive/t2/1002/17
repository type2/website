Subject: 2L rebuild progress

Hi All, 

In the process of rebuilding a 2L for Frau BlC<cher.   Got the bottom end
together, got the jugs back from the local VW mechanic yesterday, and
today I'll get the heads cleaned up.  By this weekend I should have the
longblock all together, and Saturday I'll be sandblasting and painting
engine tin.  Seems that I just did that for the engine that was in the
bus.  Hmm.  

Pulled the engine out of Frau 2 weeks ago and have pulled it down to a
shortblock.  Found some problems.  

The brass dizzy gear looks like it was installed by a drunken carpenter
wielding a claw hammer.  Pretty chunked up.  Is it the same as on the
Type 1 engine?

#2 flywheel side wrist pin circlip was half out of the piston.
Thankfully I caught it before any real damage occurred.  That could have
been nasty.  Looks like it may have been improperly installed or not
fully seated when installed.  Piston is good and re-usable. Clip will go
in the trash. 

#2 piston rings walked around so that the 2 top ring gaps were aligned.
That explains the excess crankcase pressure, oil puking, and burnt
oil/carbon fouling of #2 piston.  

The endplay was never set properly.  Instead of .003" to .005", it was
closer to 1/16".  I have a morbid curiosity to see what the crank thrust
bearing looks like.  Also explains the abnormal wear on the brass dizzy
gear and I'll bet a dollar to a donut that the cam gear is worn too.  

I will be selling the unused bits and bobs (mostly EFI) from both Frau
and the engine I purchased to rebuild.  But at the moment, getting my
bus running reliably is #1 priority.  Once that's accomplished, I'll
clean up and check out all the parts.  With the List Admin's blessings,
I'll list the stuff here to give the fellow listees first crack at
'em.  

Much fun, and I'm learnin' lots!

Shad H.
