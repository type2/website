In my experience, it is needed in the winter.  I have had problems with 
carb icing in temps between 30 and 40 degrees.

There is an alternative.  If you don't mind deviating from the stock 
vacuum line configuration, you can tap into manifold vacuum somewhere 
else.  I teed into the line coming from the port below the throttle 
plate on the left carb, which supplies manifold vacuum to the vacuum 
retard canister on the distributor.  You can run a hose from any 
manifold vacuum source to the temperature switch and it will work just 
fine.  I ran this way for years due to the difficulty of finding that 
right boot.
