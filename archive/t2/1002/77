Subject: Re: [T2] Learning to MIG weld. / Flux Core Welding Problems

This page

   http://www.mig-welding.co.uk/tutorial.htm

is indeed good and a wonderful find, but it is
also good in that it leads to another page

   http://www.anvilfire.com/iForge/tutor/safety3/index.htm

which, in turn, answers a question we were discussing
at the end of July on whether or not to weld galvanized,
which is why I made a composite Subject line above.
