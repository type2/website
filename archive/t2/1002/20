Subject: the raw power of my 81 air cooled westy (Calif model)

Hi there . . .just checking with the group to see if I've got enough power.

1. My compression all the way around is as follows . . .120, 120, 100, 120
2. Timing is set to 5 degrees ATDC (idle seems a little high, I'll hook up
tach tester tonight).  Electronic ignition.

The bus gets through to 4th gear fine.  It will cruise at 55 with no problem
(without pedal to the metal), but top speed after about a mile or two is
63-65mph on flat land at about 300ft above sea level.

Should I expect any more power than I have?  I'm thinking that I shouldn't but
wanted to be sure.

Brad
