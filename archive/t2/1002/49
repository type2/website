The air cleaner on the dual carb engine has thermostatic control box  
just before the air cleaner:

Its purpose is to let it in warm air to help the engine idle during  
the warmup period. This supply of warmed air comes from below the  
cylinder heads via preheat tin:

PreheaterTin.jpg

The valve in the box is activated by a vacuum signal which comes from  
the brake booster line that feeds off the intake manifold where you  
found that 3-way rubber tee. The vacuum signal to the box is  
controlled by a temperature switch in the air intake for the right  
carb which cuts off the vacuum signal at the designated temperature:

I've never disconnected it to determine how effective it is but a lot  
of VWs were equipped by the factory for warmup enrichment before the  
last (76.5-79) FI configuration made that system obsolete.

P/N is 021-129-637D but it's probably NLA.

If you can't find one at a vendor I might have a spare to give you.  
If I do, it's in a box and I'll have to go looking for it.
