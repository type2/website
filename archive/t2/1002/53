Subject: vacuum hose fitting

Thank you Richard, terrific info on that subject.  I've some work to do as
the PO tore out all the wiring when he "ripped" the previous motor and
tranny out.  If you can find that right hand rubber fitting it would be
great, otherwise I'll  tap into a vacuum source from somewhere else as per
David's suggestion.  tnx David.
