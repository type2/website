Gee... Y'know, I believe it. Even after "OH yeaaaah,
my Daddy can beat up your Daddy, even when mine is
72."
My Daddy's ashes are scattered over several acres, so
your Daddy would get all tuckered out and not win!

Thanks for getting back to us. Glad it worked out.
Next time consider that whatever you're doing with
your bus, there are people on this list accounting for
hundreds or thousands of times that same thing -
including mistakes and faulty diagnoses! -BaH

 Hi,
 
  
 
 I don't know if anyone can believe this, but I found
 the fault with my bus.
 
  
 
 I was all paranoid it was the oil cooler and
 thinking the worst.
 
  
 
 But, you guys kept telling me to replace the oil
 sensor.
 
  
 
 So, I did.
 
  
 
 5 bucks man.......5 bucks!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
  
 
 The leak is gone and now I am trying to get rid of a
 leak at a bolt on my
 taco plate. Accidentally pulled it off, thinking it
 was the oil strainer.
 The copper washer disintegrated.
 
  
 
 I am having tiny drips on one bolt.
 
  
 
 I am told to find aviation gasket stuff from
 Permatex.
 
  
 
 Can't find any at UAP Napa.
 
  
 
 I am thinking AME school at Summerside PEI.
 
  
 
 Should check with German Supply.
