Paul,

The hint from whoever still sells those is to have it out of the bus, put
a bb under the hollow end on a big anvil or vise, have a friend hold the 
frame and the hit the rivet with a big punch and hammer.

I tried making a tool from a 3 foot bolt cutter and it aaalllmost 
worked...but not well.


If you use a pop rivet(cause it's in the bus), think about a metal one 
rather than aluminum....


Cheers, dave
