I hit upon this by accident when replacing the rear wheel cylinders on my
'71.  I noticed that it was slowly dripping after I disconnected the
line, so I installed the new cylinder and let it sit until the cylinder
was full.  I then closed the bleeder and fully expected to have to bleed
the brakes, but I had a high, firm pedal.  It might have helped that my
bus was parked a bit nose-up at the time.

I strongly suspect that others' milage will vary, however.
