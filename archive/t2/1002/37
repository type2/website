Subject: Re: [T2] Fri [TAN]  Sunny D commercial

I passed it on the freeway a few weeks back and have
been trying to remember ever since what the product
was so I could look it up! It was in convoy with
either a motorhome, a big truck or a full sized bus,
towing a triler I think. The bus looked great! -BaH
