Subject: vacuum hose fitting

Hi all.  I"ve a 2 litre engine rebuilt and converted from fuel injection to
dual carbs.  At the bottom of the right (pssngr) intake manifold is a rubber
fitting that is in dire need of replacement.  I can find plenty of the Left
fittings, but the right one has a small hose coming out the top of it  going
up to the air filter. (as well as the larger hose going to the vacuum
balance system)   I've tried to include a pic on my "new" shaw cable website
of it but I can't guarantee it'll work.

My question is this.  What is the function of this little vacuum hose going
up to the air cleaner?  Is it even needed on a dual carb engine?  If not
I'll just get a lefty and use it, otherwise I'll need to find a vendor that
supplies a righty.  My last van had a single weber and my other VW's have
been be*tles so I've no experience with this little beasty.
