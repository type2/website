I just finished using Lysol brand Kitchen Cleaner with Bleach and it removed 
ALL the black algae and moss that was starting to grow on my rooftop. I 
sprayed the heck out of it, and then used a semi-stiff kitchen dish brush 
with a handle on it. Worked great, my roof looks like it just came out of 
the factory.
