Subject: Re: [T2] the raw power of my 81 air cooled westy (Calif model)

Brad, perhaps it should do just a little bit better than that, but not much.  Load, headwind, just how "flat" flat is, etc all affect it of course.  I've had '81, '81, '82, '83 (which was an auto) with new engines I built in all, the autobox would only do about that, the '81 and '82 would do a bit better, maybe high 60's or very low 70's on what I guessed to be "flat" but for a slightly worn engine that doesn't seem that far off.  You engine is probably making 65-70hp or so max and it is probably a 2 1/2 ton vehicle if you have anything in it, maybe even more, not hard to figure it out.  Another tip running 55mph the engine will last 75-100k miles in a Vanagon Westy, running 65mph you may be lucky to see 40-50k miles, the autobox '83 I had was on its 3rd engine with a real original 72k miles on it (though the auto has some issues a stick doesn't for cooling.)  Not uncommon that #3 is the one lower on compression BTW, it always seems to be on a T4, just like it always was on
 a T1.  Tune it up, consider having a look at the injector spray patterns if you have the guts to get a gut feel fuel delivery is even all round, but I wouldn't expect a whole lot more.

The bus gets through to 4th gear fine. It will cruise at 55 with no problem
(without pedal to the metal), but top speed after about a mile or two is
63-65mph on flat land at about 300ft above sea level.

Should I expect any more power than I have? I'm thinking that I shouldn't but
wanted to be sure.
