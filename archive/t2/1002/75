I have front discs like most '75s. I only bled the bottom of the front discs
as Bentley did not make any mention of having to bleed both the top and
bottom. I must admit that for a job as significant as replacing or bleeding
brakes tends to be, Bentley really did a poor job of walking one through it.

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
