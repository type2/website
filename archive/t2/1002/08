Subject: Engine Paint

OK...  Thanks to the advice of many individuals on this list and the support
of my local VW club, I have started my first engine rebuild project.  I am
rebuilding the engine in my 1971 VW Westy and, in the process, going to
upgrade the engine to a 1776cc.  Since I am taking time to do all of this
work, I am also going to purchase some stainless fastners to replace items
like those stock engine tin screws (yes, I will be sure to use locktite given
the fact that it is stainless).

My question, this time, is related to engine paint.  Back when I was driving
the old 57 Chevy and its cousins, I would always take a little time to clean
everything up and give things a fresh coat of paint to make everything look
good and also help with finding oil leaks and such.  The "dolling up" doesn't
really last long but at least it is a point of pride.  On VW air cooled
engines, however, I need advice.  I have heard from many to be careful due to
the paint "holding in the heat".  Also, some have even gone so far as to say,
"stay away from .... color".  What is the advice of this group?  Is it safe to
paint the engine tin?  Can the jugs or block be painted?  Any advice would be
appreciated.

Thanks,

Michael
