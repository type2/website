68 is one-year-only IF you still have the original pop
top. 68 used wood screws to go UP thru the hinge into
the wood supports in the top. NOT a good idea.... the
wind tore the top off. In 69 Westfalia changed the
design of the hold down and used carriage bolts that
came thru the top from the outside. The 68 only hinges
have stamped counter-sunk holes for the counter-sunk
wood screws. 69-72 hinges have flat holes for the nut
and lock washer to sit against. 73 hinges are
one-year-only because Westfalia realised the aluminum
tubular hinge material sucks! They redesigned them
using flat stock steel, like the 74-79 rear hinges but
not as stout.

Your best choice is to find a pair of 73 hinges and
get the carriage bolts that came with them. Then drill
4 holes thru the top....

Somewhere I have an original pair of 68 only hinges. I
use them for demo purposes.
