Subject: What seats do I have?

Ok I am the guy who doesnt know for sure what year his bus is.
Its titled as a 72 but is obviously a 75 or later.
I want to re-do the front seats but am not sure what to order.
They are high-backed seats with headrests, but if I am reading things right there are two different styles of these. How can I tell what I have so I get the right covers and pads?

Thanks,
