I was out last night doing a little zapping on Zoe, and as usual, my welds
look like crap. I know I have heard about the benefits of using a shielding
gas such as Argon, but a few websites I have looked at said that Argon is
useful mainly for welding aluminum. I would certainly like to look at
something that is going to make the learning curve easier for me and if a
gas is the way to go, which is the correct one for MIG welding on steel?
