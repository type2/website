Subject: new member, parts sources

Hi guys,

I am a new member of the type 2 list. I have been a member of the vintage
bus list for years, and the type 3 list for a couple years as well. I just
purchased a '69 single cab. I also just moved to the Mountain View, Los
Altos area of CA.

I have lots of questions about this vehicle, as the interior is incomplete,
and these modern buses are new to me. 

I moved here from Boston for a project for work. Usually I need to
mail-order all my parts back east. I have been happy with that method, but I
was hoping I could find a local supplier for VW parts, so I could walk in
and find parts etc, without having to pay shipping costs all the time. The
first thing I'd like to get is a Bentley manual that covers this bus.

Any suggestions for VW shops that provide for air cooled folks in the area?

I will probably follow up with other questions, but will change my subject
line at that time.

Thanks,

-Kevin
