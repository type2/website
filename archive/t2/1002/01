Subject: I cannot believe it

Hi,

 

I don't know if anyone can believe this, but I found the fault with my bus.

 

I was all paranoid it was the oil cooler and thinking the worst.

 

But, you guys kept telling me to replace the oil sensor.

 

So, I did.

 

5 bucks man.......5 bucks!!!!!!!!!!!!

 

The leak is gone and now I am trying to get rid of a leak at a bolt on my
taco plate. Accidentally pulled it off, thinking it was the oil strainer.
The copper washer disintegrated.

 

I am having tiny drips on one bolt.

 

I am told to find aviation gasket stuff from Permatex.

 

Can't find any at UAP Napa.

 

I am thinking AME school at Summerside PEI.

 

Should check with German Supply.

 

Alan
