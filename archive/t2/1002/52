Subject: my new front westy seats

I finally got the front seats back from Colorado Seat Treat.  John did a 
real nice job.  The fabric came from Wolfsburg West.  They used foam in 
instead of the new horsehair type stuff that is available.  They turned 
out very nice.  There is one small area where the stuffing is exposed on 
each one though.  I'm not sure what to do about that if anything.
