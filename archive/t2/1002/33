Subject: Vent window hinge rivet  - THANKS

Thanks to those who responded to my questin about the hinge rivets.
I'll try the ball bearing trick with the original type rivets.  
If that doesn't work out too well I'll just shoot a solid aluminum rivet as
I have the tools and materials to do that, at work.
