Subject: single cab parts...

Well, I am slowly going through my bus and coming up with a list of parts
and questions.

My single cab has two 'treasure chest doors'. The PO tried to install some
church key latches on them. They don't look right, and they don't really
work very well at all. What was originally used to latch these doors? I
would like some sort of locking mechanism here, as I'd like to be able to
store stuff in there-locked.

Any ideas on ways to achieve this?

Also the springs that hold up the treasure chest, as well as the engine lid
are supposed to run on some rollers. My bus in missing these rollers. What
are they called, and does anyone have any idea where to get them? I am sure
they are no longer avail, but don't' know what they are called so that I can
search for them.

Thanks...
