Subject: AridZona Jerome Jamboree 2007 1963 raffle bus update

So far Magoo needs a side pop-out window   a side pop out latch complete,
not bad for a raffle bus. Thanks to Jeff, Brad Loy on the other issues, all
of you really came through.  There were so many hands helping me on and off
the stage, it was indredible.

 

Tonight is our ABC meeting at Rosita's in Tempe, be there with raffle prizes
and to exchange tales of Jerome.  There are already stories about "Elvis"
magoo's bus.  Please be there for the celebration.

PS: I want to buy a single cab roof rack for next years 1960 SC. Please let
me know what you have. Bless you all, uj
