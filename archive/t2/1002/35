Subject: 1600dp 009 dizzy, occasional backfire

Hi List,

KK has been running well since installing a non-leaking engine. I
occasionally have a small backfire when coming off the gas in 4th gear
and stepping on the brakes. I have a couple of pin sized holes in my
stock muffler.

I have the timing set at 28 degrees WOT and the dwell is at 52. It
seems to be running at a normal temp, no way to verify, just
smell/heat. If I advance it further would that possibly stop the
backfiring?

Thank you,

Max
