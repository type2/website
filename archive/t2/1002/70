Furthest first, then next closer, etc.
Never drain.
Fresh fluid in the reservoir - keep checking to not
allow to run empty - bleed right rear first until
clear fluid comes out, then left rear, etc.

Good sign is that the switches are working cuz the
light goes on. That means there is no air bubbles at
the switches.

You still have air. Start at the right rear and go
until you get a series of bubbles, then on to the
others. Sometimes you have to go buy another bottle of
fluid!

I have never been able to do the gravity flow method -
or else maybe I have never tried it! -BaH

 I just got done doing my brakes with the help of my
 wife (since Duroc seems
 to be nursing an illness).
 
 I followed the Bentley just as I believe I was
 supposed to and I have NO
 brakes.
 
 First I removed the old stuff from the back and the
 front (opened up the
 bleeders and pumped the peddle until each one went
 dry - then closed them
 up.).
 
 Next I filled the reservoir and starting with the
 front right, opened the
 bleeder and had her slowly push the peddle to the
 floor until it was down,
 tightened the bleeder, and had her let the peddle up
 filling the reservoir
 every now and then.
 
 I did the exact process that Bentley describes and
 officially have the same
 brakes I had when I removed all the fluid.
 
 What did I miss?
 
 Now when I hit the brakes, for the VERY first time,
 the B light goes on when
 the peddle hits the floor!!!
 
 This is the first time I have replaced brake fluid
 and I thought that I got
 everything right.
 
 Anyone got an idea of what I missed?
