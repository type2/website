Subject: Backfire

Hello list members,

KK my '71 Westy is having a bit of a backfire problem. I recently
swapped engines and now when coming off WOT (85-95%) I get a nice pop
out of the tailpipe. I did a full tune-up this weekend, nothing much
needed adjusting but I still get the backfire. I have it timed at 29
degrees when at WOT. Less or more and I get a nice flame out the
tailpipe. This is a 1600dp, with a 30/31 carb, and a 009 distributor.

Any ideas?

Thank you,

Max
