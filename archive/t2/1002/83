KK my  '71 Westy is having a bit of a backfire problem. I recently
swapped engines  and now when coming off WOT (85-95%) I get a nice pop
out of the tailpipe.  I did a full tune-up this weekend, nothing much
needed adjusting but I  still get the backfire. I have it timed at 29
degrees when at WOT. Less or  more and I get a nice flame out the
tailpipe. This is a 1600dp, with a  30/31 carb, and a 009 distributor.

Any ideas?

Thank  you,




hey max  Sounds like a exhust leak, check where the heater boxes  connect to 
the muffler  later  mark d
