I was thinking about that for my Rivi. I would suggest trying Barkeeper's
Friend. You can find it at Wally World or Lowe's. It does an amazing job on
stainless and I believe that it is also made for fiberglass as well.

Follow the directions on using it like a "paste" because that stuff is just
magic when you use it right.

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
