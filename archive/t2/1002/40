Correct answer for the best welds.
Now to add a little advantage, spray the area's to be welded with a mist
of anti spatter spray.

It'll keep the pigeon ca-ca from sticking to the surrounding area's of
the weld.

It comes in a aerosol can--works well, and you can also use it to keep
the nozzle & tip clean from spatter too.
