Subject: RE: [T2] cleaning the white pop top roof

The only thing that worked for my top was a gas powered pressure washer. No
bleaches or special solvents really worked. It still looks pretty good after
6 months.

I'll try both with the penetrol next time.

Anyone know of  a good product for cleaning the white portion of the pop top

westy roof?  Soap and water doesn't seem to be doing a very good job.  I'm 
not expecting miracles, but having it look clean would be nice!

Thanks!
