The '71 was the only year to come with a 1600DP.  If your intake manifold
has cast aluminum ends going into the heads you have a DP engine.

PICT is the solex designation for a carb.  You can find it on the left
side of the float bowl.  Most Solex carbs are PICT.  Older ones can be
PCI, etc, as well as the dual carbs.
