quick question...::::::::

i was looking at my fuel lines and noticed that the PO has a ruuber line cut off from one of the 2 spouts or metal pieces that comes from the bottom of the fuel tank...

well i know one runs to the fuel pump cause i ran this one but the other one i left alone just made sure that it didtn have any leaks...

what does this other fuel connection go to?
curious ...
is it like a vent or to another line somewheres aor what...
why does it now not have a use...

the engine was once a fuel injected engine so does that have something to do with it maybe thats where it hooked to...
going to be doing a little more work on her this weekend so thought this could might maybe be a issue for our trip to HCBF...



thanks and peace,,
