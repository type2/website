well mine is not exactly stock, and it is the BA-4 from the 411/412 (which
also had a 55amp alt) but I am using the airconditioner blowers for air
handling where the stock unit used the engine fan.  mine is closed circuit
with air intake from inside and circulated thru the heater then blown back
into the cab...engine not involved at all.

I have a meter, haven't bothered to use it, too many other "round
tuit's" begging for attention. and when it is bothering me it is too cold
to deal with.,  sound about right,  and then there is the desire for

.  radio
.  fog/driving lights
.  high intensity tail lights (maybe LED to save power)
.  this crazy desire for running lights
.  maybe a coffee heater ???  wishfull thinging
