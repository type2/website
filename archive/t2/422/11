Subject: Loose valve seats

I had to share this...it's a hoot

I've had literally hundreds of heads in my hands over the years, but
this set I bought at Buckeye on the weekend were a first...

1.8 L carb style, clean as a whistle on the valve spring side with new
springs...turn em over, and two intake seats are sitting up proudly
about 1/16" above the chamber...no big deal says I, I know a shop that
does a real nice job on oversized stelite seats to fix that...so I score
them cheap.

So last night I had a chance to pop the springs off, and have a
look-see...couldn't believe my eyes...the original seat had been pounded
in so far, someone had to make up a spacer, then hand form a seat, and
install it ABOVE the spacer...guess they figured one seat was good, so
two seats must be better...LOL

I wish I could find out who rebuilds engines riveting an aluminum s/n
plate on over the original s/n with drive rivets...I wonder if they know
not to double seat, or if someone else did that...I'll bet that engine
didn't go 100 miles before they realized something was wrong...

Had to share...hope you enjoyed it...
