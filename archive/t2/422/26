Ok, Im in Canada too, I pay $2100 a year for both my buses, my New Beetle and my
wifes, ahem, mini**n.

The buses only consume a quarter of that insurance and I have FULL insurance on
all 4 of my cars.

I suggest you do some more shopping.

I'm up in Canada so its a different system,  but I get hit with quite
the insurance bill, I pay $5,500.00 a year to insure my 2000 Subaru
Impreza and my 1973 Bus. Adding the bus to my policy actually doubled
my rate, my to my surprise.
