I thought the theory behind sodium filled valves was that the sodium
sloshed around and helped to transfer the heat from the valve head.

the sodium is inside the valve. this is completely different than making
the
valve from a different alloy. basically the valve is cored out and
filled
with salt. the salt (sodium) does not retain heat as much as solid metal
would. that is theory, anyhow.
