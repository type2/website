WTF!?!?!

$5,500 a year??? You've got to be shitting us!!! Does that include free
unlimited towing, a bumber-to-bumper mechanical warranty, and all the 91
Octange gas you can burn? It had better...!

I'm up in Canada so its a different system, but I get hit with quite the
insurance bill, I pay $5,500.00 a year to insure my 2000 Subaru Impreza and
my 1973 Bus. Adding the bus to my policy actually doubled my rate, my to my
surprise.
