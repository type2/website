Subject: Fw: [T2] Cooler Valves???

I'm coming in a little late on this thread, so forgive me if this has
already been brought up.
A number of companies do ceramic coatings on valve and piston tops. The idea
is to stop heat transfer during combustion.
Most will also do a molly type coating on valve stems and piston skirts to
reduce friction etc.
I have no experience with it, but know a few people who are happy with the
results.
