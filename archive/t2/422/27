Nope.  The Bob Hoover mentioned in the article is a very prominent airshow
pilot.  He was an Ace in WWII.  One of his routines is a no-engine
acrobatic routine ending in a landing wherein he rolls up to a place where
he has left his hat.  Very impressive!

"Our" Bob Hoover is also an airplane enthusiast, but not, AFAIK, an
airshow pilot.

I'd take that article with a grain of salt, too.
