FWIW the VW auto tranny should shift

up  1->2  18-24mph
    2->3  42-47

down 3->2 24-32mph
     2->1 14-16mph

gear ratio's are 
final drive  4.1
 1st gear    2.55
 2nd gear    1.45
 3rd gear    1.00   same as fourth in manual

this might give some hints as this is what VW considers the appropriate
shift points for the bus.
