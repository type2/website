If anything I would have thought Jap cars like to rev high :-)

3rd gear above 45 is pretty reasonable if you are going up an incline
because you don't want to put too much load on the engine at low revs.  But
on the level or going downhill (unless a steep hill) I usually change up to
4th about 35-40 and stay in 4th down to about 30.
