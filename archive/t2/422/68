The online diagrams at <http://www.bug-bits.freeserve.co.uk/ramva/fiche/ft2.htm> come from ETKA (VW's online parts database). They don't sell it.

What Bentley sells is a CD version (with terrible software I might ad) of the Volkswagen Type 2 workshop manual that everyone refers to as the yellow book.

I think the money would be better spent on a copy of the yellow book from eBay than getting the CDs. The CDs only work on windows, only allow one install, aren't searchable because they are scanned from the manuals not imported via OCR. The underlying technology is PDF but the Bentley software has obscured this with an annoying interface. My recommendation is not to buy it.
