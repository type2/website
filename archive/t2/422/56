> I have read the Muir section on driving a bus and was wondering how many
follow that advice to the letter? It seems kinda nutty to drive in 3rd gear
above 45mph...in my '71 the engine sounds like it is turning to fast in 3rd
 gear at 45mph...or is that just because I am use to driving jap cars?

I have not read that section YET, (I will today!), but one of the people in
the VW club I belong to, mentioned that very thing Monday night. I've been
having trouble keeping my engine cool, and Maria, my friend, said I needed
to really "wind it out" and "give it hell" when shifting gears, and that
would help the engine to run cooler. So Tuesady afternoon, it was fairly
hot, and I took my rig out to run errands, and I wound it up good before
shifting. The dipstick sensor light never lit up. I need to try this a few
more times before passing final judgment, but so far it seemed to work for
around town driving. Now I am wondering about the open road.
