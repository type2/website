Subject: fuel vent system.. remove? NO

"If that's the case.. pardon me for a second if I try
to re-invent the process. Would it be a BAD idea to
completely get rid of all of that  stuff.."
----------------------------------------------------
---Yes it would be a bad idea.
These lines allow for expansion of vapor.. I.E. Hot
day.. fill with cool/cold gas from an under ground
tank. Cool gas hits hot environment and expands. It
has to have someplace to go other than back out the
filler neck. :-(
  The lines run out and up into the vent area so that
when you are runnen down the road the vapor goes up
and
gets cooled then runs down as liquid back into the
tank.
  When the small splice on my lines went bad I noticed
it because I had just filled up and stoped to talk to
a
guy who had just pulled up in a Splitty... when I
turned
around there was a pool of liquid under DAS bus (not
big
but enough to notice) I popped the lid and the area
behind the driver's side tail light was swimming with
gas! I didnt know about the splice at the time but it
was obvious where the gas had come from and thats
when I found it. Sooooo the short is if there was
enough
pressure in the tank from gas expansion to push it
that far along the tube I would hate to think what
would happen if the system were removed and blocked.

my 2 cents....
