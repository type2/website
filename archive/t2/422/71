Subject: Re: [T2] 86 Syncro - water leak

Hello Guys    Lets see if I can help here being both and Airhead type2 and a 
Waterboxer  also one who works on these just about everyday. Be careful 
retorqueing the heads the nuts have sealant under them and can leak after torquing  
Also in torquing these you do not use a click torque wrench but the old stlye 
beam wrench as the nut will continue to turn cause of the sealant . Also if it 
is the heads don't let the jugs come off if at all possible. This will make 
the job way easier. But be before doing anything take to a car wash and clean 
carefully watching out for dizzyand alt. Then if possible get up ona lift and 
raeally check it for where the leaks are.  These motors are pretty tough just 
don't do stupid things to them,overheat,run low on oil ETC  My synco has 325K 
on it , It still has a way to go before catching my 66 Westy(The Ghoost)  with 
375K on it.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service Salem Va
