I had an engine like that. Was painted gold at one point too I think.

Linebore was off center and it ran HOT. Eventually one of the rods started 
hammering on the big end and that ruined the crank. We just drove it until 
it practically self-destructed and then replaced it. Still got the car in 
the barn.

I think these engines were catalog rebuilds (purchase the longblock from 
the catalog).  Mine was the recipient (victim?) of several thousands of 
dollars of JC Whitney Taiwanese junk that all failed soon after I got the 
car. Within 6 months of purchasing the car it looked like a refugee from 
the junkyard. Collision and rust free but the paint failed, the interior 
failed, engine failed. I didn't care though. Fun car. I think the engine I 
had was purchased by the previous owner through the catalog.
