Subject: engine/auto trans/etc. F/S

Hello List,

In order to free up some garage space and help fund the
body/engine work for my Westy, I'm looking to sell some
spares I have laying around and I thought I'd post it here
before I do elsewhere.

I have:
1)a complete 2.0L and auto transmission from a 79, with all
FI bits atatched, and any of the associated Auto Trans
parts that would be left over after converting to Manual
(which is what i did; ie, shift linkage, gas pedal, ecu etc.)
Motor has a burnt valve on #3 Cyl, and transmission has
a leak (torque converter seal) but other wise worked fine
before being removed.

2)another 2.0L, but minus the p/c and heads.....

All offers considered.

I'm in Philadelphia, PA and would rather not ship the
items.

Also, If anyone has any leads on a cheap but running 2.0L
for sale in my area that I can throw in my bus while I
rebuild my engine, drop me a line.

Please reply off-list with any questions etc.

Thanks.
