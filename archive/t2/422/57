Subject: airhead to water head questions

Well, I couldn't pass it up, I blew a rod in my 71 Westy and then my friends 
86 syncro became available with needed work 129,000. Arizona vehicle for most 
of it's life. I'll be seeking lot's of advice, I am mechanically inclined but 
not so much with the 2.1 engines etc.

I have an apt next week with a bus mechanic to go over it and tell me the 
much needed repairs that I plan to do myself.

Obvious ... leaking anti freeze but doesn't seem to becoming from the heads, 
seems to be dripping from the left side next tomiddle above a large screw in 
the bottom of the block.

Pipe before the catalytic convertor is shot, can I just replace this pipe, I 
wonder if it's rusted into the catalytic converter.

Bad idle, fluctuates and sometimes bus lacks power from allow speed start.

I drove behind this bus yesterday fro about 2hrs, never saw smoke, cruised 
along nicely at 75. Once a while I could see it spot some water though.

The protection bar looks like a pain in the butt, in the way of everything? 
I'm assuming it needs to be dropped to do most repairs from underneath.

I'm in search of an official VW manual for it, anyone have a used one.

I have the entire history on the vehicle too.

Any other advice?
Adjust valves, torque heads, what about fuel injection....that scares me, 
what's good maintenance for it?

Thanks for listening I'll be back intown on Monday please feel free to 
respond at my email audiblea(-at-)aol.com

Thanks,
