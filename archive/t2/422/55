 I always figured it was to keep oil from running out of the front
 pushrod tubes, but I've never tried pulling the valve covers with
 the back end of the car in the air to see if that happens.

if you have the car on a slant the oil pours out of the low side head.  I 
found this out one day doing (or trying to do) a valve adjustemnet on teh street, 
and the drive walk side was lower.   Popped off the vavle cover, 
and............. Niagara Falls!

dunno if that is related.   If you have a lift and raise the car up it's 
easier, no lying down.
