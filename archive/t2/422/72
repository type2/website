Subject: Renting a bus

Hello all

I am looking for any info on renting a bus in the Las Vegas area. I have
searched the web but couldnt find anything around that area. Some friends and
I are planning a trip to Zion National Park for backpacking and hiking the
first week of October. I found the site for California Campers that rents
Westfalia's and thought that there might be something like that in Nevada. Any
locals of this area have any tips or info on this? I also thought that one of
the big rental car companies may rent Westies but would rather go with a
smaller company that specialized in VW campers first.

Thanks for any help.
