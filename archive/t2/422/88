Subject: RE: [T2] Driving a bus

I've got a 76 manual transmission.  My owners manual gives some
pretty high mph references but clearly states which ones will give
you the best fuel economy vs. accelleration.  It also states that
there is a governor that will keep you from damaging the bus if you
take it up too high in the working of the gears.  I am currently
sitting on my duff at work, so I don't have this material in front
of me atm, BUT I think it's something like this:
Economy:
1st gear  1-15
2nd gear  10-25
3rd gear  20-43
4th gear  35- and up

Werkin' it:
1st gear  1-20
2nd gear  17-27
3rd gear  25-50
4th gear  48- and up

If I remember right, running the late type4 motor up that high in a
bus will give you great accelleration but you really feel it drop
off as you take your foot off of the accellerator....  and your gas
mileage will take a major header.  I try not to run mine that as
high as that.  Usually I do this:
1st gear 1-15
2nd gear 15-25
3rd gear 25- 45
4th gear 45 and up

Occassionally I will exceed this but I start to see the man at the
fuel pump more often when I do, although it is nice to know that I
can get my bus moving at a good clip in a relatively short amount of
time as I merge into traffic or climb steep hills.  I typically
prefer to drive in 3rd on super steep hills maintaining about 45
mph,.. gradual hills can be handled in 4th without a problem at any
speed that I choose, for both buses.
