Chris,
I have always pressure washed the engine--top and bottom prior to do any
work " down under" on anything---

I spray the engine/ trans down with diesel fuel--let it sit 15 minutes
and hit it with my hot water pressure washer---sqeaky clean.

If for nothing else just to keep the garbage out of my eye's--
Makes the job a bunch cleaner---

Later,

Terry

For you folks that do engine disassembly in the vehicle - how do you
keep the dirt out? I'm always knocking dirt off of the bottom of the
vehicle when I work underneath and would hate to get it into the engine.
For that reason anything major (heads, pistons, whatever) the engine
comes out.
