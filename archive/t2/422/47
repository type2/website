Correct Scott---on the sodium filled valves.

And they allegedly are supposed to run cooler--and are supposed to be
tougher--
along with hardened seats---this is the hot ticket---or titanium valves
with the hardened seats are the big dollar solution to valve train
longevity-----but not too many will drop the bucks for the ultimate
answer to long valve train life.

And both would also benefit with a bit of an oil bath as they function
to help keep the temps down--as would stock valve gear.

Lubrication is alays a good thing--especially in an air cooled engine--

Sodium, or Titanium valves aren't necessarily goig to make the valves
run any cooler---
the sodium is inside the valve. this is completely different than making
the valve from a different alloy. basically the valve is cored out and
filled with salt. the salt (sodium) does not retain heat as much as
solid metal would. that is theory, anyhow.
