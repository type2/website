Subject: Re: [T2] 86 Syncro - water leak

For you folks that do engine disassembly in the vehicle - how do you keep 
the dirt out? I'm always knocking dirt off of the bottom of the vehicle 
when I work underneath and would hate to get it into the engine.

For that reason anything major (heads, pistons, whatever) the engine comes 
out.
