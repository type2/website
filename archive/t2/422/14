Subject: Trip & Engine Update

Hi Folks,

Just got back from my 2 week roadtrip in Pumpkin II. Went from San Diego up
the coast to Monterrey, spending a week between Santa Barbara and Big Sur
followed by a week in Modesto (in-laws). Great bus route...slower roads,
awesome scenery, and good camping spots.

The AVP rebuild now has 2400 miles, and seems to be doing fine:

- Some decrease in valve clearance following the hills on the coast. I
assume this normal early in the engine life.

- Oil Temps got to 220-230 cruising on two-lanes in the San Jaquin valley
(95+ air temp)

- Oil got above 240 halfway up the steep part of the grapevine on I-5 north
of LA. I shut down for 30 minutes, then finished the climb with no trouble.
Next time I'll plan on doing big mountains early AM or in the evening, at
least in July.

- I did have a significant fuel leak from one of the fuel tank vent line
hoses. I overfilled the tank, and the gas started running out of the
connector hose in the left air scoop. I noticed it and fixed it prior to
starting the engine, otherwise it would have caught fire for sure. I'm going
to refrain from topping the tank off until I can get to all the other little
vent connectors.
