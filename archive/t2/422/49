Oh and did I mention all of the cool (not so cool) chrome tin on the 
engine? Chrome cylinder tin, chrome fan shroud (no vanes inside), etc. etc.

None of it fit together right until I did some work on it with a hacksaw so 
the bolts and washers would pull it together tighter.

JUNK! JUNK! JUNK I tell you! <grin>

Chrome makes it go faster - right?
