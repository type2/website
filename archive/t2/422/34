What year bus do you have ?

Through my various trials I have learnt enough that I would recommend 
checking your points FIRST. Whip out the ol' feeler and check it out. 
ON my 73 I can pop the distributor cap off and manage to adjust the gap 
without pulling the dizzy out, so I would have a peek and see if that 
works for you. One way or another its a pretty easy job and worth it 
before buying a new condenser.
