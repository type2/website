Subject: Re: [T2] no wonder it won't start!  almost no spark at all! 

> I put the battery on the charger to get better cranking
 while testing, and turned th key on...than I used the
 remote starter and checked spark from the coil
 wire.....almost nothing at all!  tried a spare coil and get
 same results...any suggestions? I shluld know this answer,
 but my mind in blank right now as I have not been eating
 today!  ;-(  dang it! gotta eat some dinner and see what
 y'all ahve to suggest....bad condenser?? points?
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dirty points = low voltage
Low voltage on the primary side = low voltage on the secondary side
Got a voltmeter?  See what your voltage is going into the coil.
Disconnect the green condensor lead and see what the voltage is on the output side of the coil.
Connect the green lead and see what the voltage is with the points open.
