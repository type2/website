Okay that sounds like a problem.  I have a fan on the radiator of my Mustang that draws 21 amps continuously.  It moves something like 2800cfm of air, and if you stand behind it, it's like being in a hurricane.  It will straighten your hair, it's so strong.  I would check the current draw of those blower motors immediately - if they are really drawing 45 amps, there is something seriously wrong.

Haven't measured it, but I would guess no more than 10 amps.  Fuel injectors don't take much current, the ignition takes considerably more.
