Sodium, or Titanium valves aren't necessarily goig to make the valves
run any cooler---
They are tougher--but what is going to make them run cooler????
One thing---
Lubrication.
Petrolis Maximus.
And this is where a pint of Marvel in the Gas will help in the cooling,
and longevity department.

My 6 cents--

Hmm... I know that I have a 1.8. It's a GEX rebuild. It also has
hydraulic lifters too.
when i said AW i meant stock from the factory in that series of case.
who knows what rebuilders do, most of the motors around these days have
been rebuilt at least once.
i doubt any volume rebuilder like GEX would use sodium valves due to
them costing so much more that standard valves.
