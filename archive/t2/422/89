Subject: Buses Of the Corn Reminder

Hi Volks,

It's Friday again, so I'm shamelessly plugging Buses of the Corn once 
again.

There's just 3 weeks to go before the gates open in Whitby, Ontario for 
Buses Of the Corn 2003. There are now over thirty buses registered 
coming in from all points of the compass, and I'm really looking 
forward to it. There is room for plenty more, so come on out!

GermanSupply.com has generously sponsored the camping fees, and has 
also donated a brand-new VDO Cylinder Head Temp gauge kit to the 
door-prize pile. I also got some cool stickers in the mail last week 
from both "Save The Bays" and the Full Moon Bus Club which will be 
given away, and more is sure to come!

There's so much going on, how can you possibly miss out on:

- Tie-Dye workshop - Bring your own T-shirt, Bellbottoms, curtains or 
tablecloth, and make your own art!
- The Full Moon Bus Club's Breakfast Burritos - Sign-up sheet going 
online soon
- Bus Camping competition
- 9-hole Frisbee Golf course
- Bus Driving competition
- Kids water-balloon fight & Scavenger hunt
- Corn-Roast / Pot Luck Dinner
- The Great Canadian Bug show, happening Sunday in Mississauga, Ontario

If you need more info or you're interested in coming out, please drop 
me an email. Visit our website for more information:

Happy trails,

P.S. - Buses Of the Corn is a non-profit event. Any funds left over 
after the event will be donated to type2.com.
