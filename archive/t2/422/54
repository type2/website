Subject: T connector on fuel condensation/vent line

""Does anybody know what that T connector in that
diagram labeled as 15A is called?  or the VW part
number for it maybe?  I've got two buses of thesame
year and that part is cracking on both.  Kinda want to
keep my engine compartment free of gasoline/petrol,
dripping down on top of a hot type 4 motor...""
-----------------------------
I never could find that T connector and couldnt locate
a T fitting that worked. I ran a hose from each
steel line back to the air filter intake and inserted
them into the air intake so that the fumes are inhaled
by the carbs... I have never observed gas
dripping from the tubes this far down line. So the
fumes are sucked into the carbs eliminating the gas
smell in the engine compartment.
    BTW if you look at the diagram the single hose
coming off the "T" goes to the air filter box anyway.

Any constructive criticism on this work around is
welcome!
