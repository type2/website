Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Lines

thats what i was thinking but wasnt sure...
so what would be the ebst way to cap the spare line off...
right now it has a piece of gas line from it and a bolt stuck in the end with a little something of valve gasket in it.. and i wrapped some duct tape around it..
i want to replace it and cap it off if there isnt going to be a use for it anymore,...

suggestion on the best way to do so..
