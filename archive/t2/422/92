Subject: Re: [T2] how long should it take to install a front beam?

I just recently had some problems with my beam. The shops that I called all
quoted it to be about a 10-12 hr job. It isnt a real technical job but there
are alot of things that need to be R&R'd. They said it would cost around
$600-$800 depending on if I already had the beam or not.

mechanic in a shop (and possibly one helper) to build up a stripped beam and
install it?
