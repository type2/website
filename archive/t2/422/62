Now if you are going to jack it up a a great slant I can see a problem, but on
trucks and busses I have owned I never had much seepage. I always place a rag
over the top of the heat echanger before I pop the valve cover and then
another to dap at the minute run off. On a bug or T-3 that would be a
different story because they are lower and you have to jack them up at a
steeper slant to get the same height you get on a bus.

 I always figured it was to keep oil from running out of the front
 pushrod tubes, but I've never tried pulling the valve covers with
 the back end of the car in the air to see if that happens.

if you have the car on a slant the oil pours out of the low side head.  I
found this out one day doing (or trying to do) a valve adjustemnet on teh
street,
and the drive walk side was lower.   Popped off the vavle cover,
and............. Niagara Falls!
