Subject: instalation of side louverd windows.

I need some input on how to get the side louvered windows re-installed. I have
pushed pulled pried slid,wedged etc and I can seem to get the new (Bus Depot)v
seal to collapse enough to set correctly.I have even sprayed the rubber seal
with silicone to lubricate it enough to "slide" back in (NO LUCK). I am sure
it has nothing to do with the seal just the installer. Please provide any and
all suggestions.
