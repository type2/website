Holy Moly!

I phoned in my Bus Depot order around noon yesterday, they told me
they didn't have the parts in their warehouse but... UPS just arrived
with my parts. I am in New York so that probably plays a role.
Definitely phone in your order, ask for expedited shipping, speeds
things up majorly over web ordering.

Kudos to Bus Depot!
