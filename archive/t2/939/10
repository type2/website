Subject: Re: [T2] What would you do?

Do you know if I would be able to use my 77 interior stuff on the 72?  I 
know that there is no electrical hookup on the 72 (or water?).  Would it 
be difficult to add these things?  I'd be stoked if I could find a 77-79 
with good body and transmission with crapped out motor and rough 
interior near me  That would be perfect.
