Large holes indeed.  There seem to be a lot more transporters than 
campers available.  I would really like to end up with a pop top 
camper.  Since my bus is an auto, I'm assuming that I'll want something 
that has a good body and good transmission (standard or automatic).  If 
I end up getting another bus with the standard then I'll just sell the 
auto transmission, keep the engine and anything else?  A big problem 
that I have is the amount of space available.  I could theoretically 
take over a large corner of the garage to store parts, but holding onto 
two buses for any extended period of time would be difficult to say the 
least.

I will def keep my eyes on craigslist, samba, and ebay.  those have been 
my main sources in the past.

I like hearing that.
