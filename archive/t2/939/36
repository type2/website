Subject: VW Splitty "big" model toy

While shopping yesterday, saw a 1:10 scale VW splitty, that was RC and had the
blank windows on the top.  It was a good representation, and had a "Boom Box",
installed in it, as well as "big wheels and tires"  Was on sale for
65Canadian, and there also was a nice, same scale older Beetle, same motif.
Both looked neat.
