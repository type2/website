Subject: Re: [T2] Continental Vanco Winter

I don't know anything about the Conti Vanco winter folks but I will
  say this, the Vanco Contact and Vanco 4-season I've tried in the
  last 5 years for my dad's EV, to replace the Agilis that lasted a whopping
  30k miles.  Both Vanco tires were worn bald in 20k miles, this is
  with meticulous rotation and attention to air pressure.  Evenly bald
  but bald.  Current set of Nokian NRC2's going on 30k and look new,
  grip wonderfull.  I've long hated the Agilis cause it replaced a good
  tire from Michelin, and I am equally or more dismayed at Conti's
  current offerings (the Contact BTW made in Korea I believe, I don't
  recall but it was a far east location on the tire.)  Just my experience.
  Nokian snows BTW (the NRC2 is all season THOUGH IS severe service
  snow rated as well) are pretty pricey but are available in proper load
  range for all T2, T3, T4 era transporters.  Cost a bit more, but ever so
  worth it.  The NRC2 is an excellent true "4 season" choice if you
  live in a local like mine (WV) and get some snow for a couple of
  months but don't drive in it everyday.
