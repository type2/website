Subject: Which Piston rings?

Anyone know what's up with Bus Depot? I've sent a few emails now and they all 
return with...

Warning: message still undelivered after 4 hours
Will keep trying until message is 5 days old



I need to order some parts and have them delivered between Christmas and New 
Years, but there are three choices of piston rings (without a lot of detail 
about any of them). I and am hoping to get an answer so I can get the order 
in as soon as possible...

Can anyone else shed some light on which rings I need? Thanks.


My engine:
1973, 1700 cc, dual carb, automatic
pistons are standard (imprinted with 9706)

On Busdepot webite, here are the three choices:

Also, does the gasket kit include the flywheel o-ring?
