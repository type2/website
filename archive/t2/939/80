Subject: Re: [T2] What would you do?

I have  just replaced all the back area from the marker lights down on  a 78 
westy plus the lower 6" quarter area in front of the back wheels. 
 
When it was first brought in you would have thought parts bus but know that  
the welding is done it looks great. 
 
Don't give up on a bus because of "Major Rust" ,  It sounds like your  77 has 
the normal rust for this area. We have to deal with replacing the battery  
tray and the outer body area near it, both sides for westy's and always the  
area under the windshield.
 
Pictures would help when asking questions to do with body work.  :o)

I'd rather spend my money on my rusted OS then some  new  suv.
