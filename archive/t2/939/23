Subject: Turn Signal Stalk

Anybody have any good diagrams or photos out there of what goes on
inside the turnsignal switch mechanism for a 78?

On the way home from our company xmas party last night the stalk just
went limp. It flops around now and does nothing. So I'd like a visual
of what I'm getting into before I take things apart.
