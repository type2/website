Subject: Fwd: [T2] Stubborn Flywheel

hmm..ok, I have tried rocking it out with two screwdrivers (protecting the
case with wood). But it's quite stubborn that is for sure
that old motor is serious damaged I think, I can rock the flywheel quite a
bit, but it's not moving on the dowels.

Will tinker some more with it :)

(PS. leaving the gland nut on is a good idea heh)
