By "major cancer" I take it to mean there are large holes, or perhaps 
nothing below the side lights.  I would not put much work into such a 
bus - there are plenty of rust-free busses available as donors if you 
are patient.  The best place to find these busses is... CRAIGSLIST. 
Look at Austin, San Antonio, D/FW and Houston.  Thesamba is also good. 
A quick search came up with these that are close to what you want:

If you expanded your search to a 500 mile radius, I bet you would find a 
few more.

Sounds like a great donor bus.

If you are serious and willing to put in a significant amount of time 
and effort, you should be able to come out of it with a clean running 
bus, a boatload of spare parts and $1,000.
