Hi All, 

Made progress on my '77 bus's motor last night.  

Got the new heads put on, the valvetrain installed. Pushrods always seem
to fall out of the lifters in the time it takes to pick up the rockers
and get them in place.  Adjusted the valves and installed the new SVDA
dizzy.  I *think* the dizzy is in right.  I'll check with the fuel
injectors unplugged (no backfire through the AFM that way) and a timing
light before I try starting it up.  

New pushrod tube seals, lots of new seals and gaskets, etc.  Don't want
to have to do this again anytime soon.   

What's the recommended number of miles before I pull the rockers and
engine tin to re-torque the heads?  

I used anti-sieze and lock washers on the upper head bolts, because when
I removed them, I was worried they were going to back the studs out of
the block.  

Still waiting on some parts before I can continue, but I'm pretty much
down to sticking the engine tins, fan shroud & fan, and intake back on.
Tracking down the necessary parts this close to the holidays can be a
PITA, though.  And there's no way I'll have it ready to go to Daytona by
the weekend.  Poo. :/  

I love how it all goes together like a big Tinker Toy.  Though after 3
hours of working, my hands (arthritis *SUCKS*) were killing me.  Not too
horrible this morning, mostly just stiff.  When I got done last night I
tossed back a beer and admired my handiwork.  

Have a great holiday everybody!  Hope ya get what ya want for
Christmas! 
(I want the necessary parts to put my bus back together!)
