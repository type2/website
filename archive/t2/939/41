Hi Richard, I was trying to buy the Garmin 330 which has an internal drive, but my local supplier kept postponing it's delivery date, to the point I just cancelled it. I really liked it, but the 320 doesn't have the locked in HD, instead it uses SD cards, and you can load other things onto it. 
I ended up getting the Lowrance Iway 250C instead, and am really happey I did. It was cheaper, but has the same color touchscreen, around 2.5" square. It is like the Garmin 320, it uses SD cards, but in my opinion is better. The Garmins don't allow waypoints along the way, you have to "stitch" shorter trips together. It also will not tell you the long. and lat. like the Lowrance does. I am REALLY happy I couldn't buy the Garmin, because I stumbled upon the Lowrance 250C which does more in my humble opinion. Check one of those out before you buy a Garmin, or compare the two side by side at http://www.gpscity.ca/
I have had mine for 10 days now, and love it.
HTH,
Courtney

 I was shopping over the weekend and came across a specialty store 
 selling Garmin GPS devices. They've come a long way since I last 
 looked at them a few years ago finally offering pleasant color 
 touch screens.
 
Does anyone have any experience with them to share?
