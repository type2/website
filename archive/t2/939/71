Well, I made it home. Even after a plow goes by there's still several
inches of snow on the ground from the wind blowing it right back. I
saw lots of 2wd cars on the side of the road... Even an idiot trying
to drive a Miata in this weather.

There was over 2 feet of snow drifted in the parking lot in my
apartments. I made it mostly into a space. heh
