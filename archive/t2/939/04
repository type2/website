as to the Auto tranny, the bodies are indeed different and are not
interchangable without significant work including some welding of parts.

the auto tranny if good is worth a fair amount (I would make an offer if I
were closer to Texas)  also you would have to swap the flex plate for a
flywheel to use the engine in a manual and would also need to reset the
end play.

a good 010 auto tranny is worth a few bucks.

well selling some things like the auto tranny could increase the amount of
money you have.

auto tranny buses were 5-10% of buses sold in the USA
