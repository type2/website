I can't answer the question about adequate heat... but I can add some info 
if you go ahead with an experiment.. 

Every foot of line,, every connection,, every bend that is in the new oil 
cooler circuit adds to pressure drop. 

If you have too much pressure drop in that circuit.. the bearings will not 
get adequate oil. 

To ensure you don't have this problem... 

Put an oil pressure gauge where the oil re-enters the engine block.
Use large internal diameter lines.. like 20mm i.d.
Use very large fittings,, and if you can.. drill them out so they have a 
large i.d.
Make sure the cooler has many pass 

The offroad folks use remote oil coolers and remote oil filters... some of 
them like to change the engines between races... so they use something like 
an air line quick disconnect to couple the engine to the body lines.
I have seen them use 30mm fittings there .. as the internal restriction is 
great. 

You can ask the fitting suppliers the flow ,,,, ie.. the volume of oil at 
30psi that can pass thru ...  then match that to the pump your using. 

I used remote oil cooler to cool the engine,, not heat the inside..  I 
mounted it on the roof scoop and it had about 6 or 7 meters of hose, 4 
fittings , and the cooler.   You do see significant pressure drop if you 
don't open the lines up to at least 13mm  i.d. 

Hope that helps
