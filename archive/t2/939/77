  i am trying to stay in contact with those that like to camp and turn wrenches from time to time with other moonies. i didnt get emails but we did send many pm's back and forth my mistake not getting emails.
   
  seems the fullmoonbusclub site has went down again and i cant just bling someone cause i see there name and location and we get up to camp or again turn wrenches or share a brew or two.
   
  anyone got a calendar for upcoming events ?
