Subject: Needed 1500 cc pistons and cylinders

Need at least two NEW 83mm (82,96 ideal) 1500 P&C's, prefer German,
  but I'll consider anything if truly a 1500 set.  No joke I only really need two
  and I'll take one if someone has it laying around.  I will give fair price for
  make, quantity, and condition.  Will trade something as well, lots of T4
  engine parts available, also loads of waterboxer, EV, who knows if you got
  the P&C's ask I might have what you want.
   
  Thanks
