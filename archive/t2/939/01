Hi Lee,

I've seen some great deals in AZ.... they get posted to the type2  
list all the time. I would think that a rust-free New Mexico shell  
would be OK... I had a bus from NM recently that was in much better  
shape than a typical Eastern bus. Rent a tow dolly and go fetch;  
that's how I did it. It's a weekend to remember, that's for sure.

You'll be better off keeping your bus and parting it out rather than  
selling it as a crumpled rustbucket... a smart potential buyer is  
going to know that it needs major work and will be better off to keep  
looking, same as you are. Cherry pick the best bits, sell what you  
don't need on eBay or at local swap meets (if you have any) and you  
will probably find that you can break even on the migration to the  
new chassis... or at least come in at a much lower price than you  
would pay for a restoration.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
