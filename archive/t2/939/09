Forgot to update my AIR's entry.

Darrell's located at
Robertson Import Parts & Service
3722 Wrightsboro Road
Augusta, GA 30909
Phone: 706-860-2599

His backyard is something like 5-6 acres of VW's packed in like sardines. 
You wouldn't think you could hide that much behind a six foot fence.  I 
guess the natural slope of the land helps.

I'm taking Gertie over there soon to have him help me to sort out a starting 
problem.  He did an engine replacement for me last year (or the last year 
before that... hmm... can't remember...).

DOT's getting ready to widen the road along there and Darrell's planning a 
move to the 3900 block.  New shop, etc.  Ought to be nice.
