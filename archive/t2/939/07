Lee,
What would I do?

I'd shoot myself for leaving it sit too long.

Next thing I would do is either sell it for next to nothing, because of
it's condition     ( it might be close to Ok -I'm just going by your
description ) or repair it--and keep it around just for grins.

You'll drop some bucks--no doubt in my mind--but they are kinda neat
toys.

Good luck making this decision.
