Easier. Automatic transmission. Idiots on the road. Easier.

The Guac goes out in the snow all the time. But rowing gears while
dodging sliding idiots and trying to keep myself from sliding takes
lots of concentration.

The Exploder's full time AWD works flawlessly and lets me focus on the
idiots instead of the vehicle.

The Guac goes out this weekend for our traditional Christmas lights drive.
