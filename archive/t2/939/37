Yeah, these are the Maisto "GRidez" Series.  They're literally flying of the
shelves here at the local Target for $49.95, but I've heard it reported that
Target Online is selling 'em for as low as $41.  They've been available for
about 2 months now.

The Candy Metallic Blue Bus seems to be more common than the Candy Metallic
Purple w/Graphics, so if you see a purple one, grab it.  I figured, what
they hey, I got one of each for the collection, plus another for playing
around with.
