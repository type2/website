Subject: RE: [T2] Driving the bus in snow

My parents used to drive their 1963 split and later 68 bay in all kinds
of evil Midwestern snow and ice.  Never had a problem with it.  Real,
skinny snow tires are necessary, and back then we always studded them as
soon as the law allowed.

My experience with winter driving in Pennsylvania, which is much milder
but more prone to icing, is that even a little bit of ice on a hill will
spell disaster if you don't have chains/studs all around.  The buses
like to slide front-first on slick hills.

Either way, it looks like "traction enhancement" is the order of the
day.  But then you'll have no troubles at all.

The CHP will require chains if the roads have even a flake on 'em. I
used to live in Big Bear. Sucked how strict the cops got.

Even though I've been driving the Exploder during this "Holiday
Blizzard of '06" here in Colorado, the bus would have been fine as
well. Your tires will tell the tale.

"All Season" means jack. IIRC, you just have to have a certain amount
of space between the tread lugs and a certain depth to get that
rating. So they could be next to useless unless there's powder on the
ground.

If you've got good tread, and cary chains (or cables), you'll be fine.
Rear engine/rear drive vehicles kick butt in snow. There's a reason
Baja Bugs do so well in soft sand...
