Subject: Re: [T2] City/Battery aux. battery panel

Doug asked:

 Does anyone know of a source for the switches on the fridge control panel, battery charger panel or whatever
it's actually called? The power switch on mine a pretty much frozen. I can use the fridge but the power on/off
switch is really stuck. So rather than risk breaking it I just leave it on city power so it doesn't drain the
auxiliary battery. Not a big deal yet but I'd like to replace the switches or the whole panel ideally since
the charger doesn't work, but have had no luck so far on The Samba or the Bus Co.

I have an extra panel.  The plastic charge gauge has a crack in it but the rest of it is good.
