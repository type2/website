I think that would work well for centering it.  Kinda like how you true 
a bicycle wheel.

doubt that.  Since you have moved the fan relative to the rest of the 
pully, it is probably out of balance.

Once you get it back together, bring it to a machine shop and have them 
balance it.  Should cost you a whole 15 bux or something around there.

Wouldn't do that because you'd end up spending money for the part and 
then cost you money to have it balanced, which you should do regardless, 
including any other parts that spin real fast.

That would work as well ;)

It's all good.  At least you learn from it...
