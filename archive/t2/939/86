Someone was making locking and limited slip gearing for our trannys. I
drooled when I saw the site last year.

The snow was too high even for the Exploder to get out. I decided to
dig out the X instead of the bus, and I'm glad. Some of the roads to
work were unplowed. The bus would have made it eventually, but the X
did it easier and warmer.
