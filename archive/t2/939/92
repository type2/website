Subject: Re: [T2] Driving the bus in snow

The CHP will require chains if the roads have even a flake on 'em. I
used to live in Big Bear. Sucked how strict the cops got.

Even though I've been driving the Exploder during this "Holiday
Blizzard of '06" here in Colorado, the bus would have been fine as
well. Your tires will tell the tale.

"All Season" means jack. IIRC, you just have to have a certain amount
of space between the tread lugs and a certain depth to get that
rating. So they could be next to useless unless there's powder on the
ground.

If you've got good tread, and cary chains (or cables), you'll be fine.
Rear engine/rear drive vehicles kick butt in snow. There's a reason
Baja Bugs do so well in soft sand...
