Hi All,

In a moment of monumental ignorance (not stupidity, I just didn't know 
any better...

I [gasp] Disassembled the cooling fan/pulley to sandblast and paint 'em. 

Bentley doesn't say anything about *not* taking it apart. 

Poo.  

Now, I understand that the pulley needs centered precisely on the fan.  
I also understand that it all is balanced. 

Mkay.  My options -

Option #1.
Reassemble it the same as it came apart.  Mount the fan/pulley on the 
crank, set up a dial indicator, and "nudge" the pulley with a light 
plastic hammer until it's running true.  Then remove the fan/pulley from 
the crank and torque the 4 bolts down. Since I haven't changed anything, 
the balance should be unaffected.  (actually, it should be *better* 
balanced, since I removed lots of black crud from the blades).  Where on 
the pulley should I set the dial indicator to ride on?  What's the 
maximum allowable runout?

Option #2.
Buy another fan/pulley from the friendly local VW guy, clean it up and 
call it good. 

Option #3. 
Send the fan/pulley off to a race shop to be put back together and 
balanced all over again. 


No matter what, I made a mental note (burned in with a soldering iron), 
"Do Not Disassemble The Cooling Fan/Pulley!"


Thanks!

Shad H.
