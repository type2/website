Subject: Re: [T2] Which Piston rings?

The correct rings for the 1700 would be

http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=021198175 - Original German Ring
Set for 1700 (021 198 175)
OR
http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=021198175G - Grant mfr'd Ring Set
for 1700 (021 198 175 G).  I've used Grant dozens of times over the years
with no problems (YMMV).

The other listing is for rings on the "Big Bore" Performance Piston Sets
using 96mm pistons.

The O-Ring does come with the Gasket set, but the crank seals do not.
Order them separately. Order the following:

http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=021198009B = Engine Gasket Set
(021 198 009 B)

http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=021105247A = Crank Pulley Seal
(021 105 247 A)

http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=029105245B = Flywheel Seal (029
105 245 B)

What with the Holiday madness of ordering & shipping items, I would have
ordered this stuff long ago, not now, to make it for between Christmas & New
Years.  Break down and telephone them (or someone else), don't depend on the
internet to get yer stuff to you in the time frame you want.  As an example,
Bus Deport most likely doesn't have the rings on their shelf and probably
has them drop shipped from the supplier.  Ditto on the gasket set, just not
that much call on 1700 stuff these days.  Some of these outfits (not Bus
Deport, the suppliers) close up for the holidays, especially in years where
Xmas & New Years are a week apart vis a vis weekend to weekend.

Pick Up The Phone NOW and start ordering verbally from Bus Depot or CIP1.

Disclaimer:  I have no affiliation with Bus Depot or CIP1.
