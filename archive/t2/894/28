Subject: A/C Belts

The ongoing process of getting the A/C installed in my '72 Bus is nearing completion.  I have the compressor, the adapter, modified Vanagon Mounting Hardware and the behind the fan pully that replaces the spacer.

What I need to know is the VW part number and/or size of the belt that goes on the engine pully to the Vanagon double pully.  The belt that goes from the double pully to the compressor will have to be determined when the installation reaches that stage.
