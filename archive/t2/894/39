1. It will probably hold 500 pounds on a genuine Class III hitch on a
Suburban, but that sort of load will tear the hitch right off a bus,
unless you have a beefy custom hitch that extends forward along the
"frame" rails.  You will also have terminal sag with that much load on the
rear..

2. Anything you carry on the platform will get _dirty_!  An amazing amount
of debris gets kicked up behind a vehicle in motion.  I found this out
with my Dad's hitch-mounted wheelchair carrier.  We finally made a
tightly-fitting cover for the wheelchair so it would be presentable after
a 100 mile highway trip.

HTH, George
