Richard,
I think the key is to call the Cali number on the website
http://tinyurl.com/jfwnx and state that the can will be used "for
offroad use only." I was recently in wallymart and saw a whole shelf
of old style cans that were labeled "for offroad use only." I think a
different set of laws apply for farm, etc. use, but these are only
observations, not the result of research (feeling lazy).
FWIW, I cannot seem to get gas in my van ('79, bird's beak removed,
earlier elbow installed with fill restrictor plate) properly. What a
PITA. Vapor return won't mate up, can't get the gun far enough into
the filler neck to achieve full flow. Good thing that's not part of
the smog check.
