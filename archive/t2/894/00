Subject: Voltage Regulator Questions

Hello List,
I was wondering if anyone knew where an internal wiring schematic can be found for a Bosch, 14v,38 amp PN0190350063) voltage regulator . Also,what component is likely to fail on the unit?

Last year, I replaced the voltage regulator after at least 100k miles of use and the replacement unit failed this year after about 6k miles of touring. I am driving a 71 camper with a 1600 dp and stock generator. After taking the cover off the recently failed regulator, I see a small PC board that has a few discrete components mounted on it. Perhaps one of these discrete components failed? I was thinking of repairing this unit to use as a backup since for all appearances it looks new and having just come out of the box.

Yes, I did order a new voltage regulator and after installation am back on the road.

Thank you ,Joe
