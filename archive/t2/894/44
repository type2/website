Subject: Re: [T2] hitch receiver cargo shelf-any experience?

Drawbacks of a rear-mounted hitch tray / box:  Dirty,
wet, weight, and very very hot.  If you have an air
cooled engine, the cooling air will melt plastic. 
Lastly, the rear of a T2 is already very heavy.  My 78
is placarded to have 34 psi in front tires, and 44 psi
in the rear.  44 psi to counteract the excessive
weight.  Temperature-wise, an old bumper bike rack I
tried put the tires in the engine cooling air stream. 
On one long trip, the Rear bike tire popped, and the
front tire was shiny.  Which is why bike racks (like
the Fiamma model) specifically designed for T2's put
them way higher.
    
I would recommend against a rear-hitch mounted shelf. 
Is there a possibility of adding a roof top carrier,
or mounting the same tray / box to the FRONT of the
T2?  
   
I had the same `storage room` problem and solved it by
buying a very small trailer.
