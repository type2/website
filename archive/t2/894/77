So heres why : http://www.arb.ca.gov/pfc/facts/sep99_facts.htm
yeah.....I got bored.

Basically it looks like the states listed have adopted the CARB
(California Air Resources Board) guidelines for PFCs(Portable Fuel
Containers).

The nuts and bolts appear to be a problem with the spout that is
available for the wedco cans.  According to the CARB page, the nozzle
has to close automatically and prevent overfilling among other things.

Glad I live in Wa.....gonna have to order a can or two....the water
can is of interest as well.
