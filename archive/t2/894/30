Hey, all I want is road legal speeds for the commute and a few errands 
(less than 50 miles). The aircar sounds great!

Don't care to recharge each night. That's why I don't get the argument 
against electric cars. What's the problem? Don't need 350 miles and 2 
mins recharges, I need a city car with 100 mile range and overnight 
charging. I'll take an ICE to grandma's house over the mountains...
