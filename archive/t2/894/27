Probably not an American design though ... Looks exactly like the standard
military issue gas cans that have been around in Germany (I think east and
west) for decades ... Available in 5, 10, and 20 liters. Granted the German
version is olive-green and not red. Disadvantage is that it is almost
impossible to get the gas into your bus if you do not have the detachable
filler with you. Guess, how I know ...
