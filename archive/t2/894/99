Richard said:  "It's when both valves are closed. As the rotate the
engine clockwise from TDC you will notice the exhaust valve opening.
Rotate CCW and you'll see the intake open."

And just to make sure I haven't lost the basics, is it true that the engine
rotates CCW when it is running?? I mean, CCW from the fan end is CW from the
flywheel end - and the flywheel end is front.  My perspective is from
looking at the fan end and turning the alternator nut CCW, which turns the
engine in the same direction, CCW from the back and CW from the front views.


God, is it Monday all ready !?!?!??!
