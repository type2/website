I agree, its only really a problem when its running as when it sits,
there are no leaks(except from the oil dripping down from the tin)  I
may also be exaggerating on my oil losses.  More like a quart over the
last 3 tanks.  Theres enough oil dripping that I have little oil spots
on the back of the bus from the turbulence.  Either way, I am going to
attempt the replacement without pulling the motor as I don't really
have a suitable place to do that.  Then I will degrease the engine and
monitor the situation further.  Its a good engine and I would like to
make it last as long as possible.  At least theres lots of fresh oil
in there :-)
