Subject: hitch receiver cargo shelf-any experience?

We are considering a rear cargo shelf that slides into a 2" receiver 
hitch of a Rivers trailer hitch for the bay bus.  Any experience with 
this from bay owners?  Weight is a factor; we are interested in a 
polypro 500lb capacity one that is only 40 lbs to carry- vs 60 or more 
for metal ones.
The folding version is $144, nonfolding, $99, but sits lower-  This is 
56" long and would interfere with the tailights when folded (48" would 
be nicer), and the exhaust pipe position to the rear is a factor which 
the folding one would lift above?
