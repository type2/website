Subject: Pushrod tube seals

Well I have been chasing down an oil leak now for a while.   It hasn't
really gotten worse, but it hasn't gotten any better.

I replaced my oil breather seal thinking that might be the problem
(distributor seal is next), however I am pretty sure its my pushrod
tubes.

I took the tin off and did some poking around......sure enough there
were oil drips from the rounded section of the head right were the
pushrods are.

I am planning on replacing the pushrod seals, valvecover seals, and
distributor seal after I get back from a short trip next week (<600 mi
round trip).  I have read through the proceedure from the library and
it mentions not to get the VW parts but rather the porsche parts since
they are of higher quality.

I have checked out the usual suspects and I can't really see any
indication of which ones are which.  Most say best quality viton.
Does it really matter which ones I use?

Right now I am losing about a quart of oil every 2-400 miles.  So
while not an amount I can't keep ahead of, its more than I am
comfortable with since an oil covered engine tends to collect dirt
which affects cooling efficiency.
