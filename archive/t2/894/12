With all there down sides the New Rabbit isn't that bad. With all the car  
companies bringing back the old stuff it's only fitting. A couple examples  of 
bad VWoA is there lack of trucks and future Van ideas. Trucks are a very  
popular seller. Where is VW to fill that void???
 
Sorry forgot to sign.
