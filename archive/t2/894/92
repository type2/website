Well, I decided to park the Bopmobile in my neighbors back yard and  drive my Jag while I had family in for a reunion.  Now she's  taking revenge.  Started her normally.  Warmed her up running  just fine at low idle.  Then took her to the post office.   Got to a light and she started to die.  I gave her gas and she  wouldn't run unless I held it to the floor.  She died again and I  restarted her.  Ran fine until I got home and parked it.  I  let her run while I looked for a screwdriver.   Died  again.  Now I can hardly get her to run at all.  The air  filter is less than a year old but it does look pretty filthy.   The fuel pump is running fine and the filters on each side of it are  clear.  Ideas?
