Well, they could have contracted with GM for Corvair engines! :)

This isn't so far-fetched.  Remember that VW supplied Chrysler with
engines for the Omni around the same time.

I would assume that eating and drinking in motion are probably verboten in
Germany.  That Whopper and soda would be a bit of a distraction at
200km/h!

I dont think that VW considers the US all that important a market these
days.  Yes, they sell cars here, but we don't account for nearly the
proportion of VW's sales that we did in the '60s.  There is probably some
techie snobbery at work as well "Why should we modify our cars for US
tastes when their own cars are so screwed up?"  Heck, our local VW dealer,
in a SoCal bedroom community seems to make more money from used car sales
than from new VWs.  There's hardly a VW visible on the lot.
