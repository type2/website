Most if not all the buses or any VWs that I have worked on and owned do not  
lock the steering until the key has been removed. If the key is in the run  
position and then turned back it doesn't or shouldn't lock the steering. So next 
 time you are driving your bus and you come to a stop in your drive way. Turn 
the  key to the off position and see if the steering locks. Do not remove the 
key  just turn it back. This is for your benefit not mine. I own a VW shop. 
It's more  business for me.
