Subject: Re: [T2] Bay Windshield crack while washing

Possible something was behind the glass but, after 7 years you would think  
that would have happened years before now. My guess would be a small rock chip  
or hairline crack that was close to the rubber and the pressure of washing 
the  glass might have done that. For it to just break is not common at all. No 
real  answer just guesses. When you replace this one go over the metal and make 
sure  it's still level.
