I think with MB there is also a certain amount of "image keeping" in the
US market.  We don't seem to get the more "pedestrian" models that are
sold elsewhere.  MB seems to want to stay upscale in the US.

(my opinion, of course.  Karl, correct me if I am wrong.)

The same seems to apply to other makers.  Small station wagons from Japan?
Forget it, all the US gets is mini-SUVs  that sell for 50% more.
