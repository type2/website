I liked the "bugs".

Now for my movie review: boring!!! If you want to watch animated cars with eyes for windshields that's actually entertaining, watch the classic Tex Avery cartoon called "One Cab's Family":

There's also a WWII bomber version called "Little Johnny Jet" that was done the following year and is equally good if not a rip off of their own previous work.
