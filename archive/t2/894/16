Subject: Re: [T2] hitch receiver cargo shelf-any experience?

Harbor freight has these cheeep!  Take a look at their site.  I don't
think folding is the way to go...  If you get one that only hangs out a
coupla feet you should be able to access the back hatch and engine hatch
with no prob.  Remove it if you're not using it.  No biggie with the
receiver...

I'd think you'd want to limit your tongue weight.  I keep my total tow
weight <1000, and tongue weight about 100.  I've often wondered what the
tail weight factor is with one of these, seems it would be 1-1.  Doesn't
give you much poundage.  Put your popcorn there.  ;-)

Let us know what you decide.
