Subject: Re: [T2] Bay Windshield crack while washing - buying glass

This may be relevant, and everyone else may know this, but I found in  
buying glass that a new windshield from an on-line vendor was $200  
and shipping was $200.  I called Dominion autoglass, a local  
autoglass vendor, and the price was $190, including installation, and  
a new seal.
