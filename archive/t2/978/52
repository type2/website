Subject: 1974 Westfalia cushion dimension

I was able to find a local foam maker to make new foam for my Westfalia.
I had to choose from different grades of softness... I have found different 
methods of rating foam,, this company uses 2545 to rate this foam.. it is 
slightly "harder" than the Lady recommended.. but way softer than the grade 
I "thought" would be good.

Turns out to be perfect !  :-)   imho

For the archives,, the foam I got measured.. inches
25    x 46 x 2  upper bed
48    x 46 x 2  upper bed
48 x 35.5 x 2.5 over the engine , they cut it to the shape
18.5 x 54 x 3  seat
21    x 54 x 3  seat
