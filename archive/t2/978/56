Subject: Which interior/top is this?

We picked up a Champagne eidtion bus last night. First idea was to part it
out and use the engine/trans for Myonnie's '72. However, I am now thinking
that it may be better to swap the interior, top, and front beam from the '72
into the new bus.

Now I need to figure out whether that is really a good idea ... The '72 has
a large pop top that I have never seen before. I am not sure whether it
needs a sunroof body or whether I can simply cut a hole in the roof of the
'78.

The tag on the rear bench says that the interior is Westfalia 80. What is
this? I thought that their interior code always started with SO ... All that
remains is a full width rear seat with mustard vinyl cusions, overhead
cabinet and folding table. So what kind of top would this have come with
originally? My hunch is that it either had the small pop-top or was a
hardtop, but does anyone know for sure?

The top that is on the bus now has a faded sticker saying "Penthouse" and
"Andrews Indiana 46702". So, what does this top need? Do I need a sunroof
body or is a hole cut into the roof enough? I am hoping for the latter as I
have done that before ...
