	Sorry Heather, I'm not familiar with this system.  It 
certainly can't be as cheap as mine, and I make so bold as to hazard 
a guess that it doesn't work any better.  The proprietary WI systems 
I do know something of, J C Whitney & Holley, are IMHO inferior as 
they use transducers & pumps to push water in before the air-cleaner.


Heather then added:
>"Well-behaved women seldom make history." - Laurel Thatcher Ulrich

	Being as how it's still Friday in backward time-zones, let me 
mention that huge numbers of them have always done so  -  in the way 
lately resented by wimminsLibbers, viz. making possible the work 
visible in public life of famous men e.g  Churchill.
