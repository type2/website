Subject: Fwd: [T2] Accelerator Pump

Phil: Sorry, but I don't know how to remove the fitting, but here is 
some info based on a vague memory from a year ago when I had four 
34PICT-3 carbs on my bench: I believe there is a ball check valve 
inside that fitting. It's purpose is to insure that fuel travels from 
bowl to the accelerator pump diaphragm cavity,  but not the other 
way. I believe that if you shake the carb you should hear that ball 
moving around.
Perhaps someone more knowledgeable than I am can confirm/reject this.
Jack
