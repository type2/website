Subject: Exchange "Blockoffs", fuel pump, '74

I have in hand, a good working VW FI fuel pump, and an aftermarket fuel flow
regulator, can I use the two, in combination, for my Westy with 1.8 and Del
"DRLA40"s, to create both, the "spiral" pump, which I can mount basically
anywhere, and the required pressure to fit the "Dels"?  Chiao.
