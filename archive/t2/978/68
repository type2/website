The Street View of google maps is a major advance. In which direction is up for debate. Sites are springing up with links like this to all kinds of activities. I've been told imaging vehicles were sighted in Fresno recently. When the butt of California jokes is being photographed up close, it's a major trend. San Francisco, Los Angeles, Denver, New York and MIami are online currently. Not sure about the other areas, but more than SF was captured, Sausalito to Half Moon Bay to Oakland and Berkeley are there. 

Maybe a contest is in order? Best weekly best bus sighting? The data was collected months ago, so the deck can't be stacked, but if you know where a bus owner lives you've got an advantage. 

Alas, Karl and I have no buses on the streets in Fresno anymore. Maybe in the overhead shots or Google Earth, but the Street View can show a distributor pulled out of the engine.
