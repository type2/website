Subject: Westy Heater Vent Question

I noticed that my '78 Deluxe Westy does not have a provision for a heater
vent under the rear seat. The grill/register is there, but the triangle
piece of sheet metal that would direct heat out into the cabin is absent.
Looking under the bus, the y-pipe out of the heater channel is also not
there. 

 

I have been paying pretty close attention to a bunch of Westy's lately, and
all have operational vents under the seat, but only some have the BA6
heater, which I assumed the vent is for.

 

Anyone know why mine came without the operational vent and only the
register? It has great heating, but not for the rear passengers.
