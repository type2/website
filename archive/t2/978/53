Subject: Re: [T2] Front bra for 71 Westy?

Hi Trey,

Don't do it... I have seen a whole bunch of buses with nasty  
paintwork ruined by a bra holding in the moisture.

Don's comment  about the 3M product is a much better idea, unless of  
course your bus is messed up already and you're trying to hide  
something.

Happy Trails,
