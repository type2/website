Ok,, the secret tool for that brass fitting is found on a beetle.
The tail light lens is held on by a long screw,, that screw threads into 
that brass fitting,, and allows you to grip it and pop out the fitting.. and 
then you can take out the ball that is underneath it.. then clean out the 
passage

you don't want to drill that hole..  the check ball for the accel pump will 
be adversely effected...

hope that helps
