to start off with,, that is correct Greg.
The white wire is for left high beam only.. 

The yellow wire is for right high beam only..
hot wire it.. and the p/s will light... 

and there is 2 more wires.. white with a black strip and yellow with a black 
strip.. they are for the low beams 

They each come from an individual fuse...
when you have the headlight switch on.. you should have power at the 2 
fuse,, when you hit the dimmer.. it will change the power to the other 2 
fuses.. 

I think they are the left most fuses... you should be able to clearly see 
the large wires at the fuse box
