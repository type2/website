Subject: under rear seat heater in 73 bus

Wasn't there when I started.  Looking at the 71, it has a triangular
spot on the sheet metal where the pipe is supposed to come through.

the 73 didn't have the hole at this triangular spot...  but the triangle
was there...

I measured the distance from the edges of the floor to the pipes
in the 71...  measured the 73, and cut some holes with the holesaw.

I hit both pipes (beneath bus) perfectly.

installed a $12.00 heater core, and used the auxillary cooling fan
(electric) that was on the 73 engine...  now I have good clean CO
free heater in my subaru powered VW  (actually I did it about a month
ago)

about 1000 miles on it so far
