Subject: Brake Job article

With the recent talk about brakes and tools, I added an article on brake overhaul to my website:

http://www.ratwell.com/technical/BrakeJob.html

It doesn't have as many photos as I'd like (I forgot to take them the last couple of times) but hopefully you'll find it helpful anyway until I do.
