Subject: 050 dist question

I have one of these and have never tried it - can anyone tell me if the
orientation of the dist is different from my normal vac diz - I cant seem to
install it with the little cyl 1 notch in the same place - (roughly 5 o'clock)
(75 1.8 Westy)
Is there a trick that I am unaware of - It is in my spares and if I ever need
it I suppose I should check it out

Thanks
Eric
