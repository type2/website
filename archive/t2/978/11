Subject: RE: [T2] Who makes the best front rotors for '72 bus? And think

I know when shopping for rotors for my VW Corrado that Zimmerman are very good
quality.

Are yours warped? Sometimes old rotors can be machined if enough is left on
them.

Yea rotors and pads are a straightforward job. Sometimes though stuff can be
rusted and stuck or whatnot and that can be what makes it harder on an old bus
as compared to newer brakes. There is a special tool to hold the pads in place
thats helpful, I got one for cheap from Harbor Freight.
