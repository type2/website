Can this be patched/glued with something? Gorilla Glue ? I know Brake Fluid

corrosive.

I don't know where I could find a replacement. I'm sure they are scarce.

It's a 71 Westy."

When we bought our '71 I also found the brake reservoir to be cracked.
First thing I did was to remove it and wash it out very, very, very, well.
Then I used my small pencil type soldering iron to "weld the crack together.
I let the soldering iron melt the plastic next to the crack and then made
small, slow, circular motions over the crack.  This pushed the molten
plastic over the crack and when it all cooled and hardened the crack was no
more.  In December it will be 8 years since I made the repair and it hasn't
leaked a drop, from the crack, since then.
