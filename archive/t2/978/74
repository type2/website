BTW, Did you ever see the 78 camper modifications site someone set up 
for me but I can't edit it as they disappeared!

How's the rebuild doing?  If we don't make Litchfield, we could go to 
Terryville, Ct Bug-a-Fair in Aug.  Definitely Plan to go to West River 
Westies (Vermont) July 13 and High Country July 27th.
Since some varied driving is needed to break in engine, all highway to 
Litchfield would be a nono (and would likely run hot due to friction?)
