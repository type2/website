Hi Jamie,

Just after I pressed "send" I realized that I hadn't described the  
problem very well.

I just need to know where the white wire goes to in the fuse box. The  
wiring diagram suggests the top of fuse #6, but that doesn't seem to  
work. I suppose It's also possible that we might have multiple issues  
here....


Happy Trails,
