Do you think rotors/pads is a job do-able at home?

Yes. As long as you've got a safe place to leave the bus where it is 
out of the weather and wont fall on someone overnight! Make sure you 
do a good search through the archives and on theSamba and 
ShopTalkForums to uncover all the traps and tips before tackling the 
job. I would also consider reco'ing the calipers and checking the 
front bearings while you're at it.
