Subject: 1.8 fuel pump block off "plates"

Saw an ad in SAMBA for a guy named "Jaycee", who makes block off plates for
where the stock fuel pump sits, and can't determine, if these plates will work
with my type 2 1.8 L engine.  He is in California, so maybe someone on the
list knows of him, and if these block off plates will fit my 1.8 Type 2?
Thanks in advance.
Sid
