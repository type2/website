If you like helping friends do brake jobs on a regular basis, they  
are really useful. I believe Kukko makes them...

Description / Art No. / List Price
--
Pad extractor -  126-01 ($19)  <- so so price
Piston Reset Tool - 126-00 ($190) <- yikes!
Piston Rotating Pliers - 126-03 ($160) <- ouch!

If you don't want to pay those prices, you can buy them through ATE  
like I did (I forget the cost and it was so long ago the prices have  
probably gone up with the Euro which may mean they are now Kukko  
expensive):

Pad extractor -  0.9314-1400.2 (NLA, only the really expensive slide  
hammer version is available now set buy Kukko)
Piston Reset Tool - 03.9314-4950.3
Piston Rotating Pliers - 03.9314-5700.3

Contact Rainer Wittich at brinsonco.com to buy ATE items by part  
number in USA.

Sometime it costs extra for shipping because an item comes from Germany.

I need to put in an order soon so if anyone would like to split the  
shipping costs (sometimes from Germany) I'd appreciate your help.  
Contact me via pmail.
