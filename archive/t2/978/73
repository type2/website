Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Heater Vent Question

see http://www.geocities.com/mike_benthin for 78 camper mods
Find a "saddle" plumbing Drain/waste T connector at Home Depot and cut a
hole in the heat pipe, attaching the saddle with some calk and large
hose clamps. Run insulated ducting through the floor under the bedseat
and to the vent register.
    I did this when I blocked the front vent that faces rearward next to
the spare tire closet.  I did this because I turned the closet into a
tools/stuff  cabinet with its door flush to the sink cabinet so the
waste stool could easily sit there (against seat belt holders) for
climbing up to top bed.  The blockage was cause by the carpet-covered
board I placed the to let the stool be flush to the higher floor between
front seats.

  I noticed that my '78 Deluxe Westy does not have a provision for a heater
  vent under the rear seat. The grill/register is there, but the triangle
  piece of sheet metal that would direct heat out into the cabin is absent.
  Looking under the bus, the y-pipe out of the heater channel is also not
  there.
