Subject: Who makes the best front rotors for '72 bus? And think I can do

Hello all, getting the 72 Westy in shape for summer,
and I'm topped out at the mechanic with CV joints and
rear brakes.

Turns out, I'll need front rotors and pads with a few
hundred miles. and thought I can save a couple hundred
bucks by doing it myself. I've been looking for parts
online and BusDepot has some rotors by Zimmerman.
Anyone have experience with these? 

Also, I have the factory blue manual, plus the Haynes,
and the Muir books and consider myself pretty handy.
Do you think rotors/pads is a job do-able at home? 

Thanks
J.
