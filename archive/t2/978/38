Subject: Anyone need Vanagon parts?

So, I got a few extra parts when I got my 84 Vanagon and thought I'd 
check if anyone needs/wants anything.

First, I have 2 spare, stock rims.  The tires on them are shot but the 
rims are good.

Second, I have an extra transmission.  Condition Unknown.   Apparently 
the tranny is still good.  The PO replaced it thinking it was bad but it 
turned out to be a clutch slave cylinder that caused his problems.  At 
very least, it is a good core.

Third, I have 2 complete CV shafts and one extra joint,  They all look 
pretty good.  Not even a crack in the boots.

I will bring everything to the show in Omaha on June 16th and I hope I 
don't have to bring anything home.

Pmail me with any questions or to "reserve" a part.

Thanks,
Andrew
