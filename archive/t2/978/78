Find one in better shape. They get brittle with age and crack apart.

I found one for my '71 from this list, so maybe you'll get lucky.

You might be able to try adhesive, I would try 2-part epoxy, make sure
you get everything immaculately clean before you start, brake cleaner
should clean up the plastic pretty well.

good luck
