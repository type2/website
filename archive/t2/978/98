Subject: SQUEAL after Rebuilt Trans installed. What??

71 Bay Window

I have just had the transmission replaced.

The mechanic ordered a 71 rebuild from a reputable place. Once he 
came to put it in, he discovered that my 71 had a 70 engine and 
transmission. He went ahead with the installation, but the job also 
meant a new clutch as the 70 did not fit.

There is a short loud squeal at times.  It is loud, one or 2 seconds, 
and not grinding. It is entirely predictable and, wouldn't you know 
it, never happens when I return to the shop;  I left it overnight so 
he could start from cold. His assessment is that it is a whistle and 
he takes no responsibility. IMO,  no way is it a whistle -- I don't 
think he heard what I hear.

When it happens, it happens only once, first thing in morning when 
cold. I notice it when I  am leaving a stop sign half a block from 
home and going into 2nd gear. The stop is on a down slope, but the 
take-off is flat.
I can't be sure if it is while changing-up  or just afterwards. For 
the rest of the day it seems OK but once it really, really squealed 
in second gear going up a very steep short hill with high revs. 
Again that was in the morning, under a mile from home.

So how can I pin down the cause?  Should I keep driving?
