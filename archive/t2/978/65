Subject: Re: [T2] Trailridge Road Run

i'd love to, but i'm far away from the trailridge road and colorado
and the rockies.  damn, i hate the midwest.  couple of years ago my
wife and three kids and i drove through and camped just outside the
park.  it was my kids first time in the mountains.  they loved it.  i
envy all you bus owners who live in that area.
