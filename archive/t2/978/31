Another thing to note,, I *think* the bentley shows the fuse panels view'd 
from the "front"  FIF ... when your looking at the fuses ,, your looking at 
the back of the fuse panel.. and that changes the way you number the fuses. 

please check.. your panel cover should have the numbers on it.
the fuses for the headlights are .. most likely,, 2 over from the right 
side.. the next 4 are for the headlights. 

maybe someone can confirm this... my fuse panel is burried under the parcel 
trays.. too hard to take a picture for you..
