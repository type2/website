Along with this comes the fact that small businesses today are running on

Mr. Salmon's specific situation but I'm fairly certain that his business is

I've got a couple of other 'orphan' cars (Little British Cars), as well as 
'semi-orphaned' VW's...I'm sure others on the list do too (as does Mr.
Salmon...) If you think it's as easy keeping an old car up and running as
a VW, you've got another think coming...
