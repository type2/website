Subject: Re: [VB] neighbors suck/65 project bus FOR SALE/trade eugene OR

I have 4 buses in adition our two daily driver vehicles, none of which run
at the moment. By code I'm allowed to have 1 vehicle non op on my property
but it must be in a garage or behind a fence that obscures it from view. I'm
covered there got a fence around the whole place, but it's only good for one
bus. According to their rules a vehicle could be perfectly restored,
licensed, and insured but it will be a code violation if you didn't drive it
every two weeks. The 57 and the 64 both have permanent special intrest
registration so the tags are good. To smooth it over I'm going to make the
57 run, store the 64 with a friend, sell the 65 and let the 72 be my visible
non-op(it's hard to roll so I don't want to move it). I've got a list of
other complaints and violations that relate mostly to the never ending
remodel we're doing on the house that'll have to be taken care of as well.
The fine for the first day is $150, the second day is $250.  I'm not going
to fight it. My uncle did and won too, but it cost him a small fortune and
more stress than I need in my life. When the heat dies down I'll pile em up
again.

The funny thing is I live in a commercial/industrial area. I have a charcoal
plant, ups warehouse, auto repair shops, metal fab shop and trucking outfit
and one end of my street and at the other end another trucking outfit, a
chemical storage facility, a lumber mill, and best of all A JUNK YARD. My
father in law owned it before us so I know junkers have been in the yard
since the 70's. At one point I had nearly 20 buses in my yard for months
without a single complaint.
