Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Parts ordering experience w/ 4 vendors

Yet another example of how we Americans have been spoiled by the internet
age.  I experienced much the same attitude in many of my customers when I
worked in sales.  It seems that everyone wants it yesterday and thinks
something is wrong if their (sometimes unreasonable) demands can't be met.

We should constantly remind ourselves that these are old vehicles with a
limited parts demand.  We rely on small(er) suppliers to fill our needs.
Along with this comes the fact that small businesses today are running on
shoestrings that are thinner and more delicate than before.  I don't know
Mr. Salmon's specific situation but I'm fairly certain that his business is
no different from any other.

Cut him some slack, Jack.

BTW, aren't these buses great?
