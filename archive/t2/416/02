Subject: Re: [T2] Travel Prep/Fridge reactivation

Thanks to my neighbor, I found the problem with the fridge.
The previous owner had done a bunch of differne t things to create a 
nice spider web of dead-end wiring.
We were able to trace a lotofit out and at the very least get the fridge 
to get going.
Now I am on to installing a new water pumpo.
Thanks to Karl for the help.
