Volks,
    I just want to say that I feel really fortunate to have a Bus Depot 
type buisness available to me. I have ordered via on-line for over two 
years now, without any problems, I am talking alot of stuff. The other 
car list I am on would kill to have the availability we all have. We are 
a proud, dedicated bunch of Volks that many do not appreciate until what 
we take for granite is gone. Anyone out there remember spending time and 
money hunting down parts? Thought so. It sucks really bad.
Thank you big time, Bus Depot!!!!
