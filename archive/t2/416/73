Subject: Re: how about recarros

I have a set of cloth recarros from a bmw in my 74
westy. Replaced beamer tracks with some lower ones 
(about 1.5" tall) from the pic n save to reduce seat
height, and bolted right in. The seats, with minimal
tracks, have a lower "butt elevation" than the stock
seats. I have an extra top cushion cover, the local
auto upholstery shop quoted $225 to install as
inserts.
