Hi Daniel

Valve adjustments are important to protect the life of the valve 
components. If you neglect the adjustments, you will reduce the life of 
the valves and compression and power will suffer. If you're worried 
about a bad valve, get a compression test done, it will tell you if 
they're sealing correctly.

Other common causes for running hot:

1. Cooling system problems: Blockage or leakage in fan, fins or tin. Is 
all the engine tin present and sealed properly? Is the fan pulley 
properly adjusted? Engine hatch closed?

2. Insufficient lubrication: is the oil the correct grade and 
uncontaminated with fuel?  Short trips and leaky floats = gas in the 
oil=bad lubrication.

3. Does your mechanic know what the correct timing spec is for your 
motor? Is the pulley marked correctly? Over the years I've seen many 
non-vw mechanics time an engine by ear, which is certain to lead to 
problems with an aircooled motor.

4. Incorrect fuel. Some local stations herreabouts have been caught 
blending their own fuels without telling the customer. Toluene and 
other additives can't be good for an aircooled engine. It doesn't 
happen often, but it's not impossible...

5. Overloading: Are the brakes properly adjusted and tires correctly 
inflated? Rolling resistance=more horsepower required=more heat.

6. Running lean. Is the carb properly adjusted and are all manifold 
fittings secure? Air leaks or blocked jets=lean running=hot running. If 
your gas milage is better than usual lately this could be the cause.

If I've missed any other likely items I'm sure someone will point them 
out.

Happy trails,
