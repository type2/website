Subject: New case or line bore old case?

I need to line bore the case in my 70 Type2 or buy a new case. It is a
Mexican case w/80,000 miles installed in 1976. The flywheel main bore is
.001 out. The case also needs the cylinder spigots resurfaced ("decked"). My
existing case is plumbed for a full flow filter using two horizontal oil
galleys - a difficult operation I would not like to do again.  I have heard
that line boring should be avoided.

Any recommendations?

Also does anyone know the difference between a $289 case and a $395 case ?
