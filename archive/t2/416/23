Subject: Type 4 Engine Deck Height Tool

Does anybody have a copy of the specs for the tool for properly setting the 
deckheight on a type 4 engine.  If you either have a copy of the specs or 
could scan your deckheight tool I and send it to my email I would appreciate 
it.  The engine being rebuilt is an 1800 FI for a 75 bus.

BTW what is the longest stay anyone on the AIRS list has had due to 
mechanical problems?
