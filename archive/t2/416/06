You can get add-on cruise controls at your local FLAPS.  They come in two
varieties, those that read the distributor pulses to measure speed, and
those that use magnets on the axles to do the same.  The distributor
versions are much easier to install on the bus.  Be prepared to do some
good engineering to get the throttle linkage right.
