Subject: lurching

hi! 78 FI stock westy.  Seems to be increasing the lurching at shifting speeds
1st to 2nd 2nd to 3rd.  idles well.   Recently replaced (within the last 1000
miles)  all fuel lines, filter, all vacuum lines, points, condenser, dist cap,
rotor....

I just read the archives... bad gas,  FI problems, vacuum leak....

Any suggestions?

TIA
