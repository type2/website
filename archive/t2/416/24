Subject: Water Cooled Bus

I owned an 84 watercooled westy and it ran great. I did have gasket problems
but I actually learned to love the bus while fixing them. Replaced gaskets
on both heads for less than $200 and it went 124,000 before I sold it.

As to converting an air-cooled to a water cooled. I would take the advice of
another on this list and forget it.

Given the problems you'll encounter and the fact that the watercooleds work
fine or certainly present no more problems than the air cooled, why worry
with it?

But, having owned both, I would say that if you get an air-cooled with all
the right equipment in place, you'll be just as happy and put less strain on
the environment than if you had a water cooled. Also, you will not have
waterpump failure nor head gasket leaks...

But, if you really want to know where to put a radiator, then why not look
at where radiators are on the busses that have them? duh?

They are up front where the air hits them just behind the forward air
intakes...now, on an air-cooled, there is no air damn to knock the hot air
that is being cooled by the fan and the radiator off the passengers, so
you'll have instant heat up front...good in the artic, bad in Georgia in
July...

so, unless you just like headaches, why not just buy a watercooled?
