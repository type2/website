ones to have a look as to how difficult it will be. I
assume it will be simply a matter of making an adaptor

Check the height of the seat's seat...I'm just 6' 1" and even in
the stock seats I'm looking out thru' the top of the windshield.
I added a couple of computer fans to blow whatever warm air
there is to defrost the viewing area...
