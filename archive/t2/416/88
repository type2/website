Subject: RE: [T2] Different Seats

They bolted in with no drilling new holes? Also how is the seat height
compared to the steering wheel position? 

Poor picture, but these are Dodge Daytona seats bolted directly to the seat
pedestals. I love them, they are super comfortable and still look great
after 8
years.

I removed the seat tracks permanently and bolted the seat to suit me. :)
