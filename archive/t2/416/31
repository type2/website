This is the way the parts situation seems to be, for me anyway--

I purchase most of my parts from VW--because at least most of the parts
guys can give me a legitimate answer to any questions on
availability--and whats what--without sitting on hold for 10 minutes
just to get the usual  "Ahhh, I don't know man"

And by the time I add up the inflated shipping costs from the BD for
one--I'm getting the stuff for the same price direct from VW--and in a
timely manner--
If I have to order anything it is usually no more than a day or two--

And the the big bonus is; VW is two blocks from home--

Nuff Said--
