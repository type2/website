Subject: any 1 got a bus 4 sale local?

Maybe i shouldnt post here, but i am yes looking for another bus....
I cant afford alot but need something local for a daily driver..
i dont care if it looks like hell as long as the body is pretty much rust free and the engine and tranny are in good shape as well as the wireing..
i have a 76 transporter and it looks like it is going to take a little more time than i first suspected to have her stable enough for a daily driver..
i have found a couple of ads close to me on samba but nothing for sure yet...
closest i have found is like in north carolina..
i am wiling to drive to tennessee,nc,georgia,sc, border for the purchase of this new bus..
i am not at all being specific except i cant afford it not to be in good running condition cause i am sooner or later going to make this a daily driver for the wife and little one..but it will be my daily driver for the time being..
 will be the wifes  when mine is up and running as a daily driver...
That way we will officially be a bus family and drivers... LOL..

let me know please..
heres the kicker i am looking for this to be around 1000-2000 bucks...
no more than that and 2000 is still going to be tuff for me really tuff...
i know its not to far fetched cause i have seen them for this price in good shape other places and sometimes even in my area .....
westy,transporter,whatever i just need and want another bus...
done got the fever...
guy called me today and says hey man i know where there is a beautiful red converible chevy cavalier and the guy says he only wants 500 bucks for it that is you and i said no sir appreciated but i would rather have a unpainted older bus instead and as he says you are crazy i giggled and smiled and said just some things i cant explain when it comes to owning a Vw bus..
peace to you and all and yours...
i can always be reached at this e-mail address checked daily..
