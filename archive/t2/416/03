The advance curve is set for what size and year engine you have. It
determines how far and how quickly the distributor anvances the timing
depending on RPM. Someone correct me if this is incorrect. It is similar to
looking at the hp/torque curves of an engine. If you take a look in the
Bentley it has the correct advance curve specs for each size and code of
engine. If it is a stock engine they just set the curve to whatever the spec
in the book says. If you have rebuilt the engine to something over stock the
advance curve should be calibrated to that specific engine which Philbin can
do. On the stock type4 engine total advance should never be past 32 degrees.
That is why I had mine rebuilt, the total advance was almost at 40 degrees!
I was lucky that I didn't fry the poor thing.
