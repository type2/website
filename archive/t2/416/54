Think BD or other VW vendors are bad...?-(
I mailed an oddball piece of Britannia (sidescreen frame for a Morgan)
to another owner so he could use it as a template since he had nothing
to work from. UPS charged me about 10/11 bucks...
The guy I shipped it to wanted to show his appreciation, so he ordered
a Morgan coffee mug for me from England ($11 USD)...Six weeks later
I got the mug...But It was an MG-TC mug. I e-mailed the co. in England
and they said, "No problem, mate, just send the wrong one back and
we'll send you the right one!"
"Freight collect?" says I...
"Oh, no," says they, "We don't accept that sort of thing."
So I shipped the mug back ($16) and another six weeks later I got
the righto one...
So much for a free cuppa tea... ;-(
