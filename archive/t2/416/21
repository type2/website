Truck rated tires are an absolute MUST. You must use load range C or D,
or sidewall-reinforced tires for proper handling and safety. The
sidewall flex on passenger car tires will severely limit your handling
no matter what else you do. Not to mention that because most passenger
car tires cannot handle the Bus' recommended rear tire inflation psi,
you must either underinflate them compared to VW spec, or (worse yet)
overinflate them above the tire manufacturer's spec - both of which
present a safety issue. While I do not sell tires, I have been happy
with Korean made Hankook light truck tires (sp?) on my Westies. Stiff
sidewall (D range, I think), not too aggressive a tread, decent wear,
and quite inexpensive.

I also recommend a stiffer shock if you want improved handling. Although
opinions on KYB shocks are mixed, I personally like their Gas Adjust
shocks on a Bus in terms of handling, especially for the price. Of
course, this improvement does come at the expense of ride "smoothness,"
as compared to an oil damped shock like a Boge, but I personally don't
find the difference objectionable.  

As for the first two options you mentioned, I don't have any firsthand
experience so I can't comment. For my needs, once I put on the right
tires and KYB's, I found the handling to be as good as I could
reasonably expect from a "barn on wheels," and I had no inclination to
take it any further.
