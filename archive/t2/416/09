Subject: Re: [T2] FI Wire Harness Electrical Connector PN-Supplier?

I've bought and used the Bus-Boys wiring harness connector housings,
it is an exact replacement, great quality. They are only offered in one
color though, black.  I also got a few extra connector housings and
those tiny clips. FYI, buy their pin tool to unlock the wires from the
plastic connector housing. It's still a pain to get the wires out but
with the tool it helps.

For what its worth Advanced auto also sells a generic connector
housing. It comes with two pig tail wires and a improved release clip.
They were about $5 I think, I bought one and it was great for 
testing FI bits as it has a nice quick release clip.
