Of all the options you gave you left one out:

E) Use the shipping estimator but charge the actual shipping costs
especially if it's much lower.

This is my gripe and I think Theodore's as well. What makes BD unique to
many of the the other vendors is that you charge shipping based on the item
cost (at least according to your printed catalog). It deters me from adding
small items to the order because I know a small increase in price may
drastically increase the shipping charges.

The worst case is that if I order just lightweight items that end up costing
a lot, like a poptop canvas, I feel the shipping charges are excessive
compared to other vendors. You should fix the shipping cost of those items
to actual cost that don't fit within the calculator model.
