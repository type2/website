Subject: RE: Parts ordering experience w/ 4 vendors

Below is a copy of my invoice for 2 items from Bus Depot. I was charged
22.99 in shipping for these 2 items. I have ordered a set of 4 tires for my
bus from Tire Rack and paid 29.00, also they arrived the next day, from
Delaware to DC. This order was placed on June 29. I have still not received
the top canvas, but it has only been 5 business days and it is apparantly
coming from CA. Yesterday when I called the guy told me that there was no
way of knowing when this would arrive because it was dropshipped. Does that
mean that if it never shows up there is no way of tracking what happened to
it? I do a lot of UPS and Fed Exing from my office and I order from a lot
of different companies and the service is usually a lot better than this.
But i keep coming back to Bus Depot because the prices are good. I order
caving gear from a vendor in west VA and I get that stuff in 2 days max. It
is often odd sized and shaped equipment and he doesn' seem to have this big
problem with shipping and tracking orders. I don't mind the wait so much as
the clueless attitude of the people I have deal twith at BD. Honestly how
hard is it to send out a trackig number with an order and let me track it
through Brown myself?
