The simplest upgrade I've considered is going from my Standard bay seats 
in my 76 to some Westy seats... they're a bit nicer.

I can't blame you.  I've driven in the 325i with recarro seats.  That is 
a nice german driving experience.  Perhaps you could remove the 
rails/mounts from a wrecked car at the yard and weld them into your bus. 
 Pay special attention to heigth and the distance of the seat to the 
wheel and windsheild..  Also keep in mind that driving a bus is much 
different than sedans.  The wheel sits in front of you almost on a 
horizontal plane instead of diagonally.  I just don't know how much 
they'll let you move around.

Upholstry places can and will do just about anything for the right 
amount of money.  Looking at car shows or in your VW magazines is proof 
positive of this.  But as I''m sure you know it would definately be a 
custom job.

The all-black leather westy interior.  You might be on to something there.
