Subject: RE: Parts ordering experience w/ 4 vendors

"The first was a child's cot. You got it in just one working day."

That was awesome!

" Shipping
coast-to-coast costs more, and takes longer,"

Nowhere on the website or when I ordered was I told that this item was
coming from CA, only found that out when I called. No big deal I thought it
was coming from PA.

"directly from the factory in California. (This is only because you
ordered gray. We normally stock poptop canvas in the the most popular
colors, but gray is not one of them.)  But stilll, they had it sewed and
out the door within the same day!  "In fact, the canvas will be delivered
to you on Thursday"

Why not tell me this when I called yesterday, thats all I was asking?

"They have their own jobs to do, and we
have to be considerate and realize that digging up tracking data on
shipments that aren't even late really isn't something they have time
for (especially during their peak season)"

Customers often call me asking to track an important order that is not
yetlate. I simply give them the number. Its part of my job...

"So, you paid much less than you would have if you'd bought the parts
anywhere else. If you add up the cost of shipping both packages, the
shipping cost was more than reasonable. And you will have received both
products in far less than the promised 7-10 working days - one item in
just one working day, and the second in 7 even though it had to be
specially made."

Perhaps you missed the point of my prior post. I am more satisfied with my
orders from Bus Depot than any other vendor and always go to you guys first
when ordering. I just wish the order tracking was easier. There is no need
for everyone to go getting all bent out of shape here and telling me what I
should and should not ask for. Bottom line, I NOW know when I can expect my
canvas. Did it need to go through the list? Probably not, but we were
discussing ordering experiences and I shared mine. I'm over it.
