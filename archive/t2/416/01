I just last week had Philbin rebuild my dizzy for my stock '78. It only took
them one day and it was very good work. Total cost was $81. That is without
shipping since I live in Portland where they are located. They can also set
the advance curve to whatever aplication you need. Everything had been sand
blasted/cleaned and repainted. Bus runs better than ever now.
