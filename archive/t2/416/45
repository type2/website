"I was wondering if you experienced any impacts on performance , gas mileage 
or unplanned mechanical issues after the downsizing."

I switched from a 34 to the smaller venturied 30/31 on my 1600.  I used the 
small-flanged single-port manifold though, so I noticed only a minor change 
in driveability.  I lost a little bit of torque from a stop, and gained a 
bit of improvement in mileage.  No flat spots or lean/rich with either 
though.  6 in one hand;half a dozen in the other.
