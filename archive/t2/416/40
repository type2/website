Subject: Busdepot B****-slapping

What I notice is that EVERYONE SAYS they're the most happy with Busdepot, but curiously, Busdepot is also the only vendor to get consistently, publicly, crapped on.

I've argued with Ron personally about what all vendors can do/don't do myself, but I wouldn't rip his business a new one in front of an audience before speaking with him.

If you're so damn happy, don't slam people on the list without addressing your complaints to them.

Now I'm over it.
