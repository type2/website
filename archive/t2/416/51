Subject: engine running hot...

Listees...

My engine is getting pretty hot these days. The timing has been set by my 
mechanic so I know that is dead on. What else causes an engine to run hot??

Does valve adjustments have to do with running hot? Should this even be of 
concern, I think it's running hotter than last year in the summer. My 
dipstick is so hot you can only touch it for like a second.

Thanks,
Daniel
