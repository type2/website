Thanks for correcting me John. I didnt realize that was only for centrifugal
only distributors.

So, if I have a stock SVDA distributor and the curve is set for a stock
engine where should I set the timing? At idle or at high RPM? I have a '78
federal GE engine and now have it set at about 8 degrees at 900 RPM. Total
advance is around 32-33. Should I be more concerned about having total
advance at 42-45 degrees and not so much at what the timing at idle is? What
will be the benefits or consequence of having a higher advance at idle to
get to the 42-45 total advance?

Thanks for the info,
