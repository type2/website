I made the switch with good results.  Unfortunately, I put the new carb on
a new low-comprssion Mexican engine, so I can't tell you whether the small
power loss is due to the compression or carb.  My gut feeling is that the
carb is not responsible.

The best thing is that this carb worked great out of the box and has given
_no_ problems.  Always starts right off, idles nicely, etc.
