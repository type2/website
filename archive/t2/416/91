I tried to modify a pair of Rabbit/Golf GTI seats. Nice seats but required 
ALOT of cutting of the seat frame to get it to sit on the floor. I did not 
ruin the seat but will have to reweld a could cuts when I use them in my 
Beetle. Comfy!

The seats wound up being too tall even with the seat frame flat on the bus 
floor. Put the steering wheel on my legs, and I was looking out of thevery, 
very top of the windshield.

Vanagon seats fit nicely. Porsche 914 seats I expect would fit nicely. 
Fiero seats I'd bet fit well. MR2, Miata, NSX, etc. Anything that has seats 
that sit on the floor would be be worthy of consideration.

Your BMW seats might but remember you'll need to fab new seat mounts or cut 
the old seat mounts off of the bus seats and weld them to the BMW seats.
