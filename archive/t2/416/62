I'm curious myself! I have a pair of lovely black leather
recarro seats from a BMW 325is, that I am wanting to
install in my '78 westy....but have not taken out the stock
ones to have a look as to how difficult it will be. I
assume it will be simply a matter of making an adaptor
plate for each rail with appropriate holes.....anyone??

also...what was the deal on getting matching material for
seats? I do really like teh green/brown/tan/black plaid of
the stock interior, and am thinking of making matcing
inserts for the recarros...Yeah! seriously.....it's either
that or re-cover the rear seat and sleaping pads in black
leather to match the front seats...that's be tooo
much...huh?  ;-)  not really my style...

if my idea works on these, there are always good seat deals
at the pick-n-pull places....and some audi/bmw/vw cars have
different recarros ....and you can get a set of them for a
deal...but probably not leather like mine....  ;-) honestly
I'd rather have the grey cloth ones I had in my old audi
quattro...
