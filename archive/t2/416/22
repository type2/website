Eric,
First off , FMBC is designing a new website, we are only using the MSN board
temporarily.  We are working on a linux based website, just not complete
yet. The MSN site is serving our needs temporarily and as soon as we can we
will dump it.

Second if you don't want to sign up on the MSN or can't post because you
aren't a member of the MSN site, there is a note at the top of each page to
email either me or Buddah (depending on the list) and we'll add your info.
If you don't want to include your email that is fine (the grocery list
doesn't even ask for it)

I just don't want everyone to freak thinking they have to sign up for
something they don't want to.

I hope this clears up some confusion.

Peace Brother,
Snoopy
