Anytime the ambient temps are over 80 degrees or so, my 81 vanagon will
run at 230-240 and if it gets stressed, it will exceed 250. My VDO uses
the sensor in the drain and so these numbers are more relative than exact.

I understand that 260 and beyond will break down the oil, so if I have to
take a long trip and it exceeds these numbers, I will change the oil as
soon as I can.

I badgered the poor folks on the vanagon list for a long time about this,
and the very best advice was an aux oil cooler, but money, and where to
mount it, have kept me from doing what I think would be the best thing.
The other advice I got, which I consider quite reasonable, is that the
engines are well designed, if the tin is all in place, the fan is working,
and the engine is kept clear of tons of gunk, keep it well tuned, and use
it. It can handle whatever you throw at it within reason.

As an aside note, it is wise to be concerned about the oil breaking down,
but the other end of the spectrum is that in cooler weather, the oil temp
never gets past 140, and that is detrimental as well since it never gets
hot enough. My van gets driven a lot more under cooler temp conditions
than extreme heat, so it must be quite tolerant of these conditions.

Just an unsolicited opinion.
