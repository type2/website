I was able to find the Bosch H4 kit, made in Germany with German bulbs
included, for $90 Canadian(about $60 US). That has to be the best deal
going. People on the list talked me out of the Pakostanleys, talk about a
waste of money. The bitter taste of poor quality lingers long after the
sweetness of low price is gone.

I have Bosch H4's with Bosch bulbs, 55/60w. Perfect fit, excellent
performance. Stock wiring.
