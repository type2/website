I know there are plenty of splits around because I've been to the club meetings and shows but they seem to either be in rundown shape or restored and too nice to drive.

VW wasn't frivolous: the baywindow has important utilitarian and comfort improments. It's arguably better much in the same way the Vanagon is an improvement but it doesn't mean you can fall in love with any of them. That's what I really like about VWs.
