Vince, just what bulbs are we talking here? Not the fake Phillips or GE blue
bulbs?? What part no. and how are they fitting in an H4 headlight assembly??
I'd like to know, as I own all Hella H4 assemblies in my two bugs??
Thanks,
Courtney

*I am now using the new technology blue 65/65 watt bulbs with better light
than event the 80/120 bulbs 
* I had before.
