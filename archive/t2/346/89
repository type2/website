Subject: Re: [T2] Rod bearing play

Hi Volks,

After another weekly session of wrenching, we have confirmed that the 
rod bearings are toast. The bearings are pounded out and also show some 
minor galling. On the other hand, the cam looks good and the end play 
of the rings is in spec, so we are going to take our chances with the 
crank and not split the case. We'll just drive it gently for a while 
and see what happens. We already have about $US400 to spend and with 
the other work the bus needs it's stretching the budget to go looking 
for trouble.  With the current plan of action we should have this thing 
road-ready for Buses Of The Corn.

Thanks for the advice and comments.

Happy trails,
