Subject: Re: [VB] What H4's is everyone using in ther Buses?

    I bought a set of Bosch H4s for my 69 westy on a trip to Canada last
year. I went to a store called Canadian Tire which is like a cross between
AutoZone and K-Mart. I will tell you the fit of the bosch housings warrants
the extra price. I have the $10 cheepies in my 67 bug and I had problems
with them rattling in the rings and the bulbs that were with them burnt out
after a months service. The bosch lights came two to a pack with bulbs for
$86.99 Canadian. As for the light output and the pattern I would say that
the bosch lights have a very slight advantage over the cheepos, barley
noticeable. I guess if you want perfect fit with limited hassle the bosch
lights are the way to go. If you don't mind spending a little time fitting
the housings and making a rubber gasket to take the slop out than you can
save some money by going cheap. Don't forget to buy extra bulbs if you get
the cheap ones. I have about three friends who only got a couple of months
service out of the bulbs that come with their lights.
