Precisely. Oil that has been overheated will be darker due to carbon 
loading and thinner due to polymer breakdown. It will also smell different 
than fresh oil. I suspect it would also taste different, though I have 
never developed this skill. You might even try putting some on an anvil and 
hitting it with a hammer to see if it sounds different. In every case, you 
are looking to prove a change via empirical evidence. It is simply 
application of scientific method, as opposed to various forms of guessing 
or assumptions.
