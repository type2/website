Interesting point.  Is there a way to gauge how much your oil has "broken 
down" or does this presumably just manifest itself as dirty oil that feels 
gritty and/or does not feel like it has the same lubrication properties as 
new oil when you rub it between your fingers?

Or do you just change it more often?  :)

I'm curious, especially as to how this course of logic intersects with the 
use of (oh, no, not this again) Synthetic Oil which theoretically breaks 
down at a higher temperature.

One would think that it's not just the oil breaking down at these high
temperatures that causes the problem, but your "oil turning into water" so 
to speak, as you reach these high temps.  This begs the question of 
whether using SAE 50 oil is beter for your bus if you're doing lots of 
summer highway driving because, despite lack of lubrication and high oil 
pressures at startup, your oil is going to continue to lubricate at higher 
operating temperatures. (and perhaps not even break-down as fast: any data 
on thermal breakdown temps for these 50wt racing oils?)

Just thinking out loud...
