Just in case you weren't aware, I remember the 79 booster being different than the 72 one.  It's larger and provides more boost than the 72 unit.  I was able to squeeze the larger booster in, but if I recall it was pressed up against the floor, or the frame, or something.  It was quite a few years ago, sorry.  :)
