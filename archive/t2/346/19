When installing a windshield into a bus, is it best to first attach the rubber seal to the glass, THEN put the whole thing onto the bus using the string method. OR is it better to first attach the seal to body of the bus THEN use the string method to place the glass into the seal? I have read about it both ways.

Thanks!
