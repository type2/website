Subject: Looking for jalousie window gear box

Since I haven't been able to find anyone who has a good jalousie window for
sale around the Chapel Hill, NC area, I'm now trying to find someone who
will sell and ship to me a good jalousie window gearbox. The gearbox on one
of my current window has too much slack in it and allows the window to
vibrate while going down the road. Certainly someone out there has a trashed
window with a good gearbox that they'll drill out ( its riveted in) and mail
me.
