Subject: New and looking

I'm new to the list, I did read the faq's and  didn't see any restrictions
on posting this.  I'm not trying to start any great debates.  With that said
here we go: I have an "85 westy that I really enjoy. It is my first and only
vw. But recently I saw an older model I believe it to be a 66 split window
and I thought that's awesome.  So can anyone give me a "quick" rundown on
the differences, I know the basics, I've done several searches in the
archives and on the web.  I'm looking at maybe trading my '85 for an older
model hardtop. Let me know what I'm getting into.
Thanks (sorry so long)
