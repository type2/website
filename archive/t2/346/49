John,

Sounds more interesting now(I'm from Missouri/and believe you).

Did the rubber have chrome molding in it like some of our buses have(mine 
does)?

Maybe I should try this method on my slider(aluminum frame) windows in my 
78...they are a royal pain to get in with the rubber already on them cause 
the aluminum frame doesn't give much.

Cheers, dave
