Subject: scrubbing bubbles and dashboard

Hi All,

My dashboard had this milkey crud between the bumps on the grain.  It made 
the whole thing look grey-black instead of just black.  I've seen this on 
other dashboards.  I always thought it was just from them drying out because 
if you cover the ick up with armorall, it appears to go away for a little 
while.  So I took the dash out and disassembled it.  I tried to wash it with 
isopropyl alcohol, simple green, orange cleaner, dish soap and 409.  Nothing 
got the crud completely off.  Then I went to bed and thought about it.  The 
crud, I thought, was probably 30 years of skin cells from people touching the 
dashboard.  So last night I tried Scrubbing Bubbles soap scum 
remover/bathroom cleaner on it.  I sprayed it on, waited 5 minutes and wiped 
it off.  All the crud was gone.  No elbow greese, no trouble, it just wiped 
off.  I wanted to share because I thought some of you might have the same ick 
on your dashboards.

Take Care!
Jennifer
