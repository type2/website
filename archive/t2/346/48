Wade,

Your questions could be better answered on either the vintagebus(-at-)type2.com
mailing list (for 1967 and back VW Busses) or the
vanagon(-at-)gerry.vanagon.com list (for 1980 and on VW Vanagons).

The type2(-at-)type2.com list covers the 1968 to 1982.5 VW Busses and aircooled
vanagons.

To subscribe to the vintagebus list send a blank email to:
vintagebus-subscribe(-at-)type2.com

To subscribe to the vanagon list, send an email to:
LISTSERV(-at-)GERRY.VANAGON.COM

The body of this email should contain:
signon vanagon
