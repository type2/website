Is your westy your daily driver? Would the 66 be your daily driver?

I had a 66 13 window for a short period of time and I wouldnt' reccomend one 
for a daily driver unless it's in great mechanical shape. I had trouble with 
mine, it wouldn't start when it was really cold and i had the troughout arm 
thingy break on me. And it didn't go very fast at all. Was not well suited 
for interstate driving.

But if youare gonnna have something else to drive while you work on it that 
would work out. Splits are a lot of fun to work on and drive. Think wisely 
before buying a rusty split, i was stupid and bought mine sight unseen and 
it had horrible rust problems.
