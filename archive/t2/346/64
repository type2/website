He may be right - motors are a bit tighter at first until they "break in".  If the starter can turn the engine, you most likely have a glazed belt or your belt is too loose.  Does the starter turn the motor quickly, or just barely?  That might be a clue.

I always push down on the belt between the alternator and fan while I am turning (watch your fingers).  This tightens the belt and helps it turn the engine if it's at a point where it's more difficult to move (such as near the top of a compression stroke).

Only if it's abnormally tight.  This could be caused by off-center bearing bores, bearings that are not matched to the journals of the crank/rods/cam, or other abnormal mechanical interference.

>Any ideas what I should do?

Find someone near you that knows how tight the engine should feel.  Have them try to turn your engine and see what they think.
