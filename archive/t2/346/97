Mike and all--

I just bought a couple of boxes of the ceramic fuses at Pamida, a
discount family type junk shop store--way up in South Dakota--they are
available at NAPA or any other finer FLAPS.

... VW fuses, the old-style ceramic, multi-colored darlings 
Or do we just take them when we visit junkyards? 
Much to my surprise (but after I'd already purchased and used the glass
GBC fuses) I found a handful of the old VW fuses in my toolbox, neatly
packaged in a box that has the word "Fuses" molded into the cover. 
Amazing how often that happens... [grin]
