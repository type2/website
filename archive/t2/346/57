Wade,

Having owned several of each, except vanagons...here ya go.

66 and down were 6volt.
Not as comfortable as the later models
Didn't stay on the road as well as later models
Lower speeds a must
No air conditioning
Hard to see out of if you are tall
Swing axle rear end with reduction gears(more parts to wear out)
No disk brakes
Much smaller in the rear for camping.
Much poorer heat capabilities(no fans)

After driving a well maintained 72-79 model, older ones really do
feel like driving a model t.

Don't get me wrong, I put over 80,000 miles on a 67 that I owned
and loved it.  If it is the "cool" factor you are after, then go for it!

Cheers, dave
