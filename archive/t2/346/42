Oftentimes RV registrations have restrictions that limit them for daily
commuter use, as well.  Only in some states, though.  You should call your
DMV to see what restrictions apply to RV registrations.

Insurance prices can vary a bit, too.  Some RV insurance policies limit
your milage, others cost a pretty peny.  OTOH if you're state really does
require that your bus be registered as an RV with no option they probably
don't have very restrictive policies...otherwise there'd be a lot of
ohioian bus drivers complaining or in jail. :)
