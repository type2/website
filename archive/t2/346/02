Daniel,

Lots of answers and maybe a couple of flames on this one as it
depends on your engine, it's condition, how well the tin fits, stock
shroud or not, distributor advance , type of plugs...etec.etc.etc.

I have found the proper valve adjustment can lower the temp by as much as 
15 degrees on a hot day.

*my* rule of thumb is 100-115 degrees farenheit above ambient temp for hot 
weather.

Once it gets down to about 50 or 60 degrees, then it seems to stay about 
180 degrees farenheit or so and hold there.

Once again, this *totally* depends on so many other conditions of your
engine and car, it is just unbelievable.

Gene Berg once did a  test like that on his bus and couldn't figure out
why he kept getting such different readings on the same day...turns out 
that just having the drivers side vent wing open made a difference.

Cheers, dave
