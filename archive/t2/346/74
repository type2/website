Frank,
    If you don't want it registered as a motor home check the specific
requirnements to qualify as a motor home.  Some states require a
toilet or other specific equipment.  If you don't meet the
requirnments ( porta-potti doesn't qualify as a toilet) I bet you
could get it reregistered in another catagorey.
