Normally, the situation is that the rear is sagging, after all these 
years.  Someone must
have adjusted the torsion bars, and went a little too far.  The procedure 
is in the Bentley
Manual, there are three articles in the Type2 Library, and much discussion 
on this topic
in the List Archives.  Harbor Freight sells an inexpensive angle finder, 
and vwalley.com
sells a torsion bar tool, that is a copy of the VW tool.
