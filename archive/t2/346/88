Subject: Proper Bulbs for a Vanagon

Hi all:

Oddly enough, in the 20+ years I've owned my Vanagon I've not had to change
light bulbs very often.  However, the last time or two I've gone into my
FLAPS to get a replacement bulb and quoted the "Trade No." listed in the
Bulb Chart of my Vanagon's Owners Manual the guy behind the counter tells me
that that number is no longer valid and hands me something else.  I'm not so
sure he knows what he's talking about and now, after replacing a bulb in my
relatively-new-to-me Westfalia, the left blinker goes a lot faster than the
right blinker, which tells me I've got mis-matched bulbs.

I've looked around on the web for some sort of cross-reference chart for the
"Trade Numbers" listed in my owners manual to current general trade numbers
and haven't had any luck.  Does anybody have some sort of list of generic
"trade numbers" for bulbs that fit Vanagon?

Here's what my manual specifies:

Headlights                                    6014
Front turn signals                          1034
Front and rear
    side marker lights                      1816
Rear turn signal                             1073
Stop/tail lights                               1034
Back-up lights                              1073
License plate light                             89
Interior lights                                   211

Anybody got a more current chart?

TIA.
