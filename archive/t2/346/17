Subject: getting rid of joulise windows

Jim H,

I'm sorry, but I'm thinking about it too. Mine rattle so much I'm surprised my 6-year old hasn't kicked my a$$ for making him ride next to it for so long.

Also, there are options other than the 68-74 era fixed window with vent-wing.

78-79 buses had the lovely sliders like the vanagons. I've been collecting them for awhile. I have some earlier versions that even have screens in them.

Joel,

I feel your pain. Take them out, restore them with the kits, sell 'em for some dough to somebody who wants 'em.

See how smart(a$$) I am?

Billy
