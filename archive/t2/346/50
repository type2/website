Subject: Still working on the vacuum advance.......

Ok so upon checking out the vacuum advance at idle,  I notice that if I pull
the advance vacuum hose off at the distributor nothing happens......and it
feels like there is no vacuum either at the hose end or at the places
where it connects to the carb, weather at idle or if I give it some
gas......
So it seems as though the right connection to the carb is blocked off,  I
couldn't get a small nail to go through...and the left one seemed blocked
a little but I got a nail clear through,  so.........
The hose is free,   I pulled and sucked on both ends and was able to make
the point plate move and stay when I put my tongue over the end....
And yes the hoses are going to the right places,   the smaller one that is
connected to both carbs is the advance  and the bigger hose that just goes
to the left carb is in place and has vacuum,   when taking it off at idle
the RPM's go up a bit and then when I put it on the RPM's drop a bit,  so
it appears to be functional......
So are my carbs just messed up by the previous owner?  Please don't tell
me that I'm gonna need to take them out and have them serviced,  I am so
broke.........
This is a 73 bus with stock engine dual solexs  etc.......

Any pointers would be fabulous........
