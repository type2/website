I would like to offer thanks to Mr. Livingston. I hope this is useful to
you all.

After I made it I went over it and I intend to obtain for my tool kit
tubes of the following:
222 Low strength
246 Medium strength
266 High strength

I was surprised at how much of the bond strenth was lost at high
temperatures in most grades of loctite and am choosing the 246 and 266
grades specifically for their resistance to heat failure.  In addition the
266 is oil resistant which is good in used engines.

All that having been said, I have to say that I rarely use any sort of
thread locking substance.  I am far more likely to apply anti-sieze.  The
only situation where I apply a thread locker is when a fastener has
previously demonstrated that it will back out under vibration and even
then I tend to retorque once to be sure that the failure is on the part of
the fastener not the assembler (me).

                             OOK!
