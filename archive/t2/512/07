Subject: please report any problems (see message body) -- test message

My apologies for this. Our system administrator is once again testing a new
email filtering system. If this list receives multiple or strange/annoying
emails from my address (john(-at-)aircooled.net), please let me know so that I can
have the matter corrected.

Sincerely,
John
