Richard,

Very good work on the web page, as usual. You are a great "documentarian" of
all things relating to your bus, and it is very helpful to others.

I must say though, that steps 11-14 are not necessary. I never take any of
those parts off the engine, except the coil. You have to remove the two
bolts that hold the transmission bell housing to the upper trans mounts on
the frame, as well as disconnecting the shift rod from the transmission.
Then the entire engine/trans assembly will pivot downward and then the
engine will slide off the trans easily. Food for thought.
