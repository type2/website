Subject: Re: [T2] early bay doors on late bay?

Also, the front door hinges changed in 76(?). In my 74 (early hinge pattern)
I used an earlier door (no lock pin or whatever that thing next to the
window is called) successfully. This leads me to believe that early bay
(T2a) doors and early late (T2b up to 75) doors interchange. However, this
would contradict the librarian's advice. Note: I do not know what year my
door came off, I just know that it was a model without the lock pin on top.

With the help of my drill I could install all of the later hardware into the
early door.

Front door:

It isn't the latch that is the problem it is the bottom of the door.  the
later models (1973-9 have a footwell that the earlier (1968-72) models do
not have.  The early door just will not fit a later body.
