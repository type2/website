Gotcha here. I'll measure after work today. 

I'm a proud owner of a 1965 Beetle that I bought in Italy in 1993 (or so), brought it back to TN and discovered it was originally sold here in Memphis... This car has been around... <grin>

Any body in Type 2 land have a 60's Beetle? I need the dimensions
