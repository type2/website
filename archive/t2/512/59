Subject: Late Bay Kombi brochure

Hi all,
Does anyone out there have a VW brochure showing a Kombi fitted with a
middle front seat?
It's the ones that go between the driver and passenger seat over the walk
through section.
If so, could I get a copy of the page showing the picture.
I am fitting one to my bus and need to get approvals (transport department)
to convert from an 8 to a 9 seater. Being able to show it is a factory
accessory should make getting it approved much easier.
Thanks,
Richard,
Brisbane Australia.
