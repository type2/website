I just installed the click together laminate flooring on top of the
subfloor that was already there. It was 1/4" plywood IIRC. It works
great. Since I was already doing a bit of working w/ the bed I went
ahead and put it in the entire rear area so the bed was actually about
1/2" taller than it needed to be.
