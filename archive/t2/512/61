Subject: need shift rod coupler set screw

Esteemed list:

I have been working to reinstall my engine and trans after upgrading to an
091 and other work in my '70 Westy.  I managed to strip the brass set screw
(grub screw? that the safety wire ties through) that attaches the rear shift
rod coupler cage to the trans selector shaft.  (FYI, I tried a new coupler
cage and the &%$ aftermarket part wouldn't fit on the trans shaft).

Does anyone have one of these set screws laying around that they could drop
in the mail ASAP?  I will gladly compensate for postage and a nominal fee.
I think I will need to retap the hole, does anyone happen to know the thread
pitch?

TIA,
Will A.
