Hi Richard,

Here's my Dad's answer, he built this for his Vanagon westy to house 
his Nikon, CD,s and toll change.

DEFINITELY a one-off, but repeatable if someone wanted a clone made. If 
someone wants to pursue that email gord_AT_pottsfamily.ca. He and mom 
are tripping south to Florida with the Vanagon in a few weeks, so an 
east-coast delivery wouldn't be too hard to arrange. We'll also be at 
Everybus in April.

In the second pic you can see the gimbaled cup-holders neat the shift 
lever. Using those you never spill a drop!

Happy trails,
