 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

I saw that post about the wiper recall and thought to myself.....I know nhtsa did it for 67 and back but for
68??  So I did a check at www.nhtsa.org and only 4 recalls apply to 68 buses:

Make : VOLKSWAGEN Model : TYPE II Year : 1968
NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID Number : 68V002000  Recall Date : JAN 09, 1968
Component: SERVICE BRAKES, HYDRAULIC:FOUNDATION COMPONENTS:HOSES, LINES/PIPING, AND FITTINGS
Potential Number Of Units Affected : 14843


Make : VOLKSWAGEN Model : TYPE II Year : 1968
NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID Number : 68V070000  Recall Date : JUL 10, 1968
Component: SEAT BELTS:FRONT:WEBBING
Potential Number Of Units Affected : 293000


Make : VOLKSWAGEN Model : TYPE II Year : 1968
NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID Number : 67V081000  Recall Date : SEP 20, 1967
Component: POWER TRAIN:DRIVELINE:UNIVERSAL JOINT
Potential Number Of Units Affected : 1051


Make : VOLKSWAGEN Model : TYPE II Year : 1968
NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID Number : 67V107000  Recall Date : NOV 07, 1967
Component: LATCHES/LOCKS/LINKAGES:DOORS:LATCH
Potential Number Of Units Affected : 1764

*the wiper arm recall affected 67 and back:

Make : VOLKSWAGEN Model : VOLKSWAGEN Year : 1967
NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID Number : 72V256000  Recall Date : OCT 12, 1972
Component: VISIBILITY:WINDSHIELD WIPER/WASHER
Potential Number Of Units Affected : 3700000

 *Yes, the recall is dated Oct 12, 1972 but it applied to 67 year model vehicles:

Year:  1967
Recall Number:  72V256000
Summary:
THE SET SCREW LOCKING THE WINDSHIELD WIPER ARM TO THE DRIVING SHAFT MAY WORK LOOSE. IF THIS HAPPENS, IT WOULD
CAUSE ERRATIC WIPER OPERATION AND THE COULD CAUSE WIPER OPERATION TO CEASE ENTIRELY.
Consequence:
LOSS OF WIPER OPERATION WOULD IMPAIR ROAD VISIBILITYDURING INCLEMENT WEATHER CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN
AN ACCIDENT.
Remedy:
INSPECT AND REPLACE WITH NEW TYPE WIPER ARMS WHERE NECESSARY.
Notes:
SYSTEM: VISUAL SYSTEMS; WINDSHIELD WIPERS.VEHICLE DESCRIPTION: PASSENGER CARS; BK MODELS TYPE 1, TYPE 2, AND
TYPE 3.

*68 only wiper arms are harder to find than 68 only upper brake reservoirs!
The arm, part # 211 955 407C and pivot shaft # 211 955 221C were only used for the 68 model year, up to the
end with vin # 218 220 000. [66 and 67 pivot shafts are # 221 955 407B]

Your best repair would be to use 69 and up to the end of 72 arms and shafts. The pivot shaft number is 221 955
407E [originally D but subbed to E, the E fits 69 to 79]
To use the E shafts, you will need all the spacers and washers and nut from the 69+ wiper assembly. The
assembly itself would probably be the easiest way to do this upgrade. You would need one from a 69 to the end
of 72. 73 came with the black arms.
