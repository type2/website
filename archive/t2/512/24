Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Removal article

I have to agree with Scott here.  It is *much* easier to remove the 
engine if you allow the tranny to drop too.  That way you don't have to 
remove any tin at all.  Makes for a very quick removal.

However, Scott, I've never loosened the shift rod from the transmission. 
  Have I been killing that joint by not undoing it, or does it have a 
little bit of flex?

Nice work documenting the proccess, Richard!

thanks,
Mike
