Jamie Auch,

In light of your recent trip to school it seems that a torch would be a 
viable option. Heat the shaft where it meets the pulley. This should make it 
a bit easier. If you are going the way of a new gen. or alt. then a new 
pulley might not be much more. Let me know i probably have a couple lying 
around if you don't mind used.

Best reguards,

Michael Knight
