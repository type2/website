May be this is somehow overinformation but wanted to
give it anyway. the info might come in handy:

CABIN DOORS:
the general shape of the doors are the same only
differences:

- hinges, they changed with the introduction of
modelyear 1977 (=july-1976). If you want to place
doors with the other hinges you can use them but you
need to replace the hinges by drilling out the pin
somehow. I had it once done at my local VW dealer.

- the 'door catcher' changed somewhere during
modelyear 1977 (at chassisnr ..72 137 043) it is the
thing that prevents the door from opening too far. You
cannot place and older type of 'door catcher' in a
newer door or vice versa. The old door catcher in a
newer bus also gives problems. But by slicing some
metal of it will fit.

SLIDING DOOR
As said previously on the list: no changes happened to
it that wouldn't make it fit. Should be
'plug-and-play' in any case.


REAR HATCH
also said before: the mounting point of the hinges
changed with the introduction of modelyear 1972
(august 1971). Also the closing mechanism on the
bottom of the hatch changed. With some work you could
interchange these hatches but I would go for the right
hatch straight away, they;re not that hard to get I
think.


ENGINE HATCH
Beside the obvious change from old to new type at
modelyear 1972 there is one more change to it.
With modelyear 1977 the engine hatch got new hinges.
These are smaller than the previous ones. I don't know
if they are somehow interchangeable.

Summary (in MODELyears):

       new: 1977-1979
