Hi Richard,

After a little googling "hose pinchers" I found this site:

http://www.drivewerks.com/catalog/shopcart/TOOL/POR_TOOL_CAT586_pg6.htm

They appear identical in colour and such. They have a LIS22850 part number
which matches the Lisle website, so I am going to assume they are.

And at $5.50 that's a pretty good deal, although I found them for $4.32 US
here:
