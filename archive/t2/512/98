Hi Phillip,

If water is laying on top of the battery and it gets mixed with an 
electrolyte (salt, rust or residue from spilled battery acid), it could 
be passing current and slowly draining your battery.

The purity of rainwater varies immensely by location. If you're 
downwind of a major industrial area it can be very acidic, depending 
greatly on the type of industry.

If you live in a wet climate, you may want to consider putting your 
battery in a marine-style battery box to keep it clean. Keeping your 
battery and electrical connections clean is a helpful part of regular 
bus maintenance.

Happy trails,
