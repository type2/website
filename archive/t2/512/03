Front door:

It isn't the latch that is the problem it is the bottom of the door.  the
later models (1973-9 have a footwell that the earlier (1968-72) models do
not have.  The early door just will not fit a later body.

Slider:
The slider did not change shape and should fit all years although the
latches changed a bit over time.

rear upper hatch:
I don't know but I believe that the shape of the rear hatch was stable
from 1968 to 1979.  I worry that the shape may have changed from 1971 to
1972 with the change in engine hatch shape.

Rear lower hatch (engine lid):
The engine lid changed dimension in 1971/2 from the removable rear
crossbar to the fixed rear crossbar.  The 1968-71 hatch is taller. Then in
?1975/76? the hinges changed.  The 1972-?1975? hatch had two hinges each
attached by two screws to the body and two to the lid.  The ?1976?-1979
lid had two pins welded to the lid that fit into loops on the body.  One
loop was welded into place and the other had a single screw plate.

                             OOK!
