A garage at my complex finally became available so with Jason Thorpe's help
I was able to drop my engine this weekend. Those following along will
remember I developed a leak at the flywheel a couple of months back which
eventually started the clutch slipping.

This time around I took photos and wrote up the procedure for others to see
how easy it is:
