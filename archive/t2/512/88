Subject: Fuel Line Ratings

Hey,

I was going to replace the fuel lines on my 2.0 FI 76. Everything I read says
to be sure to use the "high-pressure" hose. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if my
local supplier's interpretation of "high-pressure" is the same.

Does anyone know an actual PSI rating I need to look for?

Thanks,

Mike
