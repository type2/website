I smell another article: in 15 easier steps!

This is the third time I've had the engine out and I've been doing it the
way I was shown. I mentioned the difficulty in the article but I've been
less adventurous with the combined drop without having seen it done.

At what angle is the engine when it slides off the transmission (this might
be easier with a simple jack that the atv jack)? Exactly how do you support
the transmission in the angled position?
