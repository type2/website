I called - one of the NAPAs here in Dallas used to do it, but no more.

Called 'em, they don't have any.  :-(
I also tried the VW dealers, they had touchup paint, but none in spraycans.

Any other ideas?
I really want some L90D in spraycans, but I can't deal with $30+ per can.
Are there any readily available alternatives that are decent quality and a 
close match?

Thanks,
