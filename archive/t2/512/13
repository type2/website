I looked in the partscatalogue on microfiche. It
displays no voltage info on the switches so I guess
the switches on the both versions (6v and 12v) were
the same.

Not really weird when you think of it. A Switch is a
pretty simple electrical thing. it just connects or
disconnects two pieces of metal. A relay or a wiper
engine is more sophisticated and they are 'voltage
sensitive'.

One thing on the emergency light switch: On the bays
this switch has a small bulb in it. You might need to
replace it for a 6v type.
