Subject: dellorto tuning

I am rebuilding my dellorto 36mm to go onto our 2.0l bus engine, few 
questions, one is the main jets are 122, the idle jets are 60 or 09 if Im looking 
upside down and the pump jet is 50. If someone has experience what do you think of 
these sizes for a 2.0l engine with a one step up cam, solid lifters and the 
rest stock. Looking for good long runner mostly highway driving. Also my other 
question is, in the book dellorto superfprmance it says to set the by pass 
screw at closed for first install but says nothing about this being adjusted, how 
do you know if you need to adjust this. Thanks Dylan
