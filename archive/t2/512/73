Subject: oil pressure problem

Hello Guys    here a good one for you just put together a 2 liter motor for a 
guy traveling that blew his all to hades, put the motor in and start it but 
we get no oil pressure  try priming the pump , check the pick-up tube,  start 
to think the pump wasn't working, so take off the filter and crank the engine 
getting good oil pressure at the filter, start scraching our heads , look at 
each other and say you don't think that new filter could be the problem do you?? 
Sure was !!!!  put on a different new filter and bingo we now have oil 
pressure. Just shows what I have been saying about getting good parts as being the 
second hardest thing about working on cars, with the people being the first 
hardest . Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  Salem Va
