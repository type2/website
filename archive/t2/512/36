Subject: 72 bus fuel tank sender

Hi all,

I am looking for a new sending unit for my 72 bus.  The one I have is 
bad and I need a new one so I can tell how much gas I have left.  
Anyone know where I can find one?  I checked the usual suspects and I 
am not feeling very lucky.

Thanks,

Dave Williams
