Ok, turns out the guy was wrong about the speed rating.  It's actually 
P (93 mph).  I wasn't too worried about that.  I top out at ~68 mph on 
flats anyway, and any faster than that down a hill, I think my head 
will explode before the tire will.

In any case, the drive home from the shop went nicely.  The ride was 
much quieter  and less bumpy than it was on the old (and somewhat 
cracked) tires.  I made a point of cornering hard on a couple of side 
streets before hitting the freeway, and the tires felt nice and 
stiff... no under-steer that I could feel, and the back-end of the Bus 
stayed on track.  Entry ramp onto the freeway was good.

The brand/model are Capitol Radial SV-820.  I snapped some photos of 
the sidewall markings and the tread.  The guy at the shop said that any 
Firestone shop should be able to order them.  I still think I got a 
pretty good deal at raw price of $50/wheel (all told, I got out for 
$389 including tax for all 5).
