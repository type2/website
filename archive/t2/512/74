Subject: Oil Pump Replacement Tips

Hi All:

Anyone have any tips on replacing a type IV oil pump with the engine in 
the car? I am working on a Vanagon. I will be dropping the main engine 
carrier, but not the whole engine and would like to avoid removing any 
tin or the fan shroud. Is this possible?

TIA
Regards,
