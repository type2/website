Subject: gas heaters for sale...

I've managed to get my hands on a stash of Eberspacher BN4 and BN2 gas
heaters.  All are in good shape, the fans spin, wiring and pumps in
place, fans spin freely.  I have a lot of ducting and misc mounting
hardware.
I'll be working on sorting and taking pictures in the next week or two.
If you are interested in something specific let me know.
Also, would the guy who was asking about a diesel heater a week or so
ago please pmail me, I might have something to interest you as well.

The BN2 heaters came with beetles and the BN4 were in busses, things and
typeIII's.
