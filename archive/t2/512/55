Subject: Generator melt down

Hi Folks,
I was on the way to school this morning in my '71, when all of a sudden
smoke starts pouring into through the vents.  I pull over grab the fire
extinguisher and head back to the rear of the bus.  Open the lid, not hot!
The generator was glowing and smoking.  The D+ post melted away!  What in
the world happened?
 

Joy Thru Air,
