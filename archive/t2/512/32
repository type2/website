Subject: Barn Door swap

My neighbor is restoring  a 1971 Bus and wants to remove the slider and
replace it with a set of barn doors off of a Splittie. He has the ability of
fabricating and welding but isn't sure if it is even possible. His concern is
that he doesn't want to mess around with the existing door pillars or have to
add or remove more than an inch all the way around and is concerned about the
different lines between the Splittie vs the Bay.Any ideas?
