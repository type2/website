Here is a brochure from 1971 and I am sure the '70 is similar:

And another (not on my site):

There are some good photos on the bottom of my "interior" page too:

If you have any camper interior pics I haven't shown please send them to me!
I do have some SunDial camper photos not yet loaded to the site.
