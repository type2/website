Subject: Online Swap Meets?

Hi All,


I am looking for a good used Brake Booster for my '74 Bus. I have been
searching around for a while, and boy are these things hard to come by. 
I really can't afford to get a new one for $170+core right now.

But in the process I was wondering about online swap meets..

are there any web sites devoted to the swapping/trading online  of VW
parts? What I envision is a place where you can look up parts with a
search engine and each result would have the part description and what the
owner was in need of, so you could offer a trade. They could in turn
accept or deny the trade. Just like a real swap meet....You could even
have managed lists of what you need so that it would find all compatible
matches for you.

Just like many of you, I'm sure, I have enough parts to build another bus
(maybe 2 or 3).... and I need a ton too. 


If there aren't any out there, I'm interested in creating one. I can
finally put that computer degree to work ;)

I'd like to hear some feedback on this.



Peace,

Eddie Goodwin
'74 Westy
