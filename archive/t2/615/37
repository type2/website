Subject: RE: [T2] Front Brakes- Squeaking and Hot

>>I'm not sure if the brakes were adjusted properly by the

first things first. what year bus? that will tell us if you have drum or
disc front brakes.

if your acceleration seems slow & the hubcaps/rims are getting hot then yes
i would say the brakes are binding/dragging.  first try adjusting them (get
the Muir book). if that doesn't work, inspect the brake hoses. the hoses are
usually the culprit & they aren't really expensive to replace if you don't
mind getting your hands dirty.
