Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS UPDATES: (Was Re: [T2] Hi all - long)

I sent a pmail to Greg about this yesterday. I have access to US
landline directory assistance data as a part of my job. Whether the use
of that access for validating phone numbers is legal is a question that
I can't really answer. I figure if we sell the data for that purpose, I
can too, so, I validated the numbers for Oregon and Washington by hand.

When I first started to look into this, I hadn't looked at the AIRS
list. I foolishly thought that I could easily download the entire list
and validate the whole thing en masse. Clearly, that's not possible. I
did 2 states to see if the output was valuable. Now that I've done it,
though, I don't know what to do with my results. Any ideas?
