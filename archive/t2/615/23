I love the VW bus because it is a "forever" vehicle. It's sturdy and utlitiarian and fits ALL lifestyles if you can keep the rust away (very possible). 

I meant a forever vehicle because you can drive it forever but right now mine is feeling like it might be forever before I start driving it... Of course if I could get innoculated against the procrastination virus I'd would have been mobile after last weekend but I did work on two friend's cars, do some porch (not Porsche) painting, yard mowing, yada yada yada. 

Congrats! And welcome back to the other side of life where car payments are shunned... <grin!>
