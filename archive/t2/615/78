Hi Joey,

I had not heard about an issue with the pop rivet on the 34PICT-3. Could you
give some more details?

Thanks,
Bill Moon

| Hello,
|
| go here: http://www.w-p-c.com/buggy3.htm
|
| and here: http://www.bostonengine.com/articles/009.html
|
| the most important thing with the 009 and 34 PICT 3 combo to make it work
| well is the pop rivet in the throtle plate in the carb.
|
| good luck,
