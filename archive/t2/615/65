One reason the retro thing may not have taken off in Europe is because the retro cars in question were still on the road. At least until the mid-90's you could buy a brand new Mini (old style with some updates) in Italy. Anyway alot of my Italian friends were not interested in the vintage cars (my Beetle especially), only in looking forward to the next new design. Maybe it comes from being surrounded by all those vintage cities... <grin!> 

I miss Europe (Italy especially)....
