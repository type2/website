Subject: 15" inch wheels - what tire size do you run

Okay, I've got a set of 15 inch wheels on their way here. What size do you run? I saw a bus on BajaBus that was running 205/75/R15 which looked GREAT but I am concerned about rubbing. Would happily go down to 205/65/R15 if necessary. MY CR-V uses 205/65/R15 stock and I am running 205/75/R15 with excellent results. Looks right, feels good, handles fine. Michelin tires. I LOVE my Michelin tires (as compared to the Bridgestones I had before) which wore out quickly, rumbled alot, and shook b/c I think 2 or 3 of them had broken belts inside. I wore out two sets in 85K miles. Thanks!
