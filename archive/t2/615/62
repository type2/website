Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS UPDATES

I agree....

I signed up for AIRS years ago and my info is way out of date. I sent an
update email a while ago but it's still not current.

However I would be hesitant to remove someone soley because they didn't
answer the phone if we call them to confirm their status. Maybe list them as
a "possible" or similar?
