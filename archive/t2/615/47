Actually this is fairly old news; they canned it a few months back  The
New Microbus would have only had sales potential in the U.S market, as
with the exception of the new Mini, this Retro craze is pretty much a
U.S. only phenomenon. (Even the New Beetle sold poorly in Europe.)  The
cost of producing a special model solely for the U.S. market was deemed
to be too high, particularly with the sagging value of the dollar.
Instead they plan to import a slightly reclad version of the T5 (Eurovan
replacement) to the U.S. in a couple of years, probably still billed as
the New Microbus. It will probably be priced out of the market just like
the Eurovan was, but at least their risk will be lower since it will
largely be an existing production model.

Frankly their decision was probably smart. The New Microbus, as they had
envisioned it, would have ended up being a $40k to $50k minivan at
current currency conversion rates. This is in sharp contrast to the New
Beetle, which, like the old one, was a relatively affordable car. For
that matter, it's in sharp contrast to every other commercially
successful "retro-mobile" (Miata, PT Cruiser, Mini), all of which were
affordably priced. Plus, the New Microbus' styling didn't evoke the old
Microbus nearly as well as the New Beetle evoked the old one. I think
the concept was fatally flawed from the start.
