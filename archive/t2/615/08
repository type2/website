Subject: 72 VAN FOLD DOWN SEAT

Hello,

I have noticed an original sign in my van that
leads me to believe that there was once a fold down
seat (beside the seat behind the drivers seat) attached to
the sink/ice cooler. does anyone have a picture
of theirs that i could look at so i could build one like this?

Thank you,
Darren
