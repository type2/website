Did you read this article by Ken Hooper:

http://type2.com/library/electrip/bosch009.htm

I'm pretty new to all of this and I have the same carb. But it seems best to 
time it at high RPM as the 009 advances a little unpredictably, so you want 
to rev it until it stops advancing and then time it to the specs in the 
article. I get the feeling some listees will support this method and some 
won't.
