Subject: Windshield revisited

Sending this again in response to George's question to Chris.

The quoted material program ate it the first time even though i had 
snipped a lot out of the original...George, can we make the program a 
little less Nazi like??<grin>

Here is the reply.

George,

My Experience has been the same as Chris's reply later.

The guy that did the front windshield on my Champagne edition said the 
same thing.  Pretty much every windshield is made by either one factory or 
the other.

When I broke my 79 convertible windshield trying to put it back in, I 
called him and he got a new glass the next day and then I took the car 
over to him on Saturday morning.  

We had to cut some "teeth" out of the bottom side of the metal lip that he 
said they only used for about two years because of DOT regulations...he 
said that those were why I broke it when I tried to install it.

We took them out with a chisel, cleaned up the edges and the vert 
windshield went right in like every other VW windshield and glass I have 
ever installed.  This guy has been in the business for along time and 
loves VW's too...

Sounds like Chris got someone who cared!  A rare find in this day and age.

I *have* seen some Mexican bug windshields that were *not* correctly 
shaped, and leaked....I still have it if anyone wants it<grin>.


Cheers, dave
