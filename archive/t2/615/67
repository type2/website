You guys are all nailing it. Now if VW would listen...

I love my 73. But you have to admit that just the regular maintenance
(not counting the repairs necessary for a 30 year old vehicle) is a
little intimidating for most folks.

So take an existing vehicle, strip it down, and market it as a bus.
Low dollar investment for VW. But sticking a peace sign on a stripped
EV would work for marketing. Hah! Even take the crying bus memorial
image and make it smile. (Though that may offend some...) They could
use the smallest engine in the stripped version... 1.8 IIRC?  5-speed
tranny, MacPhereson struts, and steel 15" wheels would be a cheap
vehicle. (I think they'd have to "cute-ify" it some but still minimal
investment.)
