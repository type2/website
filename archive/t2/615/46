Take it apart and DIP CLEAN it anyway. There's crud in the idle circuit and
it just happened to vibrate loose. There's probably more in there that will
plug it back up at some point in the near future.

And remember, when fiddling with the volume screw use only two fingers on
the screwdriver held loose enough that when it hits bottom your fingers
slip and the screwdriver drops. If you turn that screw hard into the bottom
a few times it will wallow out the needle seat and never work right again
-- and no way to repair it.

Where are you located? I have one sitting in the Rivi that came from the
'74 hardtop. I am replacing it even though it was only on the '74 for 180
miles. The oil cooler got hit and it is oil soaked.You could probably soak
it in Simple Green then rinse several times in warm water and have it good
as new. Or install and use as is, just gets your hands black and messy
every time you touch it.

I'm headed out for Jerome in about 20 minutes, hope you read this by then.
If someone at Jerome is headed back your way I can send it by them. If not,
I can ship it when I get home next week.
