Subject: Online Swap Meet; Power Brake Booster

Hello Eddie,
             Go for it!  I think your idea is a very good one.  You could start 
with a site specific to VW parts.  Once you develop the software, independent 
of brand of car, you can offer the package to the various clubs or perhaps 
several entrepreneurs.  The immediate objection you will hear is, "That already 
exists; it is called eBay."  AYMK, it takes a good bit of effort to list an 
item on eBay, whereas with a product array [part number hierarchy] the picture 
is more a confirmation, not a basic necessity.  Your service users would only 
have to input part numbers.... quick and easy.  And remember eBay started as a 
local online kind of swap meet 'way back when ;-))

On the subject of your brake booster, years ago I went everywhere to get a 
decent price on a booster for a 71 Type 2, after a failure.  I lost the first 
replacement before I discovered that the clown who previously owned the bus had 
left out the check valve (he said during an engine r+r) and the booster was 
sucking gas fumes, ruining the rubber bladder/diaphragm.  My message: be damn 
sure the check valve is in place and functioning correctly!

Subject: Online Swap Meets?

I am looking for a good used Brake Booster for my '74 Bus. I have been
searching around for a while, and boy are these things hard to come by. 
I really can't afford to get a new one for $170+core right now.

But in the process I was wondering about online swap meets..

are there any web sites devoted to the swapping/trading online  of VW
parts? What I envision is a place where you can look up parts with a
search engine and each result would have the part description and what the
owner was in need of, so you could offer a trade. They could in turn
accept or deny the trade. Just like a real swap meet....You could even
have managed lists of what you need so that it would find all compatible
matches for you.

Just like many of you, I'm sure, I have enough parts to build another bus
(maybe 2 or 3).... and I need a ton too. 

If there aren't any out there, I'm interested in creating one. I can
finally put that computer degree to work ;)
