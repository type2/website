Ahhhh, Mike, been there and done that several years ago.

My decision was that it was stop and smell the roses time for
some reason beyond my understanding...enjoy it(as best you can) cause 
something else better will be here soon...mostly in the form of
a new bus, at least for now...who knows what's around the corner!

I made a decision recently to start driving my restored 78 at least a day 
a week...I *love* buses(and driving them!).

Cheers, dave
