Subject: Anyone traveling from/through Fresno to Jerome?

The short story is that I bought a '72 Sundial from a well-know high profile
seller who advertised the bus with the "best part of the bus is a fully rebuilt
2.0L and a tall tranny". I bought the bus pretty much based on the mechanicals.
A 1972 model year does nothing for me in particular but I needed dependable-
halfway economical transportation.

I bought the bus, paid extra dollars (to the point at which I want to puke) to
get it through Arizona State emissions.

And then the motor took a dump. The seller will not stand up to his word or
reputation. I am not quite at the point of calling professional help.

A friend who lives in Fresno has a core motor that is mine for the price of
shipping. He is unable to/not scheduled to travel to Jerome this year.

Is anyone traveling from or through Fresno and attending Jerome?
I could *REALLY* use the help this time around.
Please contact me via pmail at ellisjames at yahoo dot com if you might be able
to haul a core long block to Jerome, Arizona this coming weekend (Sept
11-12/2004)
Thanks,
Jim Ellis
