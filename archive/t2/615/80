I thought I was the only one noticing the riding mower thing... $2500 for a mower that does the same work that my $999 Sears does which honestly does exactly what my $150 Murray 6 HP does given enough time to do it - and it is good for my midsection which needs all the help it can get. The Sears tractor now 5 years old and in it's senior years due to 3 seasons working a route with me. It's not the mower I would pick twice for the work I made it do, but it served it's purpose - moiwed alot of yards to help us build savings to buy a house and get our vehicles to a decent place. VW Westy STILL in progress. I don't call us Team Slowpoke for nothing... <grin!> 

I drove several passenger and cargo versions of the Fiat Ducato (2.5L diesel, 5 on the tree) and Mercedes (???) vans and thought they were a good balance between comfort and utility. The turbo Ducato was great. Plenty of power and mileage. Durability? I don't know. Several of the vans we had were 200K km vehicles so, not too bad. The went through some steering boxes, some shifters, etc. Constant abuse though so they were doing pretty good.

Carried people, seats were pretty good, reasonable noise - better than Baywindow, no a/c but that was an option. 

No hydraulic leveling suspensions to break, no NAV systems to break, no leather to tear, no power windows to fail, no power locks to quit (like my Honda whose driver's door needs a new lock motor), no etc, etc. If you want a NAV system, add it, want a fancy stereo? Add it. etc. etc. 

As each of these items fails, remove and replace. Because it is not built in, it is easier to repair and replace unlike the touch screens in the fancy cars that prob cost the same as two Civics and a Golf.
