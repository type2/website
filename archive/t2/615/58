Mike,

What is actually interesting on this one to me is that I have two friends 
with buses(and one in the VW business) and the both bought Honda 
"Elements".

They claim that it is what VW should be doing(bus wise).

The price is definitely right.  A 78 Champagne edition bus listed at about 
$6900 and if you run that thru the inflation calculator, you come out a 
slightly less than $20,000 in current dollars(2002).

Would you buy a new baywindow for $20,000????  with the current
2.0l engine and add about $1500 for A/C?

The real question is, would anyone else?


Probably should have been a Friday topic, but I couldn't resist!

Cheers, dave
