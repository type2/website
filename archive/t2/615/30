For Michael Knight:

Mike, where are you located?  I see that you have a '77 but are looking for 
a set of 1700 bus P&C, reasonable priced.  What's up??

I bought a set (new, but on the shelf for about 3-5 years) of 1700 P&C for 
my '72, but I did not have to use them.  It seems my '72 was clean and fresh 
after I pulled the heads.  The '72 engine is 'almost' ready for final 
install, so the 1700 's I have are extra.

I am in Nothern Virginia.
