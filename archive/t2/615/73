Subject: Re: [T2] No new Type II

I too agree with most of what has been said on this topic. I thought it was 
just really disturbing when they quit selling the EV in the US.  It just 
seems that if someone wanted to go to a dealer and buy a brand new Westfalia 
they should be able to do so, even if it is insanely priced.

So they quit making the EV to possibly build up demand for the new bus and 
then scrapped that idea which was probably wise. I just don't really like 
the direction VW had headed. It sounded like they were only going to offer 
the Tiptonic transmission on the new bus and I wouldn't ever touch it. The 
claims that it's a manual/auto hybrid are wrong, it's an auto tranny where 
you can select the gear you are on, if you feel like it. That alone would 
keep me from ever buying one as auto trannies have been a major week spot 
for VW and I don't think that has changed. And once your warrenty is gone 
and your Tiptonic tranny goes out you are screwed.

And they've said they are going to develop like a next generation EV that 
will sell in the US but it's quite a few years away. We'll see what they 
come up with.

And I just have formed this opinion that there are good VWs and great VWs. 
And all of the great VWs were made in Germany.  I just think the VWs made 
outside of Germany and especially Mexico are just not of the same quality. I 
think the late 80's early 90's VWs are often overlooked. The Scirocco's, 
GTI's, Jetta's, Cabby's are all awesome cars and built to last like our old 
buses.
