Does that mean that the Cofaps would be like bottom of the scale in quality. 
These are for a stock engine and not a daily driver. Of course who builds an 
engine that is not Hi-Pro and not expect atleast Daily Driver durability. It 
sounds like I need to lean toward the AA or Mahle. But if it turns out to be 
that they are indeed Mahle would it make much difference to go with the 
Cofaps?
