Subject: Re: [T2] 72 VAN FOLD DOWN SEAT

I need to add another seat to our bus, and expected to have to chuck
the sink for this.
A center seat sounds interesting.  I noticed a couple of threaded
holes below the seat belt snap attachment which I figured were for
more seat belts, but maybe it's related to more seats.
Anybody know if the drivers side rear facing seat will fit OK in place
of the sink? Expect just to try it, but might as well ask.
