Subject: No Carb Rebuild Needed (yet)

Well, shoot. I dunno what happened. 

I drove my bus to work today and once I had driven it a couple miles
it stopped idling. Now the adjustments work. Go figure.

Muffler is still together, though the cheap paper gaskets that came
with it disintegrated. Loud again. Sigh. Need to get the good aluminum
ones I spose. Only shop I know of that has 'em is VWparts.net in
Huntington. And, of course, they close at 6pm.

I still need a foam cooling seal. The duct tape I've got on there
keeps blowing off. Too hot to drive without...
