Go down to the local auto parts store. There is a Nissan gasket that fits the '72-'74 heater box to muffler and another triangular seal that fits the '75-'78 exhaust. I was in a pinch one day, worked at a FLAPS and went looking. Many stores will allow you to rumage through the gaskets with an employee looking on.
