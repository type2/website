Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Tires  ?

If you have Les Schwab Tires near you, they have a Jupiter SV-820 in
the correct size (185R14) rated at 1875lbs. 809 rev's per mile, 25.7"
diameter, if you're trying to figure out how well your new set will
work with your speedo. When I bought them (Pearl District Les Schwab),
the mgr said that he'd sold that tire onto 4 buses in the previous
couple of weeks. Other listees?
Personally, I like Les Schwab for their lifetime free rotation and road
side assistance for tire failures, free mounting, etc. No, I don't work
for them. I got a full set 2 months ago (plus a spare), and they have
treated me very well. Very little wander, good traction in rain, solid
over potholes, not very loud, firm ride (but not uncomfortably stiff),
corners well. The SV-820 is the same code as another listee found in
the "Capitol" name in the Bay Area. I don't know for sure if they're
the same tire, but they might be. In the Library, there's a whole
section dedicated to tires. I don't know how recently it was updated,
but that might be a good place to start your research.
Good Luck,
