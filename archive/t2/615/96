Subject: CT Bus for sale

While trying to avoid bumper to bumper traffic on I95 in CT I found a bus for sale. It's off exit 61 in the Madison area. Didn't get good look but is a parts bus!!!! Looks like a Riveria with no canvas. Had $150.00 on window. Let me know if you need more directions or would like me to stop and take pictures tomorrow(Thursday).

P.S.  LOCATION: IT IS IN CT !!!!! NOT MINE!!!!!!!
