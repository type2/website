Subject: Front Brakes- Sqeaking and Hot

Hi All,

My front brakes seem to be binding a little... It's fine if I go only five
miles or so, but if I make a longer trek the front wheels begin to whistle.
When I hit the brakes the sound goes away until I release them again.  It gets
louder the farther I go, when I stop to inspect the hub caps are hot!  The bus
also starts to feel like it's being held back during acceleration from a
stopped position... I'm not sure if the brakes were adjusted properly by the
PO, as he had just spent some $$$ having the brakes done.
What could this be?

Thanks,

Tom
