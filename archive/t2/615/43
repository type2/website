Volks,

I was just reading in the Oct issue of VW Trends that Volkswagen has
decided not to produce the New Bus.  (Bottom blurb on pg6) Ok, I'm not
really crying but has anyone seen my hanky? 

I realize that the new would/could not have the elegant simplicity of
the original.  But it would have been a powerful corporate voice
whispering the historical importance of the original.  Now it seems all
we have gotten was a cough, sneeze, snort through the nose.  Do you
think they are embarassed by us?  Damn you VW, don'y you know we don't
ALL wear tye-dye shirts and religiously follow the Grateful-Dead year
after year?  My wife the real estate agent would have loved to have had
to one parked in the driveway as a rolling monument to familial and
automotive soidarity.

Oh well, it is nice to have the yet to be named original in the
driveway.  I came home from the grocery store earlier and a guy driving
another bay window waved at me, and I waved back.  I see the same from
the old Beetle drivers also - but I suspect the new Bus owners would be
moritified by this the same way the rice cannon exhaust equipped New
Bettle owners seem to.
