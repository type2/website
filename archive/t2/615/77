I believe that brochure is for a '72. That's when they started putting the
vinyl covering on the cupboard doors and if you look close you can tell
that it has the later taillights.

Here's a page I created for my '71.
http://home.comcast.net/~sonofed/71AW.htm

A friend of mine has an early '68 that I believe is an Adventurewagen but
it has a couple of minor differences from the other early AWs I've seen
plus it has a sticker claiming it to be from another vendor. In spite of
the sticker I think it is an AW and the sticker probably is for a sales
lot where the conversion was originally sold. I'll get some pictures up
soon.

Also, you should join the Adventurewagen Yahoo group at:
