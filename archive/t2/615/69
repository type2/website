Dodge has done this with the Sprinter (Mercedes). However... The Sprinter is still REALLY expensive - even for the empty delivery van models. A camper would be $50K+! Empty LWB Sprinter van is still in the high $20K range which to me is absurd. 

all that siad if i can get twice the mileage out of an expensive vehicle as 2 cheaper vehicles (Mercedes vs. Chevy or similar) then you are still on the right track. 

We've got a friend with a Eurovan that has gotten excellent mileage out of their's. 240K miles? Same tranny?
