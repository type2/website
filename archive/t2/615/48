Subject: Re:Front Brakes- Sqeaking and Hot

Tom,
    In your post you said...."My front brakes seem to be binding a
little"

Last year I had a brake problem that sounds just like yours.  I
noticed that the brake pedal wasn't returning all the way up when I
took my foot off the pedal.  It was staying down maybe an inch, or
less.  Essentially the brakes were still "on" just a little bit.
After you use your brakes and release them put your toe UNDER the
brake pedal and see if you can pull it up a little more.  In my case
it took nothing more than a good cleaning of the brake pedal pivot
bushing and bolt to fix the problem.  It seems the 30+ year old grease
was stronger than the return spring on the pedal.  A good cleaning and
some new grease solved the problem.
