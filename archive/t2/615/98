Already done, but the page holding the images is down at the moment.

I did a series of sad and smiling splitties and bays based on the original
drawing (or rather a t-shirt image of the graphic).  Created both JPG and
GIF images in B/W and in color.  The link is
http://www.cfnson.com/melas/other/vwbus.html, but my site is temporarily
down.

Including the original graphics, there are 18 images, plus one done to look
like my own bay (white on red color scheme).
