Hey hey, aint busses grand? I'm on my first one, and don't plan on
ever driving anything else. I don't even miss the high speed cornering
of my old Honda Prelude anymore. Not much anyway. Glad to hear someone
else has re-realized what's valuable in life. :)  My bus (76) has car
tires on it right now too for a few more days, and it goes all over
the place, so it probably is just your tires eh? Do you have a name
for it yet? Mines 'The Troll'. Oh, don't forget to replace your fuel
lines man. Mine were just about crumbling when I got it home!

Take it easy
