Subject: re work Eurovans

About 3 or 4 years ago, there were some 1 ton Eurovan vault vans for sale for
about $25000 Canadian. They were stripped down work trucks. They had a 5
cylinder Audi diesel engine, with a standard transmission. I saw one once
where someone camperized one, it was okay but with no windows...
He said it was geared low, so at 75mph it was redlined, which I didn't like at
all. It was a work truck.

< As far as the T5 Eurovan, V W does make those in stripped versions. On my
last trip to Germany a friend had rented
one, very plain jane. Cardboard panels as in an early commercial bus. Plain
gray vinyl upolstery on all the seats
including the middle and back. 5 speed manual trans and a TDI engine. If any
of you are familar with Dustun Reitz
(sp), I have heard through the grapevine that he is going to, or is trying to
import a few of the stripped Eurovans to
the U S. I just wonder if they are allready available in Canada.>
