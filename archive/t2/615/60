Subject: Headlight switch, 78 Westy

I have a disconnected headlight switch with terminals : X, 58, 58b, 30, and 
56. The wire colors are yellow/black, red, gray,white/black, and red/white.
Can anyone help with a number to color match ? I've tried the Bentley 
Manual but can't get it for certain, Sure would appreciate any help or advice.
