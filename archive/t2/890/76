Subject: front disk brake conundrum

Whenever I apply the brakes, Lurch pulls to the right.  It's been doing 
this for some time now.  I had a front end alignment and new ball 
joints last year (or was it a couple of years ago?).

I took the wheels off to inspect the brakes.  The pads are more worn on 
the left front brake than on the right front brake.  Isn't that 
counterintuitive to the symptoms (or am I missing something)?
