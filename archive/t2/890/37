Subject: 2 questions, fuel tank resto and cooling tin screw spec

Hey folks,

Q1: 

Those who have restored the fuel tank, what did you use to re-pad the tank when you put it back.  I am referring to the (horsehair?) heavy felt pads the go between the tank and where the tank goes.  Also, how is the tank grounded, I guess there will be contact, but maybe not if I pad the tank really well.

Q2:

I have googled and looked through the archives and a bunch of other places, but I could not find the specifications for the cooling tin cheese head screws.  I am wanting to get a box or two of these in 18-8 from Mcmaster-Carr.  So, if anyone knows the thread pitch, diameter, length of these, please let me know.

Thanks

Bob H.
