>>> My bus has an under dash A/C unit (not currently working) and I'm not
sure how the hoses to the A/C unit should be attached.

I found what I needed for the A/C unit on ratwell.com - thanks Richard for a
great reference site!

I still would not mind seeing a picture if someone has one.

Thanks again,
