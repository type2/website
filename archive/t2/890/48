If you are doing an upright engine, get a dozen or so hex head screws as
well as the slotted or phillips screws.  There are a few places where it
makes your life a lot easier to use the hex head screws where there is no
head-on access.  Examples are the ends of the fan shroud, the two lower
screws of the generator tin, and that screw on the doghouse
tin.
