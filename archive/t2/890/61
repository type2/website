Subject: Re: [T2] rough idle

Hi Darren,

An uneven idle means that the cylinders are not producing a balanced  
power pulse. Either one is too strong or (more likely) too weak.  
There are a variety of causes for this, but it always boils down to  
the same three needs that every engine has: Gas, Air and Spark.

Since you know the timing dwell are good, the next step is to verify  
the spark at all 4 plugs, and check the plugs themselves. If you  
don't have a fat juicy spark at the coil then it might be time for  
new wires and coil. You might as well test compression while you have  
the plugs out... that will tell you if the valves and rings are OK.  
Next item would be to check the injector spray would also be a good  
idea to verify that all 4 are spraying evenly.... A blocked up or  
misfiring injector will also make for a lumpy idle.

Happy trails,
