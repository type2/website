	When you get over here to the obscure S. Pacific, you can see 
in The Southward Museum  -  one of the world's greatest motor museums 
- the Cadillac limo ('53 if I recall) of one Micky Cohen, a Los 
Angeles gangster  -   extra steel floor welded in throughout, and  - 
yes  -  1" thick windows.  No wonder this vehicle weighs 4 ton.
