Subject: RE: [T2] funny sign

I'm still sorry that I didn't get a picture of a sign that had me  laughing for years.  Actually it's the company name: Stubbs Limb  and Brace.  I was going to send that in to Leno.  Now they've  changed it to:  Stubbs Prosthetics and Orthotics.  Still  funny but much more subtle.  Cheers...KR

My favorite is the road signs I've seen down south, which say RESUME SAFE
SPEED.  Which, I suppose, means that prior to reaching the sign you were
permitted to drive at an unsafe speed...
