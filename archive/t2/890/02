That's a good question. Here's a good answer: You'd only be able to use the
top 10% or so of the tank.

The float chamber is, what, half way or so up the tank? Then there
variations in road angle. If you were pointed down you'd be screwed.

The idea is valid though. When my 73's tank was rusty I was able to run with
a hose to a gas can above the carbs. But I only used it for testing and
moving from one parking space to another until I got the tank relined.
