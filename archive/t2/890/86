Subject: My Luck, got to share it with someone

You won't believe my luck.  My back's been giving me a lot of trouble lately.
Last night weather was good, cool in garage, and my back wasn't to bad.  So I
hooked up the fuel lines, brake booster lines (yea on a Split) and thought I'd
finally fire it up today.  Back is hurting pretty bad, but I thought what the
heck, I just wanted to start it and see if it ran OK so I can start block
sanding.  Anyway, cranked with one of those remote start deals to get the oil
pressure up and it wouldn't fire.  Checked for spark and current everything
checked good.  During this time noticed oil leaking at adapter for Oil cooler
(remember T4 upright with T4 cooler).  Took it apart (thank god I installed a
Baywindow engine service door) checked the seals and put some permagasket
around them.  Done this 3 times and it still leaked.   Last time looked online
to order new seals (and fuel pump, more on that) noticed T1's used 8mm and
T4's use 10mm thick ones.  Guess which ones I was sold and never noticed.  Yea
8mm, no wonder it won't seal.  So I hope the local shop has 10mm ones.

Now the fuel pump, I'm using electric pump (rotary style with internal
regulator).  Checked current OK, pulled line at pump and fuel to it.  Pulled
line coming out and no fuel, and pump was hot as anything, Bad pump.

I've got to be the only person in the VW community that has Oil coolers blow
(original reason for this latest delay) go bad before it's even on the road.
Pump may be my fault. the gas had gummed up so I sprayed the pump with some
carb cleaner, maybe I damaged it.  Any way thanks for listening, if you
haven't deleted by now.  Had to tell someone, beside the wife.  All she says
is how much is that?
