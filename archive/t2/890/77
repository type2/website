Subject: More 30 PICT 2 questions...

First of all, thanks to Mark Dearing for sending me a few of the float pin retainers.  I had some
time yesterday afternoon and bolted the top of the carb down.

Now for my second question.  The 30 PICT 2 from my '69 Westy has never had an idle cut off valve
on it (or at least I've never seen it).  It just has this fitting in the port:

Which looks like someone just cut off the threaded end of the valve.  But I've also read (and seen
in the Bentley) that on this carb, the cut off valve was combined with a pilot jet.  

Do I need to get a cut off valve to fit into this port to plug the hole?  Or can I just make up
some kind of plug to fill it in?  Muir makes some mention of VW selling a plug to replace cut off
valve, but I've never seen this referenced anywhere else.
