Subject: Re: [T2] Bus No Start -- Me Very Stumped

Good advice, Don.

I'd only add a suggestion to check the voltage of the battery with a  
quick headlight test, and then follow through with checking the  
entire starting current path.

Both ends of each of these wires need to be clean and tightly connected:
	Battery + terminal to starter.
	Starter + Terminal to ignition switch.
	Ignition switch to starter solenoid.
	Starter Body to transmission.
	Transmission ground strap to vehicle frame.
	Ground strap to battery - terminal.

If the headlight test shows a dim light, you have a weak battery or  
bad connections to the battery. The FI system needs a minimum of  
10.5V to function.... below that the starter will still turn but the  
injectors will not open. Occasionally I can bump-start a bus with a  
weak battery, as there is sometimes enough power remaining to run the  
starter OR the FI system, but not both at once. Not an option if you  
have an auto transmission though.

Happy trails,
