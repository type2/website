Teh screws on my Bus are actually 6mmx1.0px12mm stainless *bolts* with 
stainless washers
under the head.  I replaced all of them when I dressed the new 
longblock a couple years back,
the old engine had a mixture of chewed-up phillips, chewed-up slotted, 
and "missing".

'course, I also took the time to strip, sand, prime and repaint the tin 
and chase the threads with
a tap afterwards.  I had a *lot* of free time on my hands back then, 
and not much to do. :-)
