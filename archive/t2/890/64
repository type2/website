I've got a vacuum leak somewhere. I've checked all spark plugs, except
#3, and the cones are white. I have new (rebuilt) injectors with new
seals ready to put in as soon as I get my 944S running again so I have
a car to drive. #3 has my CHT sensor. Didn't want to disturb it quite
yet.  I've got new wires (Magnecor). Haven't been able to check
compression yet. I have good power and all RPM ranges, just a rough
idle. But it's not nearly as bad when I run 93 octane. I've got a new
SVDA and a new Crane XR700 ready to go in too. Hopefully, once all
this is done, my engine will purr again.
