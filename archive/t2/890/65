Subject: Re: [T2] Westy florescent interior light

Does the light between the front seats work?  On my 76 they are  wired together or at least to the same fuse.  If so, it could be  the wire that runs between them.  Let me know what you figure  out.  Congrats and Cheers...KR

I just picked up a really sweet '76 Westy and with a little work I've got the
fridge and sink pump working again, but the florescent light above the sink
does not have any power. The fuses in the fuse box are good and so are the
in-line fuses I've located. The light comes on when I put some juice to the
light assembly with a battery so I know that works. Is there another in-line
fuse somewhere I'm missing? Has anyone re-wired one these successfully?
