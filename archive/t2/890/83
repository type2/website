Subject: [T2] 78 rear brake shoe surprise

Started a brake job on the rear of the 78 VW
ASI/Riviera last week to find most of the rear brake
hardware kit to be unused.  The brake shoes didn't use
the hold-down springs, and the rear brake backing
plate had no holes to accommodate them.  Apparently VW
simplified their rear brake configuration in the late
seventies.
