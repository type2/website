Jim (and list),

I think your idea of checking the cold start injector is good...but here
is some more:

My FI engine expertise is limited...but in the two FI VWs (a 77 Bus
and an 80 Vanagon Westy) vehicles I have owned, the are several things
that I have had go wrong (and fixed):

1) On the 77, the engine would randomly quit. After a little messing
around, I replaced the coil. Problem solved.
2) Various problems, from no start, to running like crap. Unplugged
vacuum line(s). Plugged in, and problem solved.
3) Decel valve causing a no start condition. Disconnected (and plugged
appropriate) vacuum lines. Problem solved.
4) Is it a Cali model? How about the idle doo-dad (probably not it, but
worth mentioning)
5) How about the air bypass valve? I know that will cause things to run
like crud when cold. But, it should start even with a bad one.
6) Grounds, grounds, and grounds.
7) Since you checked the ECU, that would mean the AFM connections are
good. Right?
8) I think you said you replaced points, right?
9) I don't remember, but is there a hall sensor?

Three things: air, spark and fuel. Problem is with the $#(-at-)(-at-)$# VW FI
engines, those are hard to check/measure.

As usual, I've gotta say I really hate VW FI. Not that I would ever
replace it with carbs, 'cause that is trouble as well.

If I still had a VW FI, I'd consider a megasquirt!

;)
