	This need not be true.
	A further entry on the long list of good
inventions we can't get is the PowerBeat battery
-  two 12-V batteries within a std case,
connected by a small epoxy-sealed box on top.
Leave the headlights on and you can run down one
6-cell part, but the other part is kept insulated
so that it can easily run the starter & ignition
to get you going again  -  the two parts then
both get charged.
	As it happens, the inventor is a friend
of mine, Assoc-Prof Evan Bydder U of Waikato (now
rtd  -  like me).  I tested one on a van of mine.
It worked fine (but met only modern standards of
quality  -  lasted only 3 y).  I'm ashamed to say
it was made in Bahrein rather than in NZ where we
used to make many good lead-acid accumulators.
	Bydder's invention relies on a small
piezoelectric detector of movement within the
epoxied box  -  movement of a few-mm ball in a
very shallow dish.  The default condition, in
absence of even small motions of the battery, is
that the two parts are disconnected.  Opening the
door, and the other movements of the vehicle
essential to trying to start it, suffice to
reconnect the two batteries.  Slam the starter
motor across that soon afterwards and you're away.
	I regret this invention has not been
brought to widespread availability.  It still
could.  The frustration of its manufacture
(corporation PowerBeat.) is a crazy chronicle
which someone should write up fully; I have only
glimpses of this Cleese-type story.
	It's Friday in NZ today.
