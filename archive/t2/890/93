Hey Chris  Just because they have been replaced does not mean that  they are 
still good.  Good quality parts are getting harder to get every  day.. You can 
check them by opening the bleeder and /or the connections at the  lines to 
see where and when they release. Work your way from down line nto the  wheel 
clylinder and see what happens .  It could also be the caliper  itself or the 
pads stickink in the caliper.  later  Mark  Dearing
