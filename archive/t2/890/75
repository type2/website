The carbs won't help here JIm.

What sounds like is happening is the ingnition is only staying on when
the switch is in the start mode---

Release the switch and the ignition shuts off.

It could very well be the double realy which supplies current from the
battery to the control unit and the injector's when the ignition is
turned onis malfunctioning.

Check them out.

Check all the pins at the Air flow sensor for juice.
