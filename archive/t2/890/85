Some success!

Replaced points. Old ones definitely had the tit/pit syndrome.
Replaced distributor cap/rotor.  Also replaced the distributor spring.
The old one was shorter and didn't have as much tension. The new
spring pushed the distributor up until the hold down bolt was
tightened. The old one didn't.

Results:  Rock solid tach reading. Dwell is now 44. Timing 7.5BTDC and
          it too is rock solid. The engine still has a slight shimmy but
          mostly goes away once warmed up. I'm going to attribute that
          to my FI injector seals.
