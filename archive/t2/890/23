Hi,

Got a call via the AIRS list! Please help!!!

The problem is that there is a oil drip (the size of a golfball) from
the edge where the engine meets the bell-housing.
On a incline the dripping is significantly more (the size of a baseball).

The oil drip goes all the way up to the starter.

Trying to figure out what the problem is. Seems like the front main seal
is shot.

Not sure if the seal is in enough,  as it was done rather recently.

Also, not sure that the case halves line up in the right spots.

If you can help contact me or Becky (-at-) 540-230-7165

She's got a '79

Cheers,
Harry
