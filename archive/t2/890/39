Those  who have restored the fuel tank, what did you use to re-pad the tank 
when you  put it back.  I am referring to the (horsehair?) heavy felt pads the 
go  between the tank and where the tank goes.  Also, how is the tank  
grounded, I guess there will be contact, but maybe not if I pad the tank  really well.




hello Bob  I use old inner tubes cut into strips for this  padding.  There is 
a separate ground wire that goes to the body for the  sending unit.  I would 
also POR 15 or Rust bullet the surounding area while  the tank is out.  later
