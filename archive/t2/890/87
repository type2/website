From the looks of the diagram in the Bentley, the cutoff valve
incorporates a pilot jet that mixes air from the top of the carburator
with fuel from the float bowl and delivers the mix to the pilot jet.  It
seems that the cutoff valve open and shuts a metered jet that delivers the
fuel/air mix to the idle needle valve.  This is different than the system
in the PICT-3 carburators that only controls air.

It looks like the jet has to be in place for things to work correctly at
idle, although the electromagnetic part could be disabled in the open
position without ill effect.  What does the other end of the part in the
picture look like?
