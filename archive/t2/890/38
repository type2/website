Q2:

I have googled and looked through the archives and a bunch of other places, but I could not find the
specifications for the cooling tin cheese head screws.  I am wanting to get a box or two of these in 18-8 from
Mcmaster-Carr.  So, if anyone knows the thread pitch, diameter, length of these, please let me know.

Tin screws are 6 x 1.0, not SAE.

Type 1 engines use straight-slot screws like these:

Type 4 engines originally came with phillips head screws but most have been replaced with straight-slot screws
because people did not look hard enough for the phillips screws.....
