Not if I  wire it correctly so it only draws from the starting battery, never 
feeding to  it. Then if I need to use it to start I can run jumper cables in 
the engine  compartment. Or I could wire a switch with some heavy cabling. But 
that seems  more work than necessar


hey Don  It still wouldn't be as handy as a jumper box. I have one at  the 
shop that we also take with us camping and seem to always have to use  it.  I 
also use it to power my bubble machine , :)   I think it  might be the best 
thing since sliced bread.  The ones I have at the shop  seem to last about 4 years 
and we use them constantly  later  mark D
