Subject: Re: [T2] funny sign

Not really a sign, but on the way home from work  today I was behind a 
jeep and the back window had two stickers on  it.  The top one said "who 
would jesus bomb?" and right below it was a sticker that read "Mary 
Kay".  It made me laugh.  I have to agree with jesus on this one...
