No. Per Bentley, vacuum connected. I have always set it this
way. New vacuum lines too, btw.  Up until about a month ago,
my engine purred very nicely. Then all the sudden it got rough.
No loss of power. CHT is normal, although my oil temps get to
about 230-235F after extended driving at 60-65 mph. It was
in the upper 90's.
