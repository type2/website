Subject: Revive battery?

Well, I've got a coupla batteries I want to salvage if it's possible - 1
12 volt auto and 1 teensy 6 volt motorcycle...

The 6v was purchased, installed and never really used...  Not even any
dust on it.  I DID disconnect the positive cable.  It sat for maybe 2
years.  I put it on the charger and after maybe 6 hours it's showing 2
volts.  Shall I:

1)  Dump it and buy a new on for a whoppin' $13
2)  Buy new acid at Napa for $5 and charge 'er up
3)  It's good to go as is.

Then the same scenario (but can't remember if this one is disconnected)
on the 12v.  Been < year.  Same q's as above, or I'm thinking this one
should be fine as it's not sat so long.

Thanks!

Teri
