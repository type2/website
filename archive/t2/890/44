Subject: Screw for headlight ring

Hi Volks:

I lost the long funny looking screw for the headlight ring while
changing bulbs this winter.  Now I am using the duck tape method.  Does
anyone have the spec's for the screw?  Local hardware store can't match
the other one.  I may need to mail/net order from hardware.com or Bus Depot.

Thanks,

BEN
