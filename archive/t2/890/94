Subject: More dead '77

Well, I thought Terry K nailed it, but it was a false alarm.  Since  
my earlier post, the follow new info has come to light:

Everything checks out fine.  Been through the Bentley troubleshooting  
as well as the Bosch L-Jetronic troubleshooting.

Interesting observation... After replacing the double relay (DR), it  
started right up and ran fine.  For about 2 minutes.  Then it died.   
Just like you shut off the switch. Grabbed another DR and still no  
start.  Unhook the power feed to DR from terminal 15 and it starts  
and runs for about 10 seconds. Hook the DR feed back up and extreme  
rich.  Will not start or run. Good fuel pressure. Though it drops to  
about 32 psi on cranking.  I'm beginning to suspect a cold start  
injector that's hung open.... Unhooking the DR and holding the  
throttle to the floor allows it to start and run until it runs out of  
fuel pressure.  Hooking the DR back up pours so much fuel into the  
engine that it literally blows raw fuel out of the muffler when it  
starts.

I've replaced the DR with a couple known good ones. Ditto the ECU.  
Tried pinching off the fuel feed to cold start valve only to notice  
that that fuel line is the return to the pressure regulator and the  
tank.  Pinch it off and the fuel pressure quickly builds to 150psi.   
Got a good fuel pump. No fuel leaks. ;o) Tuesday I'll pull the cold  
start valve and see what it does....

Still searching for that needle in the haystack.....  And still open  
to suggestions.

TIA

Jim
