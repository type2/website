Subject: new fuel pump

i just got my brand new  bosch fuel pump from the bus depot today and when i
went to install it i noticed that there are no marking on the connector to
tell me where to plug the positive or negative.  i need to know if i plug
them in reverse do i stand the risk of burning this bad boy up.   or can i
plug it in one way and then reverse them if i guess at it wrong.   does
anyone know how to bench test one of these before i try to put it on my bus.
thanks in advance guys
