I was going to offer these until I realized that you need the tops of the
cylinders and not the bodies...

cylinders with pistons, a 94mm piston kit for a 2L.  The pistons are in
their original wrappings and have never been used.  There's also an open set
of seals and gaskets, a Victor Reinz gasket set for a 2L 914.

Interestingly enough, I opened the other half of the cylinder box tonight
for the first time to store the seals there and found one of the used
pistons from the original repair job.  (Never thought to look to see if the
box really was half empty.)

The rings are sort of "welded" into the piston head where there's a spot on
the top edge that the piston is eaten clear through to the inside.  Almost a
0.5" of the edge is missing!

If it didn't have the hole in the edge, it might make a serviceable
ashtray...
