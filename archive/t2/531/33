sandwiched between a valve cover and a cylinder head.


fabulosio! i was told today by the flaps dewd that at his shop they use
one-sided sticky foam for doors and windows. i was going to do that with a
caulk trim. your timing is stupendous, eron. something to sleep on. heavy
thanks to all the guys who pitched in on this thread.   - steve
