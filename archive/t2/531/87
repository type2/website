Subject: Cleaning a DP Manifold? Oustside and In.

I got a used DP MF from Ken at the BusCo. I'm planning to wire brush the
outside , hit it with some primer and spray paint  it with High Temp Paint.

1.) Is there any reason to use Hi-Temp paint here , I was thinking of just
using some cast aluminum spray paint.

2.)  Recomenations as to cleaning the inside would be appreciaed... Tips ,
Tricks etc....

Thanks
