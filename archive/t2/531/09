list -
tomorrow i attempt to change out my 75's 002 tranny with an 091. i'm
thinking bell housing might need a switch, is there anything else?  - steve


Use the 002 Bellhousing, flywheel & starter. Rather than cut an inch off the
carrier shaft,
just remove the muffler before reinstalling the motor.
