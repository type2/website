Do this. Pull the cap, turn until the points are on top of any lobe. Push 
the shaft towards and away from the rubbing block and if the point gap 
moves more than 0.002 inch (.016-.018 spec) you have a worn out of spec 
dizzy. This wear will show as the timing jumping around like you describe. 
The bushings can be replaced in some. If the shaft is worn as well it can 
only be salvaged by turning down the shaft to true and custom reaming new 
bushings. Time to find a tight used or reman dizzy. The 15 degrees of 
variation you give is too much to keep running without risks of damage to 
the engine. Make sure the dizzy clamp is snug and not malformed. If it is 
foul from over torque like so many I've seen, replace it. Due to the offset 
nature of the drive dog, it you put it back in with the vac can in the same 
position it came out of and wired the dizzy cap the same, you are not out 180.
