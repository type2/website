Thank you, got diesel site only 95 members on that.  So has the url for the vanagon site.  I need to put new tires & shock on it.  Thinking of going to 15" but here we go with $$.  Rimes, brake upgrade & I guess speedo any feed back would be helpful.  The diesel is doing fine top it out (-at-) 62 mph on the SF bay bridge last night.  It's almost like driving the 1962 westy I had as a kid.

The 71 is getting good response on Craig's List (-at-) $1800.00 so we will see who come with the money this end.

Thank you,

Chris
