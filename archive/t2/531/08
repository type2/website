Subject: New Pistons/cylinders Help!?

Ok folks,

some kindly gentleman saw my bus smoking the other day, pulled in behind me
and handed me a set of cylinders and pistons from his but. He says that they
were rebuilt and they look clean and have numbers markered on the tops of
them ( One through four) so not used I guess. There's also stuff punched
into the top of pistons

They've got a pretty decent crosshatch going on but I'm not sure that I can
just throw them in my bus without machining the engine case or heads. how
does that work? I can send photo's of these if anyone would like to give an
opinion.

Also if my main seal behind the fan is faulty where is it going to be
leaking from? Right now there's oil all down the right side of the engine
starting in the corner of the valve cover and going back. It's also dripping
off the fan shroud and along the bottom, I've just replaced the tube seals
but its gotten worse since I did.

Thanks,

Giles
