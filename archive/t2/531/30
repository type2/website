It retards the timing from a number like 7.5 BTDC down to 5 ATDC to reduce the emissions at idle. As the rpms increase of idle the retard quickly goes away and the advance part of the can kicks in.

If it's not connected you should time it to 7.5 BTDC unless you find a setting between that and zero (TDC) that works better.
