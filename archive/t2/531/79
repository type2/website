Subject: Ohio bus event update-BBB4 May 21-23

Hey Y'all,
Just an update regarding the Fourth Annual VW Buses,
Bands, & Brews in Oregonia Ohio May 21-23 (sponsored
by the Ohio Valley Tribe of the Full Moon Bus Club). 
It is now official, Saturday evening will include
Frank Biffath's (EB Chili Cook-off Champion 2 years
running) World famous pot-o-chili for dinner. So, for
anyone not familiar, Frank is kind enough to make a
pot of chili that is approximately 120 gallons large
to feed the masses! So, the main course for Saturdays
Dinner will be the chili, which means anyone else who
wants to, can bring a side dish or something else that
goes well with chili (a nice antacid may also be a
good idea ;^)
Also, "Clark Gordon" has been added to the musical
line-up on Saturday afternoon\evening, along with "Man
Made Moon"  http://www.manmademoon.com
So, get that homebrew cooking and prepare for a
good-old-fashioned OVT campout. 
Everyone remember, that this event, as are ALL OVT
events is a FAMILY EVENT!  Bring the kids, there's
usually a bunch of them there to play with (including
my 3). You can also bring the family pooch, but the
campground manager requires that they be leashed at
all times. Here's a link to the Event web site:

Hope to see you all there!!
