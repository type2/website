Subject: RE: [T2] PC in Bus

If you plan to use a TV as a monitor for you computer, you should try it out
before you buy. A TV is not a good monitor at all. It works great for movies
and pictures being played on the PC, but as for viewing text, not a good
choice. I use a PC for a Tivo like setup in my living room. The TV displays
the movies and stuff fine, but it is very hard to use it as a regular
computer. Almost impossible to do extended work on it. If you know someone
that has TV out on their PC, try hooking it up to a TV and see what you think.
I have a 27 inch TV and text looks bad.
