Subject: Re: [T2] New Member with a FrankenBus Timing Question

Hello Guys     Correct way to find TDC  turn motor in its normal rotation in 
this case clockwise, watch the number 1 intake, when it goes in keep turning 
till it comes out ,turn till timing mark comes up about half a turn. This will 
be TDC check the rotor button should point to number 1 wire. Also some of 
these motors have the timing mark on top of the pulley , unlike a bus that has it 
on the outside face. 914 motors will have 2 marks ,one for setting with motor 
running at 2500rpm, the first one will be TDC.  later and have fun  Mark
