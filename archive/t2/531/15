Subject: Re: [T2] New Pistons/cylinders Help!?

Hi Giles,

Smoke from the tail-pipe indicates a mechanical problem with the 
engine. If the smoke is not coming from the tail-pipe, then it's 
probably just an oil leak dripping onto a heater box.

I would not pull apart the engine to replace something that isn't 
broke. The only logical reason to swap pistons and cylinders would be 
that there was something wrong with the ones that are in there. Which 
is best verified with a leak-down test.

If the engine is strong and there's no blue smoke from the tailpipe you 
need to replace some gaskets, NOT pistons and cylinders. Save them 
until you do need them, or swap them for something useful.

Happy trails,
