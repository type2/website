That's beautiful, and EXACTLY the model of mine. =D

However, mine's far from looking that nice. :(

You rebuilt all the wood inside? I'm considering that just because of the
fact that when I got it home it REEKED of mold. Several seals were shot.
While I'm replacing all the foam and fabric, I'm debating about the wood. I
probably will just because of the quantity that needs to be replaced to
service my entertainment center.

Here's what I've got so far: http://www.donimages.com/1973bus
