 results - what does it mean - something backwards perhaps

IF your 75 bus has the correct original distributor it should have a dual vacuum unit. Correct?

If yes, it sounds like you have the vacuum hoses reversed and you have manifold vacuum connected to the
advance side.

Disconnect both vacuum hoses and see what your timing is at idle. If it near 7.5 BEFORE TDC then set it to 7.5
BTDC. One of the 2 vacuum hoses should have vacuum at idle. This is manifold vacuum and it goes to the retard
side. Connect it to the left vacuum nipple, the one pointing to the drivers side. Check timing, it should now
be 5 after. Connect the other hose to the right nipple. This will be ported vacuum and there will be no vacuum
at idle, correct?
