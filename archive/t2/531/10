I don't worry about theft.  My laptop plays DVDs and it's only worth about 
$300.  I keep it out of sight (and out of the sand!).
I don't think built-ins are such a great idea anymore.  They attract 
thieves and are not as flexible as a portable device.  Want to watch a 
movie outside?  Oops, can't, the monitor is built into the cabinet.  So you 
would have to bring a second, portable device anyway.  :(

The best way to watch movies outside though is with an LCD 
projector.  Someone brought one to BNNTA a couple of years ago and it was a 
hit.  Talk about expensive though...
