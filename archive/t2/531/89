So PB Blaster is THE stuff Doc?? I'm up here in Canaduh, so don't know it.
We have Inox, and the ever unpopular WD40, for penetrants.

Thanks,

Courtney

PB Blaster, three times 5 minutes apart. Peanut sized hammer and small pin

punch, tap around perimeter in between the 3 squirts of SUPERIOR penetrant.

If it now does not demonstrate movement, hardened 90 degree pick between

gasket and seat.

Still won't come??? Heat head to 100 degrees, rub ice cube along rim of

copper, now pick it out.

 

Still won't come?? 1/4 inch chisel and small hammer. Tap it into the side

edge a bit and pry, a bit more and pry. Now force a quality screwdriver in

the slot formed and lever the gasket and bent the side to center. Grab it

with pliers and extract the offal. Do scrape clean and dress both the sides

and flange. If the new gaskets seem a bit tight, very easy to relieve them

with a file so they are just snug.
