Subject: New Member with a FrankenBus Timing Question

Hello all:

I've just spent the day messing with my new acquisition, a 74 Westfalia.  The
previous did a quick job of hanging a newly-rebuilt 914 engine in it just
before I bought it.  I am now trying to get it timed properly and I'm finding
it rather frustrating!  When I line up the rotor with the notch on the rim of
the distributor is it not supposed to be lined up to fire on cylinder #1?
Unless I'm interpreting things incorrectly it's lined up to fire on ##4
because at the notch the rotor is pointing to the lead for cylinder #4.  I've
removed the rubber plug on the fan shroud and I can from this point find what
may be a TDC mark but I really don't know for sure.  It's more of a
lighter-colored spot on the fan that a 'mark' and it is certainly not a
'notch.'  When I got the notch on the distributor lined up and the
light-colored spot on the fan showing and tried to set the valves for cylinder
1 one was open and one was closed so clearly I wasn't at TDC.  There does seem
to be a notch on the pulley where all the timing marks are but when it's lined
up with 0 there is no corresponding mark under the rubber plug.  I don't know
if it makes a difference but the engine # is EAS600703.  I can't figure out
what it is exactly.  I was told that it was from a 914 and there was an EA
series 1.7L 914 engine.  If this is true than I should be timing to 27.5
degrees BTDC but again I'm not sure.

In all the fooling around I also discovered that if I pull straight out on the
pulley I can rock it in and out a little bit. What does this mean?  Anything
is possible with this engine as some of the work seems to have been done well
and some of it has been done very poorly.

All advice is appreciated!

Thanks,
Andre
