Subject: need 3 wheels & tires

Dose anyone in the SF bay have three rimes & tries, they would like to get rid of. I have one rime & tire + the spare. What's on the bus now is MB rimes one is bent.  I will be getting new tires for the diesel on Monday but need this for the 71 westy.  It is on the market & have I think it's sold.
