PB Blaster, three times 5 minutes apart. Peanut sized hammer and small pin 
punch, tap around perimeter in between the 3 squirts of SUPERIOR penetrant. 
If it now does not demonstrate movement, hardened 90 degree pick between 
gasket and seat.
Still won't come??? Heat head to 100 degrees, rub ice cube along rim of 
copper, now pick it out.

Still won't come?? 1/4 inch chisel and small hammer. Tap it into the side 
edge a bit and pry, a bit more and pry. Now force a quality screwdriver in 
the slot formed and lever the gasket and bent the side to center. Grab it 
with pliers and extract the offal. Do scrape clean and dress both the sides 
and flange. If the new gaskets seem a bit tight, very easy to relieve them 
with a file so they are just snug.
