Subject: 110V bus wiring

Hi Volks,

We're finally starting to see some decent weather in Toronto, so I did 
some work on the westfakia  today to get it ready for EveryBus.

Since the westfakia lacks the standard 110V hookups of a true westfakia 
I thought I should add something more permanent, and I wanted to do it 
a way that would make it easy to hook up the westrailer, as I recently 
added a 36" fluorescent light and a 110V receptacle to it.

I put two weatherproof power boxes on the rear of the bus just to the 
left of the engine lid. It was a tight fit to get the boxes into this 
location... I originally wanted them centered but the actual install 
puts them very close to the tail-light lens. I'll probably just paint 
them red so they blend in better. The upper box has a 110V receptacle 
and the lower box houses a power inlet cord.

Inside the bus I installed a changeover switch to allow the power 
source for the receptacle to use shore power or the 400W inverter 
inside the bus, and connected the GFI 110V outlet in the upper box to a 
power strip inside the bus attached to the rear facing seat.

Unfortunately I discovered some rust bubbles in the area under the 
lower receptacle, but that can wait until after EveryBus.

There's a couple of pics online here:
