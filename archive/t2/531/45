Steve-O has some good recommendations, esp ties into my suggestion of a 
(I meant it be a *small*) UPS- it's basic advantage being power 
regulation. I mention it not for it's battery features but for it's 
power regulating abilities.

Doesn't have to a boat anchor.

Also like the 'slap it in a cabinet' or under a panel idea. This can be 
performed with a laptop or a mini ATX;

(Wow, this link is kinda old, but I'm tired and thats all the 
researching I'm doing tonight, sorry)

In the case of a laptop it could incorporate a base station/port 
replicator allowing for portability as well as the benefits of being a 
more hardwired install.

I like this thread, sorry if it drifts from the original poster's design 
specs.

Feel free to wrangle us back on task though.
