Subject: Generator to Alternator Swap

Hey, guys.  I'm facing this swap.  Just looked in
the library (nice article Jim!) and searched post
posts.  Just wondering if anyone can tell me
which alternator kits currently available have
the best fitting parts, have the best directions,
and are the most complete.
