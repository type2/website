Subject: Re: [T2] New Member with a FrankenBus Timing Question

OK thanks very much for the advice, I'll take another crack at it tomorrow.
Does the 27 degrees BTDC sound right?  My engine prefix is EAS then 6 digits
which sounds weird but it is definitely an S and not a 5...

Find TDC for #1 directly:
remove the plugs, remove the valve cover on the #1 side, and rotate the
engine until #1 piston comes up to TDC.  (If you can't peer down the spark
plug hole to see the piston moving up and down insert a thin piece of soft
wire through the spark plug hole and do it by feel.)  Check that the valves
are both closed.  Now go look at the position of the rotor; if it's pointing
at the plug wire that goes over to #1 you're set, irrespective of whether
it's pointing at the notch in the distributor body.

I'm guessing what you're feeling pulling on the pulley is endplay.
