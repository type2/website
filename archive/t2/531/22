dissimilar metals are generally only a problem when there is an
electrolyte present, such as water.  In a boat, this is obviously a big
problem, but in a bus it is a lesser problem.

Stainless fasteners will probably not be a problem, nor would parts made
from this metal bolted to other metals.  After all, we have copper wires
attached directly to steel and brass terminals, and this is a lot larger
difference in electronegativity than the difference between carbon steel
and stainless steel.
