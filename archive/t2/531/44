My search of archives hasn't dug deep enough to find my old bookmarks.

Also, my few recent attempts at googling didn't locate what I remember as;

A guy had multiple pages showing a interior being stripped out and multi 
layer insulation installed to keep out the heat and cold as well as road 
noise.

Any help out there?
