Subject: Timing Question

Oh man I don't know what I have done now - I attempted to time my bus last
night and was very puzzled by the result - The timing indicator tells me
that My bus is between 25-30 BTDC Can' t move it out of this area with out
it stalling out
- seems to run fine at Idle and throttle - I am confounded by these
results - what does it mean - something backwards perhaps
