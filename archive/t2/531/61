For setting timing on an unknown distributor/pulley I've found this
process to work very well. You need a timing light with a dial to do this.
1. Get the engine running (by whatever means).
2. Set the dial on the light to 30-32 degrees.
3. Point the light and rev the engine up to where it doesn't advance any
more.
4. Adjust the distributor so that it appears to be at top dead center
while at the high rev.
5. While at idle set the light back to 0 and recheck.
6. Hopefully, if your distributor and pulley were made for each other you
will now have a mark right on while at idle. If not make a new mark.
