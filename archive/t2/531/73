When I made the switch on Butch I got the full kit from aircooled.net.
It came with everything I needed including the tin pieces for the fan
shroud. Was a genuine Bosch unit to boot. The carb accel linkage is
the only thing I had trouble with. I had didn't have the linkage from
the beetle for the alt so I had to just bend the snot out of it. got
it working, but having the correct linkage would have been nice. This
was on a Pict34
