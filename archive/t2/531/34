The "EA" Code indicates a 914 engine for the '72 - '73 model years.
1700cc's, 8.2:1 comp., D-Jetronic.

Maybe the distributor drive gear was inserted in the engine incorrectly, so
the plug wires have been "rotated" to compensate?  Find TDC for #1 directly:
remove the plugs, remove the valve cover on the #1 side, and rotate the
engine until #1 piston comes up to TDC.  (If you can't peer down the spark
plug hole to see the piston moving up and down insert a thin piece of soft
wire through the spark plug hole and do it by feel.)  Check that the valves
are both closed.  Now go look at the position of the rotor; if it's pointing
at the plug wire that goes over to #1 you're set, irrespective of whether
it's pointing at the notch in the distributor body.

http://www.pelicanparts.com/techarticles/914_timing/914_timing.htm has a
good article on timing the engine, including how to determine where the
timing marks are at.

I'm guessing what you're feeling pulling on the pulley is endplay.
