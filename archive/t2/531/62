However even tar panels will trap moisture so the ones I have seen in doors
have many holes cut in them (aka Swiss cheese). The tar panels give mass to
the sheet metal and dampen the vibrations which cause or transmit noise. I did
this to my doors and wow what a difference. Thunk vs. bang.

I just completed adding Q-pads (and the JCWhitney copy) to my '80 Westy.  The noise charactersitics really change from clang to thunk.  I completely covered the engine area.  VW did this in the later Vanagons, so I wouldn't be concerned about moisture being trapped under this area.  The noise level of an air-cooled Vanagon with the engine area covered is much, much quieter that the 'Basic' Westy with no insulation was before doing this.  I just put about 25-50% coverage in the wall and door areas however, and used the 'NASA' felt padding in the doors instead of fiberglass leaving a lot of breathing room.  Also, I didn't go for the Kool Patch since it seemed a little extream for my needs. I am assuming that Vanagons were designed with a little more concern/technology for corrosion, and mine has so very little now it will probably last what's left of my lifetime.

If you do consider using the JCWhitney version of QPads, which is much cheaper than the real thing, be prepared for some additional difficulty installing over rippled surfaces like the engine area.  It's much more brittle, and I spent about 100% more time with a heat gun and rollers smoothing it out, but it works.  It's the same or slightly more thick than the thicker version of the Q-Pads and seems to have stuck down as well.  It also 'cures' much harder so be sure you don't need to re-do it.
