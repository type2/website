Subject: stainless steel/steel galvanic corrosion

Bimetallic corrosion is the accelerated corrosion of a
metal when placed in contact with a different "more
noble" or "less corroding" metal.
-----
"Iron and steel tend to protect stainless steel in
aqueous environments when galvanically coupled. The
passive behavior of stainless steels makes them easy
to polarize, so that galvanic effects on other metals
or alloys tend to be minimized. However, galvanic
corrosion of steel can be induced by stainless,
particularly in aqueous environments and with adverse
area ratios."

---------adverse area ratios--
The corrosion is caused by a current flow from the
anode (more active metal) to the cathode (more noble,
or less active metal). large cathode and a small anode
means high current densities at the anode i.e. high
corrosion rates. Such area ratio (large cathode /
small anode) is therefore not good.

---stainless fastners (cathode) + steel body panels
(anode) = minimal galvanic action.
you can cut down even further by adding a dielectric
barrier to the works such as locktite.

Soooo based on the theory.. stainless steel and steel
should be fairly happy with each other. Keep in mind
there are many different mixes of steel and of
stainless steel.. current densities will vary
depending on the mix. At any rate, current densities
will be very
small. Drill the hole. Paint it. Install the fastener.
