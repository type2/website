Subject: RE: [T2] PC in Bus

When running these things put in an accessory batter and relay.
It's pretty simple and if you run it right down and really aren't to 
concerned
with space you can even bring along a battery charger (small thing) for when
your next to a plug in.

If your not so worried about a pc part.. another idea is a modded xbox.
Play DVD's, PS1, mame whatever... divx, mpegs movies games.. You can easily
pick up a 15" tft screen and a converter box to make it accept rca signals
for cheap. Plug in a larger hard drive and now your have got room for 100's 
of
divx movies and games and no hassle of carrying the actual dvd's to get 
scratched
on your trips.

And I have an ibook now too. So im not carrying around a pc anymore (only at 
home
and work).
