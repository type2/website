"one question, why not replace with one of the 'new super' foams?"

When I installed the doghouse into my '70 1600SP, I used a valve cover 
gasket and contact cement to seal my oil cooler tin.  Works like a charm.  
The cork can withstand oil as well as the extreme temps, just as if it were 
sandwiched between a valve cover and a cylinder head.
