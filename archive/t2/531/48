I think that $500 is going to be to much for a set of rims for my bus, so I
will probably go the painting route.

What was the original color of the rims on a bus? I have a 73 westy that is
orange. The rims are silver now, but it looks like they have been repainted.
Also, I see that some people have the chrome/aluminum trim ring around the
outside of the rim. What is this and is it stock? Looks nice. I already have a
nice set of hubcaps, just need to get the rest of the rim looking good. I
found some info in the archive about tire painting, just need to figure out
what is the original color. Anyone have the color code?

Thanks,
Corbett
