Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning the engine carbon

OK, Mark, I think I will try the H2O deal.

But isn't that a sacrilege on our T-2's??

What if I add some color die to the H2O.  Do you think I can get a green or 
red cloud out of it??

Any suggestions on adding sugar to the H2O.  It should give it a kick.

Or just old fashion Coke, with phosphoric acid and sugar ...
