Subject: Do it your self alignment

Now that I have the rebuild of the front end completed I need to make my 
bus go straight.

Documents I will be/or have consulted before starting.
	The docs on type2.com
	Bentley

For those that have done this do you have any hints or suggestions that 
are note covered in the mentioned documents.

Thanks 
Steve
