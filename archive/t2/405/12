No, actually.  It looks like simple failure from wear.  I'm not sure why it
broke in the middle, except that the rubber boot is missing at the front end
and may have let a lot of nasty stuff into the tube.

Literally 15 minutes down the street on foot (through a nice area), 3
minutes driving (mostly starting out and stopping).  "(Darrell) Robertson's
Import Parts and Repair".  Really nice guy, and a local club member, too.
