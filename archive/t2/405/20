If you have never learned to shift without using the
clutch, now is a good time to learn. Muir describes it
quite well. I thought it would be prudent to teach
myself this, and lo and behold! I actually had a
clutch cable snap, and had to drive it thirty miles to
get it home (mostly freeway, late at night) and didn't
stall once! Give it a try, it will save your sweet
bippy!
