Richard,

Was off line yesterday, so will answer now.

Based on my past expierience of looking in "newish" fuel lines, I would 
tend to say false.

Varnish is only going to happen after you have let things set for a long 
time.  

Injector cleaner has got to be very similar to carb cleaner, right?
When you clean your carb(old dirty insides), does it come off in flakes or
dissolve....

If you pull a metal fuel line and look into it, what does it look 
like?....assuming that you have been driving it fairly often.

I asked a question similar to this on the diy fuel injecton list and the
answer was negative.  Best deal is to get the injectors cleaned(they do it 
ultrasonically also), and go on...

Cheers, dave
