Unless the shop was an extremely good VW shop, about all they could
rule out was (hopefully) something small & simple that had gone wrong.
Since they didn't have any luck I would seriously consider buckleing
down & working to fix it yourself. There is nothing on a VW that a
regular joe can't fix (at least w/ some help) they are meant to be
simple. With some patience you can do it.

Post back to the list w/ all the info that you know about your bus.
Then give the symptoms. 

As far as small claims court. What could you possibly say? The shop
charges by the hour you paid for parts & someone to work on your bus
for a certain time. Unless they lied about procedures their bill
should be easy to justify. About all you could say is they suck. No
judge would give you money back just because a shop didn't have luck
finding the problem. sorry.
