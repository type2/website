Contaminated furl tank, maybe?  Ah, that's "fuel" tank.  (What the heck is a
"furl", and how does one tank it?)

There's a `87 Sentra sitting in my drive at the moment with a $400.00 for
sale sign on it.

It's in the drive with a $400.00 for sale sign on it because I'm tired of
working on a car that I'm too out-dated to completely understand, and
because there's this great big beautiful bus "loafing" in the drive. :O)

Back to the topic... the main problem with the Sentra is that I'd gotten a
bad load of gas several years ago that left something in the tank.  But we
didn't figure out that that was the problem until shortly after we'd gotten
the bus and I tried to siphon the gas from the Sentra.

The car would run like a top, then simply start choking and stalling on it's
own.  Because the tank was contaminated, it didn't matter what else we did
to the car mechanically, what gas we used or what additives that we added to
the gas to combat "water".

So, too-complicated-to-work-on + tanked-fuel-tank + getting-bus = $400.00
Sentra sale.

Hope that your issues is easy to fix once it's diagnosed.
