Subject: passing along a deal

Wife has shot me down so I thought I'd pass this deal along.  It's a
'77 Westy, reputedly rust free and very straight, in Fallon Nevada. 
Suppossed to be mostly complete, with a dropped valve.  I was told
$800, the guy's name is Rusty here is his email:

Wife's informed me that after I sell my truck and buy a commuter car
I can look locally for a Westy.
