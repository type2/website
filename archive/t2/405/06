Was it because of the groud strap on the transmission?

I just ordered a spare clutch and accelerator cable set. It's being shipped to
my parents' house in Florida. I sure hope I make it there!

Hadn't tried that, but I have 'bounced' the bus off a parking block, thrown it
in reverse and popped the clutch by myself. The bus moved about 18 inches
before it started. These engines are very easy to start.

I left my Bentley at home last Xmas when Dad and I had to teardown the engine.
He grumbled alot about the 'book with the cartoon drawings'. Of course, if he
had been following Muir's recommendation for reseating the distributor drive
shaft spring, we wouldn't have had to teardown the engine.

Oh, how I wish! A VW shop in walking distance! I guess I could want to Mainly
Foreign, it's only about two miles away but I'd have to fend off the hookers
and drug dealers in between.
