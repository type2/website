<< This is a good trick to learn. The basic idea is that you need to match the

speed of the transmission to the speed of the engine (what the clutch forces).

It's much easier with a tachometer. Basically, every up-shift drops the RPM by

about 1000 (need to monitor this on the bus, my 911 was almost exactly 1000

rpm). So if you are cruising in 2nd gear at 3000 rpm and you want to go to

3rd, pop the transmission in neutral, drop the rpms to 2000 (and hold), then

gently push into third. The more you do it, the easier it gets. And it's

definitely a 'feel' thing.

Reminds me of learning how to drive my buddy's old Austin Healey with a 
close-ratio "crash-box" tranny...No synchros at all...Once you got it down
tho', slick as Slick 50 is 'spozed to be... 8-)
