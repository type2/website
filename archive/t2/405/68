The points always open every 90 degrees. The dwell is the amount of the time
that the coil gets to build a charge (points "closed").

A smaller dwell means a bigger gap. A bigger gap means the charge time is
shorter and the spark can fire earlier. That's why the timing advanced.

BTW, I've experimented with a lot of dwell settings in the past, sometimes
involuntarily, and I have to agree with Steve Dolan that 50 degrees is the
best setting.

47-53 good
49-51 better
50 best
