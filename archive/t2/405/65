Subject: oil disappearing?

Hi, 78 westy engine.  Just bought the bus and pulled the engine did an outside
cleanup and replaced most gaskets, seals, and hoses.

We have driven the bus about 1000 miles since purchase.  It consumes oil.  I
don't see it blowing smoke at start up, going down the road, on acceleration.
It is not leaking more than a few drops overnight.

I am losing a little less than a quart per fill up of about 10 gallons.  The
bus runs fine, starts fine..... has that snap your head power of VWs

other than worn out cylinders/pistons/ rings is there another possibility?
Compression test was 110-115 in 1,2,4 and 90 in #3.  plugs looked ok.   I
didn't squirt oil in the cylinder to recheck.  It was the first check out of
the engine after getting it home.

advise?  rebuilt?  any options before that?  I would like to get by for a
while, preferably this summer/ fall before rebuilding...  I would like to camp
in it!   Other than consuming oil will it hurt anything?
