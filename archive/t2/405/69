Subject: Re: [T2] lambda sensor/fuel mixture kit

I have the one from aircooled.net and it's pretty nifty.  Granted, I
didn't have to build it, but it does work well.  Remember, it will only
tell you rich or lean.  It will be extremely difficult to get it to hang
around .5 (stoich) at cruising.  For that, you need a computer to
monitor the o2 sensor and make the mixture hop back and forth about 3-4
times a second at cruising.  Plus, I have it hooked up to my megasquirt
so I can actually tune my bus.  If you've got the vw EFI, good luck
trying to tune the thing with the air-flapper dohicky ;)
