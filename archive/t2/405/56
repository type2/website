Subject: '69 Bus original Stickers

Hi, I have a '69 hardtop camper that I'm restoring.  I've been trying to
figure out what original stickers came in the door jams?  If anyone has
pictures, or could tell me what stickers came on the pass. & driver side-
I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks in advance!
