That's IT!! You're correct!! Not that I knew the answer, but connecting the
dots, you are exactly right. I recently filled up a couple of days ago with
an ENTIRE tank of 87 Octane. When I first bought it, I had put about a 1/4
tank of 92 Octane, but I nearly emptied the tank, and then filled it back up
with all 87.

What exactly is a lead additive? My uncle owns a 1969 Corvette Stingray
convertible with the big old school 427 V8, and I've seen him adding LEAD
ADDITIVE when he fills his tank up with gas at the gas station. What exactly
does it do? I had always thought it was some sort of a lubricant that when
added to the fuel, was better for the motor's rings in the combustion
chamber and such.

Thanks!!!!!!!!

Despite the technical advice of carbon buring, the symptons you mentioned
that goaway when it's cool at night and return during the day point clearly
to two causes:

1.  The heated air expands gas and leaves excess fuel to burn, thus the
diseling when it's hot

2.  You really need to burn higher octance gas or use a lead additive like
"gunk"  If I burn 87 octance I disel day or night. If I go up to 93...it
never ever happens...simple as that..

The added octance keep the engine cleaner, burns cooler, and gives me enough
MPG tradeoff to make up for the difference in cost.
