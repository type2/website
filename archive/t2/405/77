when I got my 79 I was going through about the same amount of oil.
Mine was from assorted leaks all over the engine. I just kept it
topped & kept an eye on it. Drove many 1000s of miles w/ no problem.
One thing to keep in mind though. If you have a stock 78 you have
hydraulic lifters. My experience is that the hyd lifters don't like
being run on low oil. Just keep that in mind especially on long trips.
I would just drive it & enjoy it.
