Subject: Dizzy Clip

Heya Volks,

The other week, I had just finished tuning up the dizzy for my '67-- 
new points, condenser, cap, rotor, the works! -- when one of the clips 
that holds the cap on came loose and dropped somewhere.  Given that I 
have yet to find it, I doubt I will, so I'm stuck searching for a 
replacement.  It's odd, because the other dizzys that I have all have 
clips that screw on as opposed to just sticking into the bottom of the 
dizzy.

Does anyone know where I can get a replacement clip?

(unfortunately, I don't have the dizzy ID handy)

Thanks,
	Tom
