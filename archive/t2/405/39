no, not correct.

the intake valves have 8mm stems and the exhaust are 9mm. this is for stock.
people modify the heads with smaller guides on the exhaust, so you can use
different, or cheaper, non-stock valves. but if it is stock the exhaust are
9mm.

type IV heads seldom have stem seals installed, not sure why not. ETKA lists
an "oil scraper ring" for some type IV's.
