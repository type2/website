Subject: RE: Where are the VW Pick Ups?

I've only seen one in person in my entire life. I saw one about a month ago
driving down Broward Blvd in Fort Lauderdale. The truck was completely
rusted out. One of the storage doors on the side was missing, the rear
window was missing, it was /VERY/ rusted out. 

I had also never seen a car drive this slow in my entire life.. he was
driving in the left lane.. doing about 20 miles an hour in a 45 zone.
