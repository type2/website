Subject: Double relay location needed

Hi volks,
My double relay is sticking and needs to be replaced. When my gal doesnt start, I give the double relay a couple of good raps and it kickes over, but I know this will not last forever. I talked to my local FLAPS and he said he could get one for close to $80. This seems a bit steep to me. I have checked the web sites for bus depot and busted bus, but cannot find this part mentioned. Does anyone have suggestions as to where the best place to locate this simple part is?
As always, all help is greatly appreciated.
Peace,
