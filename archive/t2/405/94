If you agreed to changing those parts you don't have a case. Shops always
want to replace parts before the end of the service interval and they love
it if there have no service history on your car.

I'm not a carb expert by any means but doesn't the condition you describe
suggest an intake valve problem or a lean condition? Sounds like they
compensated for the problem and set the mixture right at idle but on the
road it leans out. Maybe there is a simple vacuum leak which survived all
the part replacement and adjustment?
