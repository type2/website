It is attached before the fuel
>pump, and yes, it has a very good amount of rust particles in there.

Little red flakes in the fuel filter? Rusted gas tank. My Thing has this 
problem and I had to replace the tank, Hindsight is 20/20 but I would 
suggest pulling the tank and using that product that they make (forget the 
name) that is designed for rusty gas tanks.

This sounds like the problem and I take back my opinion before about it 
being the coil.
