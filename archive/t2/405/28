This is the reason I had to dent the flexible exhaust tubing to get around 
tubes
on the exhaust collector--it isn't quite THAT flexible.  I marked the tubing
with a felt pen, where I needed the dent.  I heated up that area with an 
oxy-acetylene
torch, laid on a piece of galvanized plumbing pipe of about the same size as
the collector tube, and smacked it with a big hammer, until it was sufficiently
dented.  Easy.

In this instance, you're as big of a genius as the VW engineers, 'cuz they 
didn't
do it that way either, even though it would have saved a bunch of bucks.

Well, no.  That's not how the stock setup works, it's what I had to do (for 
my non-stock
collector exhaust) to get things to work sorta' like the stock setup.  Look 
at page 12 of
Engine and Clutch, in the green Bentley.  Compare this with what you've got 
on your
collector exhaust system.
