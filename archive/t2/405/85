Subject: popping, and repair shop

  Well, I guess it is up to me to get her running right.  I would love to 
tear the repair shop a new you know what, and take them to court, but I 
realize that that is not reality.  Here again is the background, and 
symtoms.   About a month ago, I had a new fuel pump clog, and fail.  I 
replaced it, and added a fuel filter before it, as well as aft.  Took it 
about 50 miles down the highway with no issues.  As I got off the highway, 
my bus let out a cough!  (oohh jeeez she's sick!)  I made it to my 
destination, and home again with it coughing whenever there was a slight 
load placed on it.  Since, I have adjusted the valves, set the timing, 
checked my jet, replaced distributor, cap, rotor, plugs, and wires.  It was 
still happening.  Some of that was done by the shop, along with adjusting my 
air-fuel mixture.  After he replaced plugs, wires, and fuel filter, it ran 
like a dream for a few miles, and then stalled in my driveway.  Now I have a 
rough idle, stalling at stops, and still the infamous popping.  About thew 
only thing I have not done, is to check out the screen in the tank.  This 
bus has had it's time off the road, and I did not drive her this winter.  I 
can't stand not having her for camping.  I miss our time together.  My poor 
girl......Need help.  People on the list, what do you think?
BTW,  This is a 71 1600 DP with a 34 carb, and 055 Boshe vac dist. New 
everything.
