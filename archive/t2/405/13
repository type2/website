This is good info, richard.

If you can be a bit patient, and are willing to use ebay, this part is
available there for much less. It is used on a bunch of other cars and I
have seen them go for about 15 bucks. You have to scour carefully. If you
were to search for "bosch relay" right now you would not find one, but there
is a similar bosch relay for an alfa romeo that is selling for 12 dollars.
