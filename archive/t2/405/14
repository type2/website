Subject: 1972 Virginia Vintage plates

I just wanted to share my good luck...

I just purchased  & received & registered a set of original 1972 Virginia 
license plates for my '72 Westy.

I replaced a set of DMV issued 'Antique' yellow (the VW is yellowish) plates 
with these owner provided [me] white over black 'Vintage' plates.

The 'Vintage' plates are similar to the 'Antique' plates in that they cost 
$10+ for an unlimited period.  Much less than the annual renewable standard 
plates, and I still have the same restrictions (not to be used for daily 
driving, but can go to shows, etc, and pleasure driving no more than 250 
miles from residence) and benefits (no safety inspection required, but 
county registration is required for all vehicles on the road).

The plates cost me $28.50 (which included shipping) over the auction site.

BTW, I found that MANY of the 1972 Virginia plates were not registerable in 
Virginia, some times because they did not fit the plate number pattern, and 
some times because they were used by someone else.

When I found these plates were still available to be registered in Virginia, 
I 'reserved' the number (can do for up to 90 days) as a vanity plate number, 
so I was sure that I could use them on the road.  Then I bought them.

Just wanted to share.

the past 10+ years!!)
