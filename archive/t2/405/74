Subject: popping, and the repair shop

  Hey folks,  Really could use some help here as I am at the ensd of my rope 
with this.  I had recently posted about a coughing my bus was developing 
under load.  I never chased it down and finally threw my hands up, and 
brought it to a shop.  After they told me about the little things I needed, 
and what patrs they didn't like, they reset the timing, and valves, adjusted 
the fuel mixture, and test drove it.  It still had the same issues.  He 
decided that it was starved for fuel.  He found the fuel filter clogged, and 
replaced it, took apart the carb and says there was a hair in the bowl.  He 
put everything back together, and it still ran poor.  Said he checked 
compression, 110 in1, 110 in 2, 130 in 3, and 120 in 4.  He decided to 
replace plugs, and wires.  Then it was road tested, and said to be perfect.  
I picked it up, and after driving a little over a mile, the problem came 
back, only this time it stalls at stops, and is difficult starting back up.  
It also has a problem idling now.  This all costed me 256 dollars, and I am 
not too thrilled.  I called them back, and they will not do anything without 
me paying for more diagnosis.  I don't know what to do, or where to go 
anymore.  I can not spend any more on this thing.  Should I try fighting the 
repair shop in court?  Or just chalk it up as another loss?  And does anyone 
know a strictly air cooled mechanic in the Brattleboro Vermont area who 
knows what they are doing with busses?  After doing alot of research on this 
problem on line, it looks like my tank may be clogged.
Please help?
