Subject: OIL FILTER REMOVAL

Hey people,

I just wanted to give an easy method of removing oil filters.
Get a long screwdriver and a hammer , gently hammer the screwdriver
all the way through the filter , make sure you have a large bucket under
there,
then you can turn the screwdriver to get the filter off.

PS . dont do it when its too hot , you might burn your hand.

Later peoples.
Darren
