I always clean new points with brake clean or carb cleaner before
installing. They have a protective coating to keep them from rusting on the
shelf.

<A multi meter is very handy when dignosing these

I use a simple test light. If you have 12v at the + side of the coil thats
good. Then test it at the - side while you r buddy trys to start the
engine. The test light should blink as the points do their thing. No blinks
no points. 12v at the + means your sysytem is getting fed the juice to do
its thing. I have gotten bad points before and had to replace them.
