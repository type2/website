underside in Por-15? I know people always say.. "It's your car! Do what you

want to it!!" But for me, it's a little different, I work on my cars with

the idea that when my time comes, I can donate it to a museum, and they'd be

proud to have it displayed (as original).

How serious do you wanna be...?-(
I'm on a few other lists with some seriously restored cars (obviously
quite unlike any of mine...). The hard core restorers won't use any-
thing that wasn't or couldn't have been on the car when it was new.
Including paint and even deficient fasteners...If it was mine and I had
the time, money, incentive to do an all out resto, I'd go with the POR-
15, tie coat, and a finish coat of whatever VW used...(Even the re-
storers on other lists are split on POR-15, BTW)
Some restorations go beyond even that; Ralph Lauren spent a reputed
million doing up a Talbot-Lago bodied Bugatti...Even sending scraps of
the original "leather" out for analysis to find out which endangered
creature gave its pelt to the upholsterer...
(BTW, I have a few tanks left of German air for the tires... ;-)
