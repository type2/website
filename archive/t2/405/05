Do you have a voltmeter? Get it started again and make sure you've got better
than 13V at the battery (charging).

How's your alternator belt tension? How are your grounds?

Take it to AutoZone and have them run their diagnostics on it. It may take a
few tries to get a tech how knows a battery from a starter, but they do have
better equipment and can test the alternator, battery and voltage regulator.

By flasher box, do you mean your turn signal relay? Is there a flaky
connection in your warning light switch?

Just some kind thoughts the next time you see a bleau, blanc and rouge '74
pass by on the highway...
