Since the VW doesn't come with self-diagnosing capability, the most any
shop could do is a step-by-step procedure, at whatever their hourly rate
is...Even the used car inspection companies charge about $250 to spec
out a used car (and only a few years back, at that, BTW). You're far bet-
ter off going through the procedures - think of it as an ultimate tune-up -
yourself if you plan on keeping a twenty-something vehicle roadworthy.
There's no 'magic bullet' involved unless you or the mechanic get lucky...
Intermittant symptoms are worse still...A bus running perfectly on the
shop floor might not show a bad ground (for example) and might run
for miles until that one bump opens a circuit and another bump closes
it... ;-(
