I never found the cap style but you know you don't need one: you just need to make it hand tight. I've been doing this for a long time and haven't had any problems.

If you come across someone else's bus with a stuck filter I can see why you might need a wrench the one-time. There's the clamp kind with the hinged handle that can help you get into that area. It's adjustable.

Contact www.samstagsales.com and send him a picture of the filter with the number of dimples. He likes hunting down hard to find German tools.
