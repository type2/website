Subject: timing and dwell

Someone replaced my ignition points.  I checked the dwell and it was 55.  I 
checked the timing and it was about 11 vice 7.5


I reset the points to a dwell of 47, and the timing went from 11 to 14

Does this sound right??  I thought the timing would drop back to 7.5 if I 
opened the points up.
