Subject: CLEANING THE ENGINE DEPOSITS

I have the old idiot book which mentions using diesel fuel to clean the
engine
deposits. It mentions that a great deal of black smoke will come out.
I think it was poured slowly into the carburator. I was thinking of trying
it,
so I'm glad someone brought it up.

Cheers
