>I cannot find it...  Does anyone recall??

<Here's a link to BG products. I have used many of them when I had a full
automotive repair shop (lean days till I built up the VW cliental here in
the desert)

They make a GREAT trans additive, have quieted down a lot of bus trannys
with it and there engine clean system works great also.

 On another note, back in the poor days half a quart of trans fluid poured
slowly down the intake system with the engine at 2000 rpm's will clean all
the carbon and deposits off the valves and pistons, ask any old hot rodder

It seems the driver fed a 1/2 can of something like BG 44 thru their brake 
vacuum hose to the intake manifold while the engine was idling, and then 
poured the rest in the tank.


There was something else, an addition to the oil.


The person then drove their vehicle and a huge black cloud came out and 
followed the vehicle for a while.  But the end results were fantastic!!

Can anyone direct me ??

TIA
