Subject: Re: Bus In KW Area.....

I do deliveries to a house in Kitchener 6 nights a week. It is on Claremount
near Belmont just wondering if the Bus owner is on the list? It is green with
white top, and in great condition. I would like to know if you have done the
work on it, or if you took it to a shop in this area? Or is it origional?
Great VW either way.
