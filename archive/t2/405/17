Subject: RE: Holy Roll-ing... (Was: EGR connector removal)

Personally, I do know that it IS a fact that EGR can, and WILL cool the
temperatures of the cyl heads. This is a fact. It probably does help reduce
emissions slightly.. but certainly not anywhere near the benefit of a
catalytic converter. 

As for Jesus, he can drive whatever he wants, whenever he wants.... but from
what I can figure.. he probably prefers to drive his Pontiac Fiero 90% of
the time. Hehe.. am I allowed to say that on this list?
I'm sure his V-dubya comes in a close second though.

I THINK I may know an economic way to have those printed. You can have mass
printings from www.bumperstatements.com

I had a bunch of great bumper stickers printed out for G-dubya.... (well..
not FOR him, but to support him).

"FRANCE - DID YOU FORGET ABOUT WW2??"

Oh.. what a great sticker!!

I've no intent to drum up a diatribe on religion, yet I'd like to share my
personal bus-related feelings on the EEN's environmentally-oriented "What
Would Jesus Drive?" campaign that was just picked up (again) by CNN.  Some
of my kin in Christ have way too much time on their hands, and too little of
real spiritual importance on their minds...

This is a view of the graphic of a bumper sticker I've just designed and
intend for the back of my bus (and for distribution) when I find the means
to have the stickers printed.

Suggestions for an economical method of having the stickers printed would be
greatly appreciated.

I figure that if the Wiccan members of our local VW club can have their
witchcraft-related bumper stickers ("Witches parking only, all others will
be toad"), I can have my own sticker with my two cents worth of commentary
on frivolous Christianity. :O)
