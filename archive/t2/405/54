Subject: Seals and paint?

Hello,

My '76 Westy has blown main and pushrod tube seals. I was orginally 
going to fix it myself, but after viewing the rebuild tape and looking 
at the space I have to work with, I think it's better if I bring it to a 
reputable shop who can tell me whether I need new seals, an engine 
rebuild or a new engine. I live in San Francisco, so if anyone knows of 
a good vw shop that specializes in bus engines, I'd appreciate it.

Also, as I get my westy fixed, I'm thinking of taking her to Earl Scheib 
for a paint job. Anyone have any experience w/ Mr. Scheib? Anything I 
should look out for or be wary of there - or is it a good, cheap paint job?

One more thing, should I get the engine worked on before or after the 
paint job?

Many thanks,
Pete
