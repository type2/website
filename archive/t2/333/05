Subject: Solex cutoff valve interchangeability?

Just picked up a German Solex PICT-34 from that auction site that one dares
not name.  It arrived today, looks clean but is a missing the
electromagnetic cutoff valve. Does anyone know if I can use the one that is
now on my Solex/Boxar 30/31?

BTW this has not been a bad week in bus parts land. I also picked up an SVDA
distributor last week for under $6.  The seller apologetically noted that it
lacked points, rotor and cap. That was understandable. It was NOS.

Thanks in advance,

John
