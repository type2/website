I converted mine too.  I used a Coleman kit that contained a hose with a fitting and valve on one end that screwed onto the top of the disposable bottles.  I cut the fitting off of the other end of the hose and used a barbed connector to join it to the line to my stove.  Works great except that it lacks a "proper" regulator and will blow the flame out in the stove if you open the valve too far.

Agreed.  My stove lasts a really long time on a single disposable bottle.  No need for that huge tank if that's all you are running off of it.

Same here.  Plus, your bus will be lugging around 40 less pounds after you remove that big tank.  I could use that 40lbs for more batteries instead.
