Subject: Re: [T2] Polishing a bus after painting

Use 3-M's Finesse and a lambs wool polishing bonnet to get rid of any
swirl marks, and scratches in the paint after rubbng the paint out with
compound.
Use a buffer spur to clean up the bonnet after use, and to keep it clean
as you progress.
After your all done--wash the Bus to get rid of the thrown off compound
and pad--


Later,

Terry

Hello Volks 
This is a question for the Gurus of the fine art of painting a car. How
can I do to polish my bus after painting (rubbing compound and a 2000
rpm angular polisher) with out damaging the paint? How can I get rid of
the build up un the polisher wool ? 
Thanks in advance
