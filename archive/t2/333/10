Hi Steve,

My cot works OK with the headrests in place. You have to tilt the seats 
all the way back, but then the headrests act as a restraint.

Neither the seats or the cot are factory installed in my Westfakia, but 
I think they are pretty close to original config. My seats came from a 
passenger bus.

Happy trails,
