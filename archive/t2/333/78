Subject: [T2] Wind powered Batt charging

Hello to all bus pilots,
I have been kicking around an idea for a wind powered battery charger.
Being of the artistic bent I like to make windmills from found objects.
My idea is to build a mill onto a 38 amp bus generator with a regulator to 
prevent overcharging.
I realize this is not a size efficient solution but it could be dismantled 
and stowed away while traveling.
Any thoughts on my mad scientist approach?
Does this sound possible?
What kind of rpm's do I need in order to generate a useable current?
