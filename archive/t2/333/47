Not just refilled, but all propane bottles.  Imagine a 5-gallon bottle
getting loose in heavy traffic and rupturing.  Google on "Fuel-Air
Explosive" to get an idea of what could happen.  FAE is basically a
quick-empty propane tank with a timed igniter.  The military uses these
things to make instant helicopter landing zones in the jungle, and that is
not nearly as confining as a tunnel!
