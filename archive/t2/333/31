After scrounging a perfectly good barbecue, I went hunting for the tank
attachment with regulator built in- Home Depot had them for around
$15...Also one can get/find side burner attachments for a barbecue that
has the regulator and a hose that goes to a dispo. bottle- just feed it
to your stove instead of the side burner.  Not sure the latter can let
out enough for a 2 burner stove.

> I converted mine too.  I used a Coleman kit that contained a hose with a fitting and valve on one end that screwed onto the top of the disposable bottles.  I cut the fitting off of the other end of the hose and used a barbed connector to join it to the line to my stove.  Works great except that it lacks a "proper" regulator and will blow the flame out in the stove if you open the valve too far.
