Hey, Billy...

Last night, I had my daughter help me bleed the brake system on the '72 
Westy.

No joy ! ! !

My right front wheel was fine, but my left front system was clogged.  I had 
my daughter put some foot power to the brake pedal, and low and behold, the 
left front rubber brake line got four really significant bulges along the 
top of the hose.  The bottom 1.5" still was not bulged, so I think that must 
be where my stoppage is.  The rubber brake hose looks like an over stuffed 
sausage.  And BOTH the left and right front brake hoses looked very good on 
the surface.

When I bleed the right front, I found that I could not turn the rotor.  But 
on the left front, the rotor was still free turning.  The calipers did not 
close one single bit!!

Man, this was a surprise to see the left rubber brake hose bulge so much.  I 
can imagine me having to do an emergency 200 lb foot press WITH the brake 
booster also helping.  I don't even want to think about it!!!

So, now I am going to order a set of four brake hoses from Bus Depot, and 
maybe an extra front pair for my '78 Westy.
