Subject: Re: [T2] Buses on very bad roads: fine or foolhardy?

I think the earlier busses had more go on the rough terrain then the later 
ones.
There was something way cool about how if you stepped on the gas with
a splitty the back would actually rise up. This was due to the reduction 
boxes.

So I had a Bay bus get into a nasty situation. Please, Please drive 
carefully
down little used forest roads. My bus was cruising down an old road
and then I tree had fallen, making the root ball leave a huge
hole in the middle of the road. (Have I already told this story? Sorry). I 
slammed on
the brakes, but like a previous poster mentioned, wet grass is slippery.
So the bus came to a stop sideways, with half the wheels in the hole, and 
threatening
to fall all the way in. It was at a serious angle. I could not get it out, 
but I
slept in it anyway. Had to get a tow truck to get it out. Busses are heavy 
and
are not like bugs where you can get a friend and lift it out.
I would say that a bus with good tires is good at going forward, but
lousy at backing up. The weight when pointing down hill
is not good for traction in reverse.

On the other hand, I came accross a road in the woods many years later
that had been ditched for lack of a better work to allow rain water to
flow down the hill. These were some serious holes, like about 2 feet deep
and square. Going up them the bus did it. Thats the marvel of the bus.
As long as you can go straight at it, you are golden. Reversing out of
a bad situation is another story.

Oh yeah have a look at this:
