Dave, I took about the same approach as you, but I used a converter that was 
designed to let you run a white gas stove on propane. I like it because even 
though it also lacks a "real" regulator, it has six "click type" settings to 
adjust propane flow. On the second click, it equals just about 11" WC, which 
is what the original stove was set to run on. On the sixth click, my stove 
approximates the sound of a Space Shuttle launch.
