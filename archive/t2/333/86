My initial thought was that you will get enough to trickle charge at least
at idle 800-1000 rpm maybe. Now after I read your mail it occured to me I
forgot about the pulley ratio. so simply maybe 2:1 right. so I think it
should be able to charge the battery ay maybe 1800+ RPM. It wont have its
max output current but all you need is a couple amps to charge the batt.
