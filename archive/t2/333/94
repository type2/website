Subject: FIRING ORDER

Howdy,

I have a 72 van 1800 engine
I know that there is alot of talk in the archives for this question
but I wanted to see what the list has to say.
I might have put the distributor in 180 degrees backwards?
Will the van run if the wires are backwards?

I know it should be                3  2
                                                  4   1

cylinder 1 firing first then 4, 3 , 2
will it run if it is 3,2,1,4 ? thinking if it were 180 degrees off?

Thanks for your help.
Darren
