I have a faint memory of a VW fitted with a lawn mower type of pull starter

Has any one ever seen this or was I halucinating on some bad herbs?
Keep in mind this was in the "Hang ten" foot shaped gas pedal and R. Crumb 
"Keep on trucking" days of the early 1970s so anything goes.

Even if you could 'attach' a pull starter to the crank pulley, would you
like a loose rope anywhere near a rotating fanbelt...Besides, I have
enough trouble starting my 6 hp wood chipper...
