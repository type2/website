I had one - forget where I got it.  It was pretty wimpy, so much so that I
could not tell whether or not it was actually working.  It did manage to
light it's LED when the sun shone on it.  I killed it when I left it on top
of the bus in the rain - turns out it was not the least bit waterproof.
IMHO, save your money.

  Any one use those genuine VW solar trickle chargers that are being sold on
"an internet auction site", they plug into the cigarette lighter of any car?
The run about $25 with shipping.  Laura
