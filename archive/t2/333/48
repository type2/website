Well, it was available a couple of years ago, and the part number is on
the library page.  Wouldn't hurt to give the dealer a call.

When I did mine, I used a generic spring from Home Despot.  One spring for
a buck and I cut and bent the ends to make two springs the correct length.

Please take care of this.  If you don't you can damage the lock cylinders
from twisting them too hard.

One way to tell if your spring is broken or missing is to check if
unlocking is harder after pulling and releasing the trigger.  If that
makes it hard to unlock, then you have a spring problem.

While you have the lock apart, clean and lube it with white grease.  30
years is a long time for a lock to work without new lube.
