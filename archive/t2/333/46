It's not uncommon.  Many times people add a second condenser when they convert to R134a.

Yes.  But you will need to protect it somehow, and of course ensure that there is adequate airflow through it.

You need adequate cooling through the condenser in order for the system to work efficiently.  Too much will not help, but it shouldn't hurt anything either.  It probably won't be too much though, especially if you are using R134a.

Difficult to predict.  If you installed it with a single evaporator first, and got about four digital thermometers (inlet and outlet side temps for both condenser and evaporator), you could probably tell whether or not you could support a second evaporator.
