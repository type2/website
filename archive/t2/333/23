Hi there,

O.k., I did some checking on line and this definitely isn't a new idea. 
Check out - http://www.fieldlines.com/other/recipmotor.html

There are plenty of other versions out there too.

Basically the design I had was this but in a four cylinder version. The 
distributor puts electricity to the different cylinders immediately after 
top dead center and cuts it off as it nears the bottom. The piston is a 
permanent magnet - no need for compression, the cylinders just act as a 
guide - made of aluminum of some metal that isn't magnetic.

Pretty damn inefficient and I can't believe that it could move a bug!

Sorry, it isn't a big mystery but still interesting.

If I hadn't had the idea I wouldv'e guessed it was primitive diesel with 
high voltage glow plugs making up for lack of compression.

Anyone know what it is for sure?
