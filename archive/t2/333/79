Subject: Aftermarket Pull starter?

Hello,
I have a faint memory of a VW fitted with a lawn mower type of pull starter 
on an upright beetle type motor.
Has any one ever seen this or was I halucinating on some bad herbs?
Keep in mind this was in the "Hang ten" foot shaped gas pedal and R. Crumb 
"Keep on trucking" days of the early 1970s so anything goes.

"Keep on trucking"
Rusty
