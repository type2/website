Subject: Polishing a bus after painting

Hello Volks

This is a question for the Gurus of the fine art of painting a car.
How can I do to polish my bus after painting (rubbing compound and a 2000 rpm
angular polisher) with out damaging the paint?
How can I get rid of the build up un the polisher wool ?

Thanks in advance

From the sunny lands of Caracas Venezuela
