Ive found that the DMV by work here in South Miami can be empty if you hit
it right. Tues-Thurs, middle of the month, mid morning or mid afternoon.
Ive gotten through with a new title applied for in minutes.

Late in the month are frantic people who put it off until the last minute

The first few days to week of the month are those who are still frantic
but are now driving with expired tags

Mondays and Fridays people will take off time from work and squeeze it in.
Early morning and lunch can be frantic.

If you can go when noone else can you got it beat.
I take a pass if its unexpectedly busy and try again another time/day.
