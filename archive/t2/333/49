Phil,

Could be.

I am actually going to replace all the locks anyhow, including the ignition.
my bus has two keys - one for the ignition and one for everything else and
that is a pain. I have a complete set of locks from a parts van and I am
going to replace all of the locks with the complete set I have.

Maybe I'll do that before getting into trying to find the short, which is
the other thing it could be.
