I have a print out of a splitty as a space shuttle stuck to my wall, it's in 
orbit around earth, and has round mirrors both drivers and passengers sides, 
and fried egg turn signals. It has the stars and stripes and United States on 
the side.  Dunno the URL it came off,  but it's cool.   I'd like to know 
where to find the Russian space bus as well.
