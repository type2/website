Hi Jeff,

You definitely have a fuel supply issue. I would first recommend 
checking your fuel filter for debris.

Have you tried removing the gas cap? It might be a blocked air vent, 
creating a vaccuum in the tank that eventually overpowers the fuel pump.

If it's not the filter or the vent then it is a blockage in the tank or 
a bad pump. Check the flow from the tank and if that's ok, replace the 
pump. Unfortunately the 1974 mechanical pump is expensive and very hard 
to find, but a cheaper electrical pump will work just as well, you just 
have a bit more work to do to mount it.

Happy trails,
