Wow! That's a lot of work to get to a little spring. And I don't suppose
that VW has this part anymore (although Brazilian dealers may have it). I
will offer a plug for a very good company out my way that offers a wonderful
service.. Century Spring Co. of Los Angeles, CA (call directory for a
telephone number, or they might have a site on the web) offers a vast array
of springs of all types, and can blueprint and duplicate almost any spring.
This is great for car restorers.
