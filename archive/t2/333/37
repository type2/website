Subject: Re: [T2] Propane stuff and tips

LOL! Well, welcome to the new age of Lawyer-generated paranoia ... we
doctors get constantly hammered with horror stories of malpractice
suits..... it's like you have to do blood tests to treat a hangnail because
perhaps the guy is a hemophiliac (bleeder) and you could get sued...
although it would be a highly unlikely event.

I quote one of my favorite philosophers, Bertrand Russel:
"In this life certainty is not possible. In real life, one has to learn to
act on probabilities; suppose you were a general preparing for a battle, you
don't know what the enemy will do, you GUESS ...and, if you are a good
general, you guess right and a bad general, you guess wrong"

So, I'm guessing that the chance of an overfilled disposable  propane
cylinder exploding is pretty remote.... if it does fail, either the cylinder
valve will leak and stink of propane...or the built-in pressure relief valve
will open up and it will stink and you can toss it.

I can't guess for you. That's your responsibility. You do your own guessing
and live with the consequences. And. if by odd chance you guess wrong
someday then perhaps I can help to mitigate the damage and restore any lost
function ...
