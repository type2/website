Subject: WTB: NOS or never rebuilt CV Type IV Case for up to $300

Hi All:

I am looking for a Type IV 2.0L air-cooled Vanagon engine case, marked
as CV###### near the breather box. A CV case was used in Vanagons
between 80-83. It has the enclosed breather box (part of the casting)
and normally had hydraulic lifters.

I am willing to pay for a good case but only if it meets my
specifications:

- It must provable have standard main bearing bores, thrust, camshaft
bores, and lifter bores. That usually means it must have low miles,
never been rebuilt, never been overheated or have had the oil screen
bolt over tightened,

- The cylinder deck must be in good shape, no major dings or scratches,

- The case must never have been pried apart (by screwdrivers or
similar),

- All gasket-mating surfaces must be in excellent shape. This includes
the rear and front main seal surfaces. They must not have any
dings/scratches from pulling the seal, and

- Of course no cracks or other major problems (i.e. stripped oil drain
plug or cylinder studs).

There are two ways to measure a case to see if it is standard:

1. Torque the case to 22-24 ft-lb and then using a dial bore gage
(calibrated to 0.0001), at a known temperature (around 78:F as aluminum
has a thermal expansion of 0.00013 inches per 10:F, double for internal
diameters), measure the bearing bores. For a standard case they should
not be egg shaped and be within:

Main bearings
#1-3  2.7559 - 2.7567 (70.000  70.019 mm)
 #4 1.9685  1.9696 (50.000  50.016)

Cam bores:
1.0826  1.0835 (27.50  27.521 mm)

 Lifter bores:
0.9448  0.9457 (24.00  24.02 mm)

Oil Pump bore:
2.7559-2.7570 (70.000  70.030 mm)

2. Insert a new standard bearing and measure the removal force using a
spring scale (a good fish scale from Walmart).  For bearings 1-3 use
bearing # 3, and #4 for bearing #4. The removal force should be greater
than 12 lbs for 1-3 and 8 lb for #4. This will not tell you that they
are egg shaped but will give a quick indication if the bores have
sufficient crush force. Measure both sides. The cam is checked by
bolting the case together and over torquing the 6 large bolts. It should
not turn. Lifter bores can be tested by hand fitting a lifter in the
bore. I of course will pay more for method #1 than #2 as it provides a
record that I can compare.

Some signs that the case has been rebuilt:
- Sealing material placed on galley plugs,
- The case has been painted,
- The bearings from the case are not marked STD or do not have the
elephant stamp,
- Silicon rtv has been used on case mating surfaces,
- Pry marks on the case.

The above requirements may sound anal retentive, but I have a number of
used cases that need machining and I do not need to collect anymore. I
am willing to work with the owner of a good case to assist/reimburse for
measurement expenses if the case is an ideal candidate. If you are just
looking for a quick buck or selling crap please do not reply to this
message.

I will want good images of the case before buying. For pictures of a
good case see here: http://www.cs.fiu.edu/~jstric01/Engine_Case.htm.
This is what I will use as a measure for all candidate cases.

Pmail at jstric01(-at-)cs.fiu.edu or call at 772-460-1226 to discuss your
case and make me an offer.
