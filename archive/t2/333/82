You will need about 4000RPM at the generator to make a reasonable amount
of current.  You're talking about a big windmill and a goodly amount of
gearing to make this work.

For battery charging, you would probably be better off with a smaller
alternator that makes more like 5 amps of current.  If you camp places
where it is windy (Wyoming leaps to mind) it will keep things topped off.

Personally, I think that solar is more practical.  I don't like to camp
where it is windy!  :)
