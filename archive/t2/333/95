Subject: Type 2 tee shirts available?

	Hi folks,
	I was wearing my old Netvernugen tee shirt
from the vanagon(-at-)lenti days 

(http://www.type2.com/des/vw/tshirt/)

and my son, now age 6, asked if we could get 
him one. A quick search at the type2 and Samba 
sites shows no type2 - releated tee shirts for
sale.

	I recall an aircooled search and rescue
shirt a few years ago, and I suppose I could
get a copy made of my shirt, but I'd rather
support someone already in the biz, if you
know what I mean. RMMW used to have a Peter
Aschwanden bay-window shirt, b&w,, and that's
my other back-stop, I suppose.

	SOoo. If you are selling Type2 shirts,
please drop me a line with price and a 
pointer to an image of the art so I can
see what I'm getting :)

	Thanks!
	Bill Abbott
