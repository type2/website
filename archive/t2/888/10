   Hello all,

   My name is Greg Smith -- I've been on list list for a while with the 
address rnrkeys(-at-)hotmail.com. Troy Wical saved me in Colorado last fall 
with help from Don "DurocShark" Tuleja.

   I've been trying to find out some info on my '69 westy and found this 
on the type2 website: http://www.type2.com/m-codes/index.html which has 
been a huge help. It's cool to finally know the original color was pearl 
white (she's primer gray and white now) and the she was originally a 
pop-top (wasn't sure), but I am wondering if anyone might be able to 
help me with a couple unknowns? You can see my M-Plate here: 
http://www.geocities.com/gregorypjsmith/M-Plate1.jpg .

   I am mostly curious about the TR export destination (just out of 
curiosity) and I don't fully understand the explanation of TT and XXXX 
(http://www.type2.com/m-codes/t2models.html). My plate says 21 and 2310, 
but I can't figure out how to read those.

   Thanks!
   Greg Smith
   1969 Westy "Patience"
