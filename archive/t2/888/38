Rather than rewrite it, check out (http://www.benplace.com/weber.htm). 
There's some good info there for a new owner of a 32/36.  He doesn't
reference the fuel tank vent lines, but IIRC, there are 2 openings on
the underside of those chrome air filter units.  The second could be
used for the tank venting.

I don't have my bus in front of me, but are the hoses on the charcoal
canister oriented correctly?  Doesn't the fan route through the side
with 2 nipples, and the air cleaner connect to the side with one? 
Can't remember.

ps... the brakes are coming along slowly.  Got a leaky caliber (leaked
at the seam), so I'll be slapping a new one on this afternoon/tomorrow.
  Then I've got the rear lines, flushing and bleeding to do. Wish me luck!
