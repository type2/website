Hello,
I am busy  refreshing my engine tin for my 1970 single cab. I
have the car in the shop  being painted now.....

Here  were my discoveries of parts i need. First off, my fan wore
out......it and  the hub. The hub is different on this model bus, for the
alternator was  bigger, and the offset on the hub is opposite that for a bug.
Also, the tin  that goes on the generator that bolts to the fan shroud. Once
again, one of  these parts is different, due to the generator size.

Last thing needed is a fan belt pulley for above  generator. The
inner piece (next to generator) is cast iron and different  than others.

Any help is  greatly appreciated. You can  pmail

Hey Adam    first the gen or alt isn't bigger it is longer  or shorter. the 
place where they bolt up is the same size.The only size  differeces were 6 volt 
and 12 volt in diameter of the generators.   You can  make a bugone  work but 
not using that bus gen .as the tin work is  different. Use a bug gen or alt. 
with the bug tin work. As for the pulleys  convert it to a porsche 356 or 912 
system and change the belt to a 15345 size .  this will also make it run 
cooler. Otherwise you have to change the whole pulley  at the same time.  The cast 
iron pulleys are a thing of the past and can  only be found used. I probably 
have some in that bucket of pulley parts in the  back of my shop. later Mark
