Subject: RE: [T2] More Tire FART Goodness! (Vredestein vs Nokian)

I found these at Discount Tire when I replaced the ones on my 63' Double
Cab.  Just a thought.  Proper load range and specs and the ride is nice as
well.  Or atleast, as well as it could be for a DC.

...I'm sold on the Vreds for summer use and the Nokians for winter. But it
doesn't appear that the Vredestein Transport Steel tires are available in
the US. The only links I found were overseas.
