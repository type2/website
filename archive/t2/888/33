Hey Ron! 

Trade out some stuff to a programmer to write a program to read the lists and forums to find out what parts are being discussed. Then it could populate a section of your page with links to the parts. Link back to the list to refer your non-list customers to the best help available. 

Resist the temptation to have the 'bot' reply to the list, "Dude, it'd help if we knew what year and model". That's Karl's job. 

BTW, your german cv boots are great quality!
