Subject: Tow bars and 72 buses

I'm looking for a way to tow my 72 bus and was looking at a tow bar made by 
jeremyrockjock listed on TheSamba.

  http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=272543

Searching through the archives I found the note down below indicating that 
it may not work on a 72.

Any opinions to this or on the tow bar made by jeremyrockjock?

   Thanks, Kevin
