Subject: EGR on a 1973?

Hey guys,

    I have a 1973 Type-2. I recently got a new exhuast system from the Bus
Depot. It has provisions on the side for an EGR tube. I was considering
whether or not it would be worth it to me to try to hook this up somehow, or
if I should just put a plate over it. I don't even know where this would
connect... is it something that actually benefits in the cooling of the
engine? I know the EGR system on my Fiero actually helps cool the pistons by
re-introducing exhaust into the combustion chamber under cruising conditions.
Is it equally beneficial in the Bus? Or should I just block it off?


Thanks!

Todd
