Hey Guys   First there is probably two of them ,but I  have seen  as many as 5
in a reman vw engine from the factory. They  bwill probably end up  around the
oil strainer . They aren't very  stout or very big.  You will  need new ones
in their place or the  dizzy shaft might not  come up to the  dizzy and 
without
them you  could cause premuture wearing of the case where the  shaft rides.  I
would drain the oil and remove the screen and fish around with a   stick 
magnet.
I don't think you will find them thur the dizzy hole.   Later  Mark  Dearing

I  waited til Richard Carlton verified it but I said he has a 78 bus with a 
type  4 engine.

They only used one shim washer. Unlike a type 1 engine that  needs 2 because 
of the magnesium case.

If you go to the Samba link I  sent earlier,  
http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=178228&highlight=
you  will see what a type 4 washer looks like......  It has a 021 105 235 
part  number. Unlike the steel type 1
washer,  111 105  235A.




Hey guys  you are right  I was thinking he had a type 1,   the type 4 is 
thicker also. it still should flush out and will still need  replaced.   might be 
easier cause of the bigger hole to work with. if  removing the pick up tube 
screen be careful when tightening the bolt,wasn't it  just last week that 
somebody broke the case when they tightened that bolt too  tight   later  mark
