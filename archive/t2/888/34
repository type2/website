Subject: thermostat/flaps question

Strange question; type IV engine:

Assume that an engine was assembled such that the tension spring on  
the air control flaps was left off or not tensioned properly.  Is the  
air pressure from the fan enough to move the flaps to the OPEN  
position without the spring tension provided that the thermostat  
cable is slack?
