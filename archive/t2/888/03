Subject: AC/DC setup for an AC only fridge

Ok.. here's the sitch.

I bought a standard fridge froms Lowes, and put it in the van.  I
have an AC convert hooked up to it on a switch so that I can run it
off the batteries.  this works great.

I am in the process of putting the AC (shore power) in, and I'd like
to have the AC or DC option the fridge.

SO......

If the switch is on, I want it to draw from DC....  if i plug in the
AC, i want it to automatically cut off the DC and on the AC..

The current plan involves 1 duplex outlet fed by the AC converter.
there will be an HD solenoid between the converter and the outlet.
Then..  i have the AC hooked to the same outlet, and when it gets
"hot" it will cut off the solenoid  between the outlet and the
converter so that the power wont seep backwards.

thoughts?
