Subject: Follow-up: removing hubcap

Hi Folks,

Without belaboring this and with thanks to all for ideas, I wanted to let you
know what finally worked for getting that rusted-on hubcap off the front spare
tire.  I took a stout wire clothes hanger and cut a piece about a foot long
and bent that into a U.  I bent little fish-hooks on the tips, each one about
an inch long.  So what I made was essentially that 85-cent hubcap tool, though
undoubtedly not as stout as the commercial one.  Then I took a three-foot
crowbar and ran it through the loop and stuck one end in the rim opposite the
hubcap holes, and then I could lever off the cap.  Worked for me.

See you on the road,
Jerry
