Richard,
	I'm like you and don't like any additional metal flying around in my 
engine. The chances of it getting anywhere from the oil pickup are 
pretty slim, but that doesnt' mean it couldn't get bounced up from the 
bottom of the sump and into a large moving part (say a crankshaft) there 
is where you could see some issues. I'd say the chance is quite small, 
but why don't you give a shot at putting a magnet stick in the 
distributor hole and fishing around for it, you just might get lucky 
enough to pull it out of there.
