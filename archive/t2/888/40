Subject: Orange gear-like plastic things....Hmmmmmm....

Hi.... Well about a month ago I posted that I had a lifter that had 
mushroomed on the cam. Finally got the time to tear into it. I have the 
engine split in my shop and am ready to put everything back together. The 
cam lobe looks good. No scoring and no bad wear. The lifter, however, was 
pounded into submission....

I have one question, though... On the six looooong bolts that that go all 
the way through the engine that hold the two halves together, is there a 
seal of some kind? I notice that there're orange gear-like plastic things. 
Is that what these are? Should I replace them? If so, what do I call them 
besides gear-like plastic things?

The fan bolts I had to use an extractor! I searched high and low for a tool 
and couldn't find one...

Thanks in advance!!
