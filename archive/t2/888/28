Subject: What is this AFM for?

  After pointing out to him the flapper sticks in the middle of rotation 
and fuel pump contact did not open at no throttle, a guy at a local vw 
show wanted only $5 for a 7-pin AFM with air cleaner and a nice flexible 
s tube attached.  The flapper just hits on some corrosion I can sand 
away and the contact can be bent in place, but the part number is NOT in 
the bus Bentley- what is this AFM for?
0 280 200 018   - I have good late harnesses and what this for 
daughter's current 75 setup?
