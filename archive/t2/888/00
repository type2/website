Subject: Bus sighting: Nacho Libre

A mariochi band unloads from a blue bay-window in Nacho Libre.  Silly
fun film filmed on location in Mexico.  Theres one noticable orange
bullet-style roof light on the bus, and I didn't see a light on the
passenger door.  Can't tell you what that means, but truck roof lights
sounded like an interesting visibility feature for a bus..
