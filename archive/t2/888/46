Hi Rob,

These extra switches for starter and ignition are usually a good  
indication that the ignition switch is faulty. The good news is that  
an ignition switch replacement is not all that difficult or expensive.

Asumming the PO hasn't mucked up the wiring too badly installing the  
bypass switches.....


Happy trails,
