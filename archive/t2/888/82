Subject: sunroof

	Another, rare option for a small sunroof is the ft-square 
sunroof in the middle of the Devon popup roof.  The front or rear 
rim, or both, can be locked up (gap only a couple in.).
	 Maker's label: Weathershields Ltd, Birmingham, England.
	Its aerodynamics are poor, but it is a very useful little 
sunroof  -  and after 33y mine is still weathertight.
	So if you see a wrecked Devon, don't assume the little 
sunroof is wrecked  ...  get down on it.
