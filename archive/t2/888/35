Subject: Charcoal cannister and vent tube routing (theories and musings

Hey Y'al,

Not really any questions per se, just theories and musings on the physics of 
type 2 VW engines...

[Background Info]
I recently replaced the dual carbs et al on my 1972, 1700, with a single Weber 
carb conversion kit from CIP1. The new carb works very well and it has 
improved my fuel economy, and power greatly.

However, immediately after the carb swap, the engine started spitting out oil. 
It appears as though the engine oil is sloshing (or being pushed) up the 
filler tube and running out from where the plastic part is clamped to the 
metal tube -- strange because oil doesn't leak out of there when the crank 
case is being filled...?

Anyway, the only difference I can see before the carb swap and after is 
perhaps the vent tube routing. The instructions provided with the carb did 
not describe how to route the tubes. Here's how I routed the tubes (at 
first):

1. Vent on left of engine to charcoal cannister (end with single wide pipe);
2. Charcoal cannister (end with two pipes [one smaller]) to T-connector
3. Breather Vent (if that's what it's called) to same T-connector
4. T-connector to air cleaner inlet on carb.

Here's a little ascii diagram for those without proportional spaced fonts  :)

[Theory 1]

How much pressure would there be at the vent on the left side the fan housing? 
Would it be more than the vacuum created by the air cleaner intake vent, 
enough to actually pressurize the crank case and cause oil to be pushed up 
the filler tube?

Or, Since the new carb seems to have quite a bit more suction than the old 
setup, could this vent tube routing cause the oil to get sucked out 
somewhere? The vent tubes seem to have quite a bit more moisture and 
oil-froth(?) in them than before.


To test this, I've re-routed the tubes like this (confirmed as the "correct" 
way by a posting by Bruce Maxson in the archives):

1. Vent on left of engine to T-connector
2. Case Breather Vent to same T-connector
3. T-connector to charcoal cannister (end with two pipes [one smaller])
4. Charcoal cannister (end with one pipe) to air cleaner inlet on carb.

         |      |   air   |         |
         |      | cleaner |         |
         |      ---.-------         |
         \---------/                |
                              3.    |

  1.  |          ENGINE               |


This configuration seems to have solved the spitting out of oil problem. So, 
why? Did this configuration add some resistance (by the cannister) to the 
airflow and prevent too much suction from the carb or pressure from the 
engine fan? 


[Theory 2]
2. My old carb slowly leaked gas into the engine which thinned the oil a 
little. Could thinner oil get sucked out or slash up the filler tube easier? 
I changed the oil at the same time as I rerouted the vent tubes so maybe it 
was both re-routing the tubes and changing the oil that fixed the problem?
