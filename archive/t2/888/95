It's not dirt cheap, but it's not as bad as you might think. Tires are big,
but are not all that heavy for their size. Every carrier has a different
threshold for what the post office aptly calls a "balloon" rate; a higher
shipping fee for packages that are very large for their weight, because
you're mostly shipping air. (If you haven't noticed, a tire has a big hole
in the middle. :-)  I investigated every carrier and eventually figured out
that Bus tires generally squeak by just under that surcharge if we use FedEx
Ground and bundle them in pairs. Now we have a special FedEx pickup for
tires each day. The shipping cost went down about 30% versus other carriers.
