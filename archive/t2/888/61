That's your orange and white?
Orange bottom, white top?
I have seen it.
I'm done classes, done exams, done board exams and
am totally registered etc etc.
I think next week is coffee time!

You didn't see me in my orange and white 77?  :-).  Driving to work's
a pretty short trip for me, though.  I didn't see any other busses
today.
