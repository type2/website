	Earth {"ground"} fault, eh?  Thorough checking failed to 
reveal any.  Worse, the fault refused to manifest  ...  solution 
turned out to be a switch problem!
		The ignition key has 3 or 4 vague positions, 
augmented by a toggle switch in the dash to turn the ignition on, and 
a starter button in the dash.  The lo-beam headlights, and the 
wipers, both fail to work unless the key is turned to the vaguely 
defined 3rd position  ...
	Ah well, at least we cracked it  ...
