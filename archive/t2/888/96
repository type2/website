Subject: Re: [T2] Pivot Pin Replacement pitfalls

Well,
     After struggling for about 5 hours, I was able to successfully replace
my pivot pin bushings.   Man were the ones in there shot.  The pivot pin was
nasty too, looks like some water had gotten up in there and was pitting and
destroying the pin itself.

The all-thread and washer setup worked well however there are things I would
do differently if I had to do it again..
I would use a 12" peice of allthread instead of the 18" long one I had..  I
wouldn't have tried to use PVC(what was I thinking?)  I ended up using a
30mm impact socket for the "cup" to catch the bushings.   This meant that I
had to undo the whole works  in the middle in order to get the other bushing
out.  All in all most of the 5 hours was spent pulling the old bushings.

The new ones went in pretty nicely, although there was a moment of panic
when I realized that I was putting one of them in crooked but luckilly I
caught it early and adjusted my tool and got it straightened out.

Seeing a picture of the BusBoys tool is what inspired me.  Thier tool isn't
much more than allthread with some washers anyways....I used hardened
washers and they worked great.  All in all I think I spent less than 10
dollars to make my "tool".

I also took the opportunity to lube my front end while I was at it...I have
never done it on any vehicle I have ever owned and I gotta say it was alot
of fun.  Which brings me to my next question:  Does anyone have a repair log
book that they keep?  Something better than just a notebook or something?

Thanks again for all the pointers.  I'd be lost with out the T2 list.
