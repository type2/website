No, chamber pressure is between the piston and the head.  This pressure
escapes past the rings if the rings don't seal well.  A little of this
"blow-by" is OK and normal, and is easily taken care of by the natural
draft of the engine breather into the air cleaner.

If you get too much blow-by it can overwhelm the breather and force oil
vapor from the crankcase out through other openings.
