Tom:  As you can see,  It is on it's way all over the Internet !!.  We will
need somewhere to hide from the heat from 2pm on. With that black asphalt it
can really cook you,  uj

Uncle Jerry,

 

I wanted to inform you of the devopments of this gathering on July 15 at the
Scottsdale Pavilions.  Everything is set and we are hoping to have VWs start
to show up at 2pm.  Please spread the word to the AZ Bus Club and any other
VW fanatic so that we can have a nice showing.  I am not sure who to contact
at the Bus Club to have this show added to the news letter, but if you could
do that, great!, if not please let me know who to contact.  I am attaching
the file that holds the flyer for this event in case you would like to print
a few out and hand them out.  

 

Thank you,


Tom Newpher
