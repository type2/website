We carry this in 205-65R15, which is the same height as the 14" tires found
on later Busses.  It is an excellent tire. We also sell the 14" Vredestein
snows when we can get them. However Vredestein does not sell a 14" summer
tire here in the U.S.  Even if they did, it would cost considerably more
than the 185R14 Hankook RA08, our 14" all-season offering, which IMO is
definitely the best 14" year-round Bus tire available for anywhere near its
price...
