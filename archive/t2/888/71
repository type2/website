Subject: Re: [T2] Tow bars and 72 buses

I bought a tow bar from Jeremy and I have towed atleast 20 different buses  
with it and some of the buses more than once. They are made very well. I have  
recommeded them to my friends and a couple of the guys have bought them with 
no  problems. The ones who didn't still use mine. So my opinion is they are  
great.
On the 72 thing I have no clue. Haven't tried to tow a 72 yet.
