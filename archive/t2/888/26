Subject: Vanagon seats in 78?

I'm looking to swap out my seats for some Vanagon seats and have the
originals restored and reupholstered.  I know the seats will slide right in
to the original rails, but is there a range of years that work, versus model
years that don't or are all Vanagon seats swappable in this manner?

 

Cheers,


Duke
