Subject: Looking for 1970 bus/single cab engine parts

Hello,
            I am busy refreshing my engine tin for my 1970 single cab. I
have the car in the shop being painted now.....

            Here were my discoveries of parts i need. First off, my fan wore
out......it and the hub. The hub is different on this model bus, for the
alternator was bigger, and the offset on the hub is opposite that for a bug.
Also, the tin that goes on the generator that bolts to the fan shroud. Once
again, one of these parts is different, due to the generator size.

            Last thing needed is a fan belt pulley for above generator. The
inner piece (next to generator) is cast iron and different than others.

            Any help is greatly appreciated. You can pmail
