Subject: distributor shaft washer

My freind was helping me "fix " a problem i was having with the distributor
lining up with TDC,  he said we need to turn the shaft gear 90 degrees and
everything would be fine. We removed the shaft and sure enough the washer
fell into the hole.  He says that happens all the time and not to worry.
That washer isnt neccesary and it will never mess anything up ever.  " No
chance of it ever causing a problem, no chance!" were his exact words.  I
feaked on him a little and insisted that we not go any further until we got
that washer out of there.  He says the only way to get it out would be a
complete engine tear down and rebuild.  I freaked out a little more and then
we called it a day without finishing reinstalling the gear and the dizzy.
What do i need to do.  I certainly do not want to do a complete tear down
and re- assemble.  Is he right in saying " No Chance"?
