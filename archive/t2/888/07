Subject: Re: [T2] Drive Your VW to Work Day

I have a home office as well, but my 69 Westy Hardtop is still a  
daily driver for me

Although I will admit that during with intense heat and humidity of  
the Slow Country summers, I tend to drive our Subaru since it has A/C.

Yes, I am a heat wuss. (meh!)
