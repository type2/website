Mark: Interesting to hear your experience with the rocker shafts. I 
have one of the aftermarket ones from  Gene Berg (and therefore 
expensive)  and the first thing I realized was that the play in a 
direction along the shaft was a lot more than on the stock shaft 
where it is limited by those warpy washers. I wondered why I should 
go to all the trouble of aligning the arm with just the right spot on 
the valve stem when it wouldn't be spending much time there because 
of the play.
I had the same experience with the allen head swivel adjusters. Much 
easier to adjust than the slot ones, but two broke.
