Richard, IIRC the cabinets are Formica, the Baltic Birch is in the
headliner.  The orange-oil cleaners might work; we used Pledge on the
Formica cabinets of a store where I clerked as a youth.

Here's an old photo from my westy approximately shows the condition  
of the wood laminate on my cabinets:

Right now it's somewhat dull and hazy on the countertop. I'd like to  
restore the finish but there are too many products to choose from.

Does anyone know how these baltic birch panels were finished and  
what's the best way to restore the shine to them? Will an orange  
based cleaner be enough or can I expect to have to polish/burnish/wax  
the surface?
