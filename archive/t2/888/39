Hey George,

Hmmm, something like that thought had crossed my mind; I just didn't know how 
to describe it....

Isn't chamber pressure relieved by the crank case vent (is what it's called?) 
next to the distributor?

Yeah, could be...at first I wondered if the difference in power was due to the 
fact that my dual carbs were never set up correctly, and because the right 
side of my engine was running rich due to the right carb's steady dripping of 
gas into the engine.

I guess we'll see...I haven't driven the bus much since I switched the hoses 
around so if the problem continues, then I guess it wasn't the hoses. Thanks 
for the suggestion. If it is indeed a power issue, then I'll be back 
wondering how to fix that  :)
