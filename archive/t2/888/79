Subject: timing scale

any word on the timing scale that german supply mentioned they would have
about a month ago?   i need one badly and was wondering how to measure where
the zero should be on the pully.  how many centimeters or inches would it be
to the left of the timing knoch presuming the knotch is at twelve o'clock.
any tips on finding where the zero would be.   could someone tell me how to
measure with a protractor or something to mark all of the places i need like
the zero, 7.5btdc and so forth
