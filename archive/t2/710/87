Subject: Hunting for a few interior parts

Now that I have my 80 Vanagon running I'm looking forward to getting the
interior up to snuff. I have most everything for the Campmobile interior but
need two things to get rid of immediate eyesores.

1. Speaker grills for door mounted 4" speakers. I have one in fair condition
and one that is unservicable they look stock but well worn. The speakers
behind them are trashed. All the speakers I've found either have no grill or
the grill is too thick. The grill must be quite thin to fit between the door
and the dash when the door is closed and also clear the window crank when
raising and lowering the windows. I would like to find some brown grills but
black would be acceptable.

2. The wood thing that goes on the end of the rain gutter looking shelf above
the stove and sink, just above and behind the drivers seat.
