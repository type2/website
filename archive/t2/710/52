Subject: RE: [T2]Copper gasket seals /exhaust leak problems????

I'd like to add to John's saying to file with a long and wide file in order
to get both of the same pipe mating surface in the same plan.  However it is
a little hard to tell if this final plan will be perpendicular enough to the
exhaust studs centerline for a perfect seal.  While filing, it takes much
time to get down on all the mating surface, you may try to bend the pipe
(probably bend back because it was probably altered) to "save" some filing.

Increasing a little the hole's size of the pipe's flanges (by drilling)
would help self-alignment of the new surface.

You may try some, I said some muffler paste on the mating surfaces.  It
works on small gaps.  Its a good idea to let it set (in other words, dry)
before running the engine.  Heat would help the paste to set.

It's hard to get the manifolds to seat correctly, especially if you've
done some brazing. The pipes tend to warp anyway from exhaust heat,
and you generally have to file the tops of the manifolds to get them
flat again, and then carefully tighten the manifolds onto the head to
get a good seal.
