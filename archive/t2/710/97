Subject: Re: [T2] seat belt extenders

From Kevin:

 Hi Guys. I know I've seen seat belt extenders for Type
II's somewhere but don't recall where.  It's not Bus
Depot.  I have one friend that's about 6'5 and is
afraid to ride with me as the seat belt won't reach. 
 Anybody know where to buy those babies?  And has
anyone replaced the belts with the rectractable ones? 
Was it hard to do?  Was it worth it?  Thanks...KR

1) Mercedes Benz makes available longer seat belts fo some of their products. 
They replace the assembly with one that is 12" longer. That is all.

I mention this because they do NOT and will NOT offer or recommend 'seat
belt extenders' for safety reasons. Not on all of the models is there a longer belt 
offered.

2) Retractable belt upgrades for the bus are all over the archives. 

This is a continuing FART like tires and oil etc.
