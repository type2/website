Subject: Re: [T2] 79 Type 2 turn signal problems.

Right off the top of my head:

Emergency flasher switch
Turn signal switch
Fuses
Wiring and connections

If you've got a Bentley you've got a wiring diagram. (Old Volks has
downloadable ones too IIRC.) When you look at the path your turn
signal wires take your head will start spinning. For some reason VW
made those signals travel all over the place.

In my 73, the problem was the emergency flasher switch. I took it
apart, cleaned it, and put it back together with a zip tie holding it
shut. Works fine now.
