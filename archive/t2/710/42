From another bus discussion group, this topic come back from time to time
and I am convinced that there is no single answer to the question.  Some
proclaim bus is running better with premium and some on plain regular.  I
recall someone having see his engine running cooler with regular compared to
premium (head temperature gage).

The right answer is probably relate to the compression ratio the engine has
and what's the timing and timing curve.  Injected or carburated probably
also makes some difference. If the engine is running fine with regular,
chances are it will run no much better with premium.  Head and oil
temperature gages are helpful to get feedback from the engine with fuel
changes or different tunings.  If you want to advance timing to get more
power or whatever, you will be more prone to knock (pingning).   Moreover
the engine will run warmer (if not hotter).

By the way, I often used the nickname of "BusBosss".  I hope this is already
use on this forum.  Don't worry, this is just because I liked how it sound
and triple "s" really stand there so you know I do not boss any people.  It
was somehow copied from BusBoys, BustedBus and similar names..
