Subject: Support beam replacement

Hey guys.........
I have a questions on my 71 van with the factory
sunroof. The front floor, doglegs and such were pretty
rusted as well as the inside of the wheel well's right
behind the front wheels........that is pretty bad.
What i am doing is totally replacing the entire front
part......floor, pan, dog legs, seat anchor metel and
behind the seat metal......the question i have is how
is the best way to replace that rotted support beam in
the front between the seats that runs clear across the
bottom of the van and under the floor....?? (I have
that huge underbelly pan which covers any underneath
access) do i just replace like a half of it? or try
for the whole thing?
Thanks
