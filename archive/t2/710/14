Subject: Octane and the T2 

Hello T2'ers.  Haven't posted in ages because my bus is running so well
lately.  Last night as I was driving home through the hills in a pure state
of farvegnugen (sp?) I thought to myself, 'Bus, its okay if you want to
breakdown soon, I will lovingly fix you and won't cuss, because these last
few months you've given me have been so lovely.' I was contemplating
treating by bus to some 'premium' at the last fill-up, but then recalled
having done this once before only to find the bus did not seem to run as
smoothly.  At the time I was having FI issues however.  Is it all in my
head, or did VW have a particular octane in mind for our engines?  Being
just a couple years older than my bus I have no recollection of what octane
was available back in the glory days.

Hey thanks, Nik
