Subject: Engine dilemma

First, I would like to thank all who have responded in the past concerning my various issues with my engine.  After my last attempt to stop the bleeding (oil leak)  it appears that I have to drop the engine again.  It is at the least, my oil cooler.  I'm thinking that I may as well go a little further.  Either rebuild the engine I have (1700) or purchase another already rebuilt motor.
 
I see that bus depot has (2000) an upgrade for this size, maybe I should get that motor?  Maybe I should rebuild the 1700?  Maybe I should get it rebuilt by a reputable rebuilder?  
 
Going on two years without driving down the road and beginning to second guess my purchase.
