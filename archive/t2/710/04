Subject: Re: [T2] Copyrights & painting your bus.

Let me sneak this in before our beloved ListAdmin kills the thread--the 
issue here is Trademark law and not Copyright. While there is a 
provision for "fair use" under Copyright law, there is no such 
provision for a Trademark.

Moreover, corporations must vigorously protect their trademarks in 
order to maintain exclusive rights. Consider Squeegee--unless I'm 
mistaken that was once a trademarked brand name but has now fallen into 
common usage. This is why Volkswagen has been so aggressive in sending 
out "cease and desist" letters to websites and shop owners who use the 
Volkswagen name.

Here is a link to a very cool paint job that you can't put on your bus 
because you would be at risk of Trademark Confusion from a popular 
sportsware manufacturer:
