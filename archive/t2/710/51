Subject: Re: [T2] Gasket material for Carbs

Thanks Richard and Karl.

I guess I forgot that I swapped out the top end of both '72 carbs with the 
top ends of carbs I found on a '74 bus.  Perhaps there is some difference in 
the tops ends.  The masive leaks only started after I did the swaps.  And 
both carbs seem to leak at an equal flow.

Richard, I look at your web page ['72 carbs] with profound wonder.  You 
accomplish in a week with that '72 what I am unable to accomplish in 4 
years...

  '72 engine talking now: [Right...  Now he tells them...  Didn't he notice 
that the pickup tube were different lengths, and why didn't he EVEN make the 
effort to replace the NEW float cutoff switches from the '72 with the 
unknown ones in the '74. So my CO 'Current Owner' thinks he can just glue me 
back together and that wil stop all the carb problems!!  Is there such a 
dippy term as DCO??]
