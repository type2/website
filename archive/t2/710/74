Subject: Adjusting wipers

How do you tighten the wiper against the windscreen on a 71 ?

The wiper on the driver side (I'm in the UK so this is the right) is 
skipping on the screen right in my eyeline and not cleaning. I think if it 
made a little more pressure it would be fine. I also know that too much 
pressure can strip the spindle but if I'm careful I should be OK.

Thanks
