VW had a certain "Minimum" octane rating anything more than that is
wasting your money,  now remember most of the octane labels I have seen on
buses is for a different method of determining octane than is commonly
used in the USA.   also as an engine (any engine) gets older and gets a
little carbon buildup on the cyl your compresion ratio may go up and thus
your octane needs.

FWIW, I run 89 octane in my 78 FI bus with no problems, it will sometimes
miss on steep hills with 87 but as always YMMV

I remember buying 104 octane out of the pump for about 50 cents a gallon.
and thought I was being ripped off by the price. regular was about 29
cents a gallon at the time.  (lowest I ever remember paying for gas was 17
cents a gallon, the times they are a changing)
