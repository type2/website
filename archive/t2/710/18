Subject: RE: [T2] Mechanical vs Vacuum Distributor

This is my second attempt.  I hope I did the things right this time.

Hi Folks !  I think I recall being on the list for sometime some years ago
but do not recall if I posted any messages.  Let's say it's my first.  I
hope I now join the discussion in the proper way and that my English will be
comprehensible.

From my thoughts, I suggest you keep the combined vaccum/centrifugal advance
you have on your FI motor.  Advance curve of a particular distributor # for
the engine it was designed for is the best combination.  Switching to
another # can lead to weaker performances.

To my mind, a solely centrifugal advance distributor is the way to go when
you do not have the proper vaccum "signal" to feed it, like when you install
carburators not necessarely built for VW engine.  There is high chances that
the vaccum port does not give the proper vaccum signal the original
distributor needs.  So better no signal, in these cases, than a wrong
signal.

Switching to centrifugal only distributor will call for different timing at
idle.

You're the one to decide to try or not.
