Hey, we could have some fun with this! Let's try to think of non-Disney dwarf
names for Jay's bus!  I like the lawyer thread; how about adding Dewey,
Cheatham, and Howe? Or just some dwarves that have bus-related names: Greasy,
Drippy, Rusty, Leaky, Dirty, Smoky, and everyone's favorite dwarf to leave
behind...Smog Pump.

This should get to some of the list on Friday and therefore be allowable
conversation....

I can just see a really sweet bus illustrated with Ole
Man Disney's pack of profiteering pirates: The
dwarvish law firm of Greedo, Snarky, Moneygrub,
Bulldog, Anklebiter, Toady & Lickspittle.
