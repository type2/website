How about a bus painted in a Disneyesque fashion, but
featuring colorful dwarvish characters who have never
been seen in any Disney film?

Like maybe the Seven Litigious Lawyers, or the Seven
Sniveling Solicitors. Walt's Flyin' Monkies?

I can just see a really sweet bus illustrated with Ole
Man Disney's pack of profiteering pirates: The
dwarvish law firm of Greedo, Snarky, Moneygrub,
Bulldog, Anklebiter, Toady & Lickspittle.
