Subject: Gasket material for Carbs

Friday is for forgiveness...

I checked the archives and the library as best I could, but I could not find 
the reference to a posting that mentioned a tube-type gasket material that 
could be used around gas, i. e., used on the carbs.


Can someone please re-post that recommendation.  Thank you.

I rebuilt  both PDSIT 32 carbs (' stock '72) with new gaskets from the kits, 
but BOTH carbs are now leaking like Swiss cheese!!  I mean, MAJOR flow of 
clear and smelly and flammable liquid from the carbs to the engine top...  
The engine has had less than 20 minutes total running / testing time since 
the rebuild a year or so ago, and I don't expect the screws have loosened up 
that much.  Perhaps it is the floats not rising enough to turn off the pump 
switch, or not correctly adjusted.

The engine is NOT installed in the '72 yet, so I am still in a [relatively] 
safe and isolated environment [the garage floor].  I have Amskeptic [Colin] 
scheduled for a day's visit in late April, and I want to prepare whatever 
material and parts that might be needed for the event.

Thanks
