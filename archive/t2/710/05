Subject: RE: [T2] copyright issues

This seems to be the most common advice.  I have already started trying to 
contact Disney to ask for permission.  Which they don't make easy.  I don't 
really expect to get it, but I figured I could at least ask.

     When they don't give me permission, I plan to buy decals and use them.  
That will basically pass the problem on to the person that creates and sells 
the decals.  Whether they have permission or not, it will be their problem 
then and not mine.
