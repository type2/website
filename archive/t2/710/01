That's exactly what I was thinking when this came up. My bus, to me,
means freedom, relaxation, pleasure, and yes, peace. Disney doens't
mean any of that to me.

My mother-in-law works at Dismalland and I get in free whenever I want
yet I still rarely go. I'd rather go up the street to Knott's and pay
to get in. Disney hasn't done anything truly good that I've seen since
Walt died. At least Eisner is out at Disney. Maybe something will
change there, though I doubt it.
