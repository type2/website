Funny enough, the tire store by our bank here in Charleston now has a 
HUGE sign out front with Hankook on it.

Our bus has really crummy tires (they aren't even the same size front 
and back) and after we get the oil leaked fixed, new tires are next.

We'll heed Ron's advice on this issue, and see how things work out.
