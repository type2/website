Subject: Re: [T2] Copyrights & painting your bus.

Yeah - what Phil said - you should be complaining to your law makers and not 
about VW or Disney - if they do not vigorously protect their trademarks then 
those trademarks will fall into the public domain and they will loose them.

Although I'm not sure that those characters are not both trademarks and 
copyright.

Anyway - the fact remains - to complain about VW or Disney misses the 
point - they really have no choice.

On the other hand - I'm not sure that, say with VW, they have to actually 
litigate anything - I think it maybe enough that they appear to be 
vigorously protecting their intellectual property.

And ... say if VW was not vigorously protecting their trademarks - wtf would 
it be like the slaves in China were flooding the market with more fake stuff 
then they are now - at least if it says VW you can be pretty sure that it 
was made by VW somewhere.

jdd (who would want a Disney character on their bus anyway - although .... 
Gumby might be kewl)
