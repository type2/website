Subject: tail light question

Hi,
Well I have a problem with my passenger side tail light. The running light and
side marker light are out but when you put on the breaks the break light
works. I checked and cleaned all the bulbs and cleaned the ground connection
to the tail light housing. No go anyone have this problem before and can help?
It used to be intermittent and I thought it was that a bulb was loose which
worked once but now that didn't work must have been luck or something. My bus
is a 1977 FI Westy.
Meg
