Subject: Re: [T2]Copper gasket seals /exhaust leak problems????

[quote]Hello Chris  your motor isnt one that has the egr tubes in the heads is it  73=74  had these and most have been removed and pluged with bolts or plugs  they are right beside the intake where it bolts to the head  when they blow out it is really loud exhaust leak [/quote] 
 
 
went out and checked those bolts and sure nuff one had wiggled loose and was about to fall out... i would have never thought to check those until last resort...
yes made very loud noise..
tightened it down and sounded purdy again....
thanks everyone and thanks mark for hitting the nail right smack on the head...
peace
chris 




Peace and Love
Chris
