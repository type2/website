Subject: Custom shift knobs

Anybody know of an outfit that sells custom shift knobs that will fit the
standard bus depth/thread/pitch?  What is the rating for the threads on the
late bus shifters?  It's a 1976 bus.

  I'm looking for something different than the stock shift knob; preferrably
something subtle (no 8 balls, or disembodied miniature heads of Jerry
Garcia) .  Please respond to me directly if you know of a source.  I like
the stock look, but I want the occassional piece of personal expression.  I
will keep the stock shift knob for the bus.
