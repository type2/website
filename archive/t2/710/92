Subject: Gas Pedal Bracket

I seem to recall someone on the list had a broken pedal bracket.

Was it fixed?
Did you take pics?
What was done to fix it?

The reason my bus has been so gutless has been the (-at-)#%^!(-at-) bracket on
mine. Since I slipped on the ice last week and screwed up my back I
haven't been able to crawl underneath to pull the chin plate and look,
but I'm going to have to do it today.

I figured out it was the pedal yesterday. I hadn't noticed the pedal
was sloppy from side to side. I reached down and could twist the pedal
in strange directions. So it's not pulling the throttle cable its full
travel, only giving me partial throttle.
