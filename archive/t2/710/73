LOL!!
great minds think alike - i was about to email the lists looking for 
a used camshaft and lifters, as MY aluminum case is at competition 
engineering getting an exorcist to look at it. and my spare motor has 
dished lifters, so i need to replace them and the bumpstick on the 
cheap. so if anyone out there has a complete package... stick, gear 
and lifters...  let us know - we'll share!  :)
