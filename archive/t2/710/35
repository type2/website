It's hard to get the manifolds to seat correctly, especially if you've
done some brazing. The pipes tend to warp anyway from exhaust heat,
and you generally have to file the tops of the manifolds to get them
flat again, and then carefully tighten the manifolds onto the head to
get a good seal.

 i had recently patched a place on the bend there and thought it was
that but after taking to a muffler shop and him brazzing the little
place we could hear with a doctors tool stehoscope<??
 that the noise was actually coming from the #4 muffler pipe going
into the head right there...(oval ports)
 
 so i thought maybe its the copper seals up there (brand new rebuild)
thought maybe it blew it out for some reason?
 pulled that side heater box down and seals are still there but they
look really bad burnt looking....?(maybe they werent on straight? but
the nuts were torqued still?
 the thickness to them appears to be there but i just dont know if
that was what was making it sound that aways...they are pretty burnt
though... black..
 i have adjusted the valves and they are all ok .. nothing out of the
ordinary.. none to loose or to tight or anything ... but are right
now...?
 the bus seemed to run ok as well.? just sounded horrible..
