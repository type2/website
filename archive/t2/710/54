Subject: Copyright - A correction to my post

It was brought to my attention offlist that I hadn't made the parody
statement about the caterpillar clear and I want to make sure
everybody understood...

#1: I'm not an attorney. I just have a personal interest in copyright
and trademark law because of some of the work I do. So please don't
take my word as gospel, especially with the screwed up DMCA laws
recently passed. Things have gotten really vague and
corporate-oriented.

#2: The hookah smoking caterpillar on that bus in the photo would NOT
qualify as parody. As I explained to someone else, the easiest way to
define parody:

Mickey Mouse painted on a bus, not parody. (Even if you make it look
sillier or something.)

Mickey Mouse with Eisner's face painted on it, maybe with horns and a
devil's tail, would qualify as parody.

It has to be OBVIOUS PARODY! Dry humor is difficult to defend as parody. 

This is a good easy-to-read site on copyright law (and most fair use
rules apply to trademark as well).
