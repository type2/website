Subject: Re: [T2] Copyrights & painting your bus.

Jay asked:

" Barring that, does anybody know how close to the character an image would 
have to be to constitute trademark infringement? For example, the Disney 
character "Tigger" has a pink nose. If I were to paint a tiger that looked 
similar, with a black nose, and call him "Leroy the tiger", would I be doing 
something illegal?"

Hey, Jay, you got a money maker!!!  Get that Leroy the tiger  trademarked, 
then you can sue Disney for their knockoff Tigger!!

Convesely, if you got a decal from the Disney store and you defaced it and 
put it on your VW, would Disney have a comeback!!
