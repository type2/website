Correct. I had the same problem. The gasket material used in the Royze
gasket sets is not in any way fuel resistant. The hard part was making sure
the float cleared the gasket. Have you seen my webpage?

The only way I could set the float correctly was to use a thicker gasket
between the two halves of the body. I used the tan gasket material you can
find at the auto parts store in the gasket/sealant section.
