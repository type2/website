Subject: transmission part numbers?

Hi! I managed to get the transmission out of my '77 bus. There are a few
things I have to replace, but was unable to find part numbers for these:

- Shift rod grommet (missing)

- Bracket for the intermediate shift lever (broken)

(there is a picture of them here:

I'v found that the ball joint insert is completely worn (but have part
number for it) so the hockey stick was just "wandering around" in it's
place. It is possible, that I broke the bracket while trying to put it
into gear real hard...

Do you think that only the ball joint missing could have caused that I
was unable to find any gear, (and by fortune have foung gear #3 and came
home with that)?

The part numbers are what I need now so badly - the man in the shop told
me, that if I can not find it out "it would be easier to by a used
transmission in whole" :O
Thank's: Csaba
