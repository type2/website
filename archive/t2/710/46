Subject: Re: [T2] Gasket material for Carbs

-Barry said...
 
 I checked the archives and the library as best I could, but I could not find 
 the reference to a posting that mentioned a tube-type gasket material that 
 could be used around gas, i. e., used on the carbs.
 
 Can someone please re-post that recommendation.  Thank you.
 
 I rebuilt  both PDSIT 32 carbs (' stock '72) with new gaskets from the kits, 
 but BOTH carbs are now leaking like Swiss cheese!!  I mean, MAJOR flow of 
 clear and smelly and flammable liquid from the carbs to the engine top...  
 The engine has had less than 20 minutes total running / testing time since 
 the rebuild a year or so ago, and I don't expect the screws have loosened up 
 that much.  Perhaps it is the floats not rising enough to turn off the pump 
 switch, or not correctly adjusted.

Gaskets or gasket material is NOT going to help you.

Your float level is too high or the floats are not shutting off the needle and seats. 

Take the carbs off and correct the problem.
