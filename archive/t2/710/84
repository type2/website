Hi Dean,

It would be helpful to have the T4 engine sounds on file, but making a 
T4 engine produce some of those sounds would be an expensive process.  
Pancake engines don't fweem,  so the sounds would be different. It 
would also be helpful to capture the exhaust roar of a leaking air 
injection port for those running 73 and 74 engines with disconnected 
air injection systems.

BTW, I found the sound for a loose flywheel on that site the week 
*after* I discovered that was the problem with the engine in the 
sunroof bus.


Happy trails,
