Subject: Cheap busses in NC

Howdy...need to clear the yard out a bit, as well as get some $$$ to put
into the projects I've already got in the shop. All prices are very
negotiable, especially to a good home -
1977 automatic bus, with early camper interior, rebuilt engine, FI, NO
rust, a few dents, runs pretty well - $1400
1971 Westfalia - poptop, runs good, but rusty, nice interior, child's cot
& rear screen. $1200/$700 without engine
1970 Westfalia - hard top, rebuilt engine, very little rust, runs &
drives, dent on passenger front corner makes door hard to open... $1500

All prices negotiable...make offer...I have titles & pictures, or if
you're near Raleigh, come by for a test drive...
thanks,
