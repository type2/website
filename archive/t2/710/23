Subject: Fwd: [T2] Mechanical vs Vacuum Distributor

Your English is understood.  Comment va aujourd`hui?
Bon ici.  
   
Now when I joined the T2 list some months ago, I
admitted my 78 FI <GE> 2.0 liter engine was running
with an 009.  It was <<strongly>> suggested I
upgrade.  Well, I've upgraded to a ...-205 AKA
Single Vacuum Dual Advance config or SVDA.  Wow,
what a difference in power.  The engine just runs
better, especially when starting-off from a stop.  For
my engine, the 205 is a much, much better technology
choice.  Confirmed:  The 009 is the WRONG
distributor for my series of motor.   205-yes, 009-no.
      
The part I purchased is not BOSCH, and carries an
unusual part number of C24-043-905-205 from
www2.CIP1.com.  It's specs out-of-the-box are very
similar to the 205P original specs found in Bentley.
