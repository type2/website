PLEASE STOP CALLING THEM EGR TUBES!!!!

They are NOT and NEVER had anything to do with EGR.

They are AIR INJECTION ports for the smog pump system.

TWO totally different emission control systems.

EGR is Exhaust Gas Recirculation. Spent exhaust enters the INTAKE from an EGR valve(s) to LOWER combustion
temps to lower NoX emissions.

Air injection is fresh air pumped [or pulsed] into the EXHAUST just past the exhaust valves to complete the
burn of rich exhaust to lower HC emissions.
