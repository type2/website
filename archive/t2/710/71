Subject: Brackets for rear swivel table in 76 Westfalia Campmobile?

I have a 1976 VW Campmobile. This model does not have a refrigerator or
stove.

I am the second owner of the vehicle. What that means is whatever is there,
is there, and whatever is missing is gone. The mounts for the swivel table
leg are gone.

The dinette table with hinged side leaf should connect via the swivel leg to
the sink cabinet and remove for storage while traveling.

It needs to be mounted. It has a swivel table leg that mounts to the table,
and there are holes two up, two down, where the swivel table leg once
mounted to a cabinet. 

Does anyone know where I can find brackets that mount the table leg to the
cabinet?

I can send of scan of my manual (photo page 6 and page 11, Dinette Table
with Hinged Side Leaf) to illustrate if needed or a photo of the table
swivel parts mounted on a cabinet.

Thanks!
