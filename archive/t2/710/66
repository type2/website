Thanks a million guys.
 
     You sure know how to call 'em. A couple of squirts of liquid wrench on all moving parts and voila, no noise. 
     You all probably think I'm a moron for not trying this out first, but I was so sure it was bearing or something. I've just never had anything freeze up that fast from rust. Well, I guess we learn something new every day.
 
Thanks again,
