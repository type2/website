Here's are all the things that I have successfully fixed on my 73 type 2 campmobile with help from all the knowledgeable people on this list.
1. Installed new brake servo: stops on a dime now.
2. Fixed all grounds: No more electrical disturbances.
3. Installed seal between shrouding tin and engine: Now bus runs 20 degree cooler head temp than before.
 
     I'm almost ready for a trip to Northern California that I'm planning on the 28th. Engine's strong, oil and head temp in the blue, compression's good, new tires, and engine idles like a messerschmitz.
 
     But, I just went out to get some gas around the corner. It was raining, and I had my windshield wipers on and working fine, got out, pumped gas, got back in. Started the van, and the most abominable noise came from the right windshield wiper. Sounded like a 200 year old swingset being dismantled by a grizzly bear. Drove it home ( 0 visibility my friends) and can find nothing wrong with the motor. Is there some kind of bearing system in the post that the wiper attaches to? Has anyone else come upon this problem, and if so, how fix?
 
Thank you everyone for your great help and advice.
