Subject: [T2]Copper gasket seals /exhaust leak problems????

i pulled off yesterday to take my little one to school and we started hearing a loud rumbling noise like a bad bad exhaust leak...?
i had recently patched a place on the bend there and thought it was that but after taking to a muffler shop and him brazzing the little place we could hear with a doctors tool stehoscope<??
that the noise was actually coming from the #4 muffler pipe going into the head right there...(oval ports)
 
so i thought maybe its the copper seals up there (brand new rebuild) thought maybe it blew it out for some reason?
pulled that side heater box down and seals are still there but they look really bad burnt looking....?(maybe they werent on straight? but the nuts were torqued still?
the thickness to them appears to be there but i just dont know if that was what was making it sound that aways...they are pretty burnt though... black.. 
i have adjusted the valves and they are all ok .. nothing out of the ordinary.. none to loose or to tight or anything ... but are right now...?
the bus seemed to run ok as well.? just sounded horrible..
 
so anybody know the part number for these seals(total four) and what they are called and also if this sounds like my problem or if the rest is something more internal ...?
 wont know that till a compression test though...?
 
76 bus 1800 engine running weber carb dfev 32 /36 brand new everything....hmmmm.. now whats wrong and screaming to be fixed...errggg always something isnt it or seems that aways with my bus...
peace
