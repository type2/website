Subject: Mechanical vs Vacuum Distributor

I've obtained a mechanical advance distributor and was just wondering what
would the advantage be of using this rather than the vacuum one that is on
the van now in my fuel injected engine.
The guy who gave it to me uses these exclusivly, but he has bugs, not vans.
All said something about it being better at low RPMs.
Any thoughts??
