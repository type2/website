Well... borderline. It's not an immediately recognizable icon like
Mickey Mouse... Does that scene exist in Alice (Is that where it's
from?) If it really exists it's a definite no-no. If not, it would
PROBABLY be ok. Parody is a very thin line. It has to be obvious it's
parody and this really isn't very obvious.

As for the border crossings, I've heard horror stories about people
with any kind of drug artwork getting really harrassed.
