Subject: [T2]correct weber jets size

anybody got a link or knowledge of correct size jets for the inside of the carb...(weber 32/36 dfev)?
 
i can go to weber but i am sure some of you may have already done this to have it corret sizes for your engine..?
 
i now my first is a 50 and my secondary in a 55 but not sure what the jet sizes are inside as it is a brand new carb and havent opened it to see.. wanted to buy the jets first and then change them out... jst need a correct size if anyone knows..?
 
the four insde and if the four inside ????
two up top and two down in the bottom... the big one i think stays the same right?
peace and thanks in advance.
