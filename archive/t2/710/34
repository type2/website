Subject: 72 Westy Front Seats

Hi everyone, after much coaxing from my wife, it is time to sell the seats  
from the first bus I owned.  These 2 front seats came from a 72 Westy that  has 
since moved on.  I kept these seats because they were in such good  shape, 
thinking I would use them in a future bus.  Well I did use the  drivers seat in 
the 76 Westy before I re-did the seats.   
 
The horsehair in both seats is still soft and not brittle at all.   There are 
no tears and the piping is on the edges all the way around.   There is hardly 
any rust on the frame worth mentioning.  I posted a picture  on thesamba, 
here's the link:

The drivers seat is a bit more dirty than the passenger seat.  I guess  it 
was used more?  I have scrubbed them with all kinds of stuff, and this  is the 
best I could get them.  I guess someone wanting a cleaner look could  just 
order covers from TMI or WW, because like I said, the horsehair is still  great. 
 
With all that being said, I want to sell them, but I don't know what  
pricerange I should be looking for.
 
Any input?  I am not looking to get rich, just help pay for the work I  need 
to get done on the "new" 77 Westy.
 
Thanks.
