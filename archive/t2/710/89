Subject: 79 Type 2 turn signal problems.

I have a 1979 Type 2. I'm SURE I would find the solution to my problem 
in the archives, however I'm impatient and found it too slow to search 
for things. Anywho my problem is this...

When I activate on the turn signal the indicator light on the dash turns 
on and is solid, however the exterior signal light won't turn on at all. 
I have replaced the flasher relay (multipul times, two and three prong 
versions, currently three prong) with no avail. The parking lights all 
come on just fine and I'm assuming that the bulbs are good (since none 
of the four come on) and have checked all the fuses and found them in 
proper order. When I originally purchased the bus (about 3000mi ago) the 
flashers worked fine at first. After a 1000 miles or so the flashers 
would turn on but not flash-click without jiggling the flasher relay a 
bit. Finally signal indicator dash light on solid no flashing no 
exterior signal lights turn on.

Help.

Thanks,
Andrew
