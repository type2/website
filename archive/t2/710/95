Hi Andrew,

Check the flasher can. You need a 3-prong flasher in a 1979 bus. A leak 
from the windshield or the fresh air intake grille can fill the flasher 
can with water, which will cause the symptoms you describe. A small 
hole drilled in the bottom of the flasher can will prevent water from 
accumulating in it.

Happy trails,

When I activate on the turn signal the indicator light on the dash 
turns on and is solid, however the exterior signal light won't turn on 
at all. I have replaced the flasher relay (multipul times, two and 
three prong versions, currently three prong) with no avail. The parking 
lights all come on just fine and I'm assuming that the bulbs are good 
(since none of the four come on) and have checked all the fuses and 
found them in proper order. When I originally purchased the bus (about 
3000mi ago) the flashers worked fine at first. After a 1000 miles or so 
the flashers would turn on but not flash-click without jiggling the 
flasher relay a bit. Finally signal indicator dash light on solid no 
flashing no exterior signal lights turn on.
