Subject: Re: [T2] Copyrights & painting your bus.

For anyone that's curios, the contact number for trademark and copyright 
info is:

818-567-5151

     From that I got a fax number and a snail mail address to send requests 
to.  I have a pretty strong doubt that they will grant permissions for this, 
but I'd like to try it first.

     Barring that, does anybody know how close to the character an image 
would have to be to constitute trademark infringement?  For example, the 
Disney character "Tigger" has a pink nose.  If I were to paint a tiger that 
looked similar, with a black nose, and call him "Leroy the tiger", would I 
be doing something illegal?
