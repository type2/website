If you just need a quick emergency fix, this may work. 

Remove both wiper arms. 
Soak the rotating portions of the mounts with PBBlaster.
Wipe off excess and let set as long as possible.
Press in moly or bearing grease (I actually used white lithium because
it's what I had, but I removed them and regreased them with moly
grease as soon as possible).
Reassemble.
Slop some lube under the dash at all the pivot points you can reach as well.

Like I said, this is NOT a good long-term fix because the PBBlaster
will still be in there preventing lubrication.

You'll need to pull it all apart, clean and lube all rotation and
pivot points, and then reassemble for a more permanent fix.
