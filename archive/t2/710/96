Subject: seat belt extenders

Hi Guys. I know I've seen seat belt extenders for Type
II's somewhere but don't recall where.  It's not Bus
Depot.  I have one friend that's about 6'5 and is
afraid to ride with me as the seat belt won't reach. 
Anybody know where to buy those babies?  And has
anyone replaced the belts with the rectractable ones? 
Was it hard to do?  Was it worth it?  Thanks...KR
