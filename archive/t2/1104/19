i concur with these comments about the euromax lower steering coupler  
for baywindow bus.

i received some of these from a supplier recently and they are  
complete junk. i would not resell them nor would i put them on any  
vehicle. they are far too soft to be used as a steering coupler.  
completely wrong material or specifications.

euromax on the whole seems to me to be a primarily price driven  
company. they have a huge breadth of product, and some is good  
quality but most is economy grade product. in the past few years i  
have seen more and more euromax parts in the market and most or them  
are marginal in terms of how they stack up against the original  
genuine VW parts. we need big companies like euromax to wake up to  
the new reality that the vintage VW parts market has changed and  
people want, and will pay for, quality parts. i don't buy the  
argument any more than all VW people are cheapskates and only want  
the cheapest parts. it simply isn't so any more. people want quality.
