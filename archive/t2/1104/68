	I picked up at my FLTS a catalogue for 'CSA'-brand alloy wheels.

	Model names include

			DOMINATR

			VANQUISH

			DECIMATR

			TEASE

			VIGOR  (a ripoff from a Honda type name)

and, yes you were expecting it	XENA

BTW I'm told by one man who sells this type of eqpt that some of 
these flashy wheels actually weigh more than the stamped-steel wheels 
they replace.  The original reason for 'mag' wheels was to decrese 
the unsprung weight, remember??

Bus content: only a very few 14" wheels; a few 15"; most are 17" or 
more.  The wankers who buy this stuff also affect such extremely 
low-profile tyres that they have to up the wheel diameter in order to 
retain something like the rolling radius corresponding to the gear 
ratios (and something like the original ground clearance).  They must 
by now be tempted to go to solid tyres, dispensing with the risk of 
punctures!  Indeed I recently examined a Chrysler 300C with 17" 
wheels and tyres lacking any valve; they were extremely low-profile, 
/25 I think, and presumably had a thin sleeve of air, but no means to 
adjust the pressure.  Next thing to solid!
