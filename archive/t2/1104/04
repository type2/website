Subject: Re: [T2] pics of horn/steering problems

I got the whole lot out quite easily 2 or 3 years ago. At the time I was 
replacing the splined steering shaft between the steering wheel and the 
coupling disc just above the steering box, so I had taken off the bolts on 
the steeringbox side of the steering coupling disc. I know I had that black 
cover at the base of the tube off, because I distinctly remember cleaning it 
with a wire brush and repainting it. I can't remember step by step how it 
came apart. If you remove the two bolts I mention above, you will be able to 
pull the base of the steering column into the cab, and you'll have plenty of 
space to fiddle with the horn cable.
