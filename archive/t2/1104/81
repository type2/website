Yes!!!  Too bad it is such a small size.  Slightly smaller than stock, I 
think.  I bought a new set of those in 27x8.5x14 and they handled very 
well and were of course good offroad.  Looked cool, too.  Downsides - 
they are heavy, noisy when below 50% tread, and expensive though 
$125/tire is really not all that bad by today's standards, you pay 
almost that for the Vredestein 205R14's at BD. 

Speaking of which, is anyone running those Vredestein 205R14's?  I'd 
love to hear what you think of them especially whether they are worth 
the extra money over the Hankook 195R14's.  I'd prefer to run the larger 
size but the rarity and lack of info on this tire are holding me back.
