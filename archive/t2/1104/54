"VIN sticker on the door jam lists GAWR."

True that - but my Bus came across the pond as a regular ole multipurpose
transporter, then off to ASI without an update for those values (that I've
seen). I did find specs in the back of the manual for Campmobile; which
while greater in value, are less so than I thought they'd be. However, they
should be applicable.

Cheers, Mike
