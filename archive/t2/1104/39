Ok this is simple. Hankook RA08 tires. I found out about Hankook sitting in
left field at a Houston Astros Game in 2002 when behind home plate the sign
rotated in the 5th inning. Who is Hankook? Made some calls the next day -
had to call a distributor and he hooked me up on the RA08's. On my 2nd set
today. Nothing else compares. I have these on my 71 Westy.

Great Video on Dangerous Tires.
