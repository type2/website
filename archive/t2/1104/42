Subject: RE: [T2] tire on front

If you want a slow collision to destroy the nose of your bus .. then slap
that tire on there ... I believe there is a mph range at which a front
mounted tire will help in a collision ... over that speed and the tire will
make no difference ... under that speed and all you'll do is smash in the
nose of your bus ... ask me how I know ....

the speed of that impact was such that - I believe - if not for the spare I
would have only had to replace the bumper ... there is no spare on the nose
of any of my buses now ... and I'll never add one.
