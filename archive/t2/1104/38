They meet VW specs, although in my opinion the Hankooks are a far better
choice (and the only choice if you are ever going to use them during winter
weather, as they are all-season whereas the Vanco's are summer-only). 

Specs such as load range are critical, but only to weed out tires that are
simply unsuitable for use on a Bus. Among those that are left, there are
still vast differences in performance, handling, road comfort, and wear
factor.

See http://busdepot.com/details/tires.jsp for everything you need to know
about Bus tire safety and choosing the right tire.
