Subject: Rebuild

Times up. Got to rebuild my air cooled 2.0. I do not have the space, time or
skill at this point to do this job. Went to the my local mechanic giving me a
quote at 5000. Looking at parts, labor, I can see how it can get $$. I think I
can buy a long block off busdepot.com ship it and install it for around
3000-3500. They give a year Year warranty.

I want to do this right. Any one have any advise?
