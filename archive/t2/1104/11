Subject: re:horn trouble shooting

Thanks for all your help and suggestions so far.this is where I am now:

 

I have gone to the next step in trying to access the horn wires at the base
of the column. I disconnected the steering column at the "steering box
coupling disc". While I was digging around down there, I clean this disc
off, which was covered in some sort of uindercoating or caked on dirt. I
chipped at it a couple times while trying to get at the wiring. I cleaned
some more off, and it looks like this thing needs to be replaced-it has
about 4 serious cracks in it. So I had to disconnect the steering column
anyway. I have it off, and now need to finish the clean up, and assessment
of the wiring situation. I am tempted to just replace the wires that are
easily accessible at this point, so I don't have to worry about any future
problems. I just need to get the right color wires.

 

I'll finish taking it apart tomorrow/cleaning it all up. Hopefully I can
figure out the wiring issue correctly, as I don't want to put it back
together, and then have to take it apart again.

 

As for the coupling disc, the nuts on it were pretty tight. I'm not sure how
I'm going to get that much torque to re-secure them. Is there any guideline
on how hard to tighten these bolts?

 

Thanks again.this list rocks!(so does the vintagebus list!)
