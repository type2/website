	My decade-old Prius II developed a shudder 90km/h +   not 
corrected by balancing the front wheels.  As that balancing was just 
finishing, the proprietor of my FLTS pointed to the rear R tyre and 
mentioned calmly "that's buggered".  He was obviously correct, and 
the bulge was bad enough that I felt ashamed at failing to notice it 
myself.
	The 2 140K JPGs I took (but am debarred from slapping on T2 
List; let me know if you want them direct) give some idea of a tread 
that looked near delamination, centrifugation, discombooberation, and 
contribution to road alligators.
	Of indeterminate age (I've owned the car only 2.5 y), this 
Yokohama is of their variety claimed to save yet more fuel for the 
55+mi/gall(Imp) Prius.  The title is 'Yokohama ECOS  DNA' :-X .
	I've switched to Bridgestone   --  same size (165/65 x 15) 
but not claimed to be 'Ecos' let alone 'DNA'.

	Is it possible that Yokohama KK had managed to decrease 
rolling drag a little, but at the price of physical integrity?

  Anyone who is in touch with AceTVDriver Jeremy Clarkson please fw to 
him.  Perhaps he can mock Yokohama KK's silly brands, as he has some 
other Jap language.  And he might show my lurid pix on worldwide TV. 
Now that would be feedback to the market!

Bus content: Yokohama used to make (probably still do) some Light 
Truck tyres which did well on my Nissan Vanette.  Anyone tried them 
on a bus?
