So we need to design a fake spare tire and wheel that collapses in a 
crash... Seriously.

Make it out of hollow foam and paint it like a real tire and wheel? Real 
hubcap? I'd run one with a spare tire cover altered to show the wheel 
and hubcap (hubcap facing front).

I run mine facing the front so the wheel and hubcap are visible.
