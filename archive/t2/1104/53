Larry <baillybusbarn(-at-)juno.com> ex Viet Nam has laid it on us.

	One puzzling bit:

>  Nearly correct tires are out there.   Search 185/80 14 at Tire rack.

	I take it these will fit OK on normal T2 rims.  I imagine the 
results of this /80 section would be, approx:-

less body roll, and less tendency to rollover, on tight curves

less ground clearance, which is OK depending what roads you drive on.

less comfort, more jolts to the suspension, on rought roads

a lower, kewler vehicle profile, more suitable for Hollywood Blvd etc.


	But I'm only theorizing.  Set us straight, O experienced ones  <:-|
