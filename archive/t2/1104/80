The simple answer to that is "Don't bump anything".  Keep your brakes in 
good working order and drive defensively. 

I'm curious as to your assertion that there is no safety benefit.  Can 
you explain how having an additional crumple zone (the tire/wheel 
assembly) does not add any safety benefit?  Seems to me that any 
increase in crumple zone should provide a corresponding increase in safety.

I think my bus looks weird without the spare on the front.  Might be 
because it is a highroof, but to me, the nose-mounted spare completes 
the vintage camper "look".  Wind resistance and low-impact damage be 
damned, those things are second-order concerns in my book.
