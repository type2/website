So, exactly what in the VW specification indicated sidewall stiffness? 
Breaking down "185/14 6PR/load range C" - 185/14 is physical size; 6PR 
and load range C are equivalent, and specify _only_ load capacity. I 
don't see anything which specifies "stiffness." What unit is used for 
"sidewall stiffness?"

Please let us all know how "sidewall stiffness" is specified in tire 
designations, and be sure to provide an authoritative reference.
