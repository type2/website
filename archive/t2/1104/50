Odd. You haven't provided any authoritative source, as requested, so I 
went looking. Where is "stiffness" mentioned? :

"C = If a Euro-metric sized tire ends with a "C," it signifies the tire 
is a "Commercial" tire intended to be used on vans or delivery trucks 
that are capable of carrying heavy loads. In addition to being branded 
with the "C" in their size, these tires are also branded with their 
appropriate Service Description and "Load Range" (Load Range B, Load 
Range C or Load Range D)." -

Nothing about "stiffness," as you claimed. The description just sounds 
like a "light truck" tire to me, which simply means the load rating 
isn't subject to the 9% derating which would be required for a 
passenger car tire.
