Hey Chris, I tried that link to the 3M website without any luck. The link
got cut in half? When I tried to put it together I got nowhere.

 

I went to the 3M site, and it is not the worst, but far from the best! It
took a while, but I found the product you were talking about. It looks like
you can buy it online. I get a little tired of paying all these shipping
fees-I do it enough for any little gasket or part. So I tried to figure out
how to get it locally. 3M couldn't help me, I called them directly. Can you
believe it? I guess that is how business works these days. Produce a
product, and don't tell anyone where you can buy it.
