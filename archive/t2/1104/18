	You are in that mythical metropolis known as fat city. 
Nothing to be concerned about in these figures.  Many VW owners would 
be relieved to get such high, even figures, esp when taken on a cold 
motor (why???).  Let us know what you read after warming the motor up.
	The other aspect of compression testing not mentioned is to 
make sure the cylinders get properly filled, by holding the throttle 
open.  (That in turn requires either having all the spark plugs out 
or disconnected, or uncoupling the coil/distributor lead so no sparks 
are generated; easy.)
	If you warm up the engine, and then read the compressions 
with throttle wide, I predict your figures will be slightly higher, 
and even more even <:-| .
