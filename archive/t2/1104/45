Actually, no, it makes accident damage worse.

The reason being that the Bus is rather well designed
for its age with regard to crash safety.  There's a
crash structure behind the front bumper (models 73 ff.),
and a sturdy frame under the cab to accept the forces
gracefully.  Now, what the front mounted spare tire (FMST)
does is catch the impact that VW designed the bumper and
the structures behind it to handle, and deliver its force
into the front wall instead.  And that one is NOT designed
to take it.

Hence, a FMST makes every accident worse than it would
have been without it.  I've seen plenty of front end
damage on T2s in my time, and those with FMSTs always
looked decidedly worse than those without them.  I've
been in one such accident myself, without a FMST: my bus
was run into a tree at an estimated 25 mph.  Cab slightly
shortened, both doors open and close like before, no
visible interior damage other than a shattered windshield;
and this was in a '72, without even the additional crash 
structure.  Worked as designed.

Good. Keep it that way.
