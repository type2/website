The tables are closely tied to the load index rating on the tire sidewall.

Let's say the CR21 can support 1540 lbs at 40 psi. The load inflation table say it can support considerably less at 30 psi (let's say 1037 lbs). That weight rating is very close to the axle load rating of the vehicle.

VW says the maximum inflation for that front tire should be 30 psi for 3/4 load and full load.

The tire manufacturer will recommend inflating the tire to accommodate the load according to the table. For liability sake, they will also recommend following the manufacturers recommendation for tire inflation values. Handling issues aside, these two recommendations are in conflict with each other.
