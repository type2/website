Chris -

I've passed along your concerns to Euromax's owner, of whom I have known for
a long time and he appreciates feedback of this kinda stuff.  Euromax is one
of the main and largest importing agents located in Florida that distributes
their products to ALL of the main warehouse distributors in the USA, which
in turn supplies most if not all the on-line vendors (including Airhead
Parts/VWG).  Once he gets the pmail and knowing him he will definitely look
into the problem and do additional tests to check it's quality.  Euromax may
not be the actual manufacturer, but is probably the main purchaser (perhaps
exclusively) from the factory in Brazil.

Unfortunately, there is no supplier of the OE German coupler discs, they
seem to have dried up as a supply in the past couple of years.  So the
Brazlian made coupler disc may (for the moment) be the only replacement.

At Airhead/VWG, we've sold hundreds of these Euromax supplied coupler discs
without this kind of problem being reported, but I've alerted the sales
department of your post.
