Subject: Re: [T2] tire on front

I agree with this but it ignores two factors that myself and others
might consider important: 1) coolness and 2) convenience.  The nice
(preferably covered) tire looks cool on the front.  And what a
convenient place to store the spare.  Frees up a lot of other space that
has to be taken up somewhere else on the vehicle.

Luckily, in my front-end collision it was not a factor as I wasn't hit
square in the front.  I was hit right under the left-side headlight.
But I'm still going to have to replace the front panel.  Actually, I
don't have to but it is easier than fixing the one I have.  I found a
rust-free front section that I can buy out of a VW junk yard for $150.
But I'll transfer my spare there for the two reasons mentioned above.
Yes, there's a slightly higher chance of damage, negligible effect on
safety (safer at lower speeds, less so at higher speeds), but the added
benefit of seeing heads crane to look at that cool bus.  Reminds me of
the concept of 'opportunity costs.'  JMHO....KR
