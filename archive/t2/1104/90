Hi Volks,

FWIW, I am currently running my bus with an EA series 1.7L block (and
internals) and I can confirm that the L-jetronic FI parts fit just fine on
this block. It was originally built for D-Jet and does not have a
mechanical fuel pump. It also has a top-mounted dipstick rather than the
rear-mounted one used in the bus engines.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
