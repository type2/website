Kevin,

Try searching google by the 5-digit codes like this: "3M 08633". When I did I found a lot of vendors selling this product as well as mention of 3M 08634 which is the caulking gun cartridge version (instead of a pint can).

I also discovered mention that these products have been discontinued by 3M:
