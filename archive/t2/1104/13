Congratulations. I would love to have a factory 2 liter dual carb.

Your numbers are in spec as to balance and minimums. Do nothing but 
adjust the valves, get it running, then do a test warm. And even if 
you have hydrolic lifters, reset them per Boston Bob procedure.(a 
half turn in not 2 turns in from contact) At that kind of mileage, 
it's time to verify.

Very likely at 200k km = 140k miles.

Don't worry your head with such speculations. You are in spec, relax.

Just do the maintence and tuning, you should be good to go.

It won't be needed as long as you maintain it, and monitor the 
compression every 20k km. Over the miles and years you will see it 
dropping. If and when a cylinder gets to 108psi, or max variance of 
18psi, Warm, throttle wide open, all plugs out, coil grounded, you 
are at minimum. Budget the rebuild then. I have seen them running not 
to bad with one or more cylinders below 100, but you add to the risk 
of catastrophic ca-chunk if you push it too far. Then you need not 
just pistons and cylinders, valve job and bearings, but crank and 
rods and case and cam as well.
