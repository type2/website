Hi Chris,

I posted a similar note to the list back in the summer of 2000, after 
the coupler in my steering shredded itself in my driveway.

The good news (if you can call it that) is that the likelyhood of this 
component failure is inversely proportional to the speed of the vehicle. 
ie, the faster you are moving the less likely it is that you will be 
able to put 30 ft/lbs of torque onto the wheel. The problem will likely 
become apparent in a parkling lot LONG before it becomes a factor in an 
emergency crash-avoidance scenario.

I do recommend that this unit be inspected whenever someone acquires a 
new bus, esp. if it's a barn find that has been sitting a while.


Happy Trails,

   What I ultimately found was that the steering coupling was BUCKLING
   under conditions of torque greater than 30 ft-lbs.  The steering
   coupling would twist under that much torque and buckle, sending the
   steering column up into the cabin as much has 3 centimeters.

   In my opinion, this is setting up for CATASTROPHIC FAILURE.  I bought
   the steering coupling from one of our online vendors   It is
   manufactured by a company called Euromax, which is apparently based in
   Brazil.  I hope this is just a singular incident, but PLEASE check to
   make sure this is not happening to you!!!
