Subject: Re: [T2] tires - wheel size tangent

Somewhere in my memory (of 71 Camper days) I thought the 8 ply rating 
was when tires had bias ply construction and fibers not as strong as 
today's?  So now they can be rated 8 ply when they actually have less, 
but what does this do for the stiffness?  Before the Hancooks we used 
Wrangler 185R14C LT tires, excellent, but expensive.  Look at the 
inflation max, and you will have a good idea of its strength. 32 or 35 
psi is junk- I don't have the tire in front of me, but it think its says 
55 or 60 lbs.
