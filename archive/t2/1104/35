	The recent trend in cars to bigger & bigger tyre sections 
strikes me as dubious.  They do cost more; and certainly cause more 
rolling drag, & therefore more fuel.  On dry & wet roads (as distinct 
from ice, which we don't find here =-O) I get plenty grip with  185 
R14 c.  I used to drift my '57 Splittie on skinnier original-specs 
Contis; my Bay I've not yet provoked into skidding at all (a 
reflection also, no doubt, of my intervening 4 decades of ageing and 
increasing caution), so 215's would presumably give me even more 
excessive grip ;-) . 
	You see that little 'c' in the designation 185 R14 c?  Make 
that a capital C, as has been widely agreed on this list;  I believe 
that grade (C standing for 'commercial', also called 'light truck') 
is more important than section, for safety at least.
