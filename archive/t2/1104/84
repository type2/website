Well, yes, obviously.  But if you do bump anything (and it need not
be your fault either ... you might even be bumped, say by a reversing
SUV bumping your wheel with theirs), the tire will virtually 
guarantee a) expensive damage to areas that Volkswagen did not
design to be bumped, b) which can't be seen on a scant inspection:
that SUV driver, even if they think of actually checking out what
they bumped, will never see they damaged anything.  You will, when
you take the tire off next time.

That's easy: the tire, or rather the rim, won't crumple.  They are
really rather massively built.  But that's not the problem; after
all, bolting massive things to your crumple zone should not keep
it from crumpling, right?  The problem however is, the front wall
which you bolt the tire to (or anyway, which it sits in front of)
IS NOT your crumple zone.  That's under your feet, and behind your
front bumper if you have a '73 or later.  Those are the structures
that Volkswagen designed to take the impact; and what your front
mounted spare does is catch the impact away from those, not absorb
any of it itself, and deliver it all fresh into your front wall,
which is NOT designed to take it.  Mind you, it will crumple quite
nicely; but look where your legs are.  You really don't want it to.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Ermel.
