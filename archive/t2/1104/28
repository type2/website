Subject: Re: [T2] tires - wheel size tangent

On an tangent - has anyone considered converting to 15s?  GoWesty sells
steel wheels<http://www.gowesty.com/ec_view_details.php?id=3073&category_id=369&category_parent_id=>that
take the same center cap, but are 15x7, allowing for 215/65-15
tires which might be more stable, and easier to find... and would fill out
the wheel well better and look nice too (IMHO).
