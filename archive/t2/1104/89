This is just off the top of my head so nothing like comprensive. The 
1700 was designed for carbs. The 2.0 for FI. The differences would require.

Block off plate for the fuel pump.
Provision for mounting the cold start air bypass valve will not be 
found on the 1700. It needs to be fastened to the block for heat 
transfer. This is not going to be easy to do.
Same for the air plenum mount. Should bolt right up to the case half 
bolts, BUT??
I do not know if the cylinder holes for a 1.7 might be smaller than 
the later 2.0?? If I have to guess, I would expect them to be the same, BUT????
Mounting the thermo time switch might be an issue.

A careful review of the Bentley should be done as I expect the specs 
for the cylinder bores in the blocks will be shown, and review of the 
procedures and pix of the different systems will reveal some of the issues.
