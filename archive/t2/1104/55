I forget the source - it's likely Tire Sticky on Samba - or maybe
RoadHaus...

Today's load range/ply ratings indeed do not count the physical number of
body ply layers found inside a tire, but indicate an equivalent strength
based on early bias ply tires.  It's a holdover translation from an older
system. Before load ranges were adopted, ply ratings were used to identify
the strength of LT tires with higher numerical values given to tires with
heavier duty construction.  Load ranges are identified ascending from A to
Z; that is, the further along the letter is in the alphabet, the stronger
the tire and the greater amount of air pressure it can withstand and load it
can carry.

So - lower ply count,  but same/ greater strength - is how I interpret that.
When I chatted with Tire Rack a couple years ago, they mentioned that Load
Range D was now industry standard to mean 8 ply. I'm guessing he should have
said "8 ply strength".

Max psi on my Vanco2s is 65psi with Load Range D.
