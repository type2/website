	I would go so far as to suggest, tentatively, that your motor 
has high-compression heads.  The figures are so high that (assuming 
your gauge is not exaggerating) they're above what I've seen in my 
admittedly limited experience of such tests on VW motors.
	What do the more experienced T2ers think?
	Anyhow, I believe the spread of these 4 figures is not large.
