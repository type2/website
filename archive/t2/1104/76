One option for a true M+S bus tire has traditionally been Nokian.

The Hakkapeliitta CS is a true year round tire with the appropriate tread and the severe service rating (mountain snowflake symbol). Here's the product lineup for their "van" tires:

This page is out of date but there's still some useful info there:

Since I created that page a few years ago there's been some changes to the Nokian line-up.

- The CQ is gone from the lineup and has potentially been replaced with the Hakkapeliitta C Van.

- The CS and C2 are only available in 195R14C now.

- The NRC2 (which is my absolute favorite summer tire) has been replaced by the Hakka C Van.

TiresByWeb.com may have some 185R14C stock and will more about sizing availability that I do:

It is always annoying when your favorite tires disappear but Nokian engineers don't get their bonuses unless they make 10% improvements to their tires every year or so I've been told.
