Subject: Re: [T2] tires - wheel size tangent

Thanks Robt and Richard.  Interesting points brought up.

A New Q:  During an off-the-cuff chat with another list member, it was
suggested that my Vanco2 tires are incorrect for my 79 as they are not
"commercial/ reinforced", regardless of  the Vanco2 'D' Load Range, Load
Index of 1764lbs and 8ply sidewall.

That is, "The number of plys means nothing, if it isn't rated
commercial/reinforced."

I disagree, and find little evidence for this to be the case; in fact from
what I can gather, D rated tires are more sturdy/reinforced than standard
"reinforced" designated radial tires. However I am neither a tire expert nor
a VW one.

Any thoughts? I'm always up for learning something new!

Cheers, Mike
