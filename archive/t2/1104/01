Subject: Re: [T2] Steering box

90 weight gear oil is the stuff normally used.  But based on my personal
experience, a bottle of "Box Doc" is the best lubricant devised for the
steering box.  It's a special moly enhanced formulation devised by Bus Boys
over a decade ago and it's killer stuff.

Call Walter at (530) 244-1616 and get a bottle
