David,
 
I've run 195/75R14s in C loader LTs quite a few times over the years of course
as they were often something one could find locally back in the day without
having to special order.  Often I would find them to actually end up larger
diameter and the nominal cross section width than my prototypical XZX 185R14. 
I think this is likely due to normal variations in manufacturers, and size and
LTs tending to be a bit larger often comparatively with more agressive and
deeper tread.  I'll bet the BFGs are as big diameter as the 185R14 Conti
Vancos.  Just a bet though, no personal experience.  I'd pay $125 each in a
second for those tires for the SC, if shipping to AK wouldn't run me $50
each.
 
John

Yes!!!  Too bad it is such a small size.  Slightly smaller than stock, I
think.  I bought a new set of those in 27x8.5x14 and they handled very well
and were of course good offroad.  Looked cool, too.  Downsides - they are
heavy, noisy when below 50% tread, and expensive though $125/tire is really
not all that bad by
