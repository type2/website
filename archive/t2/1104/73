Tim, Michael,

Thanks for the input.
I've been running P205/75R15's since about 1975.  Not knowing better back 
then, I just had Michelin passenger tires. Bus always had a bit of wander. 
Current go is same size Bridgestone Wranglers. AFAK no longer available in 
the 15" size.  These have been quite good except that the spare doesn't 
quite fit into the spare well behind the passenger seat. The Michelins fit 
fine.
Speedo has always been spot on per the mileage markers out on our California 
Hwy 5. I do enjoy driving with traffic on the highway as I have a engine 
large enough to do so.
