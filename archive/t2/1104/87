Is anyone seeing my emails here? The archives are back up and running. I
wrote in an email a day or so ago that the search engine is not 100%
complete. The main issue I have is that the subject line is not being
returned in the search results.  BUT, all the emails (up until Dec 2009)
are searchable.  ALL the way back to 1994. At some point, I'll fix the
subject line issue. But go for it. Search em'! Be picky about it too...
throw 10 or 15 words in there if you like. Don't let the invested time of
getting them back online be wasted.
