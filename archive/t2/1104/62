throwing in my half schekel on this subject.

I needed new tires and did some searching, at the time Ron was out of 
tires and the Hankooks really weren't right since I ski and take my bus 
out in the snow.  wanted the all season radial.  Michelin was and is my 
first choice.....

finally after much searching I went to the NTB shop I have been using for 
years.   the guy I know there looked up the bus in his computer and it had 
nothing. but I told him what I wanted, a week later he had them in stock 
and put them on.

Michelin Agelis 81 tires, 185R14C   with a 102 load rating.  all season 
radials.   handle well and go in the snow.    only drawback, not cheap!

but you need someone who can function without the salesdesk computer 
because they weren't even listed in the computer.
