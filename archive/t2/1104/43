Hi Alan,

Maybe, but not necessarily... consider that the Buses were designed to take
impact via the bumper and frame rails... the spare sticks out further than
the bumper and is typically mounted high on the nose. Even in a low speed
accident, if it's with one of the usual monstrous SUVs everywhere, you might
crumple your nose before you even get to the bumper's protection.  Impact
with smaller cars might be well-handled, but likely due to the bumper, not
the spare.

Myself, I like it there. I'm not convinced it offers any additional safety
tho.
Mike
