Subject: Re: [T2] tires

Tires for our buses will in most cases require special order from the 
warehouse because, they are commercial spec tires that are very small 
in relation to the sizes that commercial tires typically come in. 
They are virtually unique as to spec and size. I have never heard of 
any other make/model vehicle which requires the same size/spec as the 
T-2's and Vanagons. Very low demand, very low production for our size 
and spec. LT tires do not meet spec. The difference in stability 
between non-spec and spec here is HUGE. The main difference is, the 
side walls are VERY FIRM, but critical for quick steering response, 
dealing with heavy cross winds, or holding a curve in a nice upright 
orientation without drifting toward the ditch. Safer by a long shot.
