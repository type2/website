I dispute both of those.  The additional chance for damage is
much more than slightly higher -- even a hardly noticeable
bump to the tire that would've left the bumper unharmed will
warp the front wall --, and there's no safety benefit at any
speed IMHO.

Whether or not it looks better is a matter of taste, certainly.
I don't like that look, but it's your bus, and if you like it
and are willing to trade a bit of safety for the look and the
(undisputed) convenience, more power to you.  Just so that you
are aware of the disadvantages and can make an informed decision,

Airhowlingly yours,
