Not necessarily kewl or Hollywood stylin!  The 185R14s Vancos (found (-at-) Tie
Rack if you search for 185/80-14) look pretty normal. Tho I do have a bit of
sag-arse (even without load) that needs to be adjusted, but otherwise
clearance is fine.

They are indeed stiff. Note tho - as Ron mentioned, they are summer tires
not all season; I live in N. Central FL.  I'll likely try the Hankooks next,
and see if they are more comfortable. Mike
