Subject: WARNING!!!! (related to Steering box)

I poster earlier about a questionable defective steering box.  I  
mentioned that it seemed that there was too much back-and-forth play  
in the axis of the input shaft/steering column.  What alerted me to  
the problem was that the bolts that mount the steering coupling were  
starting to wear through the bell-shaped cover plate seen here: http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/album_page.php?pic_id=652585 
.  What I ultimately found was that the steering coupling was BUCKLING  
under conditions of torque greater than 30 ft-lbs.  The steering  
coupling would twist under that much torque and buckle, sending the  
steering column up into the cabin as much has 3 centimeters.

In my opinion, this is setting up for CATASTROPHIC FAILURE.  I bought  
the steering coupling from one of our online vendors   It is  
manufactured by a company called Euromax, which is apparently based in  
Brazil.  I hope this is just a singular incident, but PLEASE check to  
make sure this is not happening to you!!!
