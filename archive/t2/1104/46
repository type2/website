Hi Mike,

Wow - thanks for the rundown. I was just reading page 51 of my owners manual
(a pic: http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/224051.jpg) which explains
some of the old coding methods.  Interesting to note that some Buses came
with "reinforced" or "a strengthened passenger car tire (at least in
Europe)!

I'd seen the 9% Rule and GAWR mentioned, (have memorized the GAWR LB Front
2227/ Rear 2800 from my manufacturer sticker, but those are pre-US-camper
conversion stats) but didn't quite grasp their concepts. Your explanation of
those are crystal; I appreciate it. Now I just need to find GAWR specs
specific to a Westy (or better my Riviera, which must be quite similar) and
memorize for when the Vanco's are done.

Cheers, Mike


"There are only 2 things that matter - the load rating, and whether you're
looking at passenger car or light truck tires. I have a Vanagon, so the
numbers below apply there. The breadloaf is similar, though.'
