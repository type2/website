If you are able to get enough play in the column after you have taken the
bolts in the lower cover plate out, you can slide the column up slightly out
of the little plastic bushing.  Once that's done, since the plastic bushing
has a split in it, you can gingerly lower it and removed it from the "shaft"
(as opposed to the column) by strething it a little and being real careful and
taking it from around the "shaft".

BTW... How do you replace the black ring at the base of the steering
column?
