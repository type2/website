Subject: Re: Compression Test result - drop on 1 and 3

Hi everyone!

Having moved from flat to a house and had my first baby, I now have my van
back, in my garage and am ready to start work on her.

Its an unknown history '79 bay, CJ 2 litre twin carb engine - everything in
engine bay appears stock, and mostly original, bought it in Germany.

I did a compression test last night, (on a cold engine) and got the
following results:

Test 1 (dry):
#1 119
#2 132
#3 118
#4 132

test 2 (wet)
#1 135
#2 145
#3 130
#4 144

On Test 1 that's -10.6% on #3 from 2 and 4
On test 2 that's -10.3%

To me this looks good in some respects - 80psi is the low end discussed
online, for an unknown engine age. Its nearly less than 10% difference.

I can't find anything simply stated anywhere as to why the front cyclinders
on both sides might have a drop.

Someone said cam - but I don't understand why that would effect the
compression?

My guess its a combination of wear on various parts; valves, guides, big
end, cam, lifters etc...
...and maybe if everything else is in order the drop across 1 & 3 could be
related to some crank shaft wobble at the number 1 main bearing...?
(although no obvious leak at this point)

What do you think? If its not been touched for 30 yrs, has 200K+ km on it
then maybe its just a little of everything rather than one big issue??

What would be the risks of leaving it for another 4k miles or so?
(gutted - having just moved into new garage we've been given notice on the
home, so going to have to move out again shortly - new baby means won't be
able to spend the time on 1st engine rebuild I have been looking fwd to...)

Cheers folks!

Dan
