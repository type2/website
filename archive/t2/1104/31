Subject: Re: [T2] tires - wheel size tangent

True. I didn't mean to suggest going to a less-rated tire, but that the 15x7
wheel might have more options available and be a touch more stable, within
our specific sidewall/ load-rating needs, than the 14s. I'm no tire/wheel
expert tho, just speculating...

For instance, if our buses require 185R14C, Load Range D, with a minimum
load rating of 1500 lbs you have one Continental Vanco choice (-at-)14", four
choices at 15", all within the correct specs.
