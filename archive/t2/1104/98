Yes Peter, some subtle things though.  Aside for the obviously shorter 1700
crank/rods you discard, you need to use ALL THE INTERNALS from the original
1700 block.  Don't mix things up, particularly the oil pickups.  And you will
obviously have a "dual relief" (such that it is in a T4) case.  You will have
presumeably fuel pump blocking plate issues, and of course if the 1700 is out
of something non bus (411 or 914) the possibility of issues regarding oil fill
locations and dipstick locations.  None insurmountable, or even hard, all FI
stuff will simply bolt in place (using your 2.0 heads of course, though the
1.7 heads if better rebuild candidates are fine to bore to use, but would also
need to cut a M10x1.0 for the head temp sensor if going that way, and for you
would need to track down round port exhaust that CA would let you run...)

Looking at a used 1700 block today.  Thinking of using my 2.0 crank,
new jugs, pistons, cam to rebuild an install in my 79 FI Cal Westy.

The quick question is:  Can all this be done with a good 1700 block?
