I would want to first confirm if Commercial spec tires are available 
in that size. Just cause the're bigger doesn't mean you can go to a 
less than Commercial side wall rating and maintian the stability of 
stock size commercial treads. Stock size will do just fine for a 
Westy, but make sure that for fully loaded buses you get the Load 
Range D tires. Load Range C is fine for a ligher Kombi with more modest loads.
