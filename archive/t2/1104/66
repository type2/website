Subject: Re: [T2] tire on front

As to the front tire mounting.  On my Riviera, there is NO other place to put
a spare as the rear tire well is now storage.  Yes the front panel on my bus
is
damaged from a previous bender, but you really can't see it with the wheel
there.  I do have a replacement panel that I bought several years ago (Rocky
Mtn)
 to replace the badly damaged one on my parts bus  (79 Cal Kombi) before I got
the camper.
  Larry ............... back at the barn
When would you like to travel to Haiti?
