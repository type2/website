Subject: Re: [T2] tires - wheel size tangent

Absolutely awesome wheels. That is exactly what i want to do. I have 
already purchased some 15" Mercedes wheels. I really think I like the 
stock steel wheel better. -GRIN!-

Thank you for sharing.

Those tires and wheels look just right. The little passenger car tires 
look too small on buses to me. FWIW I'm apparently sensitive to tiny 
tires. The stock tires on my CR-V and VW Cabrio needed to be slightly 
wider and taller too. -GRIN!-

Any idea of the cost of these wheels?
