So sad, but you missed the most important thing. VW spec was a side 
wall stiffer than any passenger car or LT tire that you can buy in 
our size regardless the load range. Both then and now.

If you meet 2 of 3 specs, you aren't spec. It's not just load rating. 
If you want to control body roll like the engineers intended, you 
need to meet all the specs.
