Subject: Re: [T2] Jack Stands

Do not waste the money on the SUV jack from wal-mart, I have one now (my
second) and it is crap. They work well for a while then crap out, and the
casters have fallen apart as well. i should have bought a Craftsman Jack the
second time instead of another wally-world jack.
Later-
Bryan
