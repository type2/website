Subject: Jacking points

All this talk of jacks and ramps made me wonder what points people use for bottle-jacking and jackstanding their buses.

I almost always put the stand under the front beam after jacking it up usually at a point where the frame rail meets the outrigger (depends on rust).  In the rear, I 
usually jack it from a similar place and put the stand under the spring plate stop-plate.  Never seen any evidence that this was unsafe or damaging.  I always give 
the bus a good shake after it's on the stand(s) to make sure it's sitting tight.

When I feel like living dangerously I use the stock jack, but as others have noted, it sho' is wobbly.

I've used ramps, but they tend to try to scoot out from under the wheels on smooth concrete, and it seems like most of the time I want to jack up a *bus* it's to do 
wheel/brake work -- and ramps are no help there.  (Having a bus with nice high ground clearance sure does spoil you when you have to crawl under a Ghia 
instead.)

Just curious,
