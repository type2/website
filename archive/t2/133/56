Just make sure your on the engine side of the mount so you don't stress the
pipe.  Show us pics!

Does anyone have any thoughts on hard piping an external oil filter?
I'm considering using copper tubing and brass fittings to run oil from
a CB Performance oil pump to the full flow filter. I can't think of any
problem this might cause but I've never seen it done before.
I would use 5/8" tubing and the filter would be mounted to the
engine mount so that vibration should not be a problem.

 Also, I'm running a Webber prog. on an EMPI manifold.
The problem is that the linkage is a little higher than that
of the original solex linkage, and creates cable length and interference
problems. I've seen manifolds with a built in linkage, and I would
like to make one like this (maybe I could mount it on the front stabilizer
bar). Has anyone seen a setup like this? Got any pics?

Thanks, Jak
