port 1600.  The dip-stick sender unit is about 3 inches longer than the =
stock dipstick and bottoms out in the case before plugging the dip-stick =
tube, also it sticks too high up and interferes with the alternator.  =
The dipstick sender has two electrical terminals which kind of throws me =
because I only expected one.

starting to humble me My confidence is all shot to hell, specially when =
