One good thing to include would be what type of engine & how many
carbs.

Has the air temp outside increased? Perhaps the engine is just getting
warmer and the oil pressure goes down as the oil gets thinner due to
heat.

Welllll. mabey, mabey not. It could also mean something mechanical is
causing these two to not have one of the three things needed to run
(compression,fuel,spark) I would first check compression. If there is
none on these two cyls then something mechanical is afoot. Seems
strange that both of these went out. they don't share a head. Other
than oil about the only mechanical pieces they share is crank & cam
& you would notice a broken crank. check compression first & report
what you find out.
