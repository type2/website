You'll probably be fine with the JB Weld as is.  It was a good idea to
roughen the area first.  I would not put it inside.  If it falls off, I'd
rather have a crack/vacuum leak again than clumps of JB Weld rolling down
the manifold, trying to get by the valve and into the combustion chamber.
Don't think the intake valves would appreciate the company...
