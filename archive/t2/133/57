Subject: Questions for list

List:  I have been trying to find some answers to a few questions that I have 
about my '74 bus w/1800 and auto transmission on the archives and library 
with only limited success so I am asking a couple select questions again here 
in the event someone can help or can send me a link to help that I can read 
without bothering the entire list:  Here is a question-The breather box on my 
1800 that I am piecing together has a plastic diaphram valve of some kind on 
top of it, what does this do and how?  I am considering using a breather box 
without this valve but don't understand the consequence of doing so...if any.
