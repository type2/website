Hmmm, are you referring to the stock screw jack that plugs into the jack
points?  I always thought of this one as being quite secure compared to
the standard issue Bug jack which really could slip.  In fact, I picked
up a second bus screw jack to go in our bug!

The only caution I would have with the bus screw jack is to block the
wheels really well, as it cannot oppose any side loads.  No other jack
that fits under the passenger seat will be able to oppose side loads
either
