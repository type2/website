Subject: Re: [T2] shifter

Just finished this yesterday (rebuilding the shifter that is).  I suppose it
depends on far you plan on going in response to how easy is it.  I pulled
the motor/transaxle/tranny to get the rear rod out and replace all the
bushings, install new boots and clean out/regrease the carrier tube.  Only
took about half a day for the whole job.  You can do plenty to help things
without taking the rear rod all the way out.  It was convenient for me since
I cut out the rear torsion tube and rewelded it to get about 5 inches of
lift!

Good luck,
Bill
