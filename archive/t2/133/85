I've used the welded sheet metal variety for years with no problems.  They
hold up a full-size Chevy pickup now and then, so a bus is well within
their range

Also, never get under a vehicle supported only by one thing (the only
exception being its own wheels).  The finest stands in the world can fail.

backup as well as sliding the loose tire under the bus "just in case"
