Subject: Purchased Jack/Stands


Thanks for all the information on jacks/stands yesterday.  In the end I
went to costoco and found a good jack and stand set for 100$CAN or about
62$US.  They each support 3 tons.  I feel confident these will be a good
buy and ultimately will save money by doing all repairs myself.  Next step
is to get this bus license plated and on the road.

Regards,
