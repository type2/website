<< you can get bentley shop manuals at your local vw
flaps if you live near one.  i live in so cal so that
is rather easy for me.  if you don't have the luxury
of living in the peoples republic of kalifornia then
your best bet would be either Amazon.com or order one
from So Cal Imports.  If memory serves me it should
run you 35$ or less unless you were to be so lucky as
to get a splitty then it is around 90 for the official
shop manual.   >>

we offer the '68 - '79 Bentley for $32.95 and the '63-'67 for $74.95
