$27.95 from us, part Bentley V279.  Add a few oil filters, another book, or
whatever to get your order over $50 and the additional 5% listmember
discount will kick in.

We also carry two other manuals for '68-79, both from the UK:  the Haynes
manual, and the Pocket Mechanic repair manual.  These are both a bit more
"backyard mechanic friendly" than the Bentley (which was written with
professional mechanics in mind) but are not as complete. Optimal is to get
both the Bentley and one of the other two, so you can find out useful things
like the fact that a slightly bent screwdriver can be substituted for the
"VW special tool number XXX" mentioned in the Bentley manual :-)  Also, John
Muir's How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive (the "Idiot Guide") is an absolute
must-have, and I can't say that strongly enough.  Nobody should be allowed
to drive a bus until they read that book cover to cover.
