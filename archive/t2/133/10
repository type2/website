Very cool.  I wish more people would do this.

The numbers sound a little low to me, particularly the torque.  Did they 
have an A/F meter in use during the sessions?  If so, what was your 
air-fuel ratio?  Have you given your engine a compression test 
recently?  Verify that the numbers are SAE-corrected hp and not actual hp 
nor STD-corrected.  Also, was it a DynoJet or a Mustang dynamometer?  Big 
difference in output numbers from the two types.

People quote drivetrain losses anywhere from 8% to 20%.  Highly variable 
depending on the vehicle.  I would expect the VW engine to be on the low 
side because it was designed with efficiency in mind.  If you can answer 
some of the above questions, I can make further comments on your 
numbers.  Also, if you have the individual numbers (per rpm) and could post 
or mail them, I would love to compare them to mine.
