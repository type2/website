Subject: RE: Mexican hatch seal

I recently purchased what was advertised as a "German rear hatch seal" on an 
auction site. I paid $50 for it, which seemed a good deal considering the 
Mexican seals were going for $40. I figured that even if it *was* just a 
Mexican seal being hawked by an unscrupulous seller, I'd only be out $10.

Anyhow, based on the descriptions of the Mexican seal on this thread I would 
say the one I got is indeed a German-made seal. And to answer the questions 
that were asked about it, yes it does have molded corners that are flattened 
to fit the contours of the hatch. It also has the correct bends for the 
beltline area midway down the hatch. It is composed of 3 or 4 molded 
sections glued together end to end.

I haven't installed it yet, but comparing it to the original that's in 
there, I would say it's CLOSE to identical. The quality of the original seal 
looks to be better, but it's hard to quantify that considering there's 32 
years of wear on the original (and obviously it's bad enough that I need to 
replace it.)

Hope this helps ...
