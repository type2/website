Don't forget that the hp spec quoted in the Bentley manual is at the
crankshaft while the hp measurement you get from a dyno is at the wheels.
Figure on roughly a 15% reduction in hp between the crankshaft and the
wheels due to driveline losses.

Also, there are many other factors that will influence power such as ambient
temperature, humidity, ignition timing, fuel/air mixture, etc. etc. etc.
