Since there are no authoritative replies yet...
I've used both the one with the plastic piece on top and the one with just 
the metal tube coming out the side.  Can't tell any difference and I don't 
know what the plastic piece does, if anything.  Crankcase fumes come out of 
both, and are to be routed to the air cleaner box.
