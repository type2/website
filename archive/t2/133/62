I second that on the fuel injection. As much as I do not like fuel inject=
ion, it is the right application for this motor. Manifold is much too wid=
e to vaporize fuel efficiently. I have seen many single carbs on these bu=
sses, but being a purist, I believe VW put the fuel injection there for a=
 reason, and when it works properly, it works well. Good luck with the pr=
oject!   :)     Bus Gypsy

This isn't exactly what you're asking, but keep this in mind. a 79 2
liter came from the factory w/ fuel injection. I have one & it's
great. But it was designed to run w/ FI so I always question the
ability to put a single carb on an engine that was set to run FI. Just
something to keep in mind. Other more knowledgables can help w/ the
rest of the questions
