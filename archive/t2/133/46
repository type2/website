    Whoa there... That's not me talking, I just forwarded the message I
got from Littljessica(-at-)aol.com. Drop a line directly to her or call 'em on
the cell phone, I have no connection other than being a random address
harvested from AIRS... From the context of the message it's unclear if
they'll be doing email en route, so a phone call may be in order.

(btw- I did do PCH, back in '96 on the way to Inuvik. Incredible road
trip. Highly recommended for those needing a get away. Although for the
LA-SF route we detoured up the San Joaquin valley to Kings Canyon NP,
also highly recommended) 

Peace,
