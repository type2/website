Subject: buying a '71 Westy


Hey folks,
I'm shopping for a westy....I really dig the split windows, but don't want 
to pay such a premium...

I'd like to buy a westy that:

1) is reasonably reliable and easy to get parts for..and is a practical 
design
2) hasn't been restored to the point that it's a frigg'n jewel that I will 
end up fretting over.

I suppose I have other criteria, but I'm about to take an hour drive to look 
at a '71 westy.  What are the most important things to look for as I check 
this thing out?  Where are the critical rusty spots to check on...is there a 
way to check for bondo or other filler?

The couple selling the van say that there is no significant rust...only a 
bit of superficial here and there...she says that there is no rust under the 
front windshield (is that possible in florida?)...it does not have stock 
front seats and astro-turf is on the floor of the camper area (yuck).  say 
it runs very well & no oil leak.  asking $3,500....is this a reasonable 
price if the above info is accurate?  Do you have any opinions on this model 
year?  I do wish the front passenger seat turned around like the later 
years.

I like this price range because even if I let the van go to pot (which won't 
happen), I don't stand to lose that much in depreciation.

OK...this is my first post to the site...i am looking at the van this 
Friday.  It won't be a daily driver....just something I can use to visit a 
friend in the woods who actually lives in his rusty '77 westy as he waits 
for his house to be built...and says life in the van is actually really cool 
(he's an old hippy..a true bohemian).

Thanks!
Kelton
