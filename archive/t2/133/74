Subject: AIRS call - trip to the redwoods


Got a 10 pm call from Jessica and Craig just now (Wednesday, April 10th)- their email of trip plans
came through the list just this morning...

From Corona, CA to Torrance, CA (where they called from and where their bus is in trouble) is about
30 miles or so.  A bad start to a trip!

According to Jessica, her bus wouldn't stay in gear...she said she could (I think) upshift, but if
she tried to downshift, the engine would die??

I was the closest listee she could raise on the phone.  I told her that, unfortunately, my
mechanical knowledge was pretty limited, but I would drive the 1/2 hour south and get the both of
them if they wanted to crash at my place, then take them back to the bus in the a.m.  But they have
a friend not far from the bus in San Pedro, and wanted to try to limp the bus there...

I felt kinda bad that I couldn't help them, but I figured if I let the list know, maybe some of you
smart people could pmail her or call her cell phone and advise her on her mechanical problem.

Jessica's email is:  Littljessica(-at-)aol.com

and her cell phone is: (909) 733-6657

I hope she gets her bus back up to speed!
