Subject: shifter

being new to the bus scene i have a question about my
shifter.  i took it out when i was por-15ing the floor
and when putting it back in it seem to pop out and get
all loose when i go to shift into 4th like it is
missing the little pin on the end of the shifter which
it is not, i think it is just comming out of the hole.
 any ideas?  i think it needs a new shifter bushing,
is this an easy fix in a bus.  i have done it several
times in bugs and things but never a bus.  thanks in
advance.  o' btw, it is a 72 westy.
