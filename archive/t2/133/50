Subject: Re: [T2] What kind of Jacks/Stands to Buy

I don't know if this has been brought up yet, so I'll plunge ahead:

A structural engineer/son of a bricklayer buddy of mine convinced me beyond
doubt that putting my bus on blocks (call 'em CMU, cinder blocks, etc.) is a
dangerous no-no, even the 'solids' (no holes in them).  I've done it for
years on all sorts of vehicles, but no more.
