Yes, I carry a double set of folding style (easily stored) chocks for any 
time I must jack the bus.
The tendency for the bus to laterally slide when cranked up with the stock 
jack is what has always frightened me, even with a larger base fabricated 
and used under the screw base.

Typically, I felt better using my bottle jack and just inserting a salvaged 
cast lever from a stock jack into the jack points. The bottle jack would 
lift on the "insert".

The jack sold by Bus Depot does a much better job of preventing the lateral 
slide of your bus while it is up in the air. I went further, and made a 
larger wooden base for the jack for those times on loose dirt, sand, hot 
asphalt, etc.
