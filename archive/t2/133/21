Subject: Re: Anyone need parts at Everybus?

I'm bringing heater bits. Everything out of my garage that'll fit in my 
bus, including ductwork and engine tin. Might dig out the old bug stuff; 
I don't even remember what's back in that corner.

It's getting down to the wire and turning out to be my usual 
"last-minute seat of the pants" trip planning. :-)
