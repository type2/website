Subject: 71 Westfalia Engine (Camper top installation)

The pop top and luggage rack mount with sheet metal screws.  You do not have
to take out the headliner to install them.  There should be holes in the
roof of your bus that match the mounting holes in the pop top brackets and
luggage rack.  The luggage rack should have rubber standoffs (that the
screws pass through) that support it above the roof.

I recently bought a 1971 Westfalia camper. I know I paid too much, but =
am going to try and restore anyway. The guy I bought it from told me he =
would come up with an engine case for me. He hasn't yet. He had all the =
other parts. Mahle pistons. My question is will any 1600 engine cases =
work or do I have to have one for a bus? I believe I have everything =
except for the rods and case. Also can you tell me about mounting the =
camper back on. Does it have nuts under the headliner? What about the =
luggage rack mounting? I have the camper top and luggage rack but they =
are just tied on. I live in Broken Bow Oklahoma if anyone knows anyone =
close I could hire to help me.
Thanks for any help.=20
