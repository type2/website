I took the vent doors off of the van. I turned them over and rubbed the old 
crusty foam with my thumb which made it crumble right out. All that was 
left was a line of the OEM glue which is not a problem for the new adhesive.

I laid the new foam in and trimmed to fit lengthwise - width was perfect. I 
feel certain that 2" was the width but i will check the box and tell you if 
it is any narrower.

Could the height of these doors have changed over the run of the Baywindows?
