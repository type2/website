Subject: Dizzy Woes

After reading 6 months of posts about the evils of an 009 dizzy, I bought a
new vacuum advance model from a reputable vendor, but I'm having some
trouble getting it installed properly. I've written to the vendor but
thought I'd throw it out to the list for consideration.

Here's the skinny: 1974 T4 motor, 1800cc w/FI case per AVP longblock
rebuild, Weber progressive carb. New dizzy is #0231-170-034 (043-905-205)
single vacuum advance.

When installed the #1 tower is roughly 180 out from the 009 position. No
problem, says I, and proceed to move the wires. After a few tries I get the
wires on correctly and the bus starts up, only now the idle is up around
1200 and the timing strobes at 22BTDC! (The 009 was set to 8BTDC
(-at-) 900RPM) THE ONLY THING I CHANGED WAS THE DISTRIBUTOR. I didn't touch the
carb settings at all. When I tried to retard the timing the vacuum can hits
the air flap connecting rod with the timing still at about 22BTDC. I moved
stuff around to try and gain some adjusting room, but then the condensor
hits the tin before it times close enough to even start.

Any similar experiences out there? Any suggestions or advice? How do I set
this up to time correctly, which I belive should be a 10ATDC (-at-) 950 RPM w/
vacuum hose connected.

Thanks in advance,
Dave

PS: while doing all this in the parking lot at work, darkness overtook me. I
pulled the new dizzy, put the 009 back in, eyeballed the timing and she
fired right up (only 2 degrees off).
