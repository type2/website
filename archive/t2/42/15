Subject: Seat Pedestal Mats

Visited the Bus Depot site and could not find he pedestal mats.

Visited Wolfsburg West and found the mats that go under the seat and the 
wrap around mats, HOWEVER they say they are only for busses up to 1976...

What's the difference between '76 and '78 mats?

Anyone now of a supplier for '78 mats?

My OEM mats are toast.
Ciao!
