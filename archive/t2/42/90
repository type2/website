Put a gas heater under the the folding bed, plumb it into the duct work
under the bus if you want to.  You can also install an RV thermostat inside
the camper if you want to camp in cold climates, and you will have an
automatic furnace for your bus.

A gas heater runs on it's own from power supplied by the battery.  You will
need to plumb and extra fuel line with filter, cut a hole for the exhaust
and one for fresh air for combustion.  If you want, you can cut a hole in
the floor and put in a dryer elbow and plumb into the heat duct.
