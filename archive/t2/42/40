Subject: Need a Weber choke

Does anyone have any parts laying around for a progressive Weber?  The
choke is broken on mine and now that the weather is getting colder I
think a choke would be helpful.

Also does anyone have any suggestions for a gasoline additive that would
help cut down on carb icing?

Thanks
