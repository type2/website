Subject: Re: [T2] front mounted tires&crush space.

If the front tire mount were extended out from the
bumper and designed properly you could improve crash
safety by increasing crush space.  Only problem is how
does an individual design and model this extra crush
space?  Anyone MEs who've done any of this design
work?
