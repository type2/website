Nope - won't even claim a later model can be done that fast.

An early model if you are fast and all if easy to loosen and disconnect.

But not a late model.

Even i don't like pulling the late models.

Lost of maneuvering.

Not complicated, just a good way to invent new words you don't want your 
children to use.

<grin>

Did not know which animal this bus was - newer or older. Very different 
methods.

Bye!
