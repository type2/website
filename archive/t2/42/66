what are you calling a "suitcase" engine, the type IV??

I've pulled a lot of VW engines in the past 35 years, but my type IV
engine in my 78 with auto tranny, I have a special jack I made for lifting
and lowering and have an auto tranny which is easier to remove. and I
still in a hurry  (wires  are already marked and the fuel lines have
shutoffs)need about 3 hours to do a clean job.   give yourself a full day
for your first pull take your time and get a clean pull without
endangering yourself or your engine, type IV engines are about twice as
heavy as a type I.

good luck
