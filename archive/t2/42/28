Unless you have a one piece molded seal and are offended by the following
comment....
Cut the seal or open it at a corner if its a glued 4 piece aftermarket
one.
I glue the seal in with weatherstrip adhesive anyway so its no more work
to reglue the open spot.
Ive found that the seals usually need to be stretched a bit so I glue with
black weatherstrip adhesive and tape it in place until dry so it stays
put.
Ive never used an expensive german or nos seal. If I did I might be more
inclined to do it the good (hard) way. maybe...
