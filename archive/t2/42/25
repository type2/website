Its no more difficult for a USA citizen to buy from Alan Schofield than me.

Just go to the web site and place an order using a credit card, then the
credit card company bills you in USA $. We pay 17.5% sales tax which you
would not pay as you are outside of the EU and for small parts like this
your postage could well be less than the sales tax an EU citizen would pay.

If I want any item that is (to my knowledge) only available from one place,
then it doesn't matter where in the world they are. I've used my credit card
to buy things for various hobbies on several continents of the world and
have had no more difficulty doing so than buying groceries in the local
supermarket - just had to wait a bit longer for the goods.

Probably the most difficult place to buy from was Rocky Mountain Motor Works
who, at the time I bought from them, insisted that the order was written on
one of their printed order forms.

Good luck

I've been to his site but isn't it troublesome or expensive to have parts
shipped across the pond?
I'm in california.
