Subject: camper parts questions

Volks,
located a good bus boneyard that has some parts i
want. 
I hope some camper folks can help me with questions
about parts fit. 

1. I found a full-width folding bed/seat in a
wasserbox vanagon. Will the full width bed fit my '68?

I assume the vanagon's rear deck is lower, but maybe I
can modify it. I'd rather have the full width than the
narrower Westy model.

2. One of the early 70s buses had a cool 'ragtop'
sunroof that just opens over the front seats (about
2'x4'). Is this stock or aftermarket? I know that most
aftermarket sunroofs tend to leak, but this is very,
very tempting (i'm a birder).
