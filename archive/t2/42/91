I don't think at those temperatures.  It is commonly used in household
ductwork, furnace flues, and industrial boilers.  It's bound to be MUCH safer
than PVC.  If you are really worried about it you could etch it using a
dilute muriatic acid and copper sulfate mixture.

One other note.  I started thinking about the gauge necessary.  After
reconsidering the thickness of 22 gauge, it would probably be better to use
24 or 26 gauge.  The 22 would be too stiff at that small a diameter to
compress (to lock the pipe lock) and retain the shape.  Also, most heating
and airconditioning shops should have the equipment to do this.  Probably
cost around $20.

Hope this helps.
