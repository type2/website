HAHAHA! Welding temperature! In my bus? I wish my heater boxes were that
good:)

I'm using (I think) 6" diameter flue pipe (for in house heating systems) in
a 6' length, cut to size, reduce diameter by shooting sheet metal screws
into pipe about every 3 inches. I sealed the seams with what I have heard
called 'dum dum': thick A/C system sealant that you push into the crevices.

Added fiberglass wrap ($6.99(-at-) Home Depot), and now I pull 140 degrees at the
dash vents before the air mixes with the cab air. I don't think off gassing
is a concern at this temperature. (If I'm wrong, let me know before I either
die or loose more brain cells.)

My $.02,
