 I think you're on the wrong tack here, John. One of the reasons for the
redesign of the transporter for '72 was to improve crash protection. The
area behind the bumper is designed to crumple, and I think the cab floor
was reinforced to prevent encroachment.
 The bus is designed to crumple by progressive deformation of the 
corners, if you look at scrapyard busses that have been rolled you'll
notice that the roofline at the front of the cab can be caved in by several
inches without intruding on the passanger compartment, or blocking the 
doors. The bumper area was designed in Germany, where they don't have many
Delta-88s, but they do (did) have autobahns and HGVs.
 While I'm not trying to argue that baywindow bus has the modern safety
"features" of a Toyota (would you want them?) it was designed with some
degree of crash protection in mind and will give you some measure of
protection if things go pear-shaped.

Cheers,
