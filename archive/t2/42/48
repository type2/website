Subject: Splitty Engine and Gear Box

Hi,

What's the difference between a 68 bay window gear box
and engine and the ones from a splitty?

The question is that I know of two bargains, one is a
68 bay window with good mechanics but a very rusty
body and the other is a splitty (I don't know the year
yet) with very good body condition but both gear box
and engine damaged. I don´t know the extension of this
damage, but as far as the old man says the engine as
no compression because he drove it a long time in 1st
gear because a gear box problem.

Oh, by the way, I live in Portugal wich makes things
dificult if one of you guys could sell me one of this
parts.

Thanks to you all

Ricardo Sousa
