I remember the Wal-Mart episode!
But I do think that they were more worried about us being fans of some superstar
concert that was happening in North Carolina at the same time,,
I didn't recognize the name of the group, but apparently there was a LARGE group
of hippies heading to a concert in that area,, and seemed to have an undesirable
reputation with the "older" folks

There was another fellow on our tour that was not impressed with a large group
of "Hippies" taking over his parking lot... 
roughly the same section of Hwy,,,
