Subject: heat questions

Ok you knew as the weather got cold they would start coming in.  So here
goes..
I installed a bilge blower on my bus (73) a few years back and love it.  The
fan in my engine compartment is disconnected and has been for sometime.
Well the two tubes that go from the heat exchangers thru the engine tin and
eventually up to this fan have come lose (the metal part not the part that
actually connects to the fan). If I removed them and covered the hole and
the hole in the engine tin.  Would this this be a bad thing?  What could be
some problems if any?  I am unconcerned about heat at idle as the bilge
blower gives me lots of heat.

Second question,
I have a *$*% Weber progressive that likes to ice in the winter.  On my 65
there is a tube that runs from #3 up thru the tin and goes into oil breather
filter.  Has anyone ever fabbed something similar that I could hook up to
Weber progressive to get it some heat as I am driving thru the snow and ice?
Got stranded for 2 days last winter in the middle of VA (temps never got
above 20 degrees) As I had never had this problem before and didn't know
what to do.  We pulled it into a heated garage and she started up after
warming up a few hours.

Any ideas would be appreciated on either.
