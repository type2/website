	I truly enjoyed the event!  Mine was the only bay there besides the
Volks
	Authority 1968 Panel.  That's mine with the Bad Dog Racing sticker
on
	the windshield.

Now that I know what your Bus looks like I'll introduce myself next time.
I'm glad they let you in to show.  I told Taylor to let me know when they
decide to let us in the club.  After all, our Busses have been 'vintage' for
7 years now.

I was checking out that zamboni wondering how to do a valve adjustment with
the tight quarters.  There was writing on the door saying to do an
adjustment every 50 hours of operation.
