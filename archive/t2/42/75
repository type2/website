Subject: Purring bus for -$1000?

Hey evvybody:

I'm the owner of a 1978 Westy camper bus that seems to
be stalling out and leaking lots of oil. She's been
sitting for a while, but it's time to get her running
and back into service.

Is there any way to get this thing in purring order so
it can get to Michigan and back for less than $1000?
