Subject: RE: Sliding door seal

Another option, which seems to work without requiring support or a helper,
is to undo the support at the top-leading edge of the door.  While holding
the door, tilt it out slightly, slip your seal in, and re-attach the
support.

Hi Chris,

The easiest way to fit the sliding door seal is to undo the two bolts that
hold the rear sliding hinge mechanism onto the door (these are to be seen
from INSIDE of the bus just below the window).
Then with the door ajar, WHILE SUPPORTING THE DOOR (bloks, axle stand, jack,
helper...), pull the hinge mechanism out, pop the seal through the gap,
slide the hinge back into the door.
In my experience this is much easier than removing the track cover and
takeing the slider off of the track.

Good luck
