Subject: Informal crash testing

All this talk about how bus do in a crash.  
My brother crash tested two of my buses in 1978.  
Bus # 1 was a 1971  7 passenger sierra yellow this was now my second bus the 
first being 62 Westy. 
The first time they roll her on her side, the old deer ran front of me story. 
Same bus a few months later they flip her over on the freeway 3x yes you 
could still drive it. And they waked away.

Bus #2 to replace bus #1 1972 7 passenger with air yes again sierra yellow.
This time he rear ended a parked Opal Manta that went into a VW Rabbit that 
jumped the curb and went into fences.  He drove it away. So from then on he 
stopped driving my cars. But I came away with the feeling that they can stand 
up to good knock.

PS no tire on the front of that one.
