Hi John Here
The only way to get a crumble zone on a bus is to get a big enough shock 
absorber an attach it between the frame and the bumper. Remember the bumper 
for a bus was designed when you had big 2 ton rolling irons like the Delta 
88.  What IM trying to say is that if you soften up the blow in one spot its 
going to hit something solid within the chassis. VWs weren't designed to 
crumple up like a Toyota.
