Subject: heating a bus

i have a 71 non pop top camper that i need to heat... i can not use stock 
heat exchanges due to a cheezy aftermarket header(soon to be replace)
i have an old stewart warner gas heater already mounted int the bus but it 
smokes, i don't trust it while driving with my two children breathing in the 
back... is it worth working on the gas heater.. it seems to pump out the 
BTUs and heats the bus wonderfully but it also turns the bus into a gas 
chamber.. would i be better off going with propane?
you can email me rather than clog the list if you prefer
dredlock420(-at-)hotmail.com
thanks
george m sayers
