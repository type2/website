True, but if you want the stock distributor to be properly oriented so the
vac can has room for proper setting, then you must install the drive gear
properly oriented. You can reorient the gear non-stock to accomadate a
non-stock distributor. Be certain the rotor points to the mark on the
housing with no. 1 TDC. A clearance problem with the vac can or condenser
means either the gear is not right or it's a non-stock distributor.

Did you measure it with a static light??? How do you know??? If you install
the gear per Bentley with a stock distributor you can forget about any such
issues. Then it's guarenteed to work as intended, and won't foul up the
next guy that looks it over.

so back to the original question: Does it matter where the gear is

The trick is, if the gear isn't oriented properly, you can't install the
stock distributor because the vac can or condenser will hit something.
That's your problem. The problem is solved by orienting the drive gear and
distributor in stock position. All else is experiment and prone to
functional issues that will waste your time/money.
