Subject: Re: Whistlin' CDI

Hi,
    That's normal behavior- I have one of those, too, (A Tiger 581, right?).
 I don't remember it costing $90, though, and their claims for it are, uh,
optomistic...

 I can just about hear mine whine before I start the engine- once it's
running the sound is swamped by the din in the engine bay- If yours is
in the engine bay and yet you can hear it over the engine I think you
would have cause for complaint.

Cheers,
        W.
PS Though claims of 10-15% improvement in mileage are unsustainable, I think
these units are worthwhile. IMHO cold starting is improved, though I run
stock plug gaps so that I can switch the CDI out by reversing the plug in 
the event of a failure.
