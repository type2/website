Any decent sheet metal shop can make this.  You'll need a)a good average
of the diameter  and length to ask for b)A scientific calculator that
carries Pi to at least 4 decimal spaces c)the length of tube needed. 
Ask for 24 or 22 gauge galvanized with a pipe lock.  The Pipe lock
basically is a C on one side and an off set L on the other that lock
together with some pressure.  You'll have to push it hard enough to make
it out of round, but it should pop back..
