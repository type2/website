Checked the archives and didn't see anything to help me out.  I backed out 
the mixture screw on the afm.  Now that I've passed the smog I want to put it 
back to where it belongs.  I don't have access to an exhaust gas analyzer so 
that option is ruled out.  Any info or tips would be appreciated.  Oh 
yeah--76 2.0L in a standard passenger bus.

Thanks in advance!!
