Whenever you remove door supports, don't forget to mark the parts you
remove before you take them off so that you can return them to the same
position after you are done.  They have slotted holes, and you don't want
to have the door be out of adjustment when you are done.

If you take off the top roller bracket (don't loosen the roller itself, as
you can't get it out with the bracket in place), pull the roller off and
grease its pivot pin.  Don't lose the little seal at the base of the
roller.
