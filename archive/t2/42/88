Hi Volks:

I installed a capacitive discharge ignition unit from aircooled.net in my 71 bus, and it emits a high-pitched whistle that I can clearly hear in the passenger 
compartment.  The sound changes pitch when I step on the brakes or come off idle, i.e., with small system voltage changes, e.g. when the turn signals are flashing.

Is this normal?  It's annoying as all get-out.

Here's the unit I'm talking about:
