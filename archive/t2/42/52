Exhaust gas measure is not an option. It's mandatory and essential to
confirm mixture. The mixture belongs where it will run clean, ie, within
spec for the motor. Running it rich will not improve function, just foul
the plugs sooner and lead to a build up of carbon on the valves and in the
combustion chambers. Fixing that will cost a whole lot more than having the
mixture set correctly.
