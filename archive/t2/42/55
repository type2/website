Had as similar problem with my 79. I found that the eratic idle was a worn 
distributer...replaced the dizzy...and that ceased. Then within the same 
month the van would start ok, but as soon as I got up to a certain speed it 
would shut down and then it would restart, until I got to 30mph, then the 
same thing would happen.  Sooooo, I took off the carb and cleaned it 
out...didnt do it!!!, then I replaced the fuel lines and filter...nope!!!  
Finally, after running out of options, I found that the connections to the 
coil were loose on the + side...duh!! they were still attached, but the 
vibrations at 30mph would disconnect them.  Hope your problem is that simple.
Aloha and Happy Holloween to all (Hope there arent Gremlins in there messin 
with your engine!!!)
