Subject: I think I flooded my engine

Errrrrrrrrrrrr.. so, I was checking the compression on the cylinders and
I think I probably turned the engine over a total of 20 times.  After
checking all the cylinders, I left the plugs off for another 20 minutes
or so to vent out the cylinders.. I did remove the green wire from the
coil so would the injectors have fired anyways?

I then put everything back together and it ain't startin!  It would
catch a little and then just keep turning over.

It's a 76 2000 FI.  Should I just wait until morning and then try it
again?

slighly frustrated..
Mike
