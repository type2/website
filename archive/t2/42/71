Dan, that depends on what you mean by "shot" and how far you are willing
to go.  The complete list of parts for an early bay window bus heat system
AFAIK is:

Part              Replacement/cure

Heater boxes.     on a '71, get bus heater boxes used or buy replacement
                  bug heater boxes and convert them or wire them open in
                  September and unwire in May.  The bus boxes are pretty
                  common at swap meets.

Flex tubes        Widely available new for bugs, cut them down to fit your
                  bus. (probably bus tubes are available, it's just too
                  easy to cut down the bug tubes :-)

Y collector       welded into the body and NLA, as far as I know (but
                  check with VW)...  If they are not available from VW,
                  junkyard and torch to get it out and in.  A small
                  job for a body shop, but a *big* job! for the rest of
                  us.

Long tube         Kelly (metwiz) is making repro's for splits, don't see
                  why he could not make one for bays in sheet metal.
                  Othewise, junkyard.  I recommend *against* PVC... it
                  melts.  Maybe dryer duct.  See the archives, there ought
                  to be a million makeshifts there.

air distributor   At the front, also welded in.  See Y collector above.

short tube        This varies by year and I don't know where it runs on
                  '68-71 buses, but it is a smaller diameter than the long
                  tube

Elbow to cab      I have *never* seen one of these that was dead beyond
                  use, but if it is, another junkyard item to be welded
                  in.

I do know that if you get everything in, sealed and even a little
insulated, there is plenty of heat down to ~25.  Below that, gas heaters
get real nice to own.
