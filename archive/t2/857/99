Correct.

>2) Would the Type1 engine bolt up to the Type4 trans in my 77 2.0L engine?

Yes. Remember that the input shaft of the transmission was designed to fit with the crank of the Type 4 (longer input shaft) not the gland nut of the Type 1 (shorter input shaft).

The 091 bellhousing and starter won't work with the Type1 flywheel so you'll have to swap those out.

>3) Where does one purchase the fibreglass "tin" required to do this?
