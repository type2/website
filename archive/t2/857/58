Jake Raby's done some serious work with cams and has various flavors that
will work with stock injection (what you have I assume?) to either: give
more torque, give more HP, reduce head temps, or a mixture of the above
(with less of each). He reportedly has one that will increase torque and
reduce head temps, but it needs to be used with precicely cc'd heads IIRC.

Remember if you replace the cam to get the lifters that match at the same
time. Or drop a serious chunk of change on ceramic coated ones (drool).

Personally, unless you're spending some serious money on head work, I would
stick with stock.
