I didn't take the wheels off, but the disks look OK.  Nothing fresh 
looking, but I wasn't able to get my finger in there to feel for high 
edges and such.  It's not making any strange noise in either firward or 
reverse at the moment, but I plan on a more extensive drive after I've 
had a change to take the wheels off and have a look.  If the caliper 
froze would it unfgreeze sitting overnight?
