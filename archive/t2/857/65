Subject: Brake pads

I have 2 sets of ATE disc pads I bought for my 71 bus.
 I sold it and bought a Ghia, so if anyone is
interested in these pads for $15 a pair (still in box)
# shipping, send me an e-mail.  Miss my bus and when
my Ghia is finished I might just need a bus to
transports parts, etc.  Never realized how versatile
my bus was until I sold it.
