To be honest, I was more intrigued in the rod-bolt stretch gauge at 
the bottom of the page. I've rebuilt quite a few ACVW engines but 
always just relied on torque value for these bolts.
Am I way out of the mainstream here? Do all of you measure the change 
in the length of the bolt to the precision described in the caption? 
Gulp!
