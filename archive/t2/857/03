I *think* it's 8mm x 1.25pitch.  But it gets buggered up rather easily, 
and
who knows what it might've been tapped to if that's the case.

Get an assortment of bolts so you've got a good chance of having it.  
Get
the size above, get a 10mm x 1.50pitch (unless it looks too big, you'll
be able to tell), maybe also get ahold of a couple of 5/16" bolts in 
"fine"
and "coarse" threads. And if you manage to find a 9mm x 1.25pitch, get
one of those to try too.

How goes?  I don't think I've seen you since the burger cruise-in. :D
