A paint that contains high solids made up of epoxy resin qualifies for the 
name "epoxy coating."

The paint can use high flash naptha as the vehicle for the solids, if it is 
brushed. Probably xylene if it is sprayed.

Such a paint would have to be advertised as "one-part epoxy." ( As compared 
with 2-part epoxy coatings.)

Here is an example:

Just because almost everyone assumes "epoxy" to mean a 2-part system 
doesn't exclude use of the word "epoxy" in the name of the 
coating.......although it does open the way for assumptions and 
misunderstandings.
