<<I understand why BMW would have those but why John Deere? >>

Because they are a tight fit, and won't vibrate outa the socket when on
the roll.

One difference.
The BMW and VW male and female plugs are marked Bosch.

The JD plug mfg. is in cognito--
No idea who makes them the male and female sides are umarked.

And the plugs are only used on the full sized JD Tractor's, not the Lawn
& Garden stuff.
They use the std. american cigar lighter sockets.

Go figure.
