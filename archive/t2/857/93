Yup,, it'll be the door seal.. water runs in at the back of the door,, then 
across the rubber mat near the seat belt mount.. under the seat,, soaking 
the foam under the rubber mat if your mat has any cracks in it.. and then 
onto the floor ... mat soaks it up if it is carpet... or under the rubber 
mat.

I have seen that leak many times..
