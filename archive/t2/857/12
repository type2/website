Subject: sounds from front end

At the end of my drive home from work yesterday I came to a stop to find 
the garage door opener.  When I started up the driveway I heard 4 or 5 
clicks and then a squealing.  I got out and looked around a little bit 
and nothing looks abnormal at quick glance.  I got back in and it 
squealed half weay up the driveway and stopped.  Does this sound like 
brakes or a wheel bearing or something?  Any other ideas?
