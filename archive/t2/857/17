Hiya Dan,

Wheel bearings can account for such a noise.  Typically, if the play in the 
front bearings is a bit too much the outer (smaller) bearing will fail.  And 
when it starts to go it can lose a bearing at time.  Consequently, you may get a 
noise then drive for a few miles and get the noise again as each individual 
roller bites the dust.  I've seen this happen a few times now - once to me - 
that's when I learned to check the play in the front end bearings regularly.
