Doyt,

The benifit's of any epoxy product would be lost to over reduction in a
spray can.

It's heavy coverage properties while in brush form are lost via the
aerosol delivery sytem.

You might be correct on the solvent's being used as a catylist, but
there are paints out there nowaday's that set up with just UV exposure.

Anyhow it was determined that the primer in question was a single stage
urethane.

Which by the way still doesn't have much of a filling property.

Why not buy the real thing and brush it on?
You'll get superior filling and sealing of the metal using a full bodied
primer, and nix on the watered down spray can stuff.
 
Your going to have to sand the sealed metal pror to painting anyhow--(
if your thinking abut having the paint stick for any length of time )

No big deal on the brushing of primer's.
