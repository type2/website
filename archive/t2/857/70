Well, I figured out my electrical problem.  On the dome light one  of the connectors was bent and shorting to ground.  Straightened  it and now it works and doesn't blow the fuse.  As far as the  Westy flourescent, I checked and have 12V.  I took the bulb out  and inspected it.  I can't see the filament as the glass is too  cloudy.  But I don't hear any jangling when I shake it.  How  common are those bulbs?  May pick up another just in case.   Where should I look?  If it's the light, I don't know how to fix  it. I'm not sure what that circuit does.  Provide a lower voltage  to the bulb?  How much?  It worked when I got the bus 7 years  ago.
  
  An even more annoying problem is that I found that my right rear  y-clamp that holds up the pop-top is broken.  At the rivet where  they cross.  Has anyone drilled those out and replaced them with  screws?  Or do I need to get it re-riveted?  Wonder who could  do that?  It's a pretty heavy-duty rivet.  Just not  heavy-duty enough in my case, ha.  Advice?  Thanks...KR
