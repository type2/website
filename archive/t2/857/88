Hi Cliff,

I recently discovered that two of the road maps I store under the  
front seat of the westfakia are soaking wet.

Assuming we can safely rule out "driver incontinence", I'd love to  
know where the water is getting in. Probably that %$# brazilian door  
seal. Grumble grrr grumble.


Happy trails,
