high jeff i have some friends that just sold one of there bus's that they had for years that they put a 1600 or 1776 one i cant remember  in.....
  they  were pleased with it....
  i am sure the new owners will be pleased with it also...

  Hi all,
Has anyone attempted an engine swap of this nature? Type 1 engine into a bus 
using a type 4 motor? I've heard that it can be done, just curious. I'm sure 
it would have to be a "built" type 1 to handle the load. Begin!
