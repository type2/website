Hey, Kevin, I like the drink holder you are using in this picture:

I have the same, and I have positioned my identical drink holders on either 
side of the dash.

What I did was pull out the left / right swivel vents, clean them up with 
all the deteriorating foam insulation, and put the tail of the drink holder 
in the opening, then just slide the vent back in.

I holds in really tight and  I can hang a 44 oz soft drink in there .  
Actually, on the drink holder on the passenger side, I wrapped some tape 
around the two fingers of the drink holder, or the 44 oz drink will not 
stay.

But a picture is worth 857 words, so here it is, and I will shut up:
