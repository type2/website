Subject: Re: [T2] Rattle Can Epoxy Primer

<<The can states:
Acetone
Propylene Glycol Methyl Acetate
Resin Blend (proprietary)
Toluene
Xylene and
Liquefied Petroleum Gas 
along with "This product contains chemicals known by the State of
California to cause cancer..." among other bad things.>>

Huh---

So I give --what is it?
Liquified fiberglass resin?
Maybe epoxy--
It sure doesn't say much for ingredients--other than a bunch of solvents
& the propane to get the product out of the can---

Does the front label say it's epoxy or what???
