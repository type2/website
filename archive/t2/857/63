Subject: source to rebush solex carbs

Hello list,

I have a set of Mexican solex 23/24 carbs (almost
completely identical to the ones used on 72-74 buses)
on my 68 bus.
Both carbs need new bushings in the bottom butter
flies. THey leak gasoline and fumes into the engine
compartment. 

Does anyone know of a source that replaces bushings? I
am willing to box them up and ship them to a reputable
source. Has anyone had this done? How much did it
cost? Thanks!

Regards,
David Kelly
