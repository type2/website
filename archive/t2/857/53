Subject: Performance camshaft and lifters

Hello again VW community, I come to you with yet another request for advice..
I have my 2.0 litre out right now due to some recurring problems...
I am considering replacing the camshaft that was there originally before the
rebuild...
It was reused and probably within spec, but I have had quite a few issues
since and want them to go away,
and taking the engine back apart might just fix what is going on...  Maybe
make an improvement as well...
So I might as well make it a very good, powerful engine for years to
come...(my thoughts)
I assume there are better options out there for my money than
stock..?(partially my question)

My question(s) are:
Am I being crazy and overboard by replacing the cam and lifters?
Is there that much performance increase by replacing them?
How do I know what the best cam and lifters are for my engine? Where is the
place to get them?

Once again:
2.0 litre type 4 in a 78 Westy
Stock FI
Hydraulic lifters
ACN SVDA

Thank you
Aaron
