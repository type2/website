Subject: Fouled Plug

I changed out the spark plugs in my 77 Riveria (2.1 l engine) and 
noticed a huge improvement in power.... for about ten miles.  then I 
noticed a light shudder.  I checked the plugs again, and the number one 
plug was already showing some oil on it.

So I'm guessing that the oil fouling is causing the plug to misfire.  
Where should I go from here?  Am I looking at new rings?
