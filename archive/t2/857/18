<<In my experience, automotive primers/paints do not adhere well (if at
all) when applied over rattle can primer.>>

Rattle can primer is nothing more than watered down lacquer primer,
which now is pretty much an antique / obsolete way of preparing the
metal for paint.

Not too many prominent body shops use lacquer based primer's any longer.
It shrinks and is short lived.

It has no biter's into the metal--it just lays on the metal's surface
and does nothing--especially in a rattle can.
There isn't enough product coming out of the nozzle to fill any
imperfections.  

 
<<I work beside a paint and body shop. They use rattle can primer
allot.>>

Give me the name and the address of this place---
It'll be a place to avoid like the plague.

No spray gun priming--just rattle cans.
Oh-Boy--nothing but the best.

There is so much better available in paintland to promote adhesion, and
seal the metal prior to painting--why would any body shop use rattle
cans?

Nuts---
