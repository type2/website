Subject: Trailer Hitch for a 1971 Type II

To deal with some head issues (the Bus', not mine, at least this time), I've
pulled off the hitch that came with this '71 I bought a while back and have
lamely attempted to sketch out a design and take some photos for anyone who
wants to build something similar for their own Bus (probably would work on a
68 through 71).  Records indicate that it was installed by a VW dealer in
Oregon in August of 1976 but at least some parts of the hitch seemed to have
been manufactured by Draw-Tite so it's not something of pure German origin.

If you'd like a copy of the sketch (it's a Word document), email me at
nickpace(-at-)rand.org.  I'll also send you three sample photos I took but the full
set runs about 5.5 megs and would probably overload your email system.  If you
can handle them, let me know when you request the sketch and I'll send you the
rest which would be very helpful if you ever actually decided to make one of
these things.

Apologies for the crudeness of the drawing.  You'll quickly see why I barely
got a C in my junior high drafting class back in 1968.
