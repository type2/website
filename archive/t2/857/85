Subject: [T2] Bay Window Rust & Leaks

Leaky Window Rubber Seals.
    
(1) There is considerable banter in the t2 archives
about front windshield leaks.
    
(2) I am aware of serious rust problems at the bottom
windshield sheet-metal of bay windows buses.  May
include other years.
    
(3) I`ve had a pesky wet cab carpet problem for some
time, and had not imagined it would be my newly
reinstalled windshield, using a fine quality West
Coast Metrics window rubber.  Ahem.
   
(4) Looks to me to be a design flaw.  I live in
Oregon, where things are soggy year-around.  Anyway,
rust can be fixed during the warmer months.
    
(5)  Besides fixing the rust, should I plan on sealing
the rubber seal with ATV Silicone?
   
(6)  Rear Hatch Window.  My guess is the rear window
is also leaking at the window seal.  The rear hatch
rubber was replaced twice.  First replacement was with
dubious Brazilian stuff.  The second replacement was
West Coast Metric.  Fine stuff.  But water is still
getting in.  Standing with a water hose on the hatch
seal did not indicate leakage.  But over time, the
right rear gets soggy; water is getting in from
somewhere!  (Rear window was also re-installed using
new WCM rubber.)  Is this a further indicator that the
window sealing design is faulty, whether front or
rear?
   
(7)  Who has experience and knowledge to supplant the
T2 archives?
   
(8)  Adam Cox:  I'm fabricating a Bay Riviera custom
fit waterproof cover, to halt any further water
intrusion while the bus is in storage.  Shall I sew
you one too?
