Subject: Which seals?

Hello,

A year or so back I replaced my pushrod tube seals.  They are already leaking
again.  I tried turning the tubes, but no luck.  I have an a gasket kit that's
been sitting in my toolbox for ages.  It has 8 red o-rings, 8 black, and 8
green.  One set is probably not for the pushrod tubes.  Which colors do I use?
I have a 1.8 litre Type 4.

Thanks for the help.
