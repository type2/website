Interesting debate. I've been on both sides of it professionally and
personally.

Professionally, I was the Editor in Chief of BodyShop Expo and
Collision Repair News (trade magazines) and I know there are
certainly many, many levels of what "works." The majority of my high-
end advertisers would laugh their arses off if you suggested the
rattle can route.

On the other hand, my father (who was a paint and body man before he
became a fighter pilot) started restoring his 1929 Model A in the
early 70's in Colorado Springs, and the fenders and cowl and rumble
seat lid that he sanded and primed and painted...WITH RATTLE
CANS...still look fantastic almost 30 years later.

Granted, his 29 A has had a nice life in garages and under tarps, but
the point can be made that his paint job has held up through all
these years, and probably looks better than the original.

Now, that being said, the P/O of our 69 Westy Hardtop also did the
rattle can rumba and did an INCREDIBLY shoddy job. Paint drips,
painted rubber seals, over spray on the tires....the list goes on and
on.

Point is, if you know what you're doing and don't have a lot of $$$,
rattle cans work fine, like Ronnie said.

If you have the money, though, using modern HVLP sprayers and good
materials you can probably do a better-than-new job.

Just my 2.931 centavos. YMMV.
