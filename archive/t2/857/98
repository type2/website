I had good luck using a self etching primer from cans on every panel
for an A/H 3000 resto I did back in the day. Took it to Earl Scheib
and had the $300 deluxe in Wimbledon White (Ford). I sold the Healey
and to my knowledge the paint job is intact 16 years later. Like
planning, preparation is everything. First time I ever made money on a
car.
