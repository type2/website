Subject: Re: [T2] Rattle Can Epoxy Primer

<<I've used High Build Primer from a can. It is not a Lacquer Primer.
The propaganda states it is not porous. It wasn't cheap. Worked fine for
a small repair. Since it's not Lacquer Primer isn't this Epoxy Primer.>>

The problem with any paint out of
a spray can it is has to be reduced to a water thin consistency to get
out of the nozzle, it's "High build" possibilities are at a minimum.
Sure, use 6-8 cans of it to get the same filling capacity of one pass
with a primer gun, and a good high fill primer.

If it isn't a lacquer based primer what is it?
The contents has to be listed on the can---

All the urethane and epoxy primer's I've seen / used require a catalyst
to make the product work---
