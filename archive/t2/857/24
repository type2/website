Subject: funny connector

Hey, guys.  Never got a response on my table ties for a 76 but  I'll 
  
  
try a different topic.  

I have no cigarette lighter or socket  but have a 
deeply recessed socket directly under the glove box.   What the heck is 
it?  I can see the electrical connection inside  and it probably has 
12V.  I would like to find a male connector to  hook up to that.  Anyone 
have a clue?  Thanks...KR
