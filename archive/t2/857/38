Hi Guys and gals.  My Bently doesn't show the Westy flourescent  light.  Or if it does, I don't see it.  Is it wired off the  dome light up front?  That doesn't work either and it blows the  fuse as soon as you put it in.  Must be a  dead short  somewhere.  I can feel two wires in the hole on the right side of  the dash that run up the door frame.  I'm assuming they snake  under the headliner to the dome light.  I've got to get intereior  lights before Everybus.  Any advice on a fix?  Thanks...KR
