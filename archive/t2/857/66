Subject: Evaluating CV joints...

Listees:

Im having a hard time finding the answer to my questions. I have my axles 
off my bus and am taking the axles off my parts bus. I want to use the best 
4 CV joints out of the 8. I have new CV boot kits with hardware and grease.

How can I tell which ones are the best? The boots were still intact on my 
parts bus but they all had minor to major rips on my westy. Also the Bentley 
says to use a press to get them off  do I need a press or is this something 
I need to take to a mechanic that has one?

Also will the parts bus be able to be towed with a towbar with the axles and 
tranny completely off?

Thanks in advance.
