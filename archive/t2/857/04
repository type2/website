Subject: Project for sale, must go!!!!!!

Hello all,

                    I have a 76 Westy that I was going to restore but since have lost the time and $$$ to finish the project. The bus is COMPLETELY STRIPPED. It was acid dipped in 2002 and I did alot of body work on it. There is a coat of rattle can primer on it except for the doors. Bus is  as solid as it gets. This bus SHELL is all there is so the project would be for someone with an existing Westy that has been contemplating a complete restoration, that can paint this bus and then swap all the remaining parts over. 

This is the way to go for a resto. I wish I could have finished the project but am in the Navy and have to move to the west coast in a couple of months and cannot take it. I am in Jacksonville, NC which is 70 or so miles North of Wilmington. I am entertaining offers. I understand that you can get a whole bus for the price I'm tossing around in my head but you cant get the almost three years of work that went into this bus, I'm a little OCD too. Please PM me with questions, I also have some pics if interested but cannot get any updated pics due to the cramped storage garage the bus is in now. This bus will have to be picked up, it has no wheels and is on a dolly I made and is only 6" off the ground.
