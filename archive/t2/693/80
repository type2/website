Some other minutae:

The oil pickup tube for an engine with a windage tray installed is a
different part. As you noticed, the round bit at the end is the same
stamping, hence the blank where the screw would go. Type 411/412 and 914
have a windage tray, but not Bus. You cannot install a windage tray in an
engine case that did not originally have one because of the way the pickup
fits into the case, and you need the correct pickup tube, which is a
different length than in Bus (non-windage).
