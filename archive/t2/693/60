When I asked how much the cylinder varied in temp I never got an answer. I've seen graphs but not of the stock cooling system in a bus.

I was going to wire up a 2nd thermocouple probe one of these weekends and see what the difference is between all 4 cylinders at idle, city and highway speeds.

If I had to guess, I'd bet on #1 being hotter but it's just a guess.
