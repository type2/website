Mark, you are taking this all too seriously. It's only a suggestion and doesn't require a long explanation of why you do things the way you do. If you are indeed short on time...

This advice, like always, is for everyone:

Call Loctite give them your zipcode and they will tell you which vendor in your area has ordered 574 recently. It's that simple. I can't guarantee your closest vendor will have one in stock but that's what I do everytime I need Loctite products.

Who is interested in group buy on this stuff so you have some handy for your next rebuild? I can ship a 50ml bottle to anyone in the US for $17 which includes shipping. pmail if interested.
