Subject: Re: [T2] Windage tray

Scott, This is interesting ... I have a late 412 1.8 dual carb engine (code
AT) - this engine should have a windage tray right? But you are saying that
I cannot take the tray out of this engine and transplant it along with the
pickup tube into a good GE case that is sitting on my bench? I would rather
use the GE case than the AT case.

The reason I am asking that I am planning a large displacement engine with
Megasquirt for my camper back in Germany. Since we are on the issue of fit:
is there any reason why the windage tray would or would not be a good idea
in an engine with 96 or 98 mm jugs and a stroker crank?

Thanks,
Marcus

Some other minutae:

The oil pickup tube for an engine with a windage tray installed is a
different part. As you noticed, the round bit at the end is the same
stamping, hence the blank where the screw would go. Type 411/412 and 914
have a windage tray, but not Bus. You cannot install a windage tray in an
engine case that did not originally have one because of the way the pickup
fits into the case, and you need the correct pickup tube, which is a
different length than in Bus (non-windage).
