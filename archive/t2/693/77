Subject: Loctite 574 (new)

Question for people who have used Loctite 574 to seal their case: did 
you use it on the camshaft plug?

I am seriously considering splitting my case, cleaning the sealant(s) 
that are there (and everything else) and resealing it under better 
conditions. Better now than after the engine is all together, if it 
should leak. I'm concerned about the plug because of the anaerobic 
character of the sealant. There is a lot of clearance between that plug 
and the case (judging from the amount of dried sealant I cleaned up 
before. I'm a little worried that the Loctite might never cure there.

Mark
