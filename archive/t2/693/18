Subject: Re: [T2] Hockey Stick

Are the 091 and 002 hockey sticks the same?

I only mention this because the part number begins with an 091 (and 
other 002 part numbers on the site begin with an 002).  If the hocky 
stick changed, then this would only be good for an 091 transmission 
('76 (?) -> up).

Can anyone advise?

ps thanks for the heads up richard!
