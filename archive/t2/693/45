Paul,

In many years of working on VW's, I have never had to have a flywheel 
resurfaced.  The most I have ever done is to use about 300 grit wet dry 
sandpaper to rough up the surface a little, or to make sure there is not 
any sort of glaze on it.

I can count the number of flywheels I have used sandpaper on on less than 
one hand...

If you can have any flywheel rivet induced groove's, then that is a 
different story...

Cheers, dave
