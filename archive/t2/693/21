Subject: Windage tray

There's some discussion of windage trays in the archives. Wilson 
mentions this part, and every Type 4 case has a little rack molded into 
the sump where the tray slides. But very few people actually have one, 
and David S mentions that he's never seen one. I haven't either, and I 
was feeling deprived.

But note: the windage tray bolts up to the oil pickup. In both of the 
oil pickups in my possession, there is a blank where the bolt would go. 
But it's a blank. These never had windage trays. Some DPO/rebuilded 
didn't throw it away or leave it out. It was never there in the first 
place.
