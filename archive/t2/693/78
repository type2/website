Our local Honda dealer marks parts up 100% between his cost and mine. I know b/c they gave me the wrong reciept once. That said they were cheaper on a new set of brake pads than the FLAPS who wanted $8 more. The OEM pads came with grease, shims, thicker pads, etc. I would ALWAYS buy from the dealer but more times than not - at least around here - they act like they've got us by the short hairs. 

I'd say SOME of that added cost is b/c they are factory parts but I can't imagine that the R&D costs aren't paid for when the car is designed initially. 

I buy OEM parts over the internet and they are often cheaper than the FLAPS equivalent. I know a dealer has overhead to pay for but are they being greedy? Yeah me thinks so... 

If I were in the business I think I'd want to make my living by selling quantity rather than a fewer number of high priced parts.
