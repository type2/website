Subject: Ignition hesitation

I have a 1976 bus with an intermittent ignition problem. Sometimes, not
always, when I turn the key there is a 1 second hesitation before the
starter kicks in. However, on one occasion the car wouldn't start at all. I
did alot of jingling and hammering on the roadside to get it going again,
so I really don't know the exact reason.

I don't want to have replaced both the witch and starter motor. What is the
most likely cause? Since it doesn't happen all the time, I suspect it may
not be the switch contacts. But I don't know for sure. I have checked the
external wiring connections to switch and starter.

The basic problem is that I can't try to find it again until it happens,
and then it's to late. I'm stranded somewhere.

Thanks for any advice.
