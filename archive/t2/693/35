Mark,

I understand....maybe you *are* in the wrong universe<grin>.

Best yet, try and go to walmart and ask for a battery for a 1967 VW 
bug....same for all years I am sure....they no longer carry them!

And!  At the two other FLAPS in town, they are now $50+ .

Although I haven't checked with NAPA yet....hmmmm


Cheers, dave
