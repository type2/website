 hello Guys  This is just like looking at a disc brake rotor and saying it 
looks good  LOL   If you dont mount it in a lathe or flywheel grinder then you 
cant tell how bad it is  I have a peterson flywheel grinder in my shop and 
surface all kinds of flywheels , I have seen hundreds of VW flywheels that looked 
good only to see the truth when grinding them . The only way to tell if it is 
good is to grind it.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
