Subject: My weakness for british cars and type 2's

I have a 1950 MG-TD that I bought in 1965 for $650, a 1966 Sunbeam Tiger that 
I
bought in 1969 for $1750, and a 1961 Jaguar MK 2 sedan that I bought in 1970 
for
$750.  I bought my 1971 bus in 1984 for $1100 and it has been my daily driver 
since
then. I added a 1969 MG-C roadster in 1986 for $1100 and my 1963 single cab in
1991 for $!000.   I loved them all when I bought them and still have them all 
and think
they are all works of art in their own way. Of course the bus and single cab 
are the
most used and most practical of the lot............
