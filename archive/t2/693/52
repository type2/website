Subject: Microfiche and Part Numbers

Hello,

I've found on Richard Atwell's website links to parts microfiche.  What a
great resource!  I was wondering, however, how to associate the parts
references in the diagrams to part numbers?  I've seen on some vendor
websites where they have them linked through html.  Can anyone direct me to
a resource where I could get both the exploded parts diagrams as well as the
part number?

Thanks
