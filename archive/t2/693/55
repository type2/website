It sounds to me like a loose head.

Symptom #1	If the oil seems to be leaking from either end of the 
pushrod tube(s) underneath the cylinders (but above the tin).

Symptom #2	The sound you describe under load would be a leak around the 
cylinder heads.

Symptom #3	Test the valve clearance.  If it is tight (or gone), it's a 
safe bet that the head needs to be re-torqued.  The engine will need to 
be dropped and the tin removed to do this.
