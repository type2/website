Hi Folks:

If you find more than one f what Anton is looking for, let me know too.  
MY tank was held together with what looked like silly putty and it tuend 
out all of the fittings holding in the tubes were gone.  Faucet is also 
NG .  Pump seems to work but got very dried out.  Tank DOES look good 
however as does the sink and drain.

Thanks,

BEN
