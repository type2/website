Subject: 69 Westy Sink tank/faucet is missing

All,

I first searched through the archives for the last 30 minutes to get 
some info, but couldn't find what I was looking for.

The 69 Westy we bought has the ice box/fridge combo behind the 
passenger's seat, and the ice box works great. Drains through the floor 
and tube is intact.

Sink, however, is missing the water tank, filler/cap, and faucet 
assembly.

Any leads on replacement parts is greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
Anton
