Subject: Type 4 engine crankfhaft needed

Hello Volks

This time I post looking for a T4 engine crankshaft and rods, a close friend 
of mine broke his engine due to a lack of lubrication and he is needing a 
new crankshaft and rods since we are no able to finding here in Venezuela, 
anyone in the list has those parts and want to trade it or know about a good 
source for them?

Thanks

Roberto
