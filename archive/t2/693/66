Subject: Re: [T2]Blowby out dipstick update update

Chris,  here are two more Wild A$$ ideas:

(1) pull the 'L' air hose off JUST the oil breather and just loosen it at 
the 'S' tube; rotate the air hose 90 degrees clockwise, and blow into it.  
Is it blocked??

(2)  take the 'peanut butter' hose OUT of the peanut butter jar and feed it 
into the oil filler tube.  For now, use you material resources and 
imagination to make the connect as solid as possible (temporary, of course.  
Stuff the opening with rags...)  If you can drive like that, then ask 
someone to send you one of the famous '710'  caps so you can drill a hole in 
it to permanently fit the peanut butter tube through.  You should then be 
recycling your oil from the oil dipstick back thru the oil filler cap

(3) what kind of vacuum readings have you been getting??  With the oil 
breather ON, and with the oil breather OFF.  Is the vacuum needle SOLID, or 
does it jump around.

When you keep your speed below 60 mph, do you still have oil blowby??

Readers Digest. Illiterates die of intestinal blockage.
