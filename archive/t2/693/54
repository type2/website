Hello bussers.  I just wanted to drop a line
about the excellent service I've received from
Ronnie at Old Volks home (www.type2parts.com). 
When you call, Ronnie answers the phone,
"Ronnie's."  Both times I called, I got him
directly. 

I needed some brake parts in a BIG HURRY, and I
hoped that Ronnie would have them on the shelf. 
Yesterday I called Ronnie and he said he didn't
think he had all of the parts in stock.  However,
he'd get the order to me quickly.  To my
surprise, I got an email from him that last night
stating that he did in fact have the parts. 
Today, I received a confirmation and a UPS
tracking number.  

Did I mention that he also spent time on the
phone with me discussing the braking problem? 
That he gave me quotes for some other parts, and
stated he had them in stock, but told me he
doubted I needed them?  

Everyone knows that Ronnie is a true busser and
that he has been instrumental in Busses by the
Bridge.  I just wanted everyone to know he runs a
heck of a shop also.

Happy bussin'
