Subject: Oil Leaking out of my 69 Westy

The 1969 Westy we just bought, that was supposed to have had a freshly 
rebuilt motor by a VW guru in Winston-Salem, NC has developed some 
minor problems.

Possibly major. (Hope not)

On the trip back down to Charleston, I had to pull off and re-attach 
the air filter cap (aftermarket setup, I think) because the screw 
attaching it to the inside of the carb had come unscrewed, and I had 
just the metal top and screw sitting patiently inside the engine 
compartment.

My first clue something was wrong was when the engine lost power going 
up a hill, and started chugging/sputtering, and my wife, driving behind 
me, saw smoke.

I reattached the air filter top piece, screwed it down tightly, and 
noticed there was some oil leaking on the ground directly under the 
engine. It was smoking...

On the trip home, everything seemed fine, and I rechecked the oil 
level, which also seemed okay. Added just a bit more oil just to be 
safe.

This week, while driving to and from my store, I have noticed oil 
leaking...not a whole lot, maybe a few table spoons worth...and the 
engine, under acceleration, sounds a bit "louder" than I remember. 
While accelerating, it makes a loud "brappppppppp" sound. I thought it 
was exhaust related, but found no evidence of this.

I was wondering if the engine sound and oil leak might be related?

Thoughts? Suggestions?

Thanks!
Anton
