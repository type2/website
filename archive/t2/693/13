Hi Chris,

The same thing happened to me back in the spring of 2003 while hooking 
up the dash lights to my CHT gauge. You are going to need to replace 
the gauge. I bought "half" a dash pod at EB2004 for $5 from the 
Tidewater Type2's,  (someone else wanted the other half, and since it 
was a $10 part we compromised and both went away happy). and I simply 
swapped the gauge parts into my dash pod.

Happy trails,
