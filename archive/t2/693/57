Subject: Cruzin' Performance

Just got my injectors back from Cruzin' Performance. They look great. 
Painted black, except for what was blue; new seals. Rich replaced the 
tip and some internal part in each injector.

When you place an order to have injectors refreshed by Rich, there is 
an option to have new hoses ($4 each) or not. I thought seriously about 
not doing it, since the amount of hose is miniscule. But now I am glad 
I sprung for it, because he attaches the hoses with nice, neat clamps. 
They look like they're right out of an NOS box.

Considering that Bosch injectors are currently nudging $100 each, $16 
for a refresh is a serious bargain.
