However...

If working on a not paved surface, wooden cribbing is probably a better
choice. 18 inch long pieces of 6x6. Stack in crossed pairs until you
reach the supporting point.  Shim the bottom tier to level.  Set the bus
on the cribbing then really shove it. I mean REALLY shove it around. 
It's much less work to redo it when you haven't got your broken leg
pinned under the bus.

You'll find that a properly cribbed weight is much more stable than
weight supported by jackstands.

The caveat here is: WOODEN!!!!  Do not use something that used to be
sand and gravel or clay to support anything except the roof over your head.
