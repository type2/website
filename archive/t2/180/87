Subject: Sunshine Daydream Kids?

Hi,

Sunshine Daydream http://www.72camper.com/sunshine.htm North 
Carolina's newest bus camp out is coming up in less than two weeks. I 
am trying to work it into my schedule. Stella , 7 year old, and I 
will be there at some point. We were wondering if any other kids will 
be there in her age group.

Thanks
