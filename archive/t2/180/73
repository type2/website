Subject: frame welding

List-
 I have some rust holes on the frame of my 72 Westy. The worst spot is
around the rear torsion tube where it attaches to the frame (round pipe
that goes across). I would like to cut some patches and mig weld them
into place. What gauge steel is the frame made of? and what gauge should
I use for the patch?
Thanks,
John Ingram
