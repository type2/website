through Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Chickasha, and Lawton.  From there I'm =
heading West on 62 to Altus where I'll take 6 North to Quartz Mountain =
State Park. =20

If you see me, be sure to honk and wave!!  My Westy is light blue and =
I'll be towing a red trailer with a white Vespa scooter on the back.  =
I've got the names and numbers from the AIRS list.  Hopefully I won't =

Thanks,
Erich Elmer
