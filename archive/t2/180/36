>First off, I can guarantee that VWOA's trademark creeps are going to sta=
rt
actively pursuing anyone who uses "bus" in their domain name, especially =
if
it is a VW oriented site. Watch out BusDepot, BustedBus, etc...  They did
the same thing when the "new" Beetle came out, and I fully expect them to
try to repossess the rights to anything and everything bus-related.<

This slightly interests me.  A "bus"  does not just pertain to VW.  In fa=
ct, that word was out many years before the VW was even around.  And furt=
hermore, being a fan of all vintage busses, and not just VWs, I have seen=
 many pictures of late 40s busses that the original microbus looks just l=
ike.  In that respect, it looks like VW could have been copying these pas=
senger busses in a smaller scale.  Therefore becoming the "micro" bus.  A=
 big bus in small scale.  I would love to see a company like Flexible Fly=
er, come out and sue VWoA for some kind of infringement on the original b=
us shape.  Would that not be something?  VW does not, and never will own =
the "bus" name.  Beetle?  that is a whole different animal.  Never was a =
beetle before the beetle.  Thank God for busses before busses!Get more fr=
