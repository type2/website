I was going to stay away, far away, from this thread but......
Go here and read the section on 'viscosity index improvers' and then remember
all the posts that ask " is 230 to 250 too hot??"
http://www.vtr.org/maintain/lubricants-redline.html
Think it is all BS? Here is another site with info on it, but not as
informative as the 1st one:
http://www.eskimo.com/~dalus/bmw/all/misc/all_oilfaq.html
Multi-grade dino oil has not changed over the years. Only the additive
packages. That is the only difference and so-called improvement. I have
repeatedly written to Castrol and asked them how they got past the 210 degree
polymer breakdown and how they substantiated their advertising slogan
"Engineered for greater protection against thermal breakdown" on every bottle
of oil. That has been going on for over 5 years now. They refuse to answer any
questions!! BUT they have changed the BS slogan on the front now. They now
say: "Engineered For Greater Protection Against Breakdown". Hmmm, I wonder why
they stopped using the word "Thermal"???  But, alas, it still includes
'thermal' on the back.
But just like tires, you guys are gonna use whatever you want.
