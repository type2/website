I knew that, Sean. But there others on this list who
would not only consider it for themselves ( as is their
right :) but would advocate that you do the same ( WHY ?).
I have never tried the wooden cribbage, my stands are
rated 12 tons and very stable at maximum extension, with a
wide welded frame base to prevent sinking and collapse.
It takes no time to place them and verify the stability. Just a Habit.
