Subject: got free 74 Westy;Can 74 engine be backup to 75??

List,
  I picked up that free 74 Camper in Philly, want the 150K trans for our
75 bus, but not sure whether to part the rest or offer for a Westy
want-to-havver.  The bus is salvagable for the handy (good 74 Westy
interior, wide bed), dent only in rear fender well (had a blowout?),
rusty in rockers and in fender wells of front, + jack points.  It  needs
front axle beam (why he got rid of it).  It has a taken apart 74 two
carb engine (150k mi) that is complete and had 110-120 lbs compression
(some fool of a mechanic told him it needed rebuilding)- bottom end is
still together.  I wiggled the rods for side to side play and suspect
it's nrear wear limit.  I don't want a carbureted engine, but would save
the engine for a 75 backup if it's the same case/crank/heads.  Can the
wise out there tell me if the 74 is the same as the 75 except for the FI
stuff, Which I would use off the 75 I'm restoring.  Other than needing
the temp sensor, are the heads different in the manifold attachment?  I
do have a spare 74? axle I saved but was keeping it for the 78; would
consider offering it with the bus.
