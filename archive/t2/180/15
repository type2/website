> So - looks like I canna take the bus.  It's a 72 standard blue and white,
and the body is in excellent shape for a non-runner (all things are relative
and I'm comparing to my 60 when I got it).  It needs inner and outer
passenger side rocker replacement - but that's about it for body repair -
well - paint of course.  It is loaded with westy stuff - like a z-bed and
cabinets etc.. as well as the standard rear and middle seats - there are two
gas heaters and a couple boxes of misc parts.  It's a walk thru - but maybe
all bay window buses are walk throughs - I dunno.  I was gonna buy it and
sell off some of the stuff to lower my cost but ..... They tell me that the
motor was rebuilt and installed but never run - I believe em because you can
see that the engine compartment seals look very nice.  I don't really know
the story on the title.  A guy sold his house and left his bus there and was
supposed to move it - 2 years ago.  The current home owner just wants the
bus out of there - but he is in contact with the bus owner.  So for $1500.00
the bus owner will sell it.  If the price isn't such that the bus owner will
sell it then the home owner will sell at to get it out of his yard.  I was
gonna offer them $800.00 and see what the said.  But ... My thing is I don't
know about pancake motors and if it is wired wrong - or missing something -
I'd be at a loss.  We recently bought a house we have a bit of debt we'd
like to bring down before we pick up another bus ... and I'm kinda partial
to early buses ;) I was quite tempted though because the body is so nice and
... damn those hard top buses look nice - sort of handsome - maybe I could
of painted a partion on the windshield :).

homeowner's email.  You would have to tow it or trailer it from just North
of Brockville.  Perfect for any Ottawa list members.
