Subject: Weird start and answer

I have run into a problem on the 71 SC.  I would turn the key and nothing,
sometimes and finally stopped for good today.  I had the battery fully
charged and it just wouldn't start. So I tried to jumpstart it.  Started
right up.  Disconnected the jumper cables and it dies.  hmmmm...

We disconnect the battery cable and I cut the wires and install a new
battery terminal.  Starts up on it's own.  The terminals were just old.

Thought I would pass this on in case someone else runs across it.
