Subject: Re:multivis oils- an experiment????

Hmm, the scientist in me rears up:  The multiweight oils I stay away
from except in winter, where the bus gets mostly local use and rarely
goes over 220.  My oil pressure on the high milage engine when oil is
220 is only around 22 at 55 mph.  I use 30 wt oil (Valvoline) and have
added 40 or even 50 wt on very long hot runs.  My common sense says that
if my sump oil temp is 240 or more on a hot day, it's gotta be way over
250 where the oil is splashing on the inside of the cylinders and backs
of the pistons.  So if we get the pot out, crank up the stove, and get a
viscosity cup (bowl with hole in the bottom to watch drip rate)- we can
check the viscosity of new oil at room temp and then at 250 degrees  and
then check it over time - it should increase its drip rate, yes, to
finally equal that of the lower viscosity?
