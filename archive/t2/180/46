I believe that the synthetic technology has come a long way, and I do
use it in my Honda Goldwing---which has been trouble free--

BUT--I have used synthetic oil since it was new----

Now I do know this-----

Plastic oils and dino oils are not at all compatible---unless your
thinking of a semi syn. oil----which is OK--

I'd sure hate to think of my oil galleys turning to Jello, as I'm going
down the big road of life, in my bus--

Way back when--I worked at a motorcycle shop--and besides the English
bikes we sold Yamaha's, and they had oil injection.

The bikes were set up with dino 2 stroke oil, and some of the more
adventurous, of the clients would try what they thought was something
better for their oiling system.

Upon dumping a quart of synthetic oil into their oil tank, they soon
found that their engine was toast, due to a locked up oil pump, and all
kinds of nasty jelloey substance in their automatic oiling system.

I don't know if this would be a good idea in a Bus's life to be changing
lanes midstream-- 
I sure wouldn't recommend it--

I know we were talking about viscosity here but this site is very
informative. I would trust the opinions of a Chemist from a proper Oil
Company. There is one tidbit of information that I found very
interesting. 
"Synthetic Oil has 10% better heat transfer than Petrolium based
lubricants" 
I have been considering trying synth for a little while (now that my bus
leaks very little/no oil) This statement has pushed me over the edge for
testing synth in my bus. From what I can tell in addition to air as the
coolant oil plays a very important role. If i can get my oil to transfer
heat ~10% better then I shoud be able to get more heat away from the
engine. Well see. but thanks again Karl.
