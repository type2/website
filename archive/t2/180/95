Subject: New VW bus

Just saw a few shots of what VW is gonna call the new microbus on the local 
news.

Dern thing looks terrible.
I'd rather take a daily ice water enema than have a monthly note on what I 
just saw.

What I just saw was revolting.

If they come out with that piece of crap just so as to allow newby buyers 
to pretend they have bus, us real bus owners are gonna be like road Gods.

What a shame.
I never wanted to be envied for anything.

I hope Casper and NewBus never get wrecked and never get rusty.
I'm gonna drive 'em 'til I can't drive any more.
