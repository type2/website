Subject: Re: [T2] 15w40

OK, I'm feeling fiesty and want to add my 2 cents here.  I've never run 
synthetics so I can't say anything for or against them.  But I'd like to report 
my personal observations about 20w50 and straight 40w.  I ran 20w50 year round 
in my 73 Westy (914 2.0 FI motor) for years, but switched to straight 40w about 
a month ago to see what would happen.  I've got an oil pressure and oil temp 
gauge installed and I watch them.  Here's what I've been seeing:

1.) 20w50 oil.  Morning commute - 12 miles on interstate with a 270 degree exit 
ramp at the end of it.  Morning air temps range from 40-60 F.  For the first 5 
minutes or so of run time, my oil pressure is around 60 psi.  That's about when 
I get on the interstate and crank it up to 85 mph (4000 RPM with my gearing).  
I watch the pressure drop from 60 down to 40 down to 25 over the next 5-7 
minutes.  Then I take the 270 degree exit at unsafe speeds and notice out of 
the corner of my eye that my pressure drops under 10 psi (centrifugal force 
causing oil to move away from pickup tube).  Straighten out of the curve and 
the pressure goes back up to just under 25.  Sometimes I don't go straight in 
to work at this point.  As my engine temp starts to approach normal warmed up 
range, my pressure goes back up to about 35 psi.  Multi-visc kicking in at that 
point?  Probably.

2.) 40w oil.  Same drive as above.  For the first 5 minutes I see 70 psi (a 
little high, but not dangerously so).  Drops to 50 for the high-speed 
interstate stretch.  Drops to 25 around my favorite curve then levels out about 
40 thereafter.  In my opinion, this is MUCH better behavior.

The other thing I've noticed with the 20w50 is that I have higher pressure 
readings after an oil change, but as soon as I take a trip (200 miles or more) 
where I get my oil really hot and keep it that way for a while the pressures go 
back down to what I reported in scenario 1 and stay that way (or worse) until I 
change the oil.  Multi-visc thermal breakdown?  Probably.

I'm about to take my first long trip since switching to 40w and I'm very 
curious what I'll see on my morning commute next week.  I'll post my 
observations to the list next week.  I know this isn't very scientific, but 
it's good, practical, seat-of-the-pants observations based on actual experience 
rather than hearsay.
