Just a little FYI:
All new Mercedes that are AMG models, i.e. E55, SL55, CL55, come from the
factory with Mobil 1.
If we have to replace a camshaft, there is a long break-in procedure we have
to do. I will try to remember to bring it home and post it tomorrow. It is
rather interesting!
All Mercedes from 98 up have what is called 'flexible service'. The oil is
constantly going thru a sensor and is being tested for viscosity and
cleanliness by how clear it is. This info is tied in with the odometer. It
tells you when to change the oil. It could be as low as 10K miles or as high
as 16K miles, depending on your type of driving [city or hiway]. It also goes
by time, one year max. In the beginning, other than AMG cars, all were using
dino oil. Problems arose with the long term interval of oil changes, premature
cam wear etc. The word we got was 1) the additive package was breaking down
with the long mileage and 2) the oil was mainly in bulk containers and this
caused oil and additives to separate, with the additves sinking to the bottom.
Since the pump pulls from the bottom, the initial oil drawn from the drum was
over-rich. The last 1/4 of the drum was very low on additives. This is the oil
that caused the premature wear. Now all flexible service cars get synthetic
oil only. MB says the additives do not separate from syn oil......
Do I use syn oil? No, I still am not convinced it transfers heat better than
dino oil. Before anyone says synthetic has to be right because MB approves it,
remember: MB engines are water cooled and the engine is [usually] kept at a
190-200 degree operating range.
