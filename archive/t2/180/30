Subject: Re: safe jacking to go under bus...

I believe in redundancy; I always leave the jack in place after letting
the bus down onto jack stands.  Since the jackstand feet can sink into
hot asphault or soft earth/grass, I use pieces of OSB under the jack
feet.  CONCRETE blocks will work if you lay them flat and use a weight
spanner like  lengths of 2x8 laid across the top to shim to height, then
a piece of plywood or OSB plywood on top of that.
