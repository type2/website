I've had my VW bus alignment work done at Les Schwab Tires [Western US chain] for over 20 years.  The computerized rig they use now has all the specs in an enormous database.  As adjustments are made and checked the monitor displays the specs and the actual settings for easy comparison.  

When they first installed this system I drug out my old baywindow Bentley as usual.  We compared the Bentley alignment specs with those in the database and found that they were identical.  I was suitably surprised and impressed.

BTW, the Les Schwab policy is that if a correct alignment cannot be accomplished there's no charge.  That has saved me plenty of bucks over the years.  Several times, on VWs and other vehicles, they've found a bum wheel bearing, loose tie-rod ends, etc. that prevented them from proceeding.  No charge, and a free suspension & steering system inspection/diagnosis to boot...
