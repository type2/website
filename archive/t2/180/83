Subject: Installing Cabinets and Z-bed size...

Hello,

I am in the process of refinishing the cabinets that I got for Buster. 
(Thanks Bill!) What I wondered is if anyone knows where to find 
instructions on how to install them once I get them finished. I have 
been collecting pictures of interior shots hoping to at least figure out 
the placement, but would be even more grateful for a manual, web page, 
etc... as some of the bits I'm not positive where they would go.

Also, the z-bed seems a tad small to me. Like the size of twin bed. Do 
these come in different sizes? I had read that the size was more akin to 
a full or even a queen. I'm afraid that the two of us are not going to 
fit on that bed, not to mention the three dogs ;) Is there a way to make 
it larger, or  do I need to look into a different bed altogether? I'll 
try to get some pics up this weekend. Maybe that will help.

Thanks again to all you great people for being so kind in answering my 
stupid questions!
