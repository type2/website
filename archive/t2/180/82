Your  air flow may have been bad to getting worse all the time.  Now you 
may need to take it to a shop to get the CO screw set correctly.  You 
may be running way to lean or way to rich.  Way to lean very bad on 
valves. I had worked with enough FI systems that even though i knew i 
had both a bad double relay and a bad air flow On my recently aquired 
Westy, I sent it to a shop that i use for the stuff i dont have the 
equip for.  The new one when installed almost ran but not quite, until 
adjusted with the tester.   BTW how to mess up a tech. (not nice but 
fun)  signal shop manager and put good double relay in pocket and bad 
double relay back in when he tries to set the CO.
