Ok, I will add my two cents- I have a 70 Westy (and 67 Bug) and I run 
15W-40 Castrol in the Fall, Winter and Spring and in the summer I run 
Castrol 20W-50.  So far no problems.  I am almost scared to mention Muir 
BUT when he wrote his book, multigrades had not progressed so 
singlegrade was the clear winner.  I do follow Muir on most points but 
he is not perfect (who is??)  I have follwed this oil routine for 8 
years and no problems.  I live in Northern VA  so our seasons are 
somewhat strange!
