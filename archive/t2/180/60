I have been looking at my bentley (arrived yesterday! Woohoo)  and my =
very large printout from vintagebus.com and can not figure out which =
wires go where on my heater blower.  The wires have been stripped out of =
the plug.  I have three wires.  Red w/ a fuse link, brown/orange?  and =
blue/yellow?  Now, since my mishap with the alt. wires.  I don't think =
that the blue/yellow is actually that perhaps black/ yellow?  Anyways, =
the connectors are still in the plug and I have no way to figure out =
which ones go where.  Anyone have a picture or any insight?
