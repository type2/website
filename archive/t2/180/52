I was reading a new Corvair technical manual last night that explained that 
the Ignitor II had a built in variable dwell function that enabled it to 
maintain a better, hotter spark at higher rpms for more complete 
combustion. Also required a full 12 volts versus the resistor in-line to 
drop the voltage getting to the Ignitor I.

I think I've got the details right. I can verify tonight if anyone really 
wants them.

The Ignitor II doesn't mean that you will see horsepower improvements of 
200%to 400%- just that it drives the coil 200%-400% better I'm sure. Those 
marketing folks putting a SLANT on it again..
