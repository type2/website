Now that's one low-riding bus! There really shouldn't be any thing of
this sort to happen to a properly installed sump sending unit. It's
very low profile & is actually higher from the ground than the
mustache bar. I also like the idea of having as few wires as possible
near spinning parts (like belt/crank fan/alt). I like the sump mount.
