Subject: Re: [WetWesties] Installing Cabinets and Z-bed size...

Ok so maybe I am just confused. Which is always quite possible. Is the 
SEAT all the same size and the size of the bed is the size of the 
cushion? 'Cause I don't have the cushion just the mechanical part that 
folds out and that's what looks small. Does this make any sense? This is 
what appears to me to be about 4 feet wide. With the metal parts and the 
base but no cushion. I am planning on ordering a cushion or having one 
made at an upholstery shop but thought the base was too small and I 
would need to find an all new, wider, folding out z-thingy. 
(<---technical term)

I have seen them at www.zproducts.com they are pricey and I really like 
that I got mine for free (along with the sink, stove, fridge, etc) so 
I'm hoping it's just that I am not getting something that's right in 
front of my face. :)

I'm definitely going to get the Bently. I of course didn't know any 
better and bought the Hayes first and I also have the Muir (which cracks 
me up and makes people look weirdly at me that I am cracking up reading 
a service manual). I'm gonna order one from a catalog since the local 
shop that carries it prices it at twice the amount as the catalog. Makes 
me worry about part prices.

Thanks everyone!

p.s. Have you ever tried to tell a chihuahua to sleep on the floor? 
Actually they don't take up much room as long as they sleep between my 
feet one being 5 lbs and the other about 12lbs. Now the Pit-beagle on 
the other hand will have to sleep in the front seat :)
