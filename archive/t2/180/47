Subject: Re: [T2] VWoA and the bus trademark


Just checked here:

http://tess.uspto.gov

for the 199 things that vw *does* own....didn't see "bus" but did see
"microbus".....some of the others were pretty weird though....


BEETLE BIKE
PROMOTION
SUSTAINABLE INNOVATIONS
TURBONIUM
BENTLEY FINANCIAL SERVICES   ??????
COOL SHADES                  ??????

and the weirdest one!  CREATE AN APOSTLE


BTW, for those who might feel better knowing this....I have had two 
different people ask me about what i thought of them buying a new VW.

Told them the story about the guy who was getting sued for making a vw 
hubcap clock(and selling it)...told them the story about the local dealer 
who told someone in the local club that they wouldn't sell him a new 
beetle turbo for list(he went out of state).  Told them the story about 
vw walking in to RMMW and what happened there......

Needless to say, both peoples' mouths fell open and they decided that they 
were *not* interested in a VW.  

I think "busxxxx" business owners are probably pretty safe right now.


Cheers, dave

In fact, that word was out many years before the VW was even around.  
And furthermore, being a fan of all vintage busses, and not just VWs, 
I have seen many pictures of late 40s busses that the original microbus looks just like.  
In that respect, it looks like VW could have been copying these passenger busses 
in a smaller scale.  Therefore becoming the "micro" bus.  A big bus in 
small scale.  I would love to see a company like Flexible Flyer, 
come out and sue VWoA for some kind of infringement on the original bus shape.  
Would that not be something?  VW does not, and never will own the "bus" name.  
Beetle?  that is a whole different animal.  Never was a beetle before the beetle.
