Right, they most certainly don't.
The point thst I was tying to make was the incopatabiity of the
oils--that all.

I don't quite believe that they are incompatible.  Maybe they used to be but
I don't think they are now.

You can't use synthetic since new.  You can't break in an engine with
synthetic oil, it's too slippery.  So at some point if you want to use
synthetic you are switching from dino oil to synthetic just by doing a
regular oil and filter change.

Yet I have never heard of anyone's engine being destroyed by doing this.

I switched from dino to synthetic in my '79 Bus last year and it's been
great.  Also switched from dino to synthetic in my 2001 Passat V6 after
20,000 miles of dino oil.  No additional leaks, no additional oil
consumption and no goop in the engine due to synthetic mixing with dino oil.

I guess it would be easy to test, mix some dino oil and synthetic in a cup
and see what happens.  I am guessing it won't goop up though.

There are an awful lot of folks who have switched to synthetic from dino so
seems if there was a compatibility issue we'd be hearing about it.

However you look at it I think it isn't a safe bet to be mixing them,
even though the oil has been dropped out of the engine, there is still
some left in there, and this makes me feel real uncomfortable.
