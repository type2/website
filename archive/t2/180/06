Doyt,

The transmission ground strap runs from one of the studs on the nose cone
to a stud on the mount point for the left side read trailing arm.  If
there is no stud there, it would not surprise me.  I have seen a number
where the stud rusted off.  If that is the case, your choices are to drill
and run a nut and bolt thru the frame in any convenient nearby location or
run a second ground strap from the battery to the engine case.
