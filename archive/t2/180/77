I don't quite believe that they are incompatible.  Maybe they used
to be
but
I don't think they are now.

You can't use synthetic since new.  You can't break in an engine with
synthetic oil, it's too slippery.  So at some point if you want to use
synthetic you are switching from dino oil to synthetic just by doing a
regular oil and filter change.
......

Now I have to wonder about the breaking in thing because there are quite a
few new cars coming from the factory with synthetic.
You think these engines are broken in at the factory? I cant imagine so as
they would have to set them up running with a variable load etc for a good
bit of time to do it right.
