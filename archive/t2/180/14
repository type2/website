I appreciate the righteous concern, Dave, but I'm not *that* stoopid. I 
actually *knew* (emphasis on knew) a guy who's vehicle dropped on him (not a 
bus, but heavy enough to do the job).

At first glance it looked like I wouldn't have to crawl under the bus to get 
this done (which is why I asked), but the more I look, the more I think I'll 
be doing some crawling. Jack stands will most definitely be used.

Later,

Sean
