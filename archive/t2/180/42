I know we were talking about viscosity here but this site is very
informative. I would trust the opinions of a Chemist from a proper Oil
Company. There is one tidbit of information that I found very
interesting.

"Synthetic Oil has 10% better heat transfer than Petrolium based
lubricants"

I have been considering trying synth for a little while (now that my
bus leaks very little/no oil) This statement has pushed me over the
edge for testing synth in my bus. From what I can tell in addition to
air as the coolant oil plays a very important role. If i can get my
oil to transfer heat ~10% better then I shoud be able to get more heat
away from the engine. Well see. but thanks again Karl.
