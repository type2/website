Was reading this thread and just happened to also have my 1982 owners 
manual for my westy in hand as well.  Never noticed it before but there 
is an interesting table in it.  BTW it may also link to the table for my 
Briggs and stratton engines in a way.  Briggs & Stratton says only use 
synthetic multigrade oils in the aircooled engines that i have (all 
three of them) and to use a straight 30 weight if possible.  Mentions 
temp breakdown of mulitweights.  The table in the Westy manual shows 
that 20w-50 weight oil (acceptable) is actually not the oil i want to 
use.  Straight 40 weight would actually be the better summer oil.  
Straight 30 oil is about equal to the multigrade 20W-50 except that the 
20W will go to lower temps.  And 10w multi and 5w multi are simply not 
recommended for here in denver colorado climate.  straight 40 being from 
about 65 to 100+ degrees looks good for summer, and 20/50 for winter in 
this climate.
