Dave,
You will have to cut the roof, if you plan to sleep up there.  There is only about 17 inches of room with my set up.  If you planned
to save the cross arch and put a bed on the existing roof, that would give you 14 inches. Not much room (like sleeping in a coffin)
Email me if you have any further questions. 

Joy thru air,
Jamie Auch
