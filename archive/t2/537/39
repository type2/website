Subject: OK, It's  - Save the Transported in California - time

It's a teal colored 1971 Transporter, saved from obscurity and currently 
in my driveway. Roommate has too many projects and I have been busy 
looking for a job so he said...

"Why don't you help me tow that Bus to the Wrecking Yard..."


=:0

So, I say "I will try and find an owner who will give it a good home".

I'll try and get some pix posted but I don't have access to a digicam at 
the moment.

Time is somewhat of an issue, trying to get this thing done in the next 
few days.

It's OBO time folks, and the thing is currently 30 miles south of San 
Francisco.

btw- the motor is currently mostly out, but awaiting the starter bolt to 
be removed: it was found to have one snapped #3 exhaust valve and a 
broken head bolt on the other side. Dats the truth in advertising part.
