OK, as long as we're admitting our weaknesses here, let me say that I have 
never understood the air cleaner on my '70.  There seem to be two flaps.  The 
one on the right is controlled by some sort of weight, and the one on the lever 
has a lever that might have once been controlled by some sort of cable, but 
that's long gone.  Can someone explain what these two flaps do and how I should 
be setting the one on the left?  Or point me to some obvious reference that 
has so far escaped me?

Thanks a bunch.

See you on the road,
