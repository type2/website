Your front end needs something replaced. Good idea to do a full inspection. Take it around town and see what they estimate needs done. Prob ball joints, maybe tie rod ends. 

John Muir has a basic explanation of an inspection in the "How to Keep Your VW Alive" book. At least you'll know what they are looking for. Your local library might also have a generic "How To" book that does a good job of explaning what to look at. You are essentially looking for loose suspension joints. Some may not be apparently loose until you pry a certain way with a pry bar, off the ground, moving the steering around, etc. 

Be sure to fix soon and keep the speeds down low until you get it fixed. I had an Auotbianchi A112 (read Fiat) that had ball joint trouble that reared it's ugly head 1 day running down the Autostrada at 75 mph. Car suddenly started  to uncontrollably swerve back and forth. A van would have rolled over... Finally recovered and because the car was so rough, I junked it. Nearly killed me.
