Subject: Re: [VB] traveler in need of help Rock Hill, SC

Well, my plan up until this afternoon was to be in Rock Hill right now
visiting some friends at Winthrop...  That changed when I found that I
didn't have a car that I could take, though.  Are there any people on here
from Charlotte?  It's about a half hour drive from Charlotte to Rock Hill.
