Subject: CDI question - Spark PLug Gap

I recently converted to a pertronics unit.
Can I adjust the plug gap and if so what to?

Thanks for the info folks. I meant to ask this,(it was early and I didn't
make myself clear at all). Duncan, would you mind telling me what brand of
CDI are you using? I'm interested in getting one myself. And, are you still
using mechanical points or did you switch them out too? I'm interested in
switching to the compufire/pertronix units. (I loathe setting points).
Also, if an SVDA distributor from Aircooled will work with your setup, I
highly recommend it. I got one and it is great. I should have done away with
the points when I installed mine.
