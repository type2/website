Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for a High-top.

Ask Jamie Auch for his website- he's just done this and it's turning out
pretty nice. Tom




    I've got a 1970 Westy that I'd like to drive across the country in
May, and I'm looking for a high-top roof I can put on it.  Is there
anyone in So-Cal with a spare roof they'd like to part with?  I've got a
pop-top if you'd like to trade.  I need to make a bunk in the top of the
van that will sleep two people so I don't have to worry about a place to
sleep when my van is filled with stuff.

Thanks
