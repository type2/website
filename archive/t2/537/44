Subject: crank shaft

hello all,

got a question regarding my crank well Fred took a dump and I'm in the
process of rebuilding his engine so I took the crank over to a machine shop
to get the gears pressed off so I could finish the rebuild he when ahead and
did so but told me that Fred's crank was bad because the journals weren't
shinny but I've seen V8 cranks that where worse looking and reused and
worked fine for many years so what do ya'll think I should do I'm strapped
for cash and can't affors a new crank for (-at-) lest two weeks and I'm afoot
with no ride any advice would be welcome oh ya there is on groves  on the
journals they are just discolored


keep on bus'n
