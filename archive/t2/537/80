  Can someone explain what these two flaps do and how I should
be setting the one on the left?  Or point me to some obvious reference 
that>has so far escaped me?


I had similar problems on a 'previously owned '70 beetle (I currently own a 
'70 bus).  The weighted flap is controlled by air flow.  The other flap was 
indeed controlled by a cable that connected to the flaps whose movement are 
controlled by the engine thermostat.  In '71, VW changed their design on the 
aircleaner to make BOTH flaps locally controlled.  There is a small 
spring-loaded thermostatic control on the '71.  My solution was to find the 
aircleaner for the '71 and use that instead.  Worked great.
