The pistons have those tiny rings all the way up to just above the top ring
all the way around.  I've been checking things out as well as possible 
without splitting the case, and this engine looks pretty low-mileage -- no
gunk or varnish deposits, good clearances towards the "tighter" end of
specs .. just those dratted rings.

I'll go get some cheap diesel and soak the piston for a while .. mebbe I'll 
get lucky. =)
