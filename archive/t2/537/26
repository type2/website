Hi Ray,

Widening the Z-bed isn't too hard to do. I started with a 73 bed, and 
removed all the hardware. Then I measured the width I wanted and headed 
off to Home Depot to have them carve up a sheet of plywood to the size 
I needed.

There are two tricky details:

1. I started with a 68-73 rear seat. With any westy z-bed you will find 
that the brackets attach to the sides of the seats. When you relocate 
the p/s bracket closer towards the door you are going to find that the 
arms of the bracket collide with the wheel well. I put the bracket in a 
big vice and beat on it with a hammer for a while until it fit. I also 
drilled a couple of new holes to mount it to. If you use a 76-79 bed 
then you will encounter this problem on the drivers side instead. I 
suppose a perfectionist could get a D/S bracket from a 73 and a P/S 
from a 74-79, but that's way more work than I wanted to bother with.

2. If you re-use the seat foam, you aren't going to have enough to 
completely cover the rear seat. If you plan to sleep in the bus you 
will want to be very sure that all of the foam used is the same 
density. If you don't have all the same density then you will create 
high or low spots that will RUIN your back in the course of a couple of 
nights. AMHIK. As soon as I came home from EveryBus 2001 I RAN to the 
nearest junkyard and bought enough additional 68-73 westy seat foam to 
make my bed work properly.

Camping season must be coming on strong, these inquiries are hitting me 
daily now.

Happy trails,
