Subject: Hole Pattern for Side Market Lamps?

The replacement rear side marker lampholders that I just received do not 
fit the hole pattern on the side of the Wonderbus. Before I start 
whining to the company I bought them from, I'd like to be able to take a 
look at a drawing or photo of what the hole pattern should be. My bus's 
right and left sides don't even have the same pattern. Bentley does not 
provide any information about this -- does anyone know where I can find 
a pic or a scribble?
