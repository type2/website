Hi Gail

Why did your clutch burn up?

Assuming your pressure plate was gripping the disc when you installed the disc,, would there be
any chance your clutch cable is frayed and hanging up,, holding the clutch in the release
position?

Did you have any trouble installing the engine,, did it slide right on to the trans? or did you
have to pull the engine up tight against the bellhousing using the bolts?

remove the wing nut off the cable and see if that helps
