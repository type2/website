Subject: Re: [T2] CDI question - Spark PLug Gap

no. the pertronix does not change the spark voltage. the gap should stay
the same.





With a CDI you could open the plugs up due to the much more energetic
spark.
this increases the voltage attained before discharge. there are other
considerations though such as the resistor in the rotor breaking down and
the plug wires insulation which can become a factor.

repete though,.. the pertronix is not a cdi.

fwiw when i used the cdi i just left the gap standard just in case.
it has proven useful since the cdi failed on me once on the road (got
fixed. thanks aircooled.net). i have it bypassed now because i was
troubleshooting.
the other problem with using the increased gap is the bus is not going to
run very well (or maybe at all) if you try to use a dwell meter and
standard points with the cdi bypassed.

but once again this is provided as an FYI only since we have been
discussing the issue. do not open your plug gaps with a pertronix alone.
