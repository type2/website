Subject: Problems with 68 Westy

Hi Volks,

I am posting this on behalf of a friend with a 68 who is desperately 
trying to get it road-ready to attend EveryBus.

The critical issues are the oil light and the wheel bind.

Reply to me and/or Adoom(-at-)rogers.com

Thanks!

Greg

  Finally got the drive shafts into the bus today.
  Took it for a spin. The high speed "whrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr" is 
gone. Yay!

  Downside, I have a bit of a 'bind' that I can't locate.
  On the pass. side wheel, (which now has a new inner bearing, new 
seals, cleaned & re-greased, new cv's plus cleaned and regreased) the 
wheel turns about 300 degrees, then is near impossible (by hand) for 
60. Then 300 fine, 60 hard, 300 fine, 60hard...etc. What could be 
causing this. Incidentally, I noticed this before installing the CV's. 
This is also the wheel which was giving me problems before I pulled the 
CVs and bearings. Previously if I tightened the nut all the way, the 
wheel would be completely locked up. So 300 degrees is better, but I 
want perfect before leaving on a 1500 mile trip Wednesday. It almost 
feels like someone is gently hitting the brakes (the shoes are adjusted 
to be fully away from the drum, I haven't turned them in yet.)

  Also, starting my bus is easy. Tap the gas to set the choke, turn the 
key, done. But, after the choke warms it's like the carb isn't ready. 
For the next while the bus dies at every stop. After a while it goes 
away, and idles just fine any suggestions?

  And finally, what causes an oil light to flicker?
  I have a good oil level.
  Doesn't smell of gas.
  But the oil light is flickering. With this flicker there seems to be a 
drop in power (could be coincedental). Thoughts?

  6 sleeps to everybus, and my "to do" list is getting longer instead of 
shorter.
