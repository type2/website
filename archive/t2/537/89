Subject: Looking for a High-top.

Hey...

    I've got a 1970 Westy that I'd like to drive across the country in 
May, and I'm looking for a high-top roof I can put on it.  Is there 
anyone in So-Cal with a spare roof they'd like to part with?  I've got a 
pop-top if you'd like to trade.  I need to make a bunk in the top of the 
van that will sleep two people so I don't have to worry about a place to 
sleep when my van is filled with stuff. 

Thanks
