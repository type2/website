Subject: Ah crud, looking for more parts.

I don't specifically need the parts for my Westy Bus, but its a Bus *engine*.  
I tore into my probable-runner "1.7L" core motor, and I found some interesting
stuff.  I found out that it's a 1.8L, that it's got a hydraulic cam, that two of the 
pushrods are missing  .. and that one cylinder has some rust inside and the 
piston in that jug has the rings stuck in it.  I've been carefully trying to 
un-stick 'em for a couple of days, no dice.

So I'm sending out another plea, this time for a good used (but useable) 
1.8l/93mm dished piston .. and if anyone has a couple of extra hydraulic 
pushrods that'd be great too.  =)
