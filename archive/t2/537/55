Subject: RE: [T2] CDI question - Spark PLug Gap

The pointless ignition module is only half of a high output ignition
system. The other half is the coil.  You should only open your gap up if
you are running a hotter coil or using a CDI system. You need a higher
voltage to jump a bigger gap. If you have a standard coil, keep the
standard gap. Yes, you may increase the gap a little with a standard
coil, but if you open it up too much, you run the risk of poor or no
spark. The original coil may not have the ability to create a good spark
across that increased gap.

The original coil's voltage is/was limited by the mechanical points. A
pointless trigger mechanism (such as a pertronics unit) now allows you
to run a hotter (higher voltage) coil.

A better question to ask is what ignition upgrades (points, coil, CDI)
do people have installed? What spark plugs and associated gap are they
running. And where are they located? (Local atmospheric conditions make
a difference.)

Anybody care to share?

I recently converted to a pertronics unit.
Can I adjust the plug gap and if so what to?
