Actually, I have the equipment to do this sort of thing, inherited from my
father.  Unfortunately, it is not set up and is not likely to be soon.

Look in the phone book under "engraving" and find a place that does
trophies, name badges, architectural signs, etc.  They can order the
frames from their raw material suppliers and engrave them with whatever
you wish.
