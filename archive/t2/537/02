Subject: parts needed for 70 bus

Has anyone got some good extra tin for my doghouse cooler engine?
Specifically, the Hoover Bit tin that bolts to the oil cooler(see link), and
the correct and complete lower tin parts, everything below the top cylinder
covers? I am using type 3 style cool tins. I need everything else.
