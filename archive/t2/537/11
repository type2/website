I was able to find 15/32 vacuum hose at my local FLAPS.  It is within a
couple of thousandths of the OEM metric hose and a _lot_ less than $10 a
foot!  The only difference is that it doesn't have the cloth covering.

I do not find German rubber to be of particularly high durability.  The
American 15/32 vacuum hose has been in service for a number of years and
is still like new.
