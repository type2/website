Subject: Cover pan under cab - fixing improvements

Yesterday I finally got round to doing a job I'd wanted to do for years.
The cover under the cab - the one that's held on with the 4 self tapping
screws...  Well on mine the threads in the frame members had long since been
stripped out by a combination of rust and over zealous tightening so I
needed to do something before I lost the cover on a vicious pothole or
strong gust of wind.

I have a 'nutsert' tool at work.  If you don't know what nutserts are (also
known as clinch nuts), they are like pop rivets only with a threaded portion
inside and there is no pin to break off.  You just screw them onto a
mandrel, insert into a hole in sheet metal, squeeze and unscrew.  This
leaves a threaded insert not unlike the weld nuts you see on tinware.  The
M6 nutserts need a 3/8" hole so all I had to do was drill the old holes out
to this size and put 4 nutserts in.  The cover pan now goes on with normal
M6 set screws, no stripped threads, job done.

I hope this is helpful to people who have the same problem with worn out
threads.  The only downside is that the tool isn't cheap (about the same as
a good rivetter) so you might want to borrow one if you can.
