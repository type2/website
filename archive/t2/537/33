Subject: [T2]Swaying

what causes swaying...?
i have noticed that the bus pulls sometimes to the right and other times its like  the wind is blowng me around,,,..?
is this the steering box..? or alignment..?
maybe the brakes..?
got new front brake pads..
back brakes need to be done though,, 
ones leaking on drivers side back...
could that be it?
also one of my torsion bars the passenger side one is bent in a place..?
could that be the problem..?
i know its guess work but thanks for any positive comments,..
peace
Chris
