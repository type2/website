Subject: Carb part?

Can anyone tell me what part 36 and 35 are in this picture? Also where I can
get them?

Is this the correct relay shaft for a 73 dual carb westy? I think that this is
the shaft that I have since mine is straight and not bent like the bottom pic.
I am trying to install my dual carbs now, previously had Weber progressive,
and this shaft is to short, so I think that I need these two parts. Just need
to find them.

I also need the mixture distributor assembly and the balance pipe. Are their
other ways of making these two parts or do I need to purchase them? I have no
pictures of them except for drawings on the Bus Boys website, so I am not sure
how they are made. Looks like I could just use some rubber hoses to duplicate
these parts? They are kind of pricey so I am trying to find a cheaper source
or an alternative solution. Maybe some kind of "T" connector for the
distributor assembly?

Does anyone have a good picture of a 73 with dual carbs installed, without the
air cleaner stuff, that I can look at to make sure that I have things hooked
up correctly?

Thanks,
Corbett
