my first thought it binding brake shoe. probably the drum is warped a
little. try backing off the brake adjust on that wheel just enough to stop
the binding.

i would suspect either
icing due to blocked or non functional riser tubes and/or no preheat
hoses.
or
choke is misadjusted or maybe binding.

hmm. this could range from not much to real bad.
-low idle combined with a high miles engine = hot flicker.
-oil sender too sensitive. check the pressure with a gauge to verify.
-really worn engine with low oil pressure. that wouldnt be so good.
-something funky with the oil relief valves or seats. wrong springs, in
wrong, seats dirty or damaged.
-try heavier oil. ie 20w50 or straight 40 or 50.
-overheating. this would explain the odd feel. are all of the tins in
place? engine compartment sort of sealed? belt not super loose? are you
driving too fast for the conditions?

thats a start.
cheers
