Awagen and sportsmobile interiors all had
fullwidth beds, I think.  There is also a kit
around that converted the standard rear VW seat
into a zbed.

I think you mean a 74-75 westy bed.  The 76 bed
has a cabinet that goes down the driver's side. 
Better than the 68-73 set up, but it still only
3/4 width.  

I too am hoping to find a 74-75 bed, or perhaps
convert my 76'ish zbed to full width.  Anybody
have one in the Arizona area?  Or want my 76
style one?  (I may widen a 68-73, which seem to
be less sought after, than use the 76.)
