Thanks

(Your fingernails are no cleaner than mine. It's reassuring.)

So the normal hole pattern is one big hole, two small ones -- at 8 0'
clock and 2 0' clock -- then one medium hole forward of the big one.
This matches what my bus has on the passenger side.

My driver side lamp mounting location is missing the small hole at the 2
o' clock position.

Extra holes would not surprise me. But missing a hole? Can such things be?
