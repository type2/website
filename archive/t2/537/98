the problem here, of course, is cost.

Those 5-speed vanagon trannys seem to be worth their weight in gold, 
given that there are so many vanagon owners with 4-speeds looking for 
an upgrade.

The other issue, according to the berg website, is making sure that 
your gearing is set up properly so that your fan spins fast enough.
