Hello,

When I was really poor. I took apart the cylinders and pistons on a
neglected frozen engine. The lower end was "okay" on inspection. The
clylinders had to be pounded off the pistons with a rubber mallet. I did
break a few cylinder fins. The rings were frozen to the piston. I soaked the
rings in cheap diesel fuel for a week or so and pried on them occasionally.
I finally got all the rings off and the ring grooves cleaned out. I couldn't
afford new rings, so I just mixed everything up and put it all back
together. It smoked like crazy for a month or so, then the mixed up rings
wore new microscopic grooves in their new cylinders. Then it did burn a
little oil, blue puff on starting, but not really bad, maybe 1/4 quart every
fillup ~250 miles. I drove that engine for years and even across the country
a couple of times. It finally threw a rod.

Of course it would have been better to use new rings,  total rebuild, line
bore, balance crank etc.

Be very patient, you should beable to eventually get the rings out and the
piston may be in great condition. You do know to look for worn out
pistons???. If not, have a machinist check the pistons for you. Some simple
checks are looking for even wear along the piston sides. You do not want to
see excess smooth wear on the piston skirts (opposite the top) New pistons
have tiny little rings cut in them when they are turned on a lathe. Look for
these rings. and see how far they go down.

If you cannot get the rings out. You may actually have a ruined piston.
Sometimes a broken valve piece banging on the piston top crushes the ring
lands against the rings. Even improper timing can ruin a piston by crushing
the ring lands into the rings.
