There should be a notch in the plastic timing plate
for TDC move about 1/2 inch to the left and that will
be about 7 1/2 degrees which is what the 1.7 L is
timed at. the air pulley has a notch in it for
refrence to set with the timing light, find it and put
some white nail polish on it.. You can get a
replacment timing plate from Bus Depot.. Phil
