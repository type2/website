Subject: CDI

Everyones been asking, so here it is. Its called a
"Tiger CDI"  and it came from Bradi's stash there were
no instructions or identify marks on it, but with the
listst helped I got it installed.

Its a true CDI, and Im still using the points. I just
put them in, and Ill wait till they wear out before
contemplating a replacement. Its mounted were the
leisure battery will eventually go. Im more interested
in doing some milage trials with a vaccum advance
dist. then switching the triggering system at the moment.
