Jamie River's question about whether you had to force the engine and trans
to mate was a very good one.  Some other questions to ponder are:
    1. Are you sure the clutch cable is adjusted so it's pulling the release
arm far enough?  How does the pedal feel?
    2. Any chance you put the clutch disc in backwards (I think it's
possible)?
    3. Did you take a look at your pilot bearing and know it's not binding
on the shaft?
    4. What were the symptoms of your "burned up clutch"?
    5. Are you sure you got the correct clutch for your transmission?
