Subject: 996 Splittie

Has anyone seen the most recent edition of the Porsche magazine Excellence? 
There is an article in there where they take a 59 splittie and customize it 
with a 996 engine and tranny, 18" wheels not to mention they even installed the 
front and rear suspension. This thing has around 300hp and looks stock except 
for the rims/tires, check it out, awesome.
