Subject: horn woes

Ok so Ive got a 68 bus, bought it second hand junk yard so it needed a few
quick fixes,the problems I am stuck on now all revolve around wiring issues
At the moment more specifically the horn. So it took me awhile to figure
out how the horn is supposed to work, still not 100% sure,  I had a brown 
wire that went from the
negative terminal to an unconnected end, a black and yellow "juice" wire 
that
was flowing, and a brown wire that was connected from the horn button down
to one of the screws on the steering wheel underside.  I couldnt find
anywhere for the open end to be so I figured someone rewired it funny. I
then took off all the brown wiring and replaced it with one wire that went
from the negative terminal on the horn to the horn button, once connected I
got the horn to work for two honks, now I cant get it to work. The fuse is
still ok I even replaced it just in case and so are all of the wires and the
horn, So can someone please tell me what I did wrong??
