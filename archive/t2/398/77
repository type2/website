Subject: RE: [T2] new starter and still no start!

If the spark plugs are out, it should have fairly consistent resistance.
Sounds like the maybe pressure plate or clutch disk...I think the flywheels
are pretty bullet-proof in a T4.

Since it turns now, you might try installing the starter, cranking with the
plugs out, and working the clutch (full travel) a few times while cranking.
Maybe that would help to seat things evenly? Charge the battery first.

I assume the fan and alternator are not rubbing or binding?
