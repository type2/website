actually, if you have a toilet you can drink in the
back of the bus while motoring down the freeway just
like a big rv.

Here's a Friday topic for everyone....... Is it okay 
to drink alcohol
inside the bus when you're parked?

Earlier this week I was showing my friend the new 
Westy... and we stopped
behind his house and cracked open a couple cold ones. 

I wasn't driving, so
alcohol at the wheel wasn't an issue... however just 
the same I could see
it being a problem at times.

What do you all think about this?

Regards,
Shawn.
