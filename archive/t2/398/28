That's the only way that counts.

I prefer to place the palm of my hand on top of the fan shroud where the
sticker is located that says no valve adjustments required. I find you can
sense far more variation in the temperature at that spot.

It feels stone cold in the 50-60s, warmer in the 70s, hot in the 80s and up
but it really all depends on how much time I spent idling in traffic before
coming to a stop to check the temp. I find it tells me more about the
outside temperature than the specific engine temperature; it's just not as
good as reading a gauge while driving.
