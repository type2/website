Subject: Re: [T2] Re; Thought's of Air Shocks

Robb,
Nope--the Gabriel's I put on my 74 required longer bolts and spacers top
and bottom--lasted all of five miles prior to taking out the bottom
mount--and havingthe new shock bounce around on the pavement of I-80.

Need one new shock and the air lines?
Got one reasonable--not used much--

I finally gaot weak and took the Bus to VW, and had them dial the rear
suspension in--the Bus now sits flat as new--- and with the addition of
new front and rear OEM shocks--it rides and handles real nice--

Coil over's and air shocks should not be used to correct a weak torsion
bar---Beddy, Beddy, Bad.

The mounts are stout---but so was the Titanic--and it sank too-as my
mounts did--:>)

Later,

Terry

 
Longer bolt goes on top, Terry. And 100k miles later, I've had not
problem one with my air-shock upgrades. As folks on the list who know
me, or who have met me at the last Everybus get together will attest to,
I'm 'prolly running the only Baja bus on the East Coast, and I beat the
pure shit out of my suspension every weekend trying in vain to keep up
with the sand rails that Sean at TransporterWerks has built. Those upper
shock mounts are VERY stout. Remember, coil-overs were a stock option on
the Bays.
