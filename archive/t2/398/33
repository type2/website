Subject: Re: [T2] Dual Temp Sender Data

Thanks for your reply! Both senders and the gauge are VDO. I suppose 
I should drag the camp stove out and do a boil test. The oil in the 
sump is the oil at the end of the path, right? How much cooling is 
from air flowing under the bus cooling the plate and the outboard 
section of the sender? Is the dipstick also touching oil in the sump 
but at a higher level? Heat does rise and the area at the core of the 
motor should be higher than at bottom. Right?

I though about getting an adaptor to run the temp sender at the oil 
pressure switch hole. This would give the temp right after leaving 
the pump. This requires a T-adaptor to also run the oil pressure 
switch/gauge sender. It seems the doing it that way would create a 
cul-de-sac of trapped oil that is not really in the flow, so to 
speak. It would be quite interesting to measure it there and then as 
it left to oil cooler.
