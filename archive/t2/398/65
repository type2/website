That really depends on where you live. They have Lowe's in Ohio right? Try
them.

Otherwise, get the phone book and look under Fasteners in the yellow pages
and locate a supplier of metric hardware with whom you can develop a
life-long relationship. Ask each vendor whom they recommend.

The upper shock bolt is M12 x 1.5mm pitch and give them the length of the
shank you require. It's probably grade 10.9. Don't ever skimp on the grade.

Many sturdy metric fasteners come from Europe from a company called Bossard
International. If you can find a Bossard reseller, you can find VW
automotive bolts. What makes it hard is that many bolts that size have a
courser thread. Sometimes they'll look at my request for a M14x1.5 bolt and
ask me if that's an automotive thread.
