Subject: RE: [T2] Air shocks on my bus

Steve,
No doubt the air shocks are an excellent complimentary suspension item
to have---

In addition to properly adjusted torsion bars-- 

From what I have seen and heard the problem here is waaay too many
people depend on the air shocks / coil over's to do the job of the
factory suspension--which is a no-no--

Add the shocks to help the suspension--not be the sole item to be doing
the suspending--

Later,

Terry
 
 
I've got air shocks on my bus. They work very well. I wouldn't worry so
long as the majority of the weight is carried by the torsion spring.
Someone a while back actually showed me where coilovers were a factory
option.
