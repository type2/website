John,
I got the correct pitch and length longer bolts at Kar Products.

 
E-mail message   
 
For those of you who currently have air shocks or coil overs on your
bus, where in the H*LL did you find the longer bolts with the right
thread for the upper mounting? It is driving me nuts trying to find the
stupid thing!! Please help.
