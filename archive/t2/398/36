Subject: Alcohol & bus/shifting problems

I know a NY State Trooper, and posed the alcohol question to him.  He said 
that it would really depend upon the actual setting/appearance of the situation. 
 For example, the duration of your stay would make a huge difference.  If you 
were obviously camping, or settled in for a good while like at an event or a 
picnic he wouldn't consider it an offense (but he couldn't understand why you 
would be inside the bus unless it were cold or raining); if you had pulled 
over on the side of the road or were in the Walmart parking lot he would be a 
little concerned.  He said if you were pulled over for an infraction and the 
passengers in the back were drinking they would have to be cited as there is not a 
definitive separation of the front from the back, regardless of whether or 
not it has appliances.  He also told me not to worry about drinking in my bus 
since I never seem to get it off blocks for any period of time...

Which brings me to this.  I have replaced every possible thing from the 
shifter knob all the way to the transmission and I still can't lose any of the 
sloppiness.  I don't have second gear and can't even smoothly shift from one gear 
to the next when the bus isn't running.  I'm running quite short on options 
and patience.  Any ideas what to do next?

Thanks!
