I am not sure what the all the P## designations are here is some info 
that might be helpful.

Below is a document showing the plan view of the Helsinki and the 
Berlin models. I think the text is in Dutch.

The Berlin (P27) is what is common in the US. Europe also had the Helsinki.

Here are some fantastic pictures of the interior of a Westfalia 
Helsinki interior which is roughly based on the SO69

I was once told by a fellow in Germay that many of the Westfalia 
campers in Europe has propane furnaces in the floor. He sent me pics 
of his which was a 75 camper with a layout that was basically a 
Helsinki layout with a furnace in the floor but I cannot find the 
pics.

Good luck.
