Subject: input shaft removal

Hi List,
I am replacing the 002 transmission in my 1971 Deluxe with a 091 
transmission from a '78 for the taller gearing for my 1904cc.  I have 
switched the front mount, will replace the late bell housing with the early 
one and swap the input shafts.  What's the trick to the input shaft?  I 
have removed the clip and backed of the gear.  I can't get it free from the 
stud.  Please help!

Joy Thru Air,
