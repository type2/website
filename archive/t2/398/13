Its was $22 at VW dealer when I inquired last fall. My steering box 
is leaking from that seal but doesn't drip very much so I choose to 
just live with it. Someone once suggested to try a bearing manufacturer
as they sell seals in many sizes and might have something that would 
work as an alternative. You'd need to know the precise measurements 
though so you'd have to careful when removing it.
