Subject: Simple question about engine temp

    Hi all

Its been HOT her the last few days, 95-100. As of now I have no temp gauges so
I rely on the hold the dipstick test. I just got back from about a half hour
drive, its still about 80 out. My question is do you guys do the above test
with the engine still running or right after you shut it down? If I wait even
a couple minutes the heat soak heats the dip stick up fast and it gets pretty
hot. If I grab the dipstick while the engine is running its nice and cool.


Thanks
