Subject: Wire AWG to metric sizing?

I am going to attempt to construct a wire harness from scratch for my 76 Westy 
and had a some questions for any of you guys/gals have done or attempted this 
before. Does anybody know how to convert AWG to metric sizing as far as wire 
goes? What kind of problems did you run into? I am going to use teflon 
insulated wire and wanted a comprable connector so any suggestions on a choice 
of connectors is appreciated. Lastly did you solder each connection and is it 
easier to use a little torch for soldering or a regular soldering iron? Thanks
