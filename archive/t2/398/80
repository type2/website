Subject: Fed Vs CA

I too have been running Fed points in my 78 CA bus. I wonder what the 
physical difference is? I have no cat or oxygen sensor on my bus. I 
think the sensor came later on in 79 or 80. The cat was gone when I got 
the bus. I have since changed out to a 72-74  heater box/muffler set up. 
I have stuck a fed ECU in my bus and
didn't notice any change in the way it ran.
