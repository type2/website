Subject: Euro vs. Dollar

It seems that lately the USD buys less and less Euros as the exchange rate
is back to 1998 levels. All of the vendors that carry German items I imagine
are going to be raising their prices to reflect the recent increase in
costs.

If you are thinking about making a large purchase, now might be a good time
to do it before the stock depletes and the prices go up 10-15%.

The CDN dollar has done the same thing which is a shame (unless you live in
Canada of course).
