Subject: Moving to Arizona, What is the best route?

For those that are familiar with the intestates to Mesa Arizona from the East 
coast, what are the better roads?

I40 to I17

Or I85 to I20 to I10

Mapping program shows only about a 27 mile difference.

Our moving truck has unlimited miles, so distance is not the problem.
We will be towing my Vanagon on a trailer.

For those in the Phoenix area (or near by), are there any shows with good T2 
swap meets on the 22 of June?

I will be stripping my 73 of good parts and then will sell them.  I will be 
arriving Sat the 21 of June.

Robert
