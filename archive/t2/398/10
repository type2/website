In the Doris Day movie "The Glass Bottom Boat", in the first scene involving
the remote jet-powered boat, when the accident occurs, there's a splittie
involved in the accident; center screen, but it's a very quick shot of the
bus.

Just went to our first VW club metting here in Augusta.  Rained out, but fun
anyway.  It was nice to meet so many local VW'ers.

One of the club members graciously took a few digital pics of the bus repro
masters that I'm working on.  I'll post them as soon as he emails them to
me.
