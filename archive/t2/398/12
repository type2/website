I've been seeing someone driving a late-model bay around my 
neighborhood the last few days:  light blue and white (maybe just white 
bumpers) with a Virginia (or Virginia Tech -- don't shoot me because I 
don't remember) sticker on the back window.  I think it was a 
7-passenger...

Nothing special, just curious about other air-cooled folks in the 
neighborhood.

cheers,
