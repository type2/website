Subject: Tank recondition

Hi

I am reconditoning the fule tak using the POR kit.  I have done the Marine
clean and the Acid wash and now I am cleaning it out.  When I look in the
tank it looks nice and clean and rust free but on the far wall opposite the
filler hole is what looks like brown Algea hangining off.  I didn't notice
this after the Marine clean.  Any suggestions as to wnere next?  Marine
clean again, Acid again?

Thanks
John
