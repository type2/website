Subject: very good horn question

helping a friend fix a 78 bus

I'm having horn trouble where there is no electricity to the steering 
column.
from what I can gather the postive end of my horn plugs into the igntion 
switch right? (corrrect me if I'm wrong) It then goes to steering column 
where the horn button can make contact with it.  The curious thing is 
that electrity will get to the wire of the ignition switch and no 
further.  I take out the switch and it looks good.  To help me better 
understang what's going on here I have some questions.

1.  how does the electircity get from the switch to the column?

2.  and of course  what is my problem... likey a short in the switch?... 
something missing in the column.?...
