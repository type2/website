The threads on the bottom of the tank are just nylon like the rest of it. If
someone hasn't cross threaded the pump and drain valve, have you tried
applying some new teflon tape to the threads and filling it up again to test
for leaks?

I have no idea where to find a new one. You might ask GoWesty or Just
Kampers if they know of one or a substitute.

There are a few markings on the side of the tank but I took a lousy picture
of it when I had mine out last year:

Kunststoff is German for plastic and at the time I thought Kunststoff GMBH
was the company that made it but there is probably another name in front or
above it.

You are far more likely to find a good used one to clean out.

BTW, I did recently find out that the mudflaps were made by a German rubber
company www.wegu.de.
