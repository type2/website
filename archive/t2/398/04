Subject: Alcohol + the bus

Here's a Friday topic for everyone....... Is it okay to drink alcohol
inside the bus when you're parked?

Earlier this week I was showing my friend the new Westy... and we stopped
behind his house and cracked open a couple cold ones.  I wasn't driving, so
alcohol at the wheel wasn't an issue... however just the same I could see
it being a problem at times.

What do you all think about this?

Regards,
Shawn.
