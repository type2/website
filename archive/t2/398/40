Zach,

  You can get SpeedBleeders (a replacement brake cylinder nipple with built-in valve) or a MityVac tool to suck the fluid through the whole line from the existing nipple (use bread loaf twist tie to secure hose on nipple first or you will also draw air from around the nipple).  For this application, I would get the tool ($20-$30).

Dave E.
