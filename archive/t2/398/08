Subject: [T2] very good horn question

My horn had the wires totally removed. Unless you're looking for stock
resto, you can do what I did:

1) Run a wire from one of the fuses (there is one designated for the horn)
on the fuse box through a hole in gutter under the instrument panel to the
positive terminal on the horn. I don't remember if the horn terminals are
polarity sensitive; if they are they should be labeled.

2) Run another wire from the horn neg terminal to the ground wire that goes
to the horn button (hopefully this is intact inside the column)

3) I also removed the horn button assembly and cleaned the circular
contacts.

I'm having horn trouble where there is no electricity to the steering
column.
from what I can gather the postive end of my horn plugs into the igntion
switch right? (corrrect me if I'm wrong) It then goes to steering column
where the horn button can make contact with it. The curious thing is that
electrity will get to the wire of the ignition switch and no further. I take
out the switch and it looks good. To help me better understang what's going
on here I have some questions.

1. how does the electircity get from the switch to the column?

2. and of course what is my problem... likey a short in the switch?...
something missing in the column.?...
