OH Boy, welcome to my last three weeks! This sounds EXACTLY like what I've
been going through on my '78. Tried two different decel valves and
determined that was not the cause. Changed almost all vacuum lines. I have
no EGR, its blocked off. I even went as far as spraying starting fluid
around the hoses trying to find this which made me a little uneasy ( kept
extinguisher in other hand).

Yesterday I think I finally got it! Here is what I did. I dont know which
replacement fixed it but it seems to have worked.

1-Replaced air intake boot with used one tested for no cracks from Bus Boys.
2-replaced a couple more hoses that I couldnt find but got from above:
   hose from plastic tube to decel valve, hose from aux. air valve to
plenum, aux. air valve rubber elbow and wire tied the ends, hose from
   said elbow to intake boot.
3-Replaced the two inserts in the Air intake boot with new ones that fit
nice and tight.
4-On the molded hoses since I have not been able to yet find the correct
size I wrapped them tightly with electricions tape to seal off any small
leaks they may have had.
5-Put hose clamps on the ends of the larger hoses.

I am suspecting that the insert that the Decel valve and aux. air valve hook
up to on the intake boot was loose. That alone may have been the culprit all
along.

Good Luck and have fun ; )
