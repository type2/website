Subject: RE: [T2] Fed vw Cal

The cap & rotor are the same, but there is actually a different part number
for points. I'm not sure why that is, but I suspect that I've been running
federal points in my 77 CA bus all along. I've ordered some CA points ($$$)
to see what they look like.

When I go to the local FLAPS and ask for points they give a choice for Fed
or Cal. This is for my 78.
What is the difference between the two? Same with cap and rotor?
