.................Check with your own state Bureau of Motor Vehicles to find 
out what documents they will demand when you drop in and say you want to 
title the bus you bought in Nevada, Listen carefully.  Then, get the 
necessary documents when you make the deal. Don't give anyone money until 
you have settled how those necessary documents are going to get drawn up.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I'm guessing that you will need a _notarized_ seller 
signature (usually the old title contains a form for this, at least Ohio 
titles do), with date of sale, amount paid, and VIN number plus description 
of the vehicle. But check with the BMV ahead of time, before doing anything 
else. And be certain to do it EXACTLY the way they say.
