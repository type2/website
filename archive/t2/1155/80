Subject: engine rubber seal replacement.

Here a solution for a replacement of the engine compartment rubber
seal - the one separating the engine cylinder blocks from the interior
engine compartment.

I put a copper strip inserted in the shield grove with a piece of
rubber bend around the copper strip . Works well and recreates the
shape of the original rubber profile. Mine was burned due to neglect
of exchaust failure.
kind of bush mechanics... :)
