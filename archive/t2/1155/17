Subject: Oil cooler Diagram for vanagon AC

anyone have a blow up diagram of the parts around the oil cooler on an Air
Cooled vanagon? I want to see if I am missing tins or gaskets of any kind.
the tin I have has a part cut out for some reason, and I seem to remember
some type
of plastic trim or foam  on the tin piece where it meets the oil cooler. I
want to seal this area the best I can
thanks
