You're not using fuel injection gasket blocks are you?

If you are talking about every so slightly, you should be able to bend
the pipe that much.

If you cut it, the hose should be rated vacuum hose and not collapse.
For the little bit you are talking about, it shouldn't be much
concern.

By the way, an easier way out with vacuum hose is to skip the rubber
elbows at the manifold and use the vacuum hose there instead. Then you
don't have to cut your balance tube.
