The 022 133 083 fits only 75 FI Buses.  Jeremy needs the 022 133 083
D, which Airhead/VWG now makes and provides (thanks to my prodding):

Airhead/VWG has only just got these in the past couple of weeks, hence
no photo has been uploaded yet.  I did a test fit of these on on a 78
Westy and an 80 Vanagon to make sure they work right.  Made of
high-temp resistant Viton.
