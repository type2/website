Steve,

Try plugging the vacuum line to the brake booster and see if it idles
better.  If it does then the line to the vacuum booster is leaking.  On mine
it was the short rubber line from the metal vacuum line to the booster
itself.  It was original and fabric covered so couldn't see what the rubber
underneath was like.  As soon as I had it off it fell apart.  Repair the
leak with some new hose and it should be ok.  Don't drive with the vacuum
booster disconnected since the braking effort will be a lot more.

Andy

My elusive vacuum leak is driving me crazy.  T took off the right carb,
balance pipe and intake, replaced gaskets ... no change.  I'm starting over.
