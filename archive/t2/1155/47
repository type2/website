Hi David,

Along with John Kolak's suggestions, I would recommend you take a close 
look at the "pod" on the center front of the front beam. This piece of 
metal is where the steering arm anchors. This area is prone to rust and 
can cause the sides to crack, allowing the steering input to open and 
close the crack instead of turning the wheels.

I had this crack open up on me on my way to EveryBus this year, and had 
to have it welded up with some braces while at the campout. When I left 
Toronto there was very little play in the wheel but by the time I was in 
NC I had about 45 degrees or more of free play.

Happy Trails,
