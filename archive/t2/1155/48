Entrering that part #, bus depot catalog shows this $13 item as an elbow
http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=022133083
One beef I have with their cataog is that this part does not show up 
under fuel injection, seals, or as a brake servo part, nor is there a 
picture as shown in other sites.
