Subject: front-gearbox mount-bolt size

Hi Folks,
            Could someone tell me the wrench size(s) I need to tighten the
front gearbox mount on an '83 Vanagon.  I'm away from my Bently/Haynes
manuals, and the van, so cannot check myself.   Want to make sure I have them
when I go there next.  Thanks. jon
