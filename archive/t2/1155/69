Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone considered Subaru's boxer diesel?

Neale, the conversion would be "easy" enough in the fact that the adapter
plates are made by at least 2 US companies (though far easier in a waterboxer
of course) but frankly that engine has a rep for being a real POS I've read. 
Supposedly abhorent reliability already (in a very short time) for a Subaru
product.  Since we don't have em in the US not much chance of doing one unless
we put a lot of $$ into getting it.  When I heard it had come out, I looked
into it a bit for my '87 syncro before I started parting it, read on it, left
the idea.  Now if I were in a country where they existed and fell across one
cheap, that would be a different story.  For the bus, standard issues apply,
the cooling system, heating system, and mounts will be all home fab, might as
well sell the bus and buy a '84 or so where it is a drop in kit and be done
with it.

OK, I understand to the purists this is sacrilege, but I'd like to do a lot
more mileage in the old girl, and a current turbo diesel is an attractive
option for doing big miles, especially in the country here. (and we haven't
determined how much damage a dropped valve has done to Tigger's engine, it
may be stuffed)
