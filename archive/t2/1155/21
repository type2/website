	This says:

	Could have fooled me!  I ordered from a VW dealer in 
Frankfurt a '69 1500 Westfalia camper to my specs, and collected it 
upon arrival, as if it were an ordinary Beetle.  To whatever extent 
the outfitting of kombis with Westie innards was a separate entity, 
it sure looked like VW making a camper itself.
