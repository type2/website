Hi Josh,

Low oil pressure simply means increase viscosity unless you have a
mechanical problem like worn bearings or back pressure relief
valve/spring/seat.

People who swear by mono-grade use SAE 40 when it gets hot. 20/50 can
do the trick for you too. A pressure gauge is nice instead of winging
it.
