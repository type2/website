Subject: Is the Hot Air Box supposed to be "open"?

On my '74 bus with the '75 engine running dual carbs, Bus Boys call it the Hot Air Box in this diagram it's "S" 
http://www.bus-boys.com/carb1.html

Is it supposed to be capped on the right side?  

Mine is threaded like there needs to be a cap but it's open to the world.  When I put my hand over it there is some significant air flow in and helps reduce the "vacuum leak" symptoms ... but if it's supposed to be open then I obviously don't want to cap it with duct tape or something.

The tube coming out the bottom of the Hot Air Box goes into ... something.  That seal is loose too.  

I've got the break boosters plugged so though those tubes may need attention, they are not the source of my problem.  The cylinder head/intake gasket seems to be good ... it tightened a little past 14 ft lbs just to snug it up a bit.

Thanks for all your help to this point,
Steve
