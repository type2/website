Subject: Re: [T2] Vent Window is Really Tight

That's usually the way with new vent seals.  On the production line,
it was the general rule that after installation, the vent wings were
to remain closed until they arrived at the dealer so that the glass
and seal would "seat" it self.  By the time a new customer got the
vehicle (usually 4 to 6 weeks after production average), opening and
closing it became much easier.  Remember, new VWs were always touted
for their water-tightness in most but not all seals.

Of course, everything has to align properly and Bus Side Window Vents
requires skill and patience when re-installing, much more than the
Front Door Vents. BTDT.
