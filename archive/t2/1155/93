Subject: Switching Oil

Yes, another oil thread and similar to one I've already asked...

The last couple days have hit the 90's here in Ol' Blighty.

My oil light has been flickering near the end of my commutes.
I current use SAE 30 in my 1600 twin-port '79 bus.
Most air-cooled specialists swear by the stuff and you can get good quality SAE 
30 here for not too much.

Would switching to 20W-50 part-synthetic help with the summer months?
Or would some other oil type or specification help?
I've read some accounts that say you should expect oil light flickering during 
hot days, but I find it disconcerting when I come to an idle or take a low-speed 
tight corner and it comes.
If switching oil can alleviate this, then it's a load off my shoulders.

Thanks,

Josh
