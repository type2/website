Subject: Re: Anyone considered Subaru's boxer diesel?

Hi Neale,
              Long conversion thread about the Sub diesel on the samba
currently.  Some folks have brought a wad (20-30) of the engines into the US
from Japan (by the looks of some links).  As John said, they are not getting
everyone excited (yet).  For a start, the ECU is VERY linked to the rest of
the donor car's systems, and it isn't going to work, properly, without that
ECU. Its an electronically controlled, multi-shot, injection system.  A
non-trivial install at this moment.  The VW in-line TDI diesels look much
easier.  Now if we could only get the Toyota D-4D Hilux engine, we'd be set. 
That should be easy for you in Aus. jon
