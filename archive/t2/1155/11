Subject: 4th gear rattle

Ok so today I noticed that when in fourth gear and under load there is a 
rattle/clatter noise coming from the trans-axle.
Also It will go away for the most part if I put a little pressure by 
pulling the shifter back.
So...  my questions
What is it?
How serious is this?
How long do I have?

Thanks for your thoughts...

Jason
