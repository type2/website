Subject: Running Rich = Engine Damage?

My elusive vacuum leak is driving me crazy.  T took off the right carb, balance pipe and intake, replaced gaskets ... no change.  I'm starting over.  

I can improve how the engine runs my adjusting the fuel mix screw forcing it to run a little rich. ('74 bus, '75 engine running dual carbs) Is that going to cause damage to the engine? It has to be running by the 4th and I'm getting desperate ... but not so desperate that I want to do damage to the engine.

I'm talking about driving her max 500 miles over the next few weeks.

Thanks, 
Steve
