Yes, a 5-50 oil has a greater viscosity range, but here is a concern. 
Multigrade motor oils achieve extended viscosity by adding polymers to the 
base grade oil.  The wider the viscosity spread the greater the number of 
polymers.  But polymers can break down under stress.  When this happens 
viscosity is lost.

A 20-50 weight oil is still a 20 weight oil even with all the polymers gone. 
A 5-50 oil, on the other hand, becomes a 5 weight motor oil, way to thin for 
use in a bus.

Our bus engines run a higher temperatures than water cooled engines, which 
can't be good for additives including polymers. Stress and shearing is 
another factor that can cause deterioration in oil.

By the way, when traveling and looking for oil, I find it is often easier to 
find higher viscosity oils in motorcycle shops than in supermarkets and 
convenience stores.  Motorcycles also have air cooled engines and their 
owners and shop mechanics are very aware of and knowledgeable about oils, 
and the shops often have extensive offerings.

Ideally, I would be looking for a 20W50 with high ZDDP.
The best I have found was Castrol 20W50 "for classic cars" with ZDDP.
Well, they "improved" that item, and now it is reformulated as Castrol
5w50 "classic cars" with ZDDP. I am using that now, in a warm climate.
Does the new formulation mean the oil has an even broader viscosity
range than before?
