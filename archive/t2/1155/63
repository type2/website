OK, rebuilt the master last year. The rear circuit just failed so the
cylinder walls may have pits I can't see.

I want a master with provision for both switches so he "oops, you lost
a circuit" light on the dash will continue to work.

I'm unwilling to spend near $300 for a genuine ATE master.

This appears to be a new-to-the-market valid replacement from Raybestos.

Anyone have any experience?

Anyone have one *IN STOCK* that will ship in less than 3 to 5 weeks
after I make payment? This is my daily driver and I'm currently driving
gently around town on the front circuit only. I need to get this
ordered today (Friday) and delivered/installed by next Tuesday
or Wednesday.

Thanks all,

Gerald
