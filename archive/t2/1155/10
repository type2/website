Subject: Intake Manifold Torque

I have a 1975 1800 engine with dual carbs. The spacer/gasket between the intake and the head got hung up on the tin so I still have a few screws to take out before I can replace it ... and things were going so smooth up to that point.

I've searched and can't find the torque specs to tighten down the intake manifold.  In Bentley they have 14 ft/lbs for the 1600 single carb engine but don't list it for the 1800. At least I can't find it.  

I find a variety of things online so I figured I'd ask you guys.  

Thanks,
Steve
