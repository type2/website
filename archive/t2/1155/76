Hi Max,

That's a lot to think about. First, it sounds like your electrical
system has some bugs since your first restart sounded like a dead
battery. Yet then you said you were able to crank for eternity until
it started. So either you got help and jumped the bus with another car
or battery, or your weak cranking is an intermittent electrical
problem which could be something like dirty cable and/or wire
connections or an intermittent short inside the battery, which will
only get worse and leave you stranded in time.

If you have an intermittent electrical problem, it could also be
responsible for the failure to start. But to leave the electrical
behind and focus on your fuel system questions, the symptoms also
pertain to vapor lock. Some have success with dousing the fuel lines
with a glass of water. The fuel pump diaphragm can rupture causing the
pump to stop pumping. When the diaphragm first starts to crack, the
loss of pumping power can be barely noticeable, but as it gets worse,
it will leak gas into the crankcase, so you should notice an odor of
fuel in your oil, or notice the oil level rising on the dip stick.

Air in the fuel filter is meaningless. It takes a bare amount of fuel
flow to keep the carb topped off, and even on a running engine with a
filter full of air, the flow of fuel is barely visible. It just means
that air in the system has gotten trapped in the filter. If you like
to see a full fuel filter for a feeling of confidence, you have to
bleed the air out of the system. This is probably as simple as
immersing the filter in gas, and then making sure the fuel lines on
either side are also topped up with gas and you see no air at the open
ends when you reassemble.

Have fun,

John
