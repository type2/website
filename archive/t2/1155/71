Hi Jeremy,

You can't generalize like that. A vacuum leak has the potential of
altering the air-fuel ratio into the "hot zone". A big leak might make
it lean enough to go clear over into the cool and lean side of the hot
zone. These things are unknown and speculation if you don't have an
AFR meter running on each individual cylinder. You can do it the low
tech old-fashioned way by looking at spark plugs. It's best to not
drive until the condition is fixed, and use standard engine
diagnostics to see if any damage has occurred.
