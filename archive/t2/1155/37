Get underneath and watch while someone turns the wheel.

First check in the slop range. Does anything move underneath, or is
all the slop in the steering box? There is an adjustment in the box -
if it isn't worn past being able to adjust.

If the box is tight and things are moving underneath, watch for the slop.

Are tie rods tight? Is there slop in the drag link bushing? Ball joints?

Verify what you see by lifting the wheels off the ground slightly.

Check for free play at the ball joint by putting a crow bar under the
wheel and move it up and down. Watch for any looseness at the ball
joint. You should only see normal up and down movement of the
suspension.

Check for free play at the tie rods by grasping the front and rear of
the tire and seeing if there is wiggle as you alternately push and
pull the front and rear.

Have fun,

John
