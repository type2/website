Josh, now this is a hard call, as this is a generality statement between
brands, etc, but...
 
Personally I do NOT often find 20W50 to actually perform heavier/thicker
than SAE30.  Even in a same brand comparison, back when I cared and had my
highly instrumented air cooled Vanagon, between Castrol straight 30 and
20W50, the straight 30 would across the board, start, cruise, heavy load,
run higher pressures, and slightly cooler temps actually.  Now this was a
long, long, time ago ('95 or so) in an oil galaxy far far away.  And 40
weight would run even better pressures of course.
