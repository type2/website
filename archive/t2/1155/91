I think it was vapor lock. I took sometime before the rain came to
sort out how the wires and fuel lines were routed on the left side of
the engine bay. The metal fuel line is nearly sitting on top of the
intake manifold so I am sure it got mighty toasty. I think before the
shop swapped the carb and exhaust it ran along the tin underneath the
manifold.

Does anyone have a preferred location for the metal fuel line?

She started right up after sitting all day, I still have a crummy idle
so I'll look at that next. So, I'll relocate the metal fuel line and
check out the carb in case cruft is residing around the needle valve.

Thank you all for the advice. I guess I am showing my age when I have
heard of vapor lock but it was not common when I was growing up.
