Tom -

VW Part Number N90032203 (or N90032204), Seal 7.3x2.4, Oil Dipstick
Tube to Case.

http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=N90032204

Still available from VW Dealer, but you may have to special order it.
Probably a couple of bucks.

Or if someone has a Vanagon (not a 2.0 Bus - not the same) Engine
Gasket Kit that only had certain things used, like for a Head or P&C
Exchange only, the seal's probably in a baggy in the set that someone
could/would donate.  Sorry, don't have one myself.
