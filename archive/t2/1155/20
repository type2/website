Subject: The Economist on the Bus

http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2011/06/camper-vans contains a nice
short article on our buses.

Real Type II content, just had a brand new stock 1600dp exhaust put on and I
really notice the difference over the non-stock 4tip exhaust I had on. Much
more torque.
