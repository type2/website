Gerald -

The Raybestos cylinder is of Far Eastern origin and so far has not had
a good track record primarily because they leak a few months after
installation.  That's why most vendors stick with the ATE replacement.
 Save yourself some grief, buck up and get the original.

BTW, the application shown on the website is wrong, only fits 70
Buses.  Gotta get the webmaster to upload a correction.  Also, all ATE
cylinders are now manufactured in Italy since about 2005, but the
quality is equal to the OG.
