Subject: bearings?

Well, I am still hearing a weird noise I think from my rear axle, after
replacing the brake cables. And I still notice that my brake cable is
tighter when I have a load in the back of my bed.

 

I am anticipating a rear wheel bearing issue, so I went through my parts
stash, and came up with some bearings I knew I bought a long time ago-for my
'65. I think some of these may be good for my '69 single cab.

 

I was able to cross reference some of them, but not others. Anyone know what
these bearings might be for? Sorry I bought them so long ago, I can't
remember. I think they are for the front wheel bearing on my '65.

Thanks for helping me label these parts.
