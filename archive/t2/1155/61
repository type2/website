Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Booster Vacuum Line - 71 Bus

I use 1/2" ID Oil/Trans Cooler Hose.  It's not spiral wired, but it
withstands high interior pressure and vacuum and is so less expensive
than the stuff from the dealer.  I've used it on a 71 Bus, 73 Panel
Van, 77 Westy, 80 Vanagon and currently on both my Wasserboxer
Vanagons.  Should be easy to obtain from your FLAPS.
