Thanks to all who offered suggestions for my idling problem (71 Westy, 1600 
 DP, 34PICT, Original Dist, etc).  Turns out, it was an air/vacuum  leak.  
The vacuum line that connects from the body tube to the brake  booster servo 
was split and cracked.  I replaced it...tuned the carb  properly....problem 
solved.
