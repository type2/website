The Economist is right. Westfalia-Werke was an independent company
contracted by Volkswagen to do their camper conversions. (They were actually
one of a few. In the U.S., Sportsmobile and ASI/Riviera also got the
"factory blessing" for a while, largely because Volkswagen of America could
not meet demand from Westfalia alone.) However, in 2001 Volkswagen
competitor Daimler-Chrysler bought Westfalia (having already owned a
minority stake). Perhaps due to that conflict of interest, Volkswagen
decided to bring camper production in-house. (Daimler sold Westfalia again
in 2008.)
