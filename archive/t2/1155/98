Ideally, I would be looking for a 20W50 with high ZDDP.
The best I have found was Castrol 20W50 "for classic cars" with ZDDP.
Well, they "improved" that item, and now it is reformulated as Castrol
5w50 "classic cars" with ZDDP. I am using that now, in a warm climate.
Does the new formulation mean the oil has an even broader viscosity
range than before?
