Subject: Can shock grommet be replaced?

Daughter said her 75 bus made a "clunk-clunk" in front over any bumps.
Turns out the rubber grommet on driver side lower shock mount had pushed 
out and was easy to yank out as it had split.  Are these replaceable or 
must new shock pair be bought? Because of the bushing I'd think they'd 
be part of the shock? About 70K miles on these. They are red, not sure 
if they are koni's until I unbolt this one.
