The hot air box is not an important component unless you are driving
in very cold weather.

If the hot air valve diaphragm is ruptured, it just means automatic
switching between hot and cold air intake is not working.

Just disconnect and plug the vacuum line(s) going to it so that a bad
valve will not be a source of vacuum leak to the engine.

A complete vacuum line diagram is at ratwell.com. You can check to see
if the vacuum hose goes to anything else important.
