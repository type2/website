I've been having similar difficulties with an order I've been working
on recently. So many of the things I need to order don't show up under
the vehicle subsystem, so I decided to pop in ETKA to see if I could
come up with part numbers.

The disadvantage there is that so much comes up NLA even on my older
ETKA, but I did come up with 3 or 4 part numbers that came up as
available at Bus Depot if you do a part number search.

But like you say, these have no picture, and no application data, so
it makes you wary to buy in case it's not the same as the what you are
have. Then you wonder how many other of the things you need would come
up if only you could find a part number.

Seriously Bus Depot needs to do some work on integrating their orphan
parts into the vehicle subsections.
