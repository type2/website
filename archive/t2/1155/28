Subject: Re: [T2] Oil cooler Diagram for vanagon AC

The best diagram to show this seal is actually here on the Bus Boy's site:

http://www.bus-boys.com/aircoolsystem.html#tin

Item Q is the Oil Cooler to Tin Seal, 021-119-329.  It is no longer
available new.  It is not foam, but actually a high-temp rated
neoprene rubber material.

(I created most of the diagrams on Bus Boys' site in the late 90s, so
that's how I know).

I usually find these on any 72-79 Bus or 80-83 Vanagon when I cruise
the boneyards.  Most are in decent used shape, but some are falling
apart after 28+ years of use.  I'll check my stash, I might have a
few.  I get $28 which includes Priority Mail.
