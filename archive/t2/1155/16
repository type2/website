Subject: Re: [T2] 15 inch wheels on a bay

Scott as I'm sure others will chime in, it is done, but with adapters for the
Porsche allolys.  There should be bolt on 15" choices, MBZ, Audi, later VW
(come in 2 different 5 bolt configurations so be careful) all come to mind,
just as used on Vanagons commonly.  I have some Audi turbo and EV rims, I
imagine I should try and bolt em up sometime to see what works without a lot
of effort...  So if you want a 15" to go for more commonly available tires as
14" are getting hard to find, probably better choices, if you want a style
choice then go with them fancy Porsche alloys, will match that fancy Porsche
engine (having a WV moment here, all those buses I bought with that Poorsheee
engine from hicks in the middle of nowhere.)
 
There are several good 15" load rated sizes for Vanagons, how they would
fit/work on a bus is hard to say, with a '74 and the bit lower R&P you could
probably run something a bit taller if you wanted as well, but you are going
to have to basically make sure things don't rub.

These look to have 5 lugs. Anyone switch to 15" wheels, and is it a
good idea to do this?
