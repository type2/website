Subject: Denver to Downey Calif.. wasRe: [T2] engine shipping ,

I am trying to get an T1 engine from southern ontario to California...

Greg Potts has offered to get it to HCBF,last weekend in july,  and Troy Wical
has offered to get it to Denver !

So, at this point, I am wondering if anyone might have a suggestion to get it
from Troy, in Denver, on to Downey Cali. ?

Thanks!
Jamie
