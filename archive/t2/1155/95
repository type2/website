Subject: Importing to the US

The time will be coming when we will be moving back to the States from the UK.
We'd like to have a bus for our family of four (but possibly more).

After living with Berta, our '79 Bay Super Viking, we'd love to keep something 
with that much interior space.

We also really enjoy the Propex heater for those cold months and when no 
campsite electrics are available.

We could probably sell Berta for a tidy sum and buy something in the States.
However, how about just importing her?

Has anyone done that?  Would there be problems with right-hand drive, the Propex 
unit, or emissions?
I imagine the lights need to be converted to left-hand drive configuration as 
well.
Any other points I should consider?  

It seems like UK importers are buying up VW's left-and-right from the US and 
putting them on UK roads.
Is it a gigantic headache going the other way, from UK to US?

Thanks,

Josh
