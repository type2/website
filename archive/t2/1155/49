Subject: Re: [T2] Steering is loose

Ouch, this happened to me suddenly on the Schykill Epressway in Philly 
years ago.  I laid under the bus with gas welding equipment and welded 
1/8" 1" stock over the entire housing in a x shape that wrapped over the 
torsion bar tube.  Had hot grease dropping on me....lasted until I could 
replace the entire front suspension.

Along with John Kolak's suggestions, I would recommend you take a close 
look at the "pod" on the center front of the front beam. This piece of 
metal is where the steering arm anchors. This area is prone to rust and 
can cause the sides to crack, allowing the steering input to open and 
close the crack instead of turning the wheels.

I had this crack open up on me on my way to EveryBus this year, and had 
to have it welded up with some braces while at the campout. When I left 
Toronto there was very little play in the wheel but by the time I was in 
NC I had about 45 degrees or more of free play.
