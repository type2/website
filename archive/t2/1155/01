Are you a vet? Have you looked at USAA? Getting ready to swap my daily 
drivers over b/c USAA is cheaper. Significantly cheaper than State Farm, 
my current company.

I won't tolerate limited insurance. I want to use my vehicle as I see 
fit. Have you considered insuring it for normal use for 6 months per 
year and then removing the insurance when you park it for the season or 
changing over to some sort of RV insurance when it is parked? Or 
swapping to a collector car insurance for that six months?

Once upon a time I had Nationwide and a great agent. Seems like Dad was 
able to get me reduced insurance when I parked my '66 Mustang while in 
the Navy. When I got out and relocated 100 miles north, the agent here 
noted that I did not have insurance for over three years (sold the '66), 
was living in Italy during that period. In order to accept me as a "new" 
customer I was suddenly high risk and my insurance was going to leap 
from a few hundred per year to nearly $3000! That's when I gave him a 
bit of my mind and switched to State Farm who accepted my business 
without a blink at reasonable rates and good service. Only have filed 
one $300 claim with them 15 years ago when somebody keyed my then brand 
new '99 CR-V. ARG! I went a little crazy that day... ;)

So do agents get a percentage of the insurance premiums? I think they do 
and that might explain why the Nationwide agent was acting strange - he 
was being greedy.
