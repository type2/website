Subject: Side Tent 

I have an original tent for my '78 westy that I want to sell. Its the striped
circus style. It has all the poles and is in pretty good shape. I just never
use it like I thought I would. I am going to set it up and take photos. I then
plan to list it on either samba or E-bay but I wanted to give folks on the
list first dibs. Would like to get $650 or best offer for it so if you have
interest let me know or make me an offer. Planning to get the photos by the
weekend and list it next week if there is no interest from the list. Also
curious whether folks think I would do better on Samba or E-barf with selling?
 
Thanks,
