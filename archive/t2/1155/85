I agree fully John.  It really hits home when I think about the last/only 23
window I've owned.  I bought it in school in '90 or so for $3800 which I felt
was ludicrous and sold it for about $5000 which I thought was really
ludicrous.  And it was a mint AZ bus that had been driven up by a guy who sold
Mexican woven parkas to want to be hippies on the campus of WVU and was short
on cash.  The bus had one 2x4" spot of rust on the battery pan, and one at one
of the middle seat mounts and that was it.  I've never been a samba guy and
owned it all of 6 months maybe.  Seems like I should have kept that one, I
don't know what the Barrett Jackson car started as, but couldn't have been
much nicer.
 
The point that they aren't in yards anymore, aren't cheap anymore, is well
taken too, certainly takes a real effort to use em as real transportation. 
I'll go so far to say, they aren't owned by the same group of people anymore
(present company excepted of course) more than about half the time.

But then something changed. The prices started going up. Before
getting into buses, my goal was the $2000 price point when I needed a
"new" car. So getting buses much cheaper than that was a real boost in
helping me not to have too much money tied up in transportation. But
suddenly I felt guilty when a bus I put together was worth more than
