Subject: Cranking...cranking...ignition

Hi all,

I have just returned from a pleasant drive to the coast which was fun but KK,
my bus had a few hiccups. I have recently had a well respected air-cooled shop
install a new carb and exhaust on my 71 bus. These are stock items, a Bocar 34
pict3 and a stock exhaust. Anyhow, after cruising at 55 on my return trip I
had to pull over for a police car, when I tried to resume KK died. The first
crank after that sounded like a dead battery. After looking over the engine
bay I closed the hatch and cranked again, held my foot on the gas and after an
eternity of cranking she sputtered to life. Stopped for some food on the way
home and the same problem occurred. Looking at my fuel filter, it seems
awfully empty. I suspect the carb is at fault but can the mechanical pumps
deteriorate? It is a stock 1600dp engine. It also idles lower than 850rpm
until warmed up. At speed she runs great, no noticeable difference than before
my starting issues.

Thanks for the help and wisdom,

Max
