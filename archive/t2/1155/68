Subject: Anyone considered Subaru's boxer diesel?

OK, I understand to the purists this is sacrilege, but I'd like to do a lot
more mileage in the old girl, and a current turbo diesel is an attractive
option for doing big miles, especially in the country here. (and we haven't
determined how much damage a dropped valve has done to Tigger's engine, it
may be stuffed)

We've got firms here stocking engine and transmission adapters for the
Subaru gear which would make it a bit easier, and a little 2L TDI backed by
a 5 or 6 speed transmission would be nice for cruising.

I know a lot of people have bitten the bullet and gone to the subi perol
motors, anyone thought about the diesel?

Thanks,
