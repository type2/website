To me this sounds like vapor lock or some variation of it, especially if it
only occurs when the engine has been running and is hot.  Check where the
fuel lines lie.  If they are lying against or very close to the engine then
the heat can vaporize gas inside the lines.  This used to be a common
problem with all cars way back when before the age of computerized systems

When the new carb was installed the routing of the lines may have changed,
or the positioning of the fuel filter.
