It is a tent that is a 1:1 scale relica of a 65 bus! I think that Ron at Bus
depot could make some money off of these. I would rater have one of these than
the original circus tent that are going for $500-700 now a days. Anayway, I
just wanted to pass it along. too bad they don't offer a bay window one. Maybe
Ron could convince them to make one!
