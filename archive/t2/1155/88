These are hard to come by new or used.  I had one on order for months.  I 
finally located one in an obscure warehouse in Arizona.

Good luck finding one.

What I thought was clutch/transmission problems in my 69 bus turned into a
spun rear brake drum :( I'm looking for an original vw one. If anyone has 
one
for sale please contact me. Thanks!
