What does no change mean? Have you positively identified the location
of your leak? If you did a bad job installing a gasket, take it out
and do it over. Don't settle for half-baked work.

Running rich is a slow excessive wear to the engine as it dilutes the
engine oil on the cylinder walls. Maybe valve guides too?

What I am more worried about is that you can't depend on that rich
adjustment to keep you in the safe zone at all times. Running lean
with a vacuum leak is what will burn up your engine.
