Obviously the answer will depend on the profile of your 15" tyres! I
haven't tried it, though many have. As I understand it you can
compromise the cooling by reducing the revs too much.

I assume you have already tackled the usual suspects - tuned engine,
correct tyre pressure (or a bit on the high side), removed unnecessary
junk from vehicle?
