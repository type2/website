Hi Scott,
I have 6x15 (or are they 6 1/2 x 15 ?) Fuchs alloys on my bus. They
fit with the help of adapters, because the 5-bolt pattern is a bit
more eccentric. Be sure to get the thinner steel adapters, not the
thicker aluminum ones, otherwise your tires may rub against the wheel
well. Plus the offset will then be completely wrong and cause undue
stress.

If I remember correctly, I have 205/65/15 Continentals on them (can't
check now, the bus is in California and I'm in France), but the total
diameter is very close to the original 185/14. (Quick back of the
envelope calculation: original radius = 7" + 185 x 0.82 = 329.5 mm ;
new radius = 7.5" + 205 x 0.65 = 323.75 mm).

With tires that wide, contact surface to the road is bigger, too.
Steering is a bit more difficult, which is why I inflate them more,
35-40 psi, until steering resistance is almost back to normal. (Don't
want to break the fragile steering box.)

Handling is excellent, load carrying capacity is D-rated, thus higher
than the original C-rated tires. Wider stance looks "sporty" :) But
don't expect better mileage. Unless you manage to find/fit some
195/75/15 tires (7.5" + 195 x 0.75 = 336.75 mm radius) for a 2%
increase in circumference. (Wouldn't go beyond 195 on a 5 1/2 wheel.)
Not worth the trouble.
