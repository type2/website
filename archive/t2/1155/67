Subject: Re: [T2] Can shock grommet be replaced?

Mike -

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.....Bushings were available
from the dealer to replace in the shock eyelets - VW 211 413 381 B -
but they obsoleted them out in May 2000, so no more.  Bus Depot shows
a 211 413 381 A on their site, but the parts book says they fit the
earlier bay window only, so they must be a different size.  All
bushings shown in parts book, fiche and ETKA are for STOCK original
shocks, not the aftermarket ones, they're different.

About your only choice is new shock(s).
