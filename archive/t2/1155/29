Subject: Brake Booster and Vacuum Tee help needed

I am looking for one of these:

http://www.germansupply.com/home/customer/product.php?productid=16987

Bus Boys lists the following info:


D. Rubber "Y" from Center Plenum to Plastic Tube & Power Brake VacuumHose
022-133-083  1975 Manual Trans  NLA
022-133-083D  1976-1979 Manual Trans  NLA



What have you done, or do you do when this part is so cracked that it is
causing a pretty significant vacuum leak?


What should we put around it, to seal it up?


Suggestions for sealing it or what you used to replace it are appreciated.


Thanks!



Jeremy
