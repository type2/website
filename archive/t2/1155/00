If you're talking about that black piece, that's a gasket.  The heads 
are flush.

If you want to preserve the gasket, you might try soaking the area with 
some wd40 or see if the tin is holding it on.  A few taps from the 
top/sides might help to loosen it up.  Otherwise you can grab it with a 
pair of pliers and pull/break it off.

This is what it looks like:
