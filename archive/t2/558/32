>> Glass bad.  Glass breaks, make big leak.  Plastic better.

The last part I have to disagree with.  Plastic sucks.  It is a single use item in all cases, and is not re-usable, modifiable, nor easily repaired - gee that sounds like glass.  Sorry I've just spent a whole day dealing with plastic parts that serve only the purpose of the originators, and those who make profit providing the replacements that naturally have to be needed because plastic does not survive the rigors of the environments that it is subjected to.  30 years?  Well yes, the original promise was forever, trying to recycle it is forever, and dealing with it after it fails is forever.  Yes, there is a lot of short-term gratification.....
