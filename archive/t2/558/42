Subject: Are coils supposed to get hot?

I've been meaning to ask this...

Every time I'm trying to start the bus, I notice my coil is really hot. Much 
hotter than any other part of the engine. I don't recall the coils in my 
other cars getting hot, though that may just be the placement in my bus... I 
brush against it whenever I reach into the engine box.

The coil does generate a spark according to my little fake sparkplug... 
Doesn't look weak, but looks can be deceiving.
