It would be metered just the way it was explained--with a simple air
valve from a fish tank--

The specific volume at any given time is depending upon the amount of
vacuum the engine is making.

The water injection system is not sucking water / alcohol direct from
the bottom of the tank---
The draw hose is at the top of the tank--
The air intake side of the tank is the second hose which drops to the
bottom of the tank and the fluid--which the airstone, or clunk is
attached to.

Air is sucked in--the fluid is aerated, and the moisture is sucked out
of the tank at the top and into the engine--

How much is aerated is controlled by the air valve--the more open it
is--the more agitation of the fluid-which gets sucked up by a vacuum
hose to a T or an open vacuum port.

Pretty simple--and it does work.
