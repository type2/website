Subject: Any going to Buses, Bands and Brews from KS or MO???

I have arranged to purchase an engine from a friend in Ohio.  She will 
be at the Buses, Bands and Brews campout near Cincinnati, Ohio, the 
weekend of May 21st.  Is anyone attending this event from Kansas or 
Missouri, or anyone traveling through those states on the way home from 
this campout?

If someone could get the engine closer to the Kansas City area, I would 
be willing to toss in some gas money.  I am very motivated to get this 
engine ASAP.

You can drop me an email, or give me a call at 913.360.3382.

Thanks,
mjr
