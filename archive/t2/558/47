Subject: Dim Alternator Light With Headlights On

The vehicle:  '76 FI standard w/air conditioning, California model. Stock 
radio (I don't know if it works).  All lights work.   Dual batteries.  
Starting battery appears new, deep cell battery seems original.  
Gas/electric refrigerator.  Was setup with dual CB radios.

The background:  Vehicle was inside stored for 15 years, and apparently put 
away running.  Now it is running on 3 of 4 cylinders, dwell, timing, 
compression, advance, vacuum are all in spec [48-50; 7.5 BTDC; 145+/- 5; 32' 
(-at-) 2500rpm; 17" vacuum]

The VW starts moderately well, and idles acceptably, ran well during a test 
run with just 2 of 4 cylinders working, it gave 42 mph on the 
straight/level.

Problem:  At night/dark, with the engine running and the headlights ON, the 
alternator light glows very dim.  When the headlights are turned OFF, with 
just the instrument/parking lights, the alternator light goes off.

Simply increasing engine revs does not eliminate the dim alternator light.

Thanks for any suggestions.
