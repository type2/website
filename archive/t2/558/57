Subject: RE: [T2] A couple more newb questions. :)

Ok, to answer the questions, I'm in Tukwilla. A suburb of Seattle. It's
Fuel Injected. And I have several books on order. Their just not here
yet. :)

Since I seem to need/want a Vacume Advance for my Dizzy, keeping in mind
it's for a 1976 Fuel Injected bus which I plan to use as a daily driver
in a fairly hilly area ::gasps for breath:: and going up into the
mountains to camp with, AND I'm planning on putting in electronic
ignition, probably a petronix system, and keeping in mind that I have a
fairly low budget. ::pats himself on the back for making his longest
run-on sentence to date::  What kind of distributor do you all advise? 

P.s. I learned how to weld (MIG) yesterday, that's gonna make life soooo
much easier. :) Yay!

Chris
