This is because ole Willy, Henkels and Folke Wolf hadn't figured out
supercharging yet--
That's why they got spanked real bad by 
the P-51's, P-38's, and the Thunderbolts.

There was real poor maintenance or non back then--no parts, or personnel
to carry the work out--

Water injection would work well with an alcohol kicker in any Bus--

 

<<Water-injection was used successfully in the fuel system of German
WWII fighter aircraft. It allowed a short-term increase in power that
could mean life-or-death to a pilot in a dogfight. You want to remember
that those engines had a much more intense maintenance schedule than
what our german iron is usually treated to.>>
