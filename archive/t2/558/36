Jim,

Still here.  We're getting our bay back from the shop this week after
waiting 6 months due to low revenue.  Thank God for kind mechanics and a
friend who helped us to pay off the repair bill.

What's a "Dometic reefer knob"?  Hopefully not something used for smoking
pot...

We're hurting business-wise.  It might be some time before I can repro
anything.  Give me a description and/or pic and I'll let you know if I can
do them.
