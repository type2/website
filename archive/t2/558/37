Subject: water & alcohol injection...ah...I mean ingestion   :-)

In a recent thread someone mentioned something about water & alcohol
injection.  I think the only water & alcohol injection (or should that
be ingestion???? )  I'll be doing is while sitting around a campfire
at a VW bus campout.  I guess I better stock up for this coming
weekend's Westys In The Woods
