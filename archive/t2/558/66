Subject: RE: [T2] My Por 15 test

<<After all the debates that we have on this list about POR 15 and other
miracle fix products>>

I haven't been around long enough to see any of the debates on POR 15,
but I've been helping a friend restore his 71' Ford F250 pickup truck,
and we used POR 15 on the floor of the cab, in the rain ducts, in the
bed of the truck, etc, etc, and after a few days of curing, we pounded
into it with screwdrivers and couldn't get it to chip or even deeply
scratch! I'm no expert on rust, nor do I know how well it actually works
converting rust since we sandblasted everything, but for durability it's
GREAT! It seems to have really good coverage too!

Just my two cents,
Chris
