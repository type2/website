Subject: Shaking and Shuttering

I have a 76 Westy with a recently rebuilt '78 engine (top-end) and a problem 
that seems to never go away.  The clutch was checked when it was brought in 
for the rebuild.  Please help me!

The problem is intermittent, and seems to show up during long trips.  It 
started the first trip I took in it, and at that time would only happen on a 
partial tank of gas, and would go away when you would fill it up.  I used a 
gas cleaner product to possibly clean varnish out of the bottom of the tank 
and it seemed to go away for about a year.  Recently it has been getting 
worse.  Here is the description:

-van shakes (like I am pushing on the gas and releasing repeatedly very 
quickly)
-shaking stops if I let off the gas entirely
-shaking usually stops if I floor it
-happens in all gears
-sometimes the gas will get no response for a period of 1-2 sec.  If this 
happens the tach shows the RPMs go way up.
-It will often happen one day and dissappear entirely the next
-Last two times it started in high altitudes, (after a climb), but continued 
at lower altitudes
-Extremely jerky just after starting up in low speeds.

After all that when I was driving home from Yosemite yesterday the muffler 
became disconnected... What a day!

I am trying to prep for a 1.5 month trip this summer, but this problem would 
really put a damper on that -
