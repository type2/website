1) There is a tube off the FI manifold for the vacuum brake booster hose. I THINK there may be another one to suck fumes from the tin back into the air filter housing to be re-burned?
 
2)  There is a CHT sensor screwed into the head of #3 for the FI. Not required for carbs, but hang onto to it for future use.
 
3) The thing on the bell housing is an rpm sensor. I think it's there so the dealer can connect a tach for servicing. Not related to engine operation, you could remove it or leave it. You could also hook a tach up to it if you wanted.
