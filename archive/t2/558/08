It being the Water cooled Vanagon project....

ROTHFLMAO...  your *assuming* that they used an experienced engineer.... not a
"project" given to the apprentices at the time...

I can imagine the factory worker now,,, har har,, "They think they can get summer
students to design this huh!"

Supervisor says,, Oh sure,, the bus is simple anyone can work on it,, All they are
doing is adding the water cooled part,, and some cosmetic body changes,,,
I have confidence!
I'll prove to you that My smart apprentices can do this without any help!

when the supervisor was having second thoughts, up against a deadline ,scratching
his head looking at the prototype,, and the old factory production worker was
bugging him ...,  "Hah! You think that is going to work! This is what your
department can come up with? "  mubbling "engineers.... hahahah" shakin his head

You'll see,, the proof will be in the amount we sell.... start the production line!
Ship them out.

Ever see that kind of rivalry in a shop... between the trades and the techs and the
engineers.. and management constraints,, and marketing spending all the loot........

me neither!  hahahah

Hey,, isn't that the way software is sold,,, sell it, then debug it ....
