Subject: gas mileage

I filled up the bus this morning and it was nearly $30.  Now I'm not 
complaining about the price, but it did get me thinking about ways to 
improve my MPG in the bus.  I have already gone back to the stock carbs, 
which was a nice improvement in mileage over the Dellorto DRLA carbs I was 
running before.  I got 16mpg on the last tank and it was almost 100% city 
driving.  That's about 2mpg better than before.

Anyway, I was thinking about reducing the bore of my engine a bit.  This 
would have two benefits - cooler running and better mileage (maybe - I know 
there are a lot of variables).  Note that I want to reduce bore and not 
stroke.  In other words, I want to keep the 71mm (2-liter) crank and rods 
and use 90mm (1700) pistons and cylinders which would come out around 
1800cc.  The problem with this is that the stock 1700 pistons are too tall 
and will give me a negative deck height of about .0200".  I could either 
have some large spacers machined for under the cylinders, or get custom 
pistons.  I've heard people argue against such large spacers but the cost 
of the custom pistons might be prohibitive, if they are even 
available.  Has anyone used spacers that large?  Does anyone know of the 
availability of 90mm pistons that would work in this application?

Thanks,

-David
