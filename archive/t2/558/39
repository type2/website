Interesting.  I have a Pertronix and FI, and I see rock-solid 54 dwell.

Dave would have FI in his '78, too, right?  Seems odd to me that FI 
would be causing a dwell measurement error...?

Does your '66 have a vacuum advance distributor?  If not, then you 
probably do have different units (Pertronix has a model for 
centrifugal-only and a model for vacuum advance).  I dunno why the 
dwell angle would be different for the two, though.
