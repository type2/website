Anthony,

Shield from rust---???

Please elaborate on what this item is--

I'm interested--

Are you talking about the product by the name of Rust Shield?

If your going to elaborate on the merits POR stuff--forget I asked.

 
<<<Waxoyl...Or another product...The rust was under the existing under-
coating...The undercoating is still "very" solid and hard to chip away
now but what I'm afraid of is the good chance that it's now just a cover
for rust rather than a shield from rust...
