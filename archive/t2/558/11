Done it--it works--

And if you want some more go--tain--
and cooling run some alcohol in the bottle with the water--

It's not very elaborate Wil--it's pretty simple--

All you need is an open vacuum port to use--a older GM water bottle with
the snap off lid--and the bracket to mount it--

You can use vacuum line too--the fish tank line gets hard with heat--

An air stone is what you need for a tank "clunk" to keep the hose on the
botom of the tank--no filter needed--the engine will eat all OK--

I used this setup on 389, 421, 428, 455 Pontiacs all the time--it worked
well--

It occurs to me that this is a much more elaborate idea than a
watercooled engine with the waterjacket incorporated. 
Another thought might be something like a mechanic I knew once did with
his Triumph TR-7, way back when, to increase fuel economy. 
He mounted a bottle under the hood and ran a piece of tubing to a vacuum
port on his carborator. He used an aquarium like tubing valve to control
the flow. He put water with a bit of alcohol in it (alcohol keeps things
clean). He varied the amount the valve was opened. Of course, you need
to add more water mixture when you fill your tank. 
The water minimized ping and without ping the engine ran cooler, with a
bit more hp and better mpg. I imagine it would help reduce engine
deposits too. Even if you don't hear ping you may have some
pre-ignition. 
I can think of a few places I might route a similar water injection into
my 2.0 L fi and may try it to see if it improves things any. 
(BTW, put an aquarium airator stone (not sure if that will work) or some
other filtration method on 
the end of the tubing in the bottle to keep crud from getting in the
line.)
