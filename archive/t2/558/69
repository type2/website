Subject: DOOR WINDOW REGULATOR 

Hello to you all...

Did anyone already have a problem with the "DOOR WINDOW REGULATOR"
(VWC-211-837-501)? When the crank turns, it's possible to fill that something
inside is loose.....did anyone try to fix it, or do i need to get e new one?

Thanks....
Best regards from Portugal
