A body Shutz gun with a wax based product blowing through it--

This will put the bag on tip of any exposed surface.

My 74 still has copious amouts of some wax on the bottom --and this was
from the factory--

I think the stuff works--

Anybody got an easy solution to preserving the rockers in their Bus...My
driver's side rocker had a bit in the front but the ice pick test
reveals solid metal on the outside surfaces...I've blown a lot of rust
convertor into the rocker ('til it was dripping out the weep holes and
seams but still...Any off the shelf gadgets to en- sure that the
interior of the rocker is sealed against rust...A four foot wand to
shoot (what ?) into the rocker... ?? 
What have others done that they've been satisfied with over time...?-)
