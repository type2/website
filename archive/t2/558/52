Subject: '79 windshield instalation question

My wife and I got the new windshield seal installed last night.
But it does not seam to be "centered" the "lip" of the seal is in the
correct position all the way around on the inside and out. My question:

Will the windshield "seat" itself?????
Is it safe to drive???

Thanx
MikeL
