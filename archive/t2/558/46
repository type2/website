Hi Chris,
      You're in for a treat with the shifting. Reverse is all the way 
over on the left hand side and down--where it belongs (;
      First is far upper left
      Second is down and a little bit of an angle to the right
      Third is all the way over to the right, up and to the left a little
      Fourth is all the way over to the right, and then down and to the 
right a little
      To get into reverse, first go into neutral, and then literally 
push down on the gearshift. It will go down about 3/8ths of an inch, and 
then go all the way over to the left and down.

      Your bus needs a vacuum advance dissy to run correctly.

      All valves are adjusted to .006" with the engine dead cold. This 
is assuming somebody hasn't installed hydraulics. I'm not sure how to 
describe figuring out if you have hydraulics or solids short of removing 
a pushrod tube and looking at the top of the lifter. Perhaps just check 
and see if your vavles already have a little lash in them. If they are 
hydraulics, there should be none. Anybody else want to chime in here?

-John
