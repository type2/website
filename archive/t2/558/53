no I'm not saying that the points replacement is causing a change in
timing. What I am suggesting is that the "measured" dwell might be put
off a bit by the FI system. Remember the fi gets it's fire signal off
the coil as well. If there were any residual at all it might throw it
off. The pertronix isn't like a normal point system, besides it's only
a theory. I didn't realize that Dave's bus was FI, if so this
definately throws a bone in that theory. :)

Oh the 2 units I have are both the vacuum units, so unless there are
any manufacturing varibles they should be the same.
