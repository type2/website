Subject: 78 FI to *&^% Weber progressive

For those keeping track.  I still want to put FI in my 73, but until I find
the rest of the FI system, it will have to wait.

So, in the mean time I have a 78 FI motor that I just removed most of the FI
parts from.

I have 3 questions, all from the perspective of looking from the engine
hatch..
1) on the left side of engine, just to the left and behind the coil.  There
was a hose coming off a metal tube.  On my original 73 engine this was
siliconed off.  Does it need to be?  As of now I just removed the hose.

2)  On the 3/4 head, on the 4 side, there is a switched wire coming off the
head.  What should I do with it?

3)  On the right side of engine where engine mounts to tranny, there is a
switch that appears to go into the bell housing.  What is this for? And what
should I do about it?

Please keep in mind I still want to be able to switch it back to FI one day.

Thanks in advance,
Snoopy
