Subject: The continuing saga...

Well, the fuel pump's pumping (whew!) and the lines and fittings are all 
brand new. I'm more than a little torqued at the shop that replaced the 
lines and fittings. They didn't put in a fuel filter! If it didn't have one 
to begin with, they should have asked me if I wanted them to put one in. 
Grrrr.... I've got a crappy 99c plastic one that I was going to swap in for 
a test filter, but I refuse to use it as a permanent one. Off to AutoZoned 
for a glass one with a replaceable element.

In the meantime, I tested the fuel lines at both carbs (this way also tests 
the T fitting). No way to tell how much pressure it's getting, but fuel 
squirts out when cranking the engine. And the fact that when I attempt to 
start the bus, I *have* to pump the gas tells me there's at least some fuel 
in the bowls.

I'm wondering though. If it runs for a second or so after pumping the gas 
and then dies, if one of the 3 (WTF is up with 3 of the friggin things?!?!) 
cutoff solenoids is stuck.

I replaced all the wiring to the solenoids and chokes from the coil (it was 
pretty ratty anyway) with new connectors hoping that would do it.

Nope.

Looks like I'm pulling the solenoids and the enrichment valve. If I apply 
battery to the wire I made I can hear clicks, but I'm having trouble telling 
between them.

Wish me luck!
