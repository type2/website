Subject: My Por 15 test

After all the debates that we have on this list about POR 15 and other miracle
fix products, I thought I would try to do a long term test. I was planning on
painting my rims anyway and I had some of the por 15 paint at the house. So I
thought I would put it to the test. Here is what I have already done and what
else I plan to do.

This is what I have done:
1. removed tires from rims.
2. Sand blaster the rims inside and out.
3. coated the entire outside and edge of the rim with POR 15 black.

This is what I still need to do.

1. paint the outside of the rim with the POR Tye coat primer, then use the
"chrome" spray paint to get an as close to factory color as I can.
2. Paint the inside of each rim with a different type of paint. One will have
por 15 black, regular primer and the silver paint. One will have POR 15 clear
(new) and tye coat primer and paint. One will have por 15 black and nothing
else. One will have just primer and paint and no POR 15.

I know this will take awhile, but at least I will have some idea of how well
this stuff really works. I have used some of their other products and really
like them. The "Pelucid" is great stuff for wood. I used it on my end tables
and it really worked great and held up great.

If I have any POR 15 left, I am going to put some on the tools that I use
around the house (shovel, rack, etc) to see how it holds up to chipping.

I plan to put pics up on my website detailing this process. We will see what
happens.
