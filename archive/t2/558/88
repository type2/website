Subject: Repairing Heat Exchangers?

Hi all,

Well, I've almost got my '73, dual-carb, 1700 (apparently bored to 1800) 
together...started off with under 30 lbs. compression; now have 145 to 150 
lbs.

Now to the heater boxes. Unfortunately, the outer shell is rusted away quite a 
bit, especially around the exhaust manifolds, and the control flaps are 
almost completely gone. Is there any way to repair the shells? I thought I 
read about some kind of stuff (like fiberglass, only high-heat) that you 
could spread around the holes to plug them? What about something like liquid 
steel?

I'm looking for a low-cost patch to hold till I can afford to get new ones...
