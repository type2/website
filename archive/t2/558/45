Subject: A couple more newb questions. :) 

Ok, I can't find directions on Valve Adjustments for my 76' 2.0L. Do
they use Hydralic lifters or whatnot so they don't need adjusting? 

Secondly, I'm having to buy a Dizzy since my bus didn't come with one. I
figure I'll get one of those .009's. But does my '76 take a Vacume
advance, or a Centrifugal advance? (sorry for the horrid spelling) Or
does a guy simply choose one or the other? 

And lastly, here's the REALLY newb one. What order do the gears on the
tranny go? Is it the way I'm used to or is it all different? The way I'm
used to is 1st gear being all the way left and up, second gear being
straight down from first, third gear being all the way up, and in the
middle, fourth being straight down from third, and reverse being all the
way to the right and down. And a 76 bus only has the four speeds right? 

Kk, thanks for any input in advance,
Kris und der vunderhund Ubu! :)
