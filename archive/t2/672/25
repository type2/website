Thanks for that link Scott. After so many years of working on Type IV
engined buses, I've never seen one, and was always bothered by the
amount of weight studs mounted in aluminum heads were supposed to
take, especially when you consider the amount the weight is amplified
by road shocks. I'm going to have to go out and inspect all my buses
to see if I can see exactly where they mount, and if any of my buses
have them.

 This part is very often missing on exhaust systems. It attaches to the lower
 part of the fan shroud and to one of the heat exchanger flanges, on the
 driver's side.
