I deal with CIP exclusivley because they ship free after 50 dollar order. I
have ALWAYS had good service, and that is after dealing with them since they
were a little bo-dunk outfit in New Westminster ( a suburb City of
Vancouver). That had to be 30 years ago!!

Watch out for

Cip. I have heard bad customer service stories with them.

 

Cheers,
