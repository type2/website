I realize the budget planners have done the math -- but I'm still trying to
get straight in my head how salt comes out cheaper than sand in any state
(except maybe Utah <grin>). 

It doesn't have to be used often down here but Texas tend to use coarse
crushed limestone. Ie. "big sand". Smaller than gravel but bigger chunks
that one normally considers "sand".
