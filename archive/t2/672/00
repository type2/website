Mark,

A while back I came across a website that had info on using old gasoline. As 
I recall they recommended mixing with fresh gasoline and also adding 
something - alcohol? Maybe a Google would turn something up.

.....How does one dispose of two-year old gasoline (to empty the
> tank, which may have several gallons in it)?
