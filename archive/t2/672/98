In Northern Arizona The state uses some kind of salt/volcanic cinder mix.
They say they don't use sodium cloride though, I think it's magnesium cloride.
The salt they use is not supposed to be as corrosive as NaCl. I still avoid
driving my buses in it if I can help it. There are lots of window repair
shops in Flagstaff becouse of the cinders.
