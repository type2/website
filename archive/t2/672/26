I bought one of those a couple of years ago.  I drove about fifteen miles
before it crapped out -- and yes, it was installed right.  After that I briefly
went back to points, then switched over to the OE hall-effect Vanagon
distributors. 

My advice would be to keep saving up and get a Compufire or Pertronix. 
They seem to last longer...
