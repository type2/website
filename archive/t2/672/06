GL4.

People at shops will tell you that GL5 replaces GL4, but you should not 
use GL5 because it will corrode parts in your tranny.  I believe NAPA 
still stocks GL4.

I believe you want SAE 90 weight.

Otherwise, no big surprises. After filling, take it for a test drive, then 
recheck level and top off as appropriate.
