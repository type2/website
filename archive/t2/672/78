Subject: Re: [T2] Accufire Ignition

I`m the guy who responded that I've been using an 009
with Accufire for about 4 years with only 1 hiccup,
and that being an installation boo-boo.
    
On my emergency parts shelf is a brand new 009 with
AccuFire installed.  Cap, Rotor, but no wires.  We did
put it into the bus for testing purposes, and the bus
ran well with it.  Then the 009 with known operational
AccuFire was returned to its box and put onto the
shelf as an emergency spare.
   
For me, having the second AccuFire was not enough
without without a second Dizzy, and both successfully
tested as a unit.
  
[I acknowledge the 009 is not the correct distributor
for my `78 2 liter.  Having been a member of this list
for only a month, has taught me the need for a vacuum
advance type distributor.  I will have the opportunity
to take my VW mechanic to task in February over that
issue, during tune-up and minor repairs.  Also, Bosch
formally discontinued the 009 this last summer.  Well,
just in time for me, I guess!]
     
The general negativity from T2 list members over the
AccuFire brand of Electronic Ignition, is enough to
get me to jump ship.  But instead of converting to the
USA built Compu-fire unit, which looks similar to the
AccuFire unit, I think I will instead convert to
Pertronics; the one which uses the Flamethrower 2
coil.  My bus and piece-of-mind is worth the added
cost.
     
Merry Christmas all!
