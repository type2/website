Subject: Which Dist should I be using?

1978 2.0 Liter Federal, Vin 228-2122-560 with Engine
GE 030924.  When I got the vehicle, it was in very
poor condition.  It's distributor did not have a
vacuum advance upon arrival.  And I'm running an 009,
which I (learned very recently) is wrong.   Bentley
Section 5 Page 75 is most detailed in Centrifugal
timing and Vacuum timing for 15 different
distributors.  Great.  But which of the 15 distributor
part numbers referenced was correct for my
engine/year?  I am also aware of the recent list
banter about using a Vanagon hall-effect distributor.
   
Book-wise, I have a Green Bentley, and a worthless
Haynes.  I presume the answer to my question above is
in a book I should have, but don't.
    
Clueless in Portland on Christmas eve, awaiting
arrival of family who are snowed-in & grounded
elsewhere...
