David,

I've had nothing but *good* customer service from them.  Example:

Had a 2 week old turn signal switch fail on me...e-mailed them and got and
answer back in less than 1 hour...the only question back was "where do you 
want us to send you a new one?"

They didn't even want me to ship the old one back.

Cheers, dave
