Well, a short google turned up:

http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/maintenance/salt.htm

Their cost consideration is not sand vs. salt but sodium chloride vs.
other salts.  They mention magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, and
calcium magnesium acetate; they do *not* mention any nitrates which are
much less corrosive than chlorine compounds, albeit with more significant
environmental impact (too much fertilizer may not be a good thing).

As they say in that page, any ionic compound (ice/snow melter) is going to
have some corrosive effect.  Sand is not ionic and does not melt snow
(other than by darkening the snow so that it picks up more solar energy),
it is strictly a traction improver.  It also gets kicked off the road
rather quickly and needs to be re-applied more frequently.

Reading between the lines of the article, it looks like the problem was
with the non-sodium chloride deicers and sheet and cast aluminum.  The
cost diferences are mentioned, but there is no mention of the corrosion
problem with salt and steel and I would bet that there are significant
differences that are being glossed over.  Their implied solution is to buy
a newer car, with more plastic, fiberglass, or stainless steel parts...
I'm thinking that a Trabant would fit this description :-)

OOK!
