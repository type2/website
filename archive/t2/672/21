Subject: RE: [T2] Anyone using 195/70/15's?

Continental Vanco 195/70/15's have an overall diameter of 25.7". This
measurement varies from tire to tire. I'll let you figure out the rest... I
don't have a 15" rim to look at. Since the tire and rim overlap, sidewall
height depends on where you take your measurements. 5.35" would be a good
starting point.
