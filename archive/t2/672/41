That is typical. For whatever reason, this part seldom present on the bus,
even though it is very important.

It mounts between one of the lower fan shroud screws (an 8mm one) and the
upper screw on the heat exchanger outlet flange. Installation is slightly
different for 72-74, 79 and 75-78. Basically, the exhaust is supported on
the right side by the slotted alternator bracket and on the left side by
this part. If it is missing, the head studs on the left side will be
carrying too much weight, especially since the whole
muffler/crossover/whathaveyou wants to pivot about the head studs without
this connection point. You can see this part out in the lower right of this
photo of a 72-74 exhaust setup:

It's been a while since I've seen this part on a 75-78 bus, maybe someone
has a good photo of it installed?
