Subject: Remanufactured disk brake calipers

I notice that some of the remanufactured calipers for the 1971 model 
year have two bleeders while others have only one (on the bottom). My 
originals had two bleeders. Would there be any particular disadvantage 
in having only one bleeder  versus the original two bleeder setup?

Sincere Thanks and Happy Holidays,
