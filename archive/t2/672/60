I queried AVP about this and got this response:  "I talked at length this
morning to Mr. Atwell. I explained that the bulletin we received over 6
years ago fron VW said that the thrust washers only need to be on Hydraulic,
so we no longer put them on solid lifter engines. I explained if he wanted
to add them we'd be happy to send some out (at no charge)."
