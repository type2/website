Hello Guys   Being a owner of 3 Porsches        a 65 356C euro coupe,  a 66 
912 coupe, and a 73  914 2.0L    My fav is the 356C because it is one of the 
prettiest cars ever made and a blast to drive, but for true fun the 914 is the 
winner  that car will flat out handle  . The 912 is like the 356 in running 
just not near as nice to look at but still a very fun car to drive.  Now the 914 
is harder to work on than either the 356 or 912 and the best thing I did to 
the 914 was to install the crane XR700 ingnition .    later and have fun  Mark
