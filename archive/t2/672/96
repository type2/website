problem with salt and steel and I would bet that there are significant
differences that are being glossed over.  Their implied solution is to buy
a newer car, with more plastic, fiberglass, or stainless steel parts...

spraying device in his driveway that sprays ordinary water up
to clean off the underside of his Volvo...It's the salt and water
that does the steel in, not clean water... :-(
