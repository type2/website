Subject: Re: [VB] ACCUFIRE electronic ignition 

The only experience I had was hooking up a wire to the wrong side and 
toasting the module.A $50 or $100 bill buys lots of toilet paper but very little 
qaulity electronics. Pertronix/Accufire cardboard isnt very absorbant. Stick with 
stock. Your butt will thank you.
