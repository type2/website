Subject: Re: [T2] ACCUFIRE electronic ignition 

its a compufire knock-off.  I have compufire and high out-put coil.  
Never ever had any problems with ignition system.  i recommend and save 
for compufire.  I have no experience with Pertonix.   Watch out for 
Cip.  I have heard bad customer service stories with them.

Cheers,
David
