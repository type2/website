Subject: Re: [T2] transaxle oil

Hi,

Quoting Bently here:

"The viscosity of transmission oil is also designated by SAE numbers.
Use SAE 80W or SAE 80W/90 for general year round service in the manual
transmission. Always use SAE 90 hypoid oil in the final drive of the
automatic transmission. ATF is not graded for viscosity and requires
no seasonal change when used in the automatic transmission. However,
in arctic areas where temperatures remain constantly below -25 deg C
(-13 deg F), you can also use ATF in place of hypoid oil in the manual
transmission. The ATF should be replaced promptly with hypoid oil if
summer temperatures exceed -25 deg C (-13 deg F)."
