Note the ratios the others were discussing in their messages. 1:10 or 2:10.
They weren't talking about adding good gas to a tank that's had bad gas
sitting in it a year or two. They're talking about old gas that is pourable
and not the thickened varnish at the "bottom of the barrel".

Once the old gas is mixed in with new (of any octane) it will stop
thickening (or slow so much it's negligible) because that mostly happens
due to evaporation of the most volatile components of the fuel. 

If added to your 10 or 15 gallon fuel tank 1 gallon at each fill up you
shouldn't notice it at all. 

If there's fuel that's been sitting a few years it need to be poured off
and the tank pulled and cleaned because there WILL be a gummy varnish in
there. But the fuel that pours easily from the tank can be re-burned mixed
with fresh.
