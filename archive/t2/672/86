Must be why we have so many nice Buses out here in Washington!

BUT....

http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/maintenance/salt.htm

In the state of Washington, they've started using salt again as of winter
2002-2003, for the first time since the 1980s.  The main reason is cost.
I-695, a voter initiative, changed vehicle licensing fees from a 
percentage of value to a flat $30/year.  Of course, this slashed the 
licensing fee for new-car drivers to pennies on the dollar, but actually 
raised the price for old vehicles, including all aircooled VWs.  The state
transportation budget has been a mess ever since, so now we get salt.
