Pertronix has it's own set of issues. I couldn't escape the quality control
when the kit included a screw with no threads. Shops were closed on the day
I decided to rip out the points but luckily the house I was staying at had a
M4 metric die in the toolbox.

After I fixed that installation hangup I never looked back. I just can't see
a reason to mess with points.
