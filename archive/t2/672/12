Richard,

It's one of those things, you know? The engine will surely work without the
thrust washers, but they are there for a reason. The assembly is just not
correct with the springs bearing straight onto the rocker arm. They help
with oiling and help keep the side of the rocker arm from wearing. You know
and I know that if YOU rebuilt the heads, the washers would be there...
