I think it is better to remove the wires from the plastic connector on the
sender so you can run them through a small (>1/8") hole in the grommet. Then
put them back in the connector. Make sure they are in the right way or the
gauge will not work.

Ideally, your grommet will be about 1" in diameter. A step drill is very
handy to make the hole in the tin, I put mine on the crown of the top
cylinder cover plate. Here is a photo:

I think I got the grommet from a car at a wrecker. You want one that is
large with a small hole, or even better, no hole, then you make a tiny hole
just big enough for the wires to pass through.
