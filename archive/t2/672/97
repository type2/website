Yeah, and Volvo gave him a new car too. What's funny is on the Volvo
boards he used to gripe about the Ford-built Volvos. LoL!  ;-)

In Big Bear, CA, they would put pumice down. Purely traction. But it
worked pretty well as long as it was regularly applied.

Of course, it's easier for 2 small cities than an entire state to deal
with reapplying...
