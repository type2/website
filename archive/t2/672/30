Subject: Getting rid of old gasoline?

A few members have suggested burning old gas diluted in new fuel in a vehicle.
My experience is that this is a very BAD idea. I tried this using my 83 Dodge
as the proud recipient of the old gas and just got it out of the shop after a
very expensive carburetor rebuild. It's not just a matter of flammability
being balanced by adding some 93 octane. The old gas actually changes
consistency and gums things up.

Others seem to have had success with this approach and depending on the age of
the gas you may be able to get by with no problems. However, I think this is
one of those situations where the risk outweighs the reward. IMO you are
asking for trouble by willingly putting contaminants in a good vehicle. I (and
my bank account) wish I had not done it.
