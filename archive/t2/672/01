Subject: transaxle oil

Hello List,

From sunny SoCal.

I'm going to change the oil in my transaxle.  Reading
from the original Muir book it doesn't seem to be that
big of a deal, but I wanted to get some first hand
knowledge from any of you out there.  Any surprises,
what type of oil should I use ?

thx & happy holidays,

rudy
