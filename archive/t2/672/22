However, one must observe that we are not looking at anything even 
remotely connected to Porsche AG.  If you want to know what the factory 
thought of the 914, pick up a copy of Paul Frere's "The Racing 
Porsches." There on page 155 you will find a photo of Porsche's racing 
stable.  And there with the 917, 917 PA, 908/02, 908 long-tail, etc, 
you'll find the "lowly" 914. Positioned ahead of the 911s.

That the Porsche-ista don't acknowledge it just means that they STILL 
don't get it. A well setup 914/4 will run competitively with a 
similarly prepped 911 at about a third the investment. The 50/50 weight 
distribution makes a world of difference.

But it's still a lousy motor for a bus. No bottom end torque.

The first lemming to lead his peers off the cliff is a bold and 
decisive leader.
