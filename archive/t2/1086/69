Subject: re: Gas tank re-design

What I am interested in is lowering the rear shelf and getting more sit-up headroom in the bed. I have plenty of engine room, but the gas tank has to go somewhere else. I may just have a long 6" or 8" diameter tube welded up to create a gas tank that would run under the middle of the bus. Wouldn't be tough to mount or protect. Filler tube would be a bit long though - probably a gallon in the fill tube alone! Venting will be a challenge as the vent needs to be roll-over protected. Guess I should look at what the stockers had with those little pod-looking devices up in the corner air vents - are those some kind of valves for roll-over protection?
 With rectangular tubing, a piece roughly 4" X 6.5" will hold a gallon for every 9" of length. Baffles would be necessary. 8ft section holds 10.5 gallons. What d'ya think of that idea? Relieves another compartment for interior storage, too! (Or it may allow me to re-engineer the intake on the Subey!)
