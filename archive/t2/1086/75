Yes that would work. We built several for hot rods from sheet metal and 
the baffles were simply vertical divider panels with a cut near the top 
and the bottom.  I would want to use screw together hose connections 
instead of hose clamps on the OEM version. You could extend the filler 
neck all the way down to the new location I think.

How much would reworking the rear floor affect the bus structurally?  
Have not given that any consideration yet. The old gas tank location 
could become a hidden lock box for your valuables while travelling or 
parking in questionable places. Access it from the top via a grafted in 
another engine hatch with locks added?

I like getting the fuel tank down lower for center of gravity purposes.
