Subject: Re: [T2] Bus on sand

Also of utmost importance is a bicycle tire pump.  If you're stuck in  
the sand you can deflate your tires, drive out, then jack up the car  
and inflate the tire right back to where it should be.  It is  
important to have the jack for this part; filling a tire while the bus  
is bearing on it is super difficult with a small pump.
