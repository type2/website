Subject: Re: [T2] Brakes and fluid

At one time I got the idea to "upgrade" my BMW motorcycle from DOT3 to 
DOT5.  I carefully flushed the system and installed the DOT5 stuff.

100 miles later the brake lever was stiffening up and after 150 miles the 
brakes were unusable.  The DOT5 fluid had caused the seals to swell.

It took a complete disassembly of both master cylnders and all three wheel 
cylinders to put things right.

I learned my lesson.  Use the specified fluid!
