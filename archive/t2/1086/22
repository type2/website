Mike,

My reasoning is based on what I have seen on my wideband AFR meter with 
a properly running, late model computer-controlled fuel injected engine. 
  Granted, it is not a VW engine and perhaps the same does not apply to 
a low-compression aircooled engine but I suspect that it does.

Because of this I recommended no leaner than 14-to-1 (NOT 14.7:1) under 
moderate to heavy throttle with leaner mixtures being acceptable at 
light loads where overheating is not an issue.  In retrospect I probably 
should have said 13.5 rather than 14.

This is from Wikipedia, note the all-caps section:

"A stoichiometric mixture unfortunately burns very hot and can damage 
engine components if the engine is placed under high load at this fuel 
air mixture. Due to the high temperatures at this mixture, detonation of 
the fuel air mix shortly after maximum cylinder pressure is possible 
under high load (referred to as knocking or pinging). Detonation can 
cause serious engine damage as the uncontrolled burning of the fuel air 
mix can create very high pressures in the cylinder. AS A CONSEQUENCE 
STOICHIOMETRIC MIXTURES ARE ONLY USED UNDER LIGHT LOAD CONDITIONS, A 
RICHER MIXTURE (LOWER AIR-FUEL RATIO) IS USED TO PRODUCE COOLER 
COMBUSTION PRODUCTS and thereby prevent detonation and overheating of 
the cylinder head."

In another paragraph, it says:

"Lean mixtures produce hotter combustion gases than does a 
stoichiometric mixture"

So conventional wisdom states that rich is coolest, stoich is hot and 
lean is hotter.

If you disagree, please explain your reasoning.

Thanks,
	-David
