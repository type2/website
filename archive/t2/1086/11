Subject: Metric Bolt Sizes (was Re: [T2] Nut Size)

I'm guessing its an M10x1.5 or M12x1.5.

2 weeks ago I wouldn't have had the foggiest clue, but I've finally
learned how to identify these things. 

To determine it yourself, measure the diamater of the stud/bolt, then 
measure the number of threads per a given length (I usually take
an average).  

In this case, because it's a metric bolt, you're meauring in millimeters.

If the bolt (threaded portion) diameter is 10 mm, it's an M10 bolt.  8mm
diameter, likewise, is M8.

Then count the number of threads per millimeter.  If there is 1 thread
per mm, it's 1.0.  Two, then 2.0.  One and a half, then 1.5.  You
get the picture.

1.5 thread pitch is fairly coarse and probably what you're looking for.
It's not a 1.0 (i know that much) and I'm almost certain it's not a 
1.25.

I'm thinking it's an M10x1.5 (I know it's not an M8), but there's some
chance it could be an M12...

HTH,
