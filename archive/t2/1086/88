While you are in there, check the idle fuel cutoff solenoid for fit
and function. Mine (70 Riviera w/ 1600 DP) suddenly got to dying at
red lights and I thought the idle had somehow crept down. I got advice
to check the solenoid and that seems to have been the culprit.

Its on the left side of the carb, below the idle mixture screws, and
it has a wire that goes from it to the coil on one end and to the
choke heater on the other. Turn the ignition on but do not start the
engine, and then wiggle the wire at the solenoid, pull it off and make
momentary contact with it. If you don't hear the solenoid click every
time you make contact, it is shot. I saw the usual online suppliers
had them, possibly the FLAPS too if you are lucky. While there, make
sure the thing is screwed into the carb body snugly, mine was not, and
there would be an air leak from that as well as no fuel if the
solenoid managed to break ground contact.

Hope it helps...
