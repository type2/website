You should not be running rich with that jetting.  I suspect something 
else is wrong.

I would also like to know what "way too rich" is.  At highway speeds in 
a bus you should be well into the throttle and I would think you would 
want an AFR no leaner than 14 to 1 under those conditions.  I think you 
only want the very lean AFR that they talk about on theSamba (16-18) on 
decel and extremely light throttle (such as maintaining 40mph on a 
country road).

The idle jet has a negligable effect at highway speeds so I would ignore 
that.  You can either increase the air correction jet (to say, 170) or 
decrease the main jet (to say, 130) or both.  Let the wideband be your 
guide.  Under heavy throttle, what is the difference in AFR at low vs. 
high RPMs?  If it is only too rich at higher RPMs then increase only the 
air correction jet.  If it's only too rich at lower RPMs then decrease 
only the main jet.  If the AFR is the same across the RPM range then 
change them both.
