Subject: Front axle nut

Hello

Are new front axle nuts available for 72 up bay window busses? You know the
one that you adjust the wheel bearings with that has the 6mm hex?  I got one
that is pretty messed up.

The bug ones I have are too small, are bus ones on any other vehicles that you
know of?

Thanks
