Ok, finally got around to taking the firewall off.  The tank does have  
a vent on the driver and passenger side.  I blew into both of them and  
they are free and clear.
Those two vents connect to rails that lead to the intake vents on  
either side of the bus, as designed.  When I blow into those, it's  
much harder to get any air out.
Is this what's causing orssure in the tank?  Should those rails  
leading to the  air intakes be as free and open as the vent probes  
coming out of the tank itself?

Peace, Troy
