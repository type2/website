Subject: Re: [T2] Another nutty idea... Fuel tank redesign...

I think that, short of a racing fuel cell with bladder, the safest tanks 
out there are the plastic ones.  Having used fuel cans of various 
materials I have found the plastic cans to be the toughest available. 
I've seen them come off of trailers at highway speeds and survive without 
leakage.  A metal can would burst its seams in the same situation.

There is also the issue of rust.  Plastic doesn't.  The only thing that 
damages plastic is high heat and sunlight so if you keep your tank away 
from both it will last just about forever.

I wonder if one of the plastic marine fuel tanks would fit the fuel tank 
area of a bus?  They come in a lot of configurations.
