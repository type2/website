Many folks, myself included, like the Pic 30/31.

The Pic 34 is much more finicky.  Still, you should be able to get an idle 
from it.

If you are not familiar with how that is done this is a link to a pretty 
good description.

The important thing is to identify the Bypass Screw and the Volume Control 
Screw correctly.

They are both brass screws to the left side of the carb as you are looking 
from outside. The Volume Control Screw is smaller and lower.  The Bypass 
Screw Larger and above.

Cheers,

John
