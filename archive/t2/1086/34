Subject: Fans and automotive un-insulated wire connectors

Hi All,

 

I was looking for automotive wiring connectors at Grainger.com and ran
across these fans. They look pretty good and are not too expensive!

 

BTW. Is there a source for un-insulated wire connectors?

 

Thanks again for the info.

 

Bob
