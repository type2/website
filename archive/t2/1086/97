Thanks for sharing the VW Resource Article. I had not seen the site
before and spent some time following the link to other articles.

I had two vehicles which had the 34PICT carb. One was a Westy and the
other was a Thing. Neither would idle. I probably followed the
Chilton's carb adjust procedure, and being many years ago, I don't
remember if it was the same as the VW Resource article. Perhaps if I
had the article back then I might have had better luck with the carbs.

When I sold the Thing, the buyer was a retired VoA service tech. He
told me that the 34PICT was a seriously flawed carburetor, and that
VoA issued many tech bulletins on modifying the carb to get it to run
right, involving things like drilling new passages in the body, etc,
such that he did not feel that the carb was worth messing with.

He later wrote me back and said that after installing a 32PICT carb
the Thing ran great. He said anything from 28PICT to 32PICT was a good
choice.

 The Pic 34 is much more finicky.  Still, you should be able to get an idle
 from it.
