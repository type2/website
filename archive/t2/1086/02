Hi all,

After my latest top end rebuild (78 2.0l, standard dual solex carbs) I'm
still struggling with high cylinder head temperatures (affirmed with a
DakotaDigital CHT gauge). Dizzy is rebuild, timing is spot on, checked
the centrifugal as well as vacuum advance, everything's good. Flaps are
open completely. Carbs are rebuild also, adjusted according to Bentley.
Since I got a manual transmission, I use 132.5 main jets, 160 air
correction and 52.5 for idle. This is according to the specs found on:

So finally, I installed a wideband lambda sensor into a collector-style
exhaust to check the AFR. I'm running way too rich at cruising speeds
which could be the reason for this high head temps (BTW: here's the
samba thread about running lean/rich and the effect on head temps
http://tinyurl.com/lxb6hk).

So my question is, how do I rejet the carbs so the engine runs leaner?
Should I only change the main jet to a smaller one or should I also put
in a larger air correction jet? Does the idle jet has any effect when
driving at highway speeds? Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!
Cheers,
Timo
