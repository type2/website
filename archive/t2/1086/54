Between 12.5 and 14 when cruising at 65 mph (depends on load/uphill
etc.).

No, I wanted to take some more exact measurements and also record RPM,
oil temp, CHT and ambient temperature as well (I don't have any data
logging available so I'll be just recording the gauges with a camcorder
and write the results down afterwards).
Since I'm away at a conference right now I won't be able to post more
exact results before the weekend.
Thanks to all of you for the input!
Cheers, Timo
