I may just have a long 6" or 8" diameter tube welded up to create a gas tank that would run under the middle of the bus. Wouldn't be tough to mount or protect. Filler tube would be a bit long though - probably a gallon in the fill tube alone! Venting will be a challenge as the vent needs to be roll-over protected. Guess I should look at what the stockers had with those little pod-looking devices up in the corner air vents - are those some kind of valves for roll-over protection?

not sure how tall the Suburu engine is but the gas tank compartment is
only 14inches deep so you would not get much extra space for sit up,
the engine comp is still the same height as the gas tank compartment.
