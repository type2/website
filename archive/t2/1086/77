Hey all...


Hate to be the naysayer, but something's been bugging me about the 8" tube running the length of the bus...

You
have a 8 foot tube 8" in diameter (and of course, your non-double
walled tube-tank is right down there with the rocks and hazards, not
tucked into its corner of the engine bay), but it just hit me - having
driven tankers at one time, when you're down to, say, 3/4 of a tank (or
tube), you hit the brakes, and how ever many more gallons of gasoline
will come rushing towards the front of the bus.  Now I know at 8" i.d. every
foot is about 2.5 gallons, so you have an instant forward motion (or
more correctly in engineering terms, "moment") of...  15x7.5...  112.5
lbs of fuel (at 3/4 tank) from however fast you were going to stop, the
fuel then sloshes at a -50 MPH to the front of the tube, shoving your
bus forward and defeating your brakes.  Sure, it's not 3,000 gallons -
but it will affect your stopping.

And adding baffles in a length that long may be problematic...  then you have to get it so it drains (or feeds) right, esp. on long uphill (or downhill) runs...  

Plus,
getting back to the whole protection gig - you'd need a tunnel to mount
your tube tank, else it would be hanging 8" under the bus...  even the
little propane tank on the side has a shield to protect it's beefy self.  A tube thick enough would weigh a bit as well...

Actually, I thought this idea up a while ago for a set of PVC tubes on top of my poptop to fab a hot water shower,
and decided that having that much weight sloshing around (never mind it
would be on top of the bus, with all the inherent things that would
cause) wasn't worth it.  

My opinion???  If you want more headroom, go with a tall-top bus.  ;)

(There's an idea - a tall top with a westy poptop on top.  Hmmm...)
