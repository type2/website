I would have thought so too but I have a friend who used to crash test
those pickups in the 50s. Said that in a hard rear-ender the cargo bed
would be pushed forward into the rear of the cab possibly collapsing the
tank, squeezing open the top seam and causing the gasoline out of the
tank. He said they saw that under the right circumstances the gasoline
could squirt upward through that broken seam, hit the ceiling and then
come down on the occupants and possibly a sparking dash. Instant
apocalypse. Sort of soured me on my '49 3100 Chevy. On a street rod my
father built we put a new plastic tank under the bed at the rear of the
truck. Eventually I sold the truck when we were trying to buy our
current house.
