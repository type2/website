Take waffle block levelers- I carry at least a dozen of these, and once 
helped a vanagon at Cape Henlopen SP get out of deep sand by laying a 
row of these in front of the tire.

  Has anyone had experience driving their bus on the beach? Headed to 
ocean camping this weekend and there is an area where trucks can be on 
the beach. They have air lines for putting air back in tires as most let 
air out to go in the sand. Will a bus handle the soft sand or do you 
need 4wd? Do I let air out and if so how much?
