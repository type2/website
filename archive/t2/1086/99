I have found that my bus does not do very well in loose sand.  Packed, 
wet sand should be okay.  If you're unsure, take it slow and if you get 
stuck, very gently back out in reverse.  Whatever you do, don't spin the 
wheels as they will dig in instantly.  Bring some boards and a large 
jack in case you get stuck.  One board goes under the jack and another 
under the stuck wheel.  Drive a few feet and repeat until you are back 
on pavement.

They have air lines for putting air back in tires as most let air out to go in the sand. Will a bus handle the soft sand or do you need 4wd? Do I let air out and if so how much?
