Subject: Re: [T2] Bus on sand

Using the parking brake worked well for me. It got both wheels going. Seemed like the tide was gonna catch me until I finally got the nerve to just go for it! With the parking brake and a higher gear, I had two roostertails of sand impressively high. Forward progress was slow, but I eventually got out and now, some 17+ years later I have never again been tempted. Some of that original sand is still on/in the bus somewhere, I'm sure! That was back when I had the hot bus motor and had lotsa power and revs. Woulda lost it to the tide if it was stock!

 Has anyone had experience driving their bus on the
 beach? Headed to ocean camping this weekend and there is an
 area where trucks can be on the beach. They have air lines
 for putting air back in tires as most let air out to go in
 the sand. Will a bus handle the soft sand or do you need
 4wd? Do I let air out and if so how much?
