Nice job on the repair.  As far as finding a replacement pin goes, I'd 
think that one of the major used parts suppliers (bustedbus, busco, 
interstate) would have a rusty engine hatch lid with good pin(s).

As an aside, having had my hatch lid off and on several times recently 
while doing some rust repair on the seal area, I'm impressed be the 
simple elegance of the design...
