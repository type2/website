I dunno - get me some old gas and I'll letcha know ;)

I can tell you that regular vs premium makes no difference in temps.  I 
did notice a while back that Chevron runs the coolest, but I haven't 
totally confirmed that as I was using a VDO sensor.  I should try it 
with my DD sensor as it's much more accurate and the measurements are 
repeatable.
