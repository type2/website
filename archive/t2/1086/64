Hi All,

In the same vein... When I pulled the rear compartment door on my '78 Westy,
I broke the screw (surprise surprise). The part that the screw goes into
moved somewhere inside. Where did it go? How do I go about finding it,
taking it out, removing the other end of the broken screw and reinstalling
it so that I can put the door back on?

Thanks in advance for your advice.

Bob
