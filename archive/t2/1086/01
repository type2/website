This is apples and oragnes here volks, DOT 5 is silicone fluid, most of the
"synthetics" like the Valvoline from parts stores are still DOT4, which is
still DOT3 compatible, which is just fine in out systems.  DOT5 should not be
used without a complete system teardown, flushing, and seals compatible with
silicone fluid (who knows what you got in there, even with new parts.)   It's
merits are also somewhat dubious in the collector car world, as although not
hygroscopic, water that gets in just sits in one spot in the system and rusts
locally.  For me I still use Castol LMA as it was an OEM Girling approved
fluid from the day, and hell some of the time some of our parts are Girling. 
Always has had a good rep.  You change it every 2 years, you don't have
problems.  I've use the Valvoline as well, as it isn't much more expensive
than the LMA, but I've used plenty of generic parts story "heavy duty" DOT3 in
my life as well.  Usually on a new to me
 vehicle I flush a full qt of that through then follow with 2 pints of the LMA
as a final bleed.
