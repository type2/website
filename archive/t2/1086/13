Since it is Friday...
 
You know it gets worse, ask yourself (if you aren't daily driving your bus
currently like me) when the last time you did your "regular" cars was.  My
wifes 2001 Rav4 I did about 4-5 years ago, my '87 syncro beater I haven't and
PO probably never did (bet its been 10 years or never on that van), and my
stinking '99 Suburban I would but I had to buy a $500 OTC Genysis diagnostic
computer to bleed the damn brakes, which I broke down and did last fall, and I
still haven't gotten around to it.  At least the OTC did let me diagnose some
intermittent issues on the Rav4.
 
And I even have a nice pressure bleeder to use on all the cars except the
Suburban, so I can do it myself easily, just laaaaaazzzy...
 
It will cost me I know.

Makes you wonder how long the PO went without flushing it, too ;)
