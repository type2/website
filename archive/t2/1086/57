Subject: Buses By The Depot  (and BusDepot Warehouse Sale) - Oct. 3

The web page is now up for the third annual Buses By The Depot, which will
be Saturday October 3 at Green Lane Park in Perkiomenville, PA (near the Bus
Depot).   

As with prior years, you can join us for the day for free, or stay overnight
for $15.  (Most people camp Saturday night, but some come early on Friday
night.)  On Saturday afternoon there will be a caravan to the Bus Depot for
our annual Open House and Warehouse Sale (where we blow out a year's worth
of distressed inventory below cost - discontinued items, scratch-and-dents,
customer returns, one-of-a-kinds, used items, etc.).  Following that will be
potluck dinner back at the campground. 

See http://busdepot.com/BBD2009.htm for complete details, and to reserve
your spot if you're staying overnight. There is a limited number of
campsites in our section of the campground, so it's best to reserve early.

Looking forward to seeing many familiar faces, and some new ones as well!
