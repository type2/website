MTBE was outlawed in California a few years back, so they're using something
else in it's place (ethanol I believe).

But yer right, fuel formulations are different from state to state these
days.  I noticed that when traveling across the US a couple of years ago.
My FI usually compensated, but once in awhile, you could tell a slight
difference in power and mileage.  I use Premium as per recommended by Mark
Dearing in my 2.1 Wasserboxer and I get my best mileage with that.
Sometimes I will run "Mid-Grade".  I use only "Top Tier" gasolines, ie:
Chevron/Texaco, Conoco/Phillips/76.  Stay away from ARCO tho.

YMMV
