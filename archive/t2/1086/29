gasoline of yesterday is soooooo different from todays fuels.

and day to day,, and state to state.... you get different fuel.  if you
travel across the country, you will find the fuel you buy in Montreal, is
different from Toronto,, and from Wall SD... and from LA.. <never been there
tho<

it isn't gasoline anymore..   it is MTBE .... or someother recipe  ..... see
the E in that mixture,,, is means ETHER... an oxygen bearing fuel... that
should mess with your settings as there is air going thru the intake,, and
oxygen put in via the fuel.
