Subject: Two into one Project

Hi Folks
           In case anyone is interested I have posted on my blog, photos of 
our latest two into one project. The poptop is too far gone to make a 
restoration viable so we are going to tranfer the equipment into the bus. I 
have also included a photo of the last Westy we owned (the one we should 
have kept). The bus runs well on choke but dies at idle, probably an air 
leak. I have checked the usual suspects. The servo vacuum line, the carb was 
removed and cleaned and has no apparent leaks. I was going to remove the 
fuel pump until I realized it required removing the complete intake manifold 
unit first (single carb set up). So for the moment I have decided to leave 
it on. at least until we put it away for the winter. On the intake manifold 
there are two smaller pipes going down to the exhaust, could the leak be 
caused there?
I think the engine is the older 1600 cc the bus is a 1973. Any ideas would 
be appreciated.
                                   Cheers  Ben & Linda.
