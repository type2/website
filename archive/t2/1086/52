Subject: Re: [T2] Another nutty idea... Fuel tank redesign...

I happen to have my engine and firewall out,  Here's what my rough
measurements are.  YMMV, and I have sound deadening stuff at the front
of the fuel tank bay, so the depth may be a little short.  Also, this
is from a '72.

Tank: 14"D x 10"H x 37"W
Bay: 14"D x 11.5"H x 40"W
