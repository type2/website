Subject: Re: [T2] anyone got a trailer hitch?

Hey I just bought a Brenderup 1205S from Brenderup in Midland TX. Give 
it a look. Dunno what your budget is. They do not show it on their 
website. However the Brenderup UK website does.

Light tongue weight, designed for light duty European vehicles and pulls 
so well you won't know it is there most of the time. Torsion bar 
suspension, independent suspension, galvanized steel sides, composite 
wood floor, etc.

Just a FYI. I wanted a lightweight trailer where the trailer was not a 
large amount of my total towing weight. My CR-V makes make it look easy. 
I think the bus will be happy with it too.
