Subject: Re: [T2] Play in steering in 1974

Bentley says no more than 15mm (5/8") with the front wheels off the ground.

But before assigning blame to the steering box (and with a friend underneath
[front end properly supported with stands],) check to see if there's play in
the Drag Link, Steering Damper (they do wear out after 30+ years) and the
Swing Lever Pin/Bushings.  If all those are nice and tight, try to readjust
your steering Box as per Bentley Section 2, Procedure 9.2 (page 23 of
Section 2).  If that don't help, time to replace the box.
