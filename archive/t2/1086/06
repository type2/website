Subject: Re: [T2] Brakes and fluid

Be careful with Brake fluid DOT numbers.  

DOT 5 Brake fluid is NOT SYNTHETIC Brake Fluid... it is
SILICONE brake fluid and should ONLY be used in systems that
have been COMPLETELY flushed or COMPLETELY replaced with 
components that are specifically made for SILICONE fluid.
It has a higher boiling point.....BUT.... it is still
hygroscopic and in fact if it is not brought to near
boiling on a regular basis, it will in some cases cause
even more damage than our REGULAR fluids.

My recommendation is to use a brand name, DOT 3 or DOT 4
HEAVY DUTY brake fluid, petroleum or synthetic base,
(will mix but take on the boiling point of the lower standard) 
and make flushing 
(the new vacuum brake bleeder systems make this a pretty simple chore) 
part of your every two years maintenance.

The difference in boiling point between DOT 3 and DOT 4 or 
petroleum or synthetic base is less than 100 degrees F.  As 
brake fluid (ANY hydraulic fluid) absorbs water (hygroscopic) 
the boiling point goes down.....as the moisture content increases.

We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
