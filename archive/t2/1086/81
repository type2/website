Subject: Bus on sand

Has anyone had experience driving their bus on the beach? Headed to ocean camping this weekend and there is an area where trucks can be on the beach. They have air lines for putting air back in tires as most let air out to go in the sand. Will a bus handle the soft sand or do you need 4wd? Do I let air out and if so how much?
