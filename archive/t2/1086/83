Subject: t2 email archive search

Since the move to the new server, we've been without full text  
searching on the email archives.  Up until now, we've been limited to  
searching only the subject line.  While thats better than nothing, it  
leaves for poor results.  I've been working on somewhat of a revision  
for the type2.com website and my first priority was to get the  
archives fully searchable again.  I think I've come up with a solution  
that works decently.

If anyone has feedback, feel free to let me know.  This is my vision  
of where the site should go, and its more related to how it runs as  
opposed to how it looks.  Making is look different/better/fancier/etc  
is not what I'm trying to spend time on.  My process for importing  
into mysql involved creating csv files, and my regex scripts to rip  
out the '(-at-)' and '.com' stuff didn't go as smoothly as I would have  
liked, so you'll see odd text here and there, but nothing that should  
prevent the email from being read.

So, for the good stuff.

Go to http://type2.calivw78.com and use the search engine
If you want to browse the email archives posts, go to http://type2.calivw78.com/mail-archive

Right now, I've imported about 70 emails from 2001.  I'll do more as  
time permits, and I'll update the list as I complete large chunks.

For those who are wondering, calivw78.com is running on a server that  
physically sits on top of type2.com in my basement.  Eventually, I  
would like to see type2.com running like this.  But for now, I am  
using the other server as a bit of sandbox environment.

Peace, Troy
