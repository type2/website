Subject: wire and connectors in Ak

Hi John,
    Have you tried Polar Wire ( Seward Hwy frontage road) or Frigid North
(Spenard Rd) in Anchorage.  I get most of my connecters from Polar Wire.  They
sell good, -50F cold-flexible, wire too.  If you travel to Fairbanks, the Napa
at the north end of Airport Rd has a good selection of wire and connectors.
