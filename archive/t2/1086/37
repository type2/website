Better auto parts stores have them (but I mean a real good store.)  And the
correct crimping tool that folds the little inverted W sort of shape.  But
I've yet to find a store here in AK, so I resort tosimply jerking the little
blue thing off a regular ole crimp connector, then using the proper tool, then
soldering.  Probably could get em online from Digikey, and even McMaster-Carr
(page 744 online has an assortment of uninsulated, including proper "double
crimp" like cars use) or somewhere like that as well.  Sort of surprised
Grainger doesn't.  The tough ones to find are the little sized VW ones,
whatever they are (about 0.100" or so, don't recall off the top of my head,
they exist but are hard to find.)

BTW. Is there a source for un-insulated wire connectors?
