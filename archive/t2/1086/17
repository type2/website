Subject: anyone got a trailer hitch?

So, we've decided to go with a trailer, instead of a roof rack.  We  
even have a possible line on a trailer already.  Problem?  No hitch  
yet.  On top of that, we leave to go camping next Friday (8.4) and  
want to see if we can get something together by then.  I sent an email  
to Jamie asking what the timeline is on one of his, but I'm certainly  
not holding my breath about the possibility of getting one a week out.

With that said, is there anyone out there with a hitch they are  
willing to part with on short notice for a sum?

4 kids and needing more room, Troy
