Subject: Re: [T2] Brakes and fluid

I got my reminder to change fluid with a borrowed Motorhome
about 10 years ago.   Long, steep hill only 500 yards from my house,
lost ALL brakes and went through two intersections before I could stop
the thing.  The fluid looked like coffee, and worked just as well.  I have
NEVER again let my cars go more than two or three years.
If you don't have a fancy bleeder for your BUS, just go get one of the small
"one man bleeder" kits at a local parts house, or make up one out of an
old soda bottle, and just keep filling the reservoir and bleeding through
each bleeder in turn until the fluid looks like what you are pouring in.

When would you like to travel to Haiti?
