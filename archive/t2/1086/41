Subject: Re: [T2] Play in steering in 1974

I just replaced the steering box in my '79.  It was clearly the
greatest source of play in my steering.  I had about 8 inches of play
measured at the the edge of the steering wheel.  The steering was
horrendous: driving in a stiff wind was an exercise in stress and fear
management.

Now that the steering box has been replaced there is about 2 inches of
play as measured at the edge of the wheel.  This is still more play
than the spec limit (if I remember correctly the spec says something
like 810 mm at the edge) but it's not so much that I'm really nervous
about the steering anymore.

At some point I'll get around to working on the rest of the steering
and getting that play down even further.

Good luck!
Zack
