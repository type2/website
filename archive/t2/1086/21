This is a snippet from
http://www.aircooled.net/gnrlsite/resource/articles/jetting.htm

"Idle jets operate from idle to 2500-3000rpms or so. Main jets are primarily
from 2500-4500rpms, and Air jets affect the engine from 3500/4000 on up.
Lastly, you have emulsion tubes to change "where" it's rich, lean, etc. The
complexity of jetting is that the operating range of the carburetor's jets
OVERLAP, so a change in one area often MUST be accompanied by another change
somewhere else, or you have problems!"
