Well, 10x1.5 was it. Thanks everyone.

As I was tightening them down the engine/trans pair shifted a smidge.
All of a sudden my bus was slowly rolling down the driveway!

Turns out THAT is why my clutch cable was loose. The separation of the
two. So my adjustment last week made the cable too tight when they
were properly bolted together.

Scary having the vehicle you're under start moving away on its own!
