Kevin:

I assume these are original VW heads?  In that case I *think* that a flycut
only dresses up the contact point between the head and the thick metal
"gasket" that VW installed between the head and the cylinder.  The new heads
being manufactured (not by VW) have this "gasket" as part of the casting,
obviating the need for the gasket.  I believe a step cut mimics this
machining more material out of the center portion of the head, leaving a
small "step" around the outer circumference of the head.  (Somebody will
correct me if I'm wrong here!)  I don't think one is better than the other
for cooling or unleaded gas.
