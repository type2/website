it can be done in the bus, but after doing it both ways I highly
recommend just pulling the engine. Makes it even easier to replace
those fuel lines & check the whole engine also. I would also add the
Bentley to your reading collection. It's by far the most accurate of
the books as far as not being general.

There was a gasket (soft metal ring) that was inserted between the
cylinders & heads. Many years later VW issued a bulletin that
essentially said "you don't need them, just make sure you make up the
shim difference w/ under cyl shims". My thought on this is. If you
pull the heads & the gasket is there, put a new one back in. otherwise
don't worry.
