Jeff,

Good job!  This is the leak I have been sort of waiting for on FI.  One of
the big complaints that the dual cab guys have is leaks around the
bushings where the shaft for the throttle butterfly passes thru the body
of the carb.  I have always wondered that the FI system was not subject to
the same problem, but up 'til now it has not been one.  Yours is the first
report of it, but I expect that others will start to show up.

Because it has not been a problem (or at least not one we paid much
attention to), I have not looked at that area too closely, but if it is
anything like the carbs, there is a steel shaft passing thru bronze
bushings (and you thought the bronze age was long gone :-)  Since bronze
is a fairly soft metal, over time it deforms and wears and you can get a
vacuum leak.  the only solution I know of is to take the throttle body to
an old fashioned carb shop and have new bushings installed.
