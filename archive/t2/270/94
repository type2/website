I use a triangular scraper to shave off those sharp edges, then while 
installing, use a very small screwdriver to work around the seal, tucking 
it in. Use no sealant on those o-rings, just some light oil. Silicone 
grease would also be ok. They have to move without binding due to heat 
expansion.
