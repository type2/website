Subject: Steering Box info Req'd

Hi Volks,

I recall a posting last week about NEW steering boxes for $200.

This morning while I was stopping in at the local ACVW shop there was a 
73 westy there which needed a steering box. I've double-checked my 
in-box and the archives but can't find the link.

If someone could forward me the info I'd appreciate it, ... it would 
help get another bus back on the road; and there aren't that many up 
here!

Happy trails,
