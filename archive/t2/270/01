That's what the owner's manual is for. If you've got one, read it. If you 
don't got one get one.

Yes, you have a great many issues to consider with any vehicle that sit's 
for more than a few years. Expect the most very foul happenings with the 
brakes. The pulling is from a gross buildup of rust scale now contaminating 
the shoes/pads. The leaking of fluid will weaken that wheel and will pull 
the other way. Without question, any vehicle that has set for 15 years must 
have all the brake cylinders/calipers/hoses replaced. The steel lines 
should be flushed with alcohol and blown out and repeated several times to 
get the gunk out of them.

Before you drive again, block the wheels, put on the emergency brake, put 
it in neutral, start the engine and let it idle. Stand on the brake pedal 
as hard as you can. Don't be suprised if it pops and goes to the floor. Now 
fix the  brakes and the wheel bearings before you drive it again.

This means you cannot drive another 5 miles without doing more costly damage.

You are in fact stuck without a car, at least this car. Your description of 
things says to me it would be dangerouse to drive this vehicle, PERIOD.

Do not force the issue with the brakes or bearings. The downside of an 
accident jeopardizing you, your kids, and everyone else you pass on the 
road is just too much.
