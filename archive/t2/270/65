Hi Craig,

    About a hundred years ago at the dealer, we had an old slow cooker in
the "unit room" with oil in it, set on high. We just left it on all the time
(which I would never do at our shop), when we took a crank apart we just
dropped the gears in the oil, and they were ready to go when we were.
    At one time I tried an old coffee maker (again stolen from wife), just
didn't get hot enough. Now I have an old electric Hot Plate on the bench. I
have found that high temp will heat the cam drive gear to 600 f (using my
infrared temp gun), and medium will get the distributor drive to about 250
f. Both will slide on without having to be driven with a hammer. I stole an
old pair of hot dog tongs from the wife. I heat the ends of the tongs
slightly, so there not a heat sink. I also worked the ends with a hammer a
little so the curved ends fit the gears just right. Now they also hold the
gears firm enough to twist them around so I can line up with the key and
push them on before they cool down.
    Works for me, good luck.
