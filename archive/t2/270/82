>[...] valve cover off, remove rocker arm's & pushrod
retaining wire, take out the pushrods. Use the inside
pliers that you use to remove the crankshaft circlip
with, reach in and put pressure to the inside of the
pushrod tube, twist and pull at the same time it will
come out. Replace seals, put some silicon on the seals
and put them back in, twisting as you push them in.
