Subject: 73 Transporter Woes, engine help!

Volksfolks I require your advice....
I have a 73 Transporter, 1776cc Engine, dual carbs, manual transmission,
chasis number 2232068024, that has some very strange (in my opinion) stuff
going on. The whole saga started about a week ago when I set out to install
new shocks all the way around, and new brake shoes on the rear wheels, plus
do a tune up on the engine.
Here are my troubles: the shocks are installed and feel great on the one
test drive I've had. That however, is really the only good thing I can say.
She chokes out when I shift from first to second, I have to slip the clutch
with the engine at around 3-4 grand to get her to take off. On top of that,
whenever I apply the brakes, I hear a very odd clicking noise, which appears
to be coming from the equalizer bar underneath the cab, I can also feel the
clicking if I touch the parking brake lever while applying the brakes. My
personal favorite woe is that after driving for about 10 minutes, she starts
to smoke. But not out her exhaust system, out the 3-4 bank side of the
engine. My best hypothesis thus far is that I'm leaking oil somwhere either
between my cylinder and head, or cylinder and case. The smoking isn't really
a new problem, but I had hoped that new valve cover gaskets would cure it.
The engine has been tuned up, new points, plugs, rotor, car, condensor,
valves are adjusted to .006", new air cleaner. I'm very much at a loss about
the parking brake, and am hoping for the best regarding the smoke. Please
let me know if there is anything anyone can think of regarding either of
these issues. Thanks in advance.
