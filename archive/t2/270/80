Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 Push Rod Tube Install hints ??

What I use to put the pushrod tubes in with is the
snap ring plyers that I take the snapring off the
crankshaft with, it opens outward and holds tight
inside of the pushrod tube,I also use a little bit of
silicone sealer to help the "o" rings slide in easy
without cutting, put them in with a twisting
motion,works for me. Phil
