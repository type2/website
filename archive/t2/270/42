Subject: [T2] type 4 bearing # Question 

I had a similar problem with my 914 a couple of months
ago, bought an engine that had been bored to 2.2 L,
but the guy put the wrong bearings on.  He had bored
it to .01 over and .02 over on the case and crank, but
had put .01 over and under bearings on there.  Hence,
the .010 difference was causing a knock in the engine.
 Took it to the machine shop to find this out, just
had him measure and it wasn't very expensive.  Was
kinda hard to find that bearing size, but finally
found a company in Atlanta that sold em.  problem solved.
