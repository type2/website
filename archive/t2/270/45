Hi All,
Transmission does not shift properly from 2nd to 3rd, I think. When
driving about 30 to35 miles an hour the tranny wants to stay in 2nd. It
will only shift if you let up on the gas completely or accelerate to 44
miles an hour and it will shift into 3rd. Is this normal or a problem. I
changed the fluid and cleaned the filter, but no help. I do not see a
vaccum adjustment on the transmission.

        Thanks
