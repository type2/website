People like this will probably do it regardless of the answer to this question.  But to answer the question, the bus will "do" pretty much like a baywindow with a 1600DP engine (think 1971).  Heck, that was an awfully easy question.  I can't believe they even asked it.

Okay that's a better question and if I recall the answer is YES.  The gear ratios did not change significantly from 71 to 73.  74 was the first real change in baywindow gear ratios.
