Thanks Chris.

I am just using a multi-meter for now as I do not have the O2 sensor permanently
mounted. I will get some errors as it is placed after the cat, but as my cat is
original, I believe that its useful life is over (just a glorified straight
pipe). When I get all the new goodies installed, then my new cat will have a
mounting port for the O2 sensor and I will investigate installing a meter.

Though according to  DIYEFI.com the best Co meter is one using a wide band O2
sensor. These have a more linear curve with respect to Lambda. Unfortunately they
cost around $150 for a universal type sensor (used on the 95 Honda Civic and
others). One site for a nice build it yourself article is
http://www.techedge.com.au/vehicle/wbo2/default.htm .


Does the Smog Help people you mentioned have a web site detailing what they do to
rebuild the EGR valve? I opened my old one up and the rubber shaft seal has a
small hole and the secondary metal sealing surface (used to restrict exhaust gas
intake at full throttle) is too pitted to seal. The primary seal (after I cleaned
it up) still seems like it will work (can hold 20 inHg of vacuum).
