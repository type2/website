Billy,

Same as before....<grin>

Did it just start running bad or bad from when he got it back from 
being rebuilt....how come he doesn't take it back to them?

Running bad and no idle just all of the sudden?

Won't idle, or won't run good or both?

Vacuum hose loose/leaking?  

Timing is going to be the same at idle pretty much no matter what.

Advance the dist a little to see if you can get it to idle...not too much 
though, and then start checking timing and spark and dwell....good 
sparks???

Maybe just a bad set of points? or timing waaay off cause it moved?
Spark plug wires all on good?...not rubbing and grounding out on 
something?

Do electrical first and then move on....if you can get him idling at all,
then you can pull the wires off one by one and see if something changes.

Loose rocker arms somewhere?

Cheers ,dave
