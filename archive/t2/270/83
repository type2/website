An excellent substitute for this is an electric deep fryer, available at
garage sales everywhere.  They heat up relatively fast, are made to
contain oil (though you don't want to leave them unattended) and have nice
baskets to hold the parts.

One nice thing to have is a set of lab-style insultated gloves.  Much more
secure than trying to manipulate the item with tongs.
