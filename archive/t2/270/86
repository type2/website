Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 DP in a 73 Westy, how will it perform?

Thanks for the info.  I'll pass it onto the perspective buyer.  The 2.0 was
never installed in the 73 bus.  I bought the bus minus the engine and later
picked up a wrecked 76 bus and removed the engine and fuel injection parts
from it.  I know you'd need to change to a later bell housing for the 2.0 to
fit, plus swap the tank for the fuel injection and the person looking at my
bus doesn't want to do all that.  I guess that's the main reason they want
to go with their 1600.  John
