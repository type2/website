Subject: 1975 Bus for sale Charleston SC..$750

$750 firm.  Good price for the motor alone. Solid running bus. Has stood one
year or so........has shift linkage problems.  I have tried to adjust, and it
will go into reverse 1.2 or if i move the shifter other way, 3 and 4.  Go
figure.

Has some rust, not perfect by any means.  Has a pop-top, a few tears in
canvas, and fold out (some call z-bed) bed in back.  Originally was a camper
but over the years someone removed that stuff.

Stuff that comes with it.....new TMI front seat upholstery, 2 new front steps
to weld in.  Also, 1 drivers side heat exchanger to replace the one on the car
that has a leak.

It is not really a parts car, but it is no raving beauty either.  It could use
a good cleaning, and that linkage issue.  I would do the work myself, but have
my hands full with my own fleet and customer's cars right now.

Buyer needs to tow it from its current location in N Charleston, SC.  It will
crank right up, but as i said, has a shifting issue.  Other than that a
roadworthy bus.

Pmail for more info or my number.
