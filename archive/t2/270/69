Hi Volks,

There will be a small carabus departing from the shell station on 
Warden Ave just S. of  HWY 401 in Toronto tomorrow at 7:30 AM to meet 
up with Jamie Rivers' Fall Tour of S. Ontario.

For info on the Fall tour, see the Official Fall Tour website:
http://www.globalserve.net/~jrivers/falltour2002.htm

Let me know if you're coming, or just be there; that's cool too. See 
you on the road!

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
