I had to put the throttle body back into the van as I need it to move. But I am
now on the lookout for a used one so that I can investigate how the seal works.
As given the years on our buses, I am sure that all of us will shortly have this
problem.

I will let the list know what I find out. I will have to go through oil seal
vendor catalogs and see what parts exist as I am sure this was not a custom
part.
