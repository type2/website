Hi All,
I am still getting gas in the oil. While checking the auxillary air
controller, bently says to remove cloth hose from the large rubber S hose
and check for vaccum after starting the engine. With the hose removed the
engine does not want to start, tries but will not run. Is there another
problem causing this or am I doing it wrong. Engine runs fine normally. 

        Thanks
