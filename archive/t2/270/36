So if the magic number is 7.5before static, then that occurs two times in one complete engine cycle, so I have to verify that I'm at 7.5 before for #1, not #3 right?

Okay, I haven't really messed with these things much. I have VW elec ignition on my '79 engine, and I don't ever touch it.

Dist. cap and rotor had mild build up, but not burned.

The wires seem to be heading to different cylinders than mine, when compared. How do I verify which wire at the dizzy is for where?

>Check the dwell...even with electronic points.

I don't know how to do this, I have to do some investigation.

Thanks Dave and list.
