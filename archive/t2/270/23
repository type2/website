Subject: Re: [T2] VW Trends sales call?

They lady was very pleasant and said they would send me a form...they
did not ask for any money or cc numbers over the phone(good).

I got the same call two weeks ago, and they DEMANDED a credit card number,
said they would NOT bill- I don't give out CC numbers over the phone unless I
initiated the call. I called VW Trends the next day and they claimed it was
not anyone representing their magazine.       Jeff
