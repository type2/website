BusDepot has em, $2.49, P/N: 025 133 073.  D*mn!  You know what?  I
took my bus into the shop yesterday, having given up on chasing down my
vac leak.  Preliminary results?  Throttle body seal!  I had even examined
this... couldn't find a new gasket locally, so I just used blue Permatex
to seal it up.  Looks like that doesn't work.
