Subject: Rear Drum Brake Woes

I'm having some issues with my 73 bus's rear brakes. I recently deceided to
replace the brake shoes, partlt because they were getting old, and also
because I learned that my parking brake was not hooked up properly and
therefore didn't function. So I got all the parts, had the drums turned at a
very good machine shop, and installed the new shoes. My problem is that ever
since I got the old girl out of my shop, there is an odd clicking noise that
is very quiet while driving, but gets much much louder whenever I depress
the brake pedal. The clicking noise seems to be coming from the equalizer
bar up near the front of the bus, but isn't isolated there. There is
definate noise coming from the wheels themselves. Everything appears to be
installed correctly, per the Bently manual and Muir's book. I'm at a loss, I
know very little about the mechanics of the braking system for the drum
brakes, so any help is appreciated.
On a side note, what is the general opinion about chokes? Should I disable
mine like Muir says, or are they better left doing what they were made to
do? Again, any suggestions or opinions are apprecited.
Thanks in advance to anyone who can help, I just want my baby to be drivable
again!
