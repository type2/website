Subject: Sachs VS Daikin clutch ?

Fellow listmembers...

especially vendors that may have additional insight with this issue...

here is the short of it :

"They don't have any Sachs brand in stock, so I am getting a Daikin brand 
one instead. Does anyone have any experience with these? "

they cost more, but are they any lesser of quality? they don't seem to think 
so, but you never know.

full story :

had some shifting issues, and a new oil leak. turns out the pilot bearing 
and oil cooler seal are bad.

so, motor comes out of the bus to fix these things. they asked how old the 
clutch is, and I said I don't know.

they got the motor out, said its ok for right now, but its scraped and worn 
and will probably go out sooner than later, so may as well tackle that to.

Pilot bearing job : $260
Oil Cooler seal : $140
Clutch : $240

I believe the pilot bearing price is the one that took on the cost of 
removing the engine...

update, literally as I wrote this :

they did a pressure check, and its the cooler itself. the thing leaks I 
guess, damnit

Oil cooler : $120


Anyway, back to the clutch.

They don't have any Sachs brand in stock, so I am getting a Daikin brand one 
instead. Does anyone have any experience with these?



They are going to replace the fuel tank sender while they have the engine 
removed.

so far, my estimate from them is $800 + tax.

ugh


Just have to keep reminding myself it was only $400 to begin with, so im 
still probably in the black investment-wise. I know its no fun to look at it 
that way, but sometimes, especially times like these, you can't help it.
