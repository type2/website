I highly recommend a Porter-Cable 4" random orbital sander. About $70 at 
you local Home Improvement Store. I've had mine over a year now and I've 
run the hell out of it. It uses little velcro stick sanding pads and it's 
been flawless. It sands as good and as fast as any little air tool I've 
ever borrowed and b/c I don't have a big air compressor it's all I can use.

I also have a small square pad sander that i bought way, way back in 1994. 
It was called a Professional Grade Balck and Decker. This was pre-DeWalt 
(who sells the current version - about identical to the old version). It 
has been perfect too but it sands considerably slower.

Also the Porter-Cable version comes in two version. 1 has the electronic 
speed control so that the sander speed doesn't go through the roof when you 
take the sander off of the surface of the wood/metal/etc that you are 
sanding. VERY nice touch. Mine does not have it, I recommend it.
