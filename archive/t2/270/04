Subject: On the road tomorrow for the first time

Folks,

Thank you to everyone who has helped me these last 6 months with my bus.

I'm finally driving to California and I'm leaving tomorrow morning.  The bus
has been running great these last 6 months after sitting for 4 years so I
feel confident I'll make it Sunnyvale, CA in one go.

I'll be stopping at El Paso the first night (yep a whole day in Texas), Palm
Springs (Cathedral City) hopefully the 2nd night and then all the way to
Sunnyvale on Sunday.

Wish me luck!
