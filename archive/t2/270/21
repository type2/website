Subject: 1600 DP in a 73 Westy, how will it perform?

I've got someone that's interested in buying my 73 Westy but they have a
1600DP that they want to put in the bus rather than the 2.0 that I have with
it.  They are wondering though how the bus will do with that engine.  Is the
transaxle that came in a 73 with a 17600 engine geared too high to use with
the 1600?  Did they keep the same gear ratios when they made the change from
the 1600 to the 1700?
