Subject: Re: [T2] Bus values 

Hello Jak,

    If I were you, I would get a statement form your bank showing the "Loan
Value" of your bus. In real money this is what its worth. This should show
up as $0.00 by the banks standards.
    Let your conscience and your Lawyer take it from there! ;-)   ;-)
