 WHAT, are they crazy? For power and performance I would stay with the 2.0.
 or is the engine blown?<<<

I agree but if you noticed I asked if the 2.0 was blown.

 one word... SLUG

My '71 resents your epithet.  It prefers the term "stately".
1600s push buses very nicely.  No, not a performance engine, but there is
no VW engine that will give a bus "high performance".<

Oh really? wanna try and stick with my bus while I'm doing 90 down the
Interstate with my below average Type 4 engine? Your 1600 cc dp do that?

If he wants to stick a 1600 in his bus thats no business of mine. I was just
throwing out the fact that 2.0 Type 4 engine is a better choice. I have no
problem's with Bays with 1600's in them I know alot of people who have them
and are happy. It just seems sorta backwards to take a 2.0 Type 4 out and
put a Type 1 motor in it.
