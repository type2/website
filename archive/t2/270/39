Subject: Pop Top

Hello

I was wondering if anyone could help me.  I am about to re-paint my roof and 
have noticed that the two front corners of my pop top are catching the actual 
roof of my van and scratching the paint away.  Obviously I don't want to 
repaint this just to find it ruins the paint job.  Also the roof doesn't seem 
to sit all that well at the back towards the roof rack end.

I was wondering if anyone could tell me if there is any adjustment I can 
make?

Thanks
