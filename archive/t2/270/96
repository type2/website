Subject: Junkyard in MA

Hi,

During the transporterfest in Brookline two weekends ago, somebody (sorry, 
can't remember your name) told me about
a junkyard around Billerica that had 1 or 2 buses. Unfortunately I lost the 
info.
I'm in the process of doing body work on my bus and I need the nose metal 
from the vent intake to the windshield sill.
If somebody has the information about the junkyard or knows of a donor bus 
I could cut up, it would be greatly appreciated.
(it's a long weekend so I could drive couple hundred miles to scavenge for 
parts. I'm located in Boston MA).

Thanks  a lot,
Rogelio
