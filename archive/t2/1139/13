Figure the volumes involved. There aren't near as many vehicles using 
that part as there used to be. Demand is probably down to 10% of what it 
was 20 years ago.

Now consider that there are possibly as many as 4 previous owners of 
that part in the supply stream ahead of you, and three shipper/couriers. 
Each of the wholesalers and couriers needs to make money, or they go out 
of business. It adds up.

A year ago my employer started adding a $5 fuel surcharge to every order 
in order to compensate for the losses we were taking due to the rise in 
fuel costs. Suddenly a $4 part costs $9!!!

In the past a seller could order a box of 1000 of those screws and know 
for certain they would be reordering in a few months. Now a box of 100 
lasts a year or more; he has no incentive to sell cheap.

Happy Trails,
