> - Some have reported needing to use a in-line resistor from the wiring
harness of the vehicle to the + 15 side of the coil when using a non-Bosch
"black" or "blue" coil. Bosch coils should be manufactured with internal
resistance . Some Bosch "blue" coils are of varying quality so a Ohm
resistance test would be needed to determine compatibility.

What would be the expected Ohm readings for either case?
