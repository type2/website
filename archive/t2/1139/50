Ditto on what Greg Potts and Ron (Bus Depot) says.

The same thing is happening to the 8x9x56mm 2.0 Exhaust Stud (also
fits 914 and 911 too).  The manufacturer that supplies to the leading
fastener importers isn't making them anymore unless an order for
50,000 pieces minimum is made.  I'm looking into having them made,
with considerably less quantity minimums to keep the supply alive and
hopefully at a reasonable cost.  Most machine shops in SoCal I deal
with are "turning" the 10mm side down to 9mm on their own to complete
the head rebuilding job - not perfect, but it's becoming the only
alternative for now.  I use to sell 500 or more a month over 10 years
ago.  Now, when I have them in stock, I'm lucky to sell the 8 pieces
required per engine in 2 years.

And as time goes on and we try to keep our 30+ year old rides on the
road, it's not gonna get cheaper :(

Geez, as someone who has been around the block and machine shop, I gotta
figure someone is making MUCHO bucks on these. Sure they are tip hardened,
radiused, and polished, but man!!!
