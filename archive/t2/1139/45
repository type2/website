Subject: Re: [T2] Canvas Top Installation - Karl Von Salzen or others?

Yes, Karl is greatly missed!

The job is rather straightforward. I don't think special instructions
are required. It's probably been 8 years since I did it myself, so my
mind is not real fresh on the details.

Start by removing the wooden retainers that sandwich in the old canvas
in the pop top.

Remove the aluminum runners that do the same for securing the canvas
to the bus roof.

Install the fresh canvas to the pop top the same way you got the old one out.

Apply moderate tension to pull the canvas tight while reinstalling the
aluminum keepers. I started at the middle center of the sunroof
section. The trick here is get it in straight so that it is properly
centered and symmetrical when you get to the corners, and then at the
corners try to gather the material in an even and consistent manner so
that you don't get big bunches of material choking up the turn so that
you can't get the aluminum screwed down.

The difficult part would be near the hinges where the pop-top is quite
close the the bus roof. The working clearances there would be tight. I
don't remember if there was enough room for me to work there
comfortably. I don't remember it being a big hassle, so maybe it
wasn't so bad.

When finished, trim the excess.

John
