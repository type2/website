Subject: Re: [T2] Points Replacement Issues: Primer

In my experience, the Mexican made (cheeper) Bosch Blue Coil is NOT
internally resisted.  I only use and/or sell only Brazilian Bosch Blue
Coils as they are properly and internally resisted.  I've had Mexican
Bosch coils burn up the points and condensor almost immediately.  Word
to the wise.

Compu-fire in my experience has been the best in installation and
reliabity for magnetic units.  Crane XR700 (formerly Allison back into
the 60s) are by far the best I've used in past 35+ plus years.  I've
run these on almost every air cooled VW I've owned and even a 72
Toyota Pickup I once owned.  I am currently running one on my 914.  I
grew up a few miles from the Allison factory in Duarte, CA.  They even
made a 6 volt version before being bought up by Crane.  Crane XR's are
becoming hard to find since their financial troubles a few years back.

Perrtronix units don't even make good paperweights ;)
