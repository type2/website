Greg hit the nail on the head on both counts. Supply and demand plays a
major part.  The manufacturer isn't selling many of these anymore, so they
increase their markup on each unit in lieu of making it up in volume. That's
where the bulk of the profit goes. They can get away with it because demand
is relatively inelastic.  Not many people need valve adjusting screws at any
given time, but if you need them you need them. From our standpoint, there's
no longer enough demand for us to "cut out the middleman" and import these
ourselves in large volume, as we do with many other parts we sell. So
instead we buy them from the U.S. importer now, who imposes their own
markup. By the time we see the part, we're only paying a couple of bucks
less than you are.  On the bright side, at least it's still available. 

Small orders also cost more because the cost of processing a $10 order and a
$200 order are basically the same. Either way I have to pay employees to
process the order, charge your card, get the parts from the bin, box them
up, print a shipping label, etc. Now add the credit card processing fees
(much more expensive for the first dollar than for additional ones), and
shipping costs (much more expensive for the first pound than for additional
ones).  We pass some of this cost on to the customer via a $4 minimum
shipping fee, but even so we still lose money on virtually every order under
$20.  (And, for that matter, any order where a part is backordered, since we
not only have to go through the entire process again each time we ship a
backorder, but we also cover the ship charge on our dime.)  It is the larger
orders that make up for it, which is why the List Discount doesn't kick in
until you hit $50.
