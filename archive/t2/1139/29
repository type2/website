Subject: Compu-fire Q & Trouble w/ spark: RESOLVED

I posted a question asking if the 009 & SVDA Compu-fire modules were
interchangeable. I got word back from Compu-fire and they are exactly the
same. The only difference is a spacer which slips on the distributor shaft
included in the SVDA kit. Also, the SVDA kit is "emissions legal", since a
009 is technically in itself not a legal modification in California. Go
figure. So if you are running a Compu-fire module and it craps out on you
and the local speed-shop or FLAPS only has a 009 module, as long as you have
your original spacer, you are good to go. Conversely if you have a module
for a SVDA and want to run it in your 009, (perish the thought), you are
good as well, just don't use the spacer.

Thanks everyone for their input. A shout out to John Kolak for a nice
technical explaination on how dwell is translated in regards to points and a
points replacement module.

I also posted an issue I was having with the same cutomer's '71 bus. No
power under load using a points replacement module, but normal operation
with points. Oddly it wasn't an ignition issue at all. The fuse for the fuel
pump relay to the generator was blown. The fuel pump to starter relay was
allowing the bus to start. After the motor was running, the enormous amount
of positive fuel pressure generated by the Dellortos was pulling fuel PAST
the stalled fuel pump. First time I have seen that happen. Someone else
might be able to explain why running points allowed the bus to operate
pretty much normally with the fuel pump stalled. I have my theories, but
I'll keep quiet in the sake of keeping misinformation from spreading.
