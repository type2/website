Subject: Canvas Top Installation - Karl Von Salzen or others?

Ho Volks:

The late great Karl von Salzen sent me really good instructions on how 
two of us could install a new canvas pop-top on the Westy without 
removing the fiberglass top.  I'm buying the tent now, but can't find 
the directions and sadly I can't ask Karl to resend.

Does anyone have Karl's directions or other links to directions for this 
job?

Thanks,

BEN
