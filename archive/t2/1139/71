Subject: ignition lock

A few weeks ago someone on here had a question about an ignition for an early
bay and they actually had one for a late bay.  I have a customer who might be
interested in it if it's available, but I couldn't find the thread to contact
the owner.  If the owner of the lock wants to contact me, I'd appreciate it.
