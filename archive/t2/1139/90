Subject: DVD, some might like

Hi, it being Friday, thought I would put this out there.
"stumbled' onto a site where they have recovered the Bluebird record attempt
jet boat, Sir Donald Campbell died in, and with voluntary help and private
donations, are about 3/4 done restoring it, from what they found at the bottom
of the lake!  I bought a DVD with Anthony Hopkins in it as Donald Campbell,
and it goes a bit through his background via 'soap opera', but last scenes are
actuall, of the crash, when he hit 345 mph!  It is entertaining, mildly. I
believe you can see excerpts at www.cultandraredvd.com. and I think there is a
link to 'resto' group at the end of DVD.  You have to be older to remember the
fierce battles over speed between "Brits' and USA on land, and water in the
late 60s!
VW content, the garage in the background holds a 62 right hand drive beetle
