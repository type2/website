Adrian,

The Dansk units are loud since they stopped putting enough fiberglass in
their mufflers. Ernst makes the closest to original. However if I were going
to drop any money on an exhaust I would buy a vintagespeed unit.

I just installed a vintagespeed muffler on a customer's '71 T2a. I was VERY
skeptical, but the build quality is absolutely incredible. I couldn't build
one for the price. Full stainless, sounds excellent with the right balance
of acoustics. Great flow characteristics. 2 week delivery. I am considering
ordering one of each model. One for my '68 T2a and one for my '78 T2b with
'72-'74/'79 exhaust. I think they are the best value out there. No
disrespect to Jake Rabe of course.
