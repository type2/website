Bob,

Where do you live?

I also had an interesting experience her in CA at the test-only station
(where they make me go every time even though the bus passes every time with
flying colors). My '79 is a California model, and has a one-year only,
California only exhaust system with a catalytic converter and no smog pump
(please, please please someone help me find new heater boxes!).

The tester may have been the same one you had. I had to explain the entire
process to him, and that the 1979 CA model did not have a smog pump (he was
looking in his instruction book the entire time, and of course it only had
the federal model in it). He then proceeded to inform me that there was no
way my bus would pass because California adopted some new procedures, one of
which was to test the entire fuel system for leaks by pressurizing the fuel
tank. He said there would surely be leaks in some of the evap. system hoses.
What he didn't know was that less than four years prior I had replaced every
single hose with the very best hose I could get my hands on. He was pretty
surprised when it passed that test, and asked who my mechanic was. After I
told him that no one has worked on that van but me, I was finally able to
convince him that I knew more about it than his book, and he passed me on
the visual without the smog pump.

Never going back there. I'll drive a little further to use my old guy.
