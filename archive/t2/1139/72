Subject: Mufflers

  Just replaced the decrepit cylindrical muffler on my '79 (which has 
the same setup as 72-74:  muffler bolts directly on to heater boxes) 
with what appears to be a stock Dansk (has DK and some numbers stamped 
on it)  Problem is, seems like the new muffler is way louder than the 
previous one.  I'm not expecting my bus to sound like a Prius, but it 
would be nice to have a conversation while at 60 mph.

Any suggestions on a good, quiet muffler that will fit a 72-74 or 79.

Thanks,
Adrian
