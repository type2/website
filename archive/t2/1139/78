HI Jon,

Any idea if the Vintagespeed muffler influenced (or is expected to) head
temps of your customer's engine?  I've been looking for a decent flowing
muffler alternative as I can't install a header due to my trailer hitch
being welded in place... so I'm stuck to stock-sized/ shaped components for
my 79.

Thanks, Mike
