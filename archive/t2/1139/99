Subject: Re: Alt with built in Volt Reg???? See picture

Hey Mark,
That's what I thought, but I can't seem to get any voltage output from it when
I test it with my voltmeter.B  To test it, I just need to put the red
probeB of a volt meter to the B+ terminalB and the black prope to ground,
right??? SHouldn't I be getting output when I do this of about 13.8 volts or
so or am I missing something??

PEACE!
John Baker
