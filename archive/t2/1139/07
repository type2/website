 Maybe have a look around in that site.

They seem to have switched from Compu-fire to Pertronix, but the stock
number is generic, apparently so it can adapt to whichever brand is
being sold at the time:

Points Replacement Kits
(12V; Fits SVDA, and 1968-79 Stock Volkswagens, 009s, and 050s)

The Bugformance ad for Compufire on The Samba says this:

COMPUFIRE IGNITION SYSTEM

FITS 009 WITHOUT THE SPACER AND STOCK DUAL VACUUM ADVANCE WITH THE SPACER.
