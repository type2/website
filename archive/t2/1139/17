Subject: thur funny and question.

had to take my 78 bus in for an emissions test today and while I'm sitting 
there the tester goes around the bus with his mirror on a stick looking 
under the van and finally in the middle of the bus by the side door he 
gets down and looks under, finally ask him what he is looking for. he says 
the "Catalytic converter"   had to tell him, engine is in rear and there 
never was a converter on it,  really had a strange look.

as expected I did fail but was looking for possible hint as to why gas 
mileage is so bad (5-6mpg) but the van was very close to passing so it 
leaves me with more questions than answers????
