You can really see this coming just by looking at the split window bus
market. When I got my first splitty, prices were such that a project
could be picked up for $500 and less, and I actually got my first one
which was nice, but needed a motor for $1000. Now I see people post a
find to the list and everyone is excited when a bus that is just a
clean foundation for a rebuild is $3500. Now that I've left the area
where they could be found fairly cheaply, I rather despair of ever
having a chance to own a splitty again. Plus their parts are roughly
double the cost of bay parts.
