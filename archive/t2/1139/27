yeah the problem I have is the guy who worked on my engine and REALLY knew 
type 4 engines moved 300 miles away, just a little for to go for a tuneup.

wish there was someone local with type 4 engine experience (Baltimore MD) 
that could just swap notes or sad stories with even.  there is one guy but 
he has a 1600 engine and really knows that but is lost with fuel 
injection..
