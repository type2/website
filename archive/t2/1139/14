Subject: QU RE replacing bushing on rod under shifter

Daughter said shifting was sloppy, bushing in front of the shifter cup 
on the rod is kaput.  She has the part (nylon bushing doughnut) but a 
check of the archives/Ratwell pages (BTW, Richard, the pics do not load; 
says access denied) does not make clear if the rod can be split at the 
coupling midway or must be at the shift coupling box in the rear?   What 
is the sequence re shift to which gear, uncouple rod, shift again?, 
remove shift lever and slide rod out of bushing?
