I met only one of the guys, I presume the other was too shy to leave the hotel
room, but yes - traveling from Pennsylvania to Oklahoma.

I don't know the history of this engine, since communication was sparse at
best.  He was able to read lips.

The engine compartment was at least well maintained - fairly clean, seal
intact, Weber progressive.  He had a set of Solexes to put on.

I was concerned that the points did not seem to be maintained - the felt in
the distributor shaft was dry also (I forgot to check the mechanical advance,
even though I set the timing dynamically), but I WAS concerned that the timing
was way off (20 degrees).  I set it to what he told me - 5 degrees - and at
that setting, it seemed to idle fine at about 950 RPM.

He felt that the mixture was too rich, but since I didn't know anything about
the Weber, I left him to that.

I hope I didn't jinx myself (and the travelers) by saying "And they lived
happily ever after."
