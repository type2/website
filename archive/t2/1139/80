Subject: RE: [T2] Mufflers

Since we are on the topic of exhaust...I've recently been collecting parts
that were damaged during the rockslide I encountered back in December on my
trip back from McKinleyville,CA during that HEAVY storm here in the PNW.  I
found a moustache-bar locally, and I'll need to order mounts to replace the
broken ones.  Still need a heater box to replace the one that bent during the
same slide. My muffler looks like Spicoli smashed it into his
forehead(probably dating myself) and I've been eyeballing several replacements
within my budget.  As much as I'd like to put this:
http://www.cbperformance.com/catalog.asp?ProductID=1262 or this
http://www.cbperformance.com/catalog.asp?ProductID=1764
on the vehicle(1970 1600 S/P), they fall outside my constraints both
physically as well as economically.  Which leaves me looking at the standard
quiet-pack setups and the hideaway exhausts by CB and Bugpack.
Single: http://www.cbperformance.com/catalog.asp?ProductID=388, double:
http://www.cbperformance.com/catalog.asp?ProductID=387, and hideaway;
http://www.cbperformance.com/catalog.asp?ProductID=398.
One last possibility is this merged unit for smaller(mine) engines:
http://www.cbperformance.com/catalog.asp?ProductID=1634.
What experiences(if any) or thoughts do you guys have about these?  I REALLY
like the hideaway for the obvious reasons - invisibility and ground clearance.
I don't want to tear another exhaust off, and if I do I'd like to be able to
just replace the muffler to it.  The Sidewinder is a beaut, but 1K is outta
the park for me.  The thing I DON'T like about the merged setups is the amount
they protrude from the rear of the vehicle.  I don't want to see the
collector.  I've even seen some Type 181 exhausts modified to hideaway quite
nicely, but none are off-the-shelf bolt-ons.
I'd love your input!  Thanks.
Eron
