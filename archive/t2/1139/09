Subject: Vanagon/Calif Electronic coil cheap

Just received the coil I ordered from Rockauto.com. it is listed for the 82
Vanagon California model.
it is on clearance now at 23.79 . it is new old stock listed as Standard
Motor Products, but in actuality it is a Company called PVL, and
says made in W Germany on the top. seems like a nice piece if you have Calif
Van 79-83 and need a coil. PVL Part # 101-406 and
Bosch # 0.221.122.023.  includes mounting clamp.
