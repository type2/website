Yes, good point. I should have included that piece of trivia. I don't prefer
installing Compu-fire modules in customer's buses for that exact reason.
Down the road if they attempt to a simple cap and rotor replacement and
forget that important fact, the problems get bad quickly. Odd modifications
needed to make a "drop in" points replacement module work are just poor
engineering IMO.

Pertronix modules are more complex in their initial installation, but allow
regular service of the distributor to be the same as if using points.
However the drawback with Pertronix (at least in my experience as of late)
build quality and reliabilty has been poor.

Has anyone on the list used the relatively new Comp-u-tronix module?

I wouldn't recommend the HOT SPARK. They can't handle heat very well and
will melt without spreading CPU grease under the unit before installation.
They need the advance plate to act as a heat sink.

Of course the CRANE unit is the best, but whoa!!!, the price...
