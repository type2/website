Subject: Re: Mufflers

The UK folks have had good stainless exhausts, including mufflers, for a long
time, for a wide range of vehicles.  (Also good vehicle-specific,
sound-deadening kits for engine and road noise.)  Not cheap but good for
salted winter roads.  I always wondered why they were not more present in the
collector car market here.  It's not like folks dont spend (big) money on
their rigs. jon

You only really own those things you can carry under both arms at a dead
run... (Robert A. Heinlein)
to drop any money on an exhaust I would buy a vintagespeed unit.

I just installed a vintagespeed muffler on a customer's '71 T2a. I was VERY
skeptical, but the build quality is absolutely incredible. I couldn't build
one for the price. Full stainless, sounds excellent with the right balance
of acoustics. Great flow characteristics. 2 week delivery. I am considering
ordering one of each model. One for my '68 T2a and one for my '78 T2b with
'72-'74/'79 exhaust. I think they are the best value out there. No
disrespect to Jake Rabe of course.
