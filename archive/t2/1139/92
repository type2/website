Subject: Re: [T2] Mufflers

I apologize if I wasn't clear: You are correct, it is a direct bolt on (if
we are talking about this:
http://www.tangerineracing.com/Type4ExhaustHeaders.htm). However, the header
forces the muffler into the same space under the rear bumper that my
welded-to-frame hitch occupies.

I have found I cannot attach any muffler I've tried after installing a
header (much as I would love one), as my massive tow hitch gets in the way
of the muffler - so, a performance muffler of the same/ similar stock
dimensions that might increase flow beyond what the stock one offers,
doesn't need a header, and bolts directly to the 79 heater boxes is of *
great* interest to me. That stainless one is the first possibility I've
seen.

I'll take your advice and chat with Chris. Merry Friday, Mike
