Hey there guys (and gals).  Nobody answered my Crane related query the other
day, so I'll try again.  Are the optical triggers available as a replacement
part?  Summit has them (CRN-700-0020) for $30.00, but I don't know if it comes
with any mounting hardware or not.
My other question was concerning the vacuum can on my distributor.
Aircooled.net sells a replacement can, but I'm not sure it will have the
proper 'pull' for my distributor.  It is sold as a replacement for all stock
SVDA distributors, and I don't know if any of you have used one or not.
Thanks again.
Eron
