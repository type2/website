Subject: Vacuum Can't?

Hi listees,
I have a 043 905 205H VW dizzy with a defunct canister on it.  I was looking
at the one on Aircooled.net's site and I was wondering if this 'universal' can
will work well enough on this distributor?  Has anyone given it a shot yet?
Also, I have a Crane ignition on the bus with the optical trigger in my 205T
dizzy.  I don't want to pull the trigger if I'm just going to add a second
distributor to the mix.  I'd like them to be 'plug-and-play' for that
nightmare switcheroo scenario we'd all like to avoid.
Eron
