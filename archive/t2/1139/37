I just installed one as well. It only fit after a VERY firm push from the
rotor. Then I had to pull the triggering collet off again and clean the
little pieces of plastic that scraped off of the collet, keeping the collet
and rotor from fully seating. Sometimes it takes about 3 tries to get it to
seat correctly. Not the best design.

That being said, some rotors are certainly taller than others and will need
a trim. I measured some of my rotors in my "big 'ol box of mixed rotors" and
they varied by about 1/2mm up to 2mm in height across all different brands
and locations of manufacture.
