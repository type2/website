Subject: Alt with built in Volt Reg???? See picture

Hey Y'all,
Can someone look at this picture (1600 DP) and tell me if the alternator pictured has a built in voltage regulator or do I need to wire it to a separate Voltage regualtor as I would a generator??? The terminals are marked "B+" and "D+"  Here's the link to the pic:
