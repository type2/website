This is a conversation you might want to have with Jake Raby.  Heck, you 
might even ask him how his exhausts (or the ones that he works with) 
compare to the Vintagespeed exhausts.  If there's anyone that would 
know, or have the data, it would be him.  You could also post the same 
questions on his forum or the shoptalk forums as I'm sure it's a common 
enough question.
