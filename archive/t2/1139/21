Hi Bob,

What were the numbers? knowing that may help us figure out where the 
problem is.

Summer of 08 I went through a similar problem with super-poor mileage. I 
went through the symptom charts and everything was within spec. Power 
was good and it ran cool but it was too thirsty to let lie.

The fix in my case was to swap the ECU/AFM/throttlebody/wiring harness 
as a set from a donor. IIRC they came from a Vanagon; if you get all 
four parts at once the year doesn't matter so much. Since then the 
mileage has been back in the usual 18-20 MPG (US gallon) range.


Happy Trails,
