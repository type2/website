Subject: Re: [T2] Canvas Top Installation - Karl Von Salzen or others?

Karl was very helpful in giving distributor specs to see if the SVDA 
Bosch Mexican distributor BusDepot sells really works for our busses.

Measure or compare carefully the dimensions of the old one to the new- 
our canvas was not tall enough at the higher end and I ended up stapling 
the canvas to the surface of the wood runners; not enough material to 
put around the runner strips.  Even then, pushing up the top is very 
tight at the last push; you can see the elbows pushing against the 
fabric from the outside.The stapling we covered with edging from a 
fabric store.
