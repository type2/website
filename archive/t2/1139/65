OK Mike:

Thanks for terrifying me with that video! 

Here is what I've learned from you all:

    * Get the Westfalia tent if I can.
    * Don't do it alone.
    * Don't do it while drinking or stoned. (I live in CA)
    * Get the one or two extra helpers and remove the top.  Comes out
      better that way.
    * Pay someone to do it for me (not an option this year <g>).
    * Don't film it while I'm doing the installation alone in my
      backyard in 120 degree heat.

Anything I missed?  Let me know.

I have three really good step-by-steps which are nothing like this vid. <g>

Thanks,

BEN
