Subject: Weak Starter (Part 2)

Thanks for all the suggestions re. my starter woes.  I pulled the starter last
weekend are replaced it with a one-year old Bosch that was in a parts van I
recently bought.  When I was hooking everything up I noticed that one of the 10
gauge double wires leading to a ring connector was frayed and practically ready
to break free.  The previous owner had wrapped the whole thing in electrical
tape (damn him.)  So I replaced it with the one in my parts van.  I  suspect the
frayed wire was the one leading to the B+ on the alternator.  Long story short,
she fired up right away and now the dash voltimeter is reading 13+ volts (before
it was around 12).    

My 20 year old starter was probably fine but not a bad thing to have much newer
one installed.

Adrian
