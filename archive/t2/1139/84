Hi Mike,

If recall, his Tangerine header and muffler exhaust claim a lower head temp
(as do his engines) - but from what I've generally read, the header is
usually required for a decent performance muffler. Since I'm stuck without
the ability to add a header (unless I have one made to dodge the hitch) I'm
stuck looking for a performance muffler that fits the same space as stock
and doesn't require a header for some performance (inmy case, performance
would mostly be lower head temps!), so I was intrigued by the stainless one
mentioned... I haven't seen anything like that at MassIVe. Still, it's been
a while since I've read over there; I should take your advice and go check
again. Merry Friday Volks. Mike
