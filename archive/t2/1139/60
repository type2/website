Lest anyone think this constitutes a contradiction of

	, lemme point out that these facts, on their face, are 
consistent.  They imply the quality control in Pertronix Inc was very 
poor, for some period(s).  I gather a similar fate befell awhile an 
eminent USA bloatocycle mfr, when taken over by AMF.
	Racer Phil was lucky; the other end of the quality 
distribution happened to pile up on poor Jim.
	What fraction of a given component can fail before a decent 
honest retailer gets plurry annoyed?  I have no experience, and Jim & 
our other dealers will I trust comment, but my guess is 5%.  If more 
than 1 in 20 causes a claim, the line is too unprofitable, if 
planning has assumed 0.1%.
	What fraction of field failures will be needed to cause an 
evil reputation for a solid-state ignition soupup kit?  5%   ?
	Please ignore my guesses, and I hope real numbers will be 
forthcoming from those who know as I sure don't.  But I do want to 
reconcile the two statements about Pertronix.  If a component has an 
inherent weakness and poor quality control, duds will reach retail 
too often.  The onus is now on Pertronix Inc to prove that they've 
overcome their earlier defects.

	Next stage to understanding this dismal digital age: a proven 
specimen, run in & emerged OK from the initial high-failure-rate 
'burn-in' period, is worth quite a lot more than a new specimen of 
the same component.  $5 for a 'burnt-in' diode, normally $0.50, was a 
late-60s example of the commercial value of this characteristic of 
some electronic eqpt.

	The potential for high reliability in solid-state electronics 
has been all to often eroded by short-sighted overstressing of 
components, and scanty testing before 'fit for sale'.
	I keep the original points/condenser going, but am interested 
to review from time to time the pros & cons of points-free modern 
soupup kits.  It sounds as if Pertronix is inferior to Crane, with 
respect to your chances of failure.
