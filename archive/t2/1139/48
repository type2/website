There's a video that was shot of a late vanagon canvas install At  
WetWesties ReUnion XIV. It will give you the general idea of what it  
looks like when a professional does it.  You can find it on Curt  
Long's Vimeo list:

The installer would be Kris Knight of Boise's Fine Auto Trim.  If  
you're in the Pacific Northwest, and you would rather spend your  
weekend doing something other than cursing the Westfalia factory, Kris  
is your man. He's done a couple for me and more than a few for friends  
and family. IMHO, having him do the deed is money well spent. (And  
when you're in Boise, you can lunch at the coolest pizza parlor on the  
planet. Flying Pie Pizza. <http://www.flyingpie.com/costaricastory/index.html
