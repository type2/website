Subject: Points Replacement Issues: Primer

So, the recent thread about points replacement modules got me to start
creating a list of known issues (to me). Know issues in the installation,
operation and reliability of various points replacement module as they apply
to Bosch SVA, SVDA, DVDA and "009" distributors. Not included are the
Pertronix and MSD style full distributors.

PLEASE contribute by adding missing information or correcting
misinformation, and maybe we can get something into the library for users.
Any questions on year specificity can be answered at Jim Thompson's very
thorough documentation in the Articles section of Type2.com. Any thing I am
not sure of has a question mark by it.

SVA - Single Vacuum Advance: 1968-1970 VW Type 2a
(NOTE: There are currently no replacement modules available for the SVA
AFAIK

DVDA - Dual Vacuum Dual Advance: 1971 Type 2a-early 1976 Type 2b?
(NOTE: The vacuum can has two ports, one for advance, one for retard)

SVDA - Single Vacuum Dual Advance: Late 1976-1979 Type 2b?
(NOTE: Not including 1979 California)

"009" - Dual Advance: N/A
(NOTE: Never installed on a bus from the factory)

Compu-fire
(http://www.compufire.com)
Specifics:
- Traditional style "drop in' points replacement.
- Uses a rotating trigger wheel with magnetic pickup
Limitations:
- Wiring from module is extremely heavy and stiff. Care should be taken to
thread the wires under the negative ground strap and tuck them securely
behind a piece of the advance plate, running against the body of the
distributor. If the wires are not firmly in place, the wheel of the
Compu-fire will eat through the wires.
- The square plastic grommet provided with the kit does not hold the wiring
firmly, so care should be taken to keep the wires from being tugged or
pulled once the module is in place.
- The square plastic grommet provided with the kit will not fit some DVDA
distributors. A rubber grommet from a hardware store will have to be used
with silicone to firmly keep the wires in place.
- The provided crimp-on wire connectors are of very low quality. Replace
with a waterproof style connectors, or give the connectors a strong crimp
and put some shrink tubing over the wire and connector to keep them from
pulling out.
- The Compu-fire needs a spacer (provided for SVDA models) to keep the
trigger rotor from rubbing against the pickup module.
- The distributors' rotor will need to be shaved down considerably to make
it fit once the module's trigger rotor is installed. The rotor should not be
able to be turned left or right and remain rigid after it is installed and
modified correctly.
- The 009 and SVDA modules and trigger rotor are exactly the same and are
interchangeable. The SVDA only needs the spacing ring
- Some have reported needing to use a in-line resistor from the wiring
harness of the vehicle to the + 15 side of the coil when using a non-Bosch
"black" or "blue" coil. Bosch coils should be manufactured with internal
resistance . Some Bosch "blue" coils are of varying quality so a Ohm
resistance test would be needed to determine compatibility.
Quality:
Average to Good

Compu-fire DIS-IX
(http://www.compufire.com)
Specifics:
- Non-Traditional style kit
- This kit can effectively remove the "dead spot from start" when running a
"009" distributor in a bus
- Kit uses a massively powerful spark and eliminates the cap and rotor.
- Commonly used in off-road applications
Limitations:
- Offered for the "009" distributor only
Quality:
Good to Very Good

Compu-tronix
(http://www.compu-tronix.com)
(This is a relatively new company which makes all sorts of claims on their
product being superior to any competitor. Evidence needed.)
Specifics:
- Traditional style "drop in' points replacement.
- Uses a "Pertonix Style" rotating collet for magnetic pickup
Limitations:
- No information
Quality:
- No information

Crane XR700
(http://www.cranecams.com)
Specifics:
- Traditional style "drop in' points replacement.
- Uses a rotating wheel with optical pick-up to trigger spark
Limitaitons:
- No information
Quality:
Good to Very Good
- According to users, the best solution of all of points replacement
solutions. Uses an optical pickup, not magnetic pickup like others.

Empi
(www.empius.com)
Specifics:
- Traditional style "drop in' points replacement.
- Uses a "Pertonix Style" rotating collet for magnetic pickup
Limitations:
- These replacement modules are often found hanging on your local VW shops'
wall. According to most aircooled VW shops they are "use at your own risk".
Not a good reputation but more evidence need to be collected.
Quality:
- Poor to Very Poor

Hot-Spark (http://www.hot-spark.com)
Specifics:
- Traditional style "drop in' points replacement.
- Uses a "Pertonix Style" rotating collet for magnetic pickup
Limitations:
- These units do not handle heat well. A thin layer of computer style
thermal paste (grease) is needed to keep the module from melting
- An in-line resistor is strongly recommended, even when running a Bosch
coil
Quality:
- Average to Poor

Pertonix Ignitor
(http://www.pertronix.com)
Specifics:
- Traditional style "drop in' points replacement.
- Uses a rotating collet for magnetic pickup
Limitations:
- The trigger collet is very difficult to seat correctly and requires a lot
of downward force to seat. Use the rotor as an installation tool. After
installation, remove the collet and clear out any loose plastic shavings and
re-seat. The collet should NOT wiggle back and forth after proper
installation
- Some have reported the rotor will need to be shaved down slightly to fit
- DO NOT INSTALL THE WIRES BACKWARDS. Pertonix modules are fragile in this
regard and will be immediately destroyed in a cloud of smoke. + or positive
wire RED goes to the + or 15 side of the coil. - or negative wire BLACK goes
to the - or 1 side of the coil.
Quality:
Average to Good

Pertonix Ignitor II
(http://www.pertronix.com)
Specifics:
- Traditional style "drop in' points replacement.
- Uses a rotating collet for magnetic pickup
Limitations:
- Offered for the "009" only.
Quality:
Unknown
