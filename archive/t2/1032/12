Subject: Wanted: Camper Parts (Socal)

Hi All,

I've committed to re-doing my bus from the inside out.  Once I finish
repainting/rustproofing the floor, I need "new" interior.

I'm looking for any leads on camper interior parts - bed, cabinets, etc. These
all seem too large to ship, so I'm hoping to find something somewhere around
Los Angeles. Any leads, please let me know..

Thanks!

Mark
