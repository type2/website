Subject: weird engine problem

Fuel injected 2.0 in a 78 bus, hydraulic lifters, original vac advance
distributor. Compression, 110, 115, 105, 110


Symptoms

While on a cruize today to town, weird thing happened.

CLimbing a hill the engine had a signifigant loss of power, and when I got to
the turn, and slowed down the oil light was on at idle.

Engine does not feel too hot, no CHT temp installed.

I'm thinking it is ignition related, as the fuel pump is 3 month old, fuel
injectors were cleaned by cruzing performance 6 months ago, but have never
changed the temp sensor, but I don't know if they cause symptoms like this?

Would a weak coil, or marginal points case this?  Or is the engine toast ?
When I first start it up in the mornings the oil light is staying on longer
than normal, I changed the oil pressure switch, and the delay was still there.

Any ideas would be appreciated.
