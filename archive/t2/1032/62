Rob et al,

The full story appears to be here:

I'm completely jealous and wish I: (a) had a bus back then, and (b) had 
known about the trip.

Bus Content/Trip Report:
-----------------------

Just got back from a weekend of touring in my '67:

Friday: Pittsburgh->Washington DC (including beers with Dolan)
Saturday: DC->Lorton, VA
Sunday: Lorton, VA -> Elkton, MD/Newark, DE
Monday: Newark, DE -> Pittsburgh

Bus ran cool for most of the trip with the average cruising speed between 
55-60 mph.  I had to occaisionally dial it back to 53-55 for cooling.  No 
major problems, just some minor water leaks (despite new windshield 
rubber!) in the rain.  Still plagued by minor oil leakage from the oil 
filter/cooler hoses, about a half to three quarters of a quart in ~800 
miles.  Oh, and the rear hatch opener/button doesn't want to come back 
out, making it impossible to open.

Total mileage covered: ~730 miles
Mileage on engine since rebuild: ~13,000

Next steps:
 	-pull snow tires
 	-purchase 15" tires for 15" rims I acquired last winter
 	   (apparently Cooper is no longer producing the 195R15s.  Boo!)
 	-valves/timing
 	-fix rear hatch
 	-clean/air-out inside of bus
 	-wash bus
 	-pressure wash undercarriage and find someone to oil it with
 		bar/chain oil
 	-change oil (it's gotten to looking dark and it's summertime-ish)

 	-find VW-friend body shop in PGH and get estimate on restoration
 		+ paint (seam rust, minor dings, screw holes, rain gutter
 		seal).  Suggestions/price guesses welcome.


Cheers,
