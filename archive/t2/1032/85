Subject: RE: [T2] Roof Rack Question

Russell,

 

I'm just trying to fit it to a Bay ('68-'79). I don't have any splitties
(look nice, miserable to drive).

 

The rack is stock, which has me scratching my head. The PO swears he had it
on his '74, but what makes me suspicious is he said he used it on his
Vanagon as well...

 

Anybody know how to track ZVW numbers?

I'm sure splitties are narrower and the roof seems to bulge up a bit more,
but after 67 they are the same from 68-79.
But that doesn't really match what you're describing, unless you're trying
to fit to a pre-68.  Is it possible that the second one got squished out of
shape?
