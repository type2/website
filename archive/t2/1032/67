Ha, ha - after re-reading my post I see there could be some confusion...

It is the JAW that needs a case, not the LC-1

I haven't put it in yet; its on my list of spring things to work on:

LC-1 install
Transistor mod on CPU to boost signal
Lock the distributor and switch to programmable timing
Drop fuel tank, clean out and stop filler neck leaks
Replace the propane tank with new
Replace hyd lifters with new set
Get fridge to light on propane ...

and on it goes.
