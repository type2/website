Your are all nuts! :)

Buy a table jack and a set of wheel ramps. That way you can use the "table"
on the table jack as a "table" when you are not using it! A ATV jack, floor
jack, transmission jack, etc are all single use specific. Table jacks are
all about multipurpose.

Chris (BustedBus) and I use these exclusively. And we have pulled, oh I lost
count at 50, motors and trannys in the last 3 years.

For those of you who jack up the rear of the bus, It's important that 
the engine/trans end up  PARALLEL to the floor the jack is rolling on. 
Otherwise you have to raise/lower the jack as you roll it, a real PITA 
when reinstalling, as the tranny shaft must be parallel to the line of 
the crank for easy meshing! I roll the bus onto short ramps around 6" 
high, remove the bumper, and jack up the front until the bus is parallel 
to the floor.  71 bus was easy; one can ramp the rear, then drop engine 
with tranny onto a block until it is automatically parallel- and easier 
to get to the upper mounting bolts behind the fan shroud.

  back, put jack stands under the middle then use the
  trolley jack up front and the customized atv jack for
  the engine. Raise the jack in the front to lower the
  back; lower the jack in the front to raise the back!
