resource, Marcus, Karl. I see that on the Parts List on this page
:*http://tinyurl.com/3lfnv3*thatsome parts list part numbers, and some say
NLA. If there is a part number,is there a chance the part is available?
Thanks, Andy

No longer available is no longer available.  The program has not dropped the
part number yet..... but it will on its next version/update.

I hate that about VW..... once the part becomes NLA, the part number
vaporizes.

Not like Mercedes, when a part becomes NLA, the part number stays so you can
track it.
