I don't want to modify it. I'd rather sell it to someone who has the right
model of VW.

Good idea though for a universal rack fit.

   I made mine from an old "universal" roof rack that
   mounted to a rain gutter...I took the feet off and
   chucked the rest. The Bay roof has a bow in it that
   makes regular racks unfittable...I cut oak blocks to
   raise the level of the rack above the roof... ;-)
