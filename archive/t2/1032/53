Inspired by the fact that I left our Westy parked in the lane for
six months (vanagon content), a few years ago our neighbour purchased
an early '70s "project" (cough, cough) westfalia bus.  Photos are here:

He has done nothing with it in the past few years and now the city
has asked him to remove it.

Are there any parts on the bus that would be especially valuable?  Or,
is there anyone in VW land who would be interested in it?  (feel free
to forward this message to a more appropriate list...)
