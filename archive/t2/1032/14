Subject: Unexpected find, trip to Inuvik '96

Last Monday while north bound on I-5 in Yreka, CA I (again) saw the 
VW wrecking yard and after I thought about it this morning I went to 
the type2 archives to see if I could find it. I did and as a plus I 
found this very well told story of the trip to the Arctic Circle back 
in 1996. I remembered watching the planning and some of the trip 
posts. I was in Michigan at the time and going along was not an option for me.
