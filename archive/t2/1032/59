Tabe, Paul or whomever,

There are a lot of goodies on that bus since it is a '72.

Bumpers and splash pans, lenses, guage cluster, interior, master-cylinder
and brake booster, dash, radio, clock and gas heater (if they are there). I
could go on and on. If you have time, you could pull it apart and sell the
pieces. Just have to make sure it is worth your time.

Too bad it is rotting away. It could make a nice bus for somebody since it
appears to be intact.

Inspired by the fact that I left our Westy parked in the lane for
six months (vanagon content), a few years ago our neighbour purchased
an early '70s "project" (cough, cough) westfalia bus.  Photos are here:

He has done nothing with it in the past few years and now the city
has asked him to remove it.

Are there any parts on the bus that would be especially valuable?  Or,
is there anyone in VW land who would be interested in it?  (feel free
to forward this message to a more appropriate list...)
