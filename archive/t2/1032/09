I'm confused by this response.  I can understand the thought that maybe
you can't move the engine around enough when its sitting on a jack like
that.  But the next sentence throws me because it would imply (at least to
me at this early hour of the morning :D ) that you are using the atv jack
to jack the bus itself up, and using some other jack to drag the engine
out.  If that's the case, yeah...I don't think this jack would work well
in that application either.  Personally I jack the bus up with my floor
jack and put it on stands, then use my atv jack (like the one you have
pictured) to lower the engine on to and pull the engine back with.

Peace, Troy
