Subject: Need rear bumper "T" mounts for my 77 Westy

The PO had some bodywork done on the bumper and they welded the T mounts to the frame. I would like to cut them off as they are ratty anyway, and bolt them properly to the frame, then to bumper. Does anyone have a parts van they have good rear bumper T mounts on, and would move them along at a reasonable price?
Thanks,
Courtney
