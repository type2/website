And here's another twist: I jack the bus up in the
back, put jack stands under the middle then use the
trolley jack up front and the customized atv jack for
the engine. Raise the jack in the front to lower the
back; lower the jack in the front to raise the back!

The ATV jack I have has a safety lock with several
notches which is sometimes a big help but often a
detriment as, if you needed to lower it just a tad and
forget to disable the next notch, it will engage to
the notch right when you need it to lower and then you
have to raise it a lot to disengage the safety.

It helps if you make an adapter that properly fits the
engine. I have one carriage adapter for engine +
transaxle and one for engine only.

I can see where maneuverability would be an issue if
you don't have a smooth floor. I work on a dirt floor
but place a piece of plywood (old sign) down so I can
easily move the atv jack this way and that. The Subey
with tranny is still not too heavy to slide the whole
unit sideways if I have to, also. -BaH
