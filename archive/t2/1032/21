Subject: Starter Motor Runs When Connected to Battery; Does Not Turn

Hello
   
  The subject just about sums up my woes.
   
  The starter motor runs when the battery is connected.  The key does not have to be in the "on" for this to happen.  The engine does not turn over at all.  
   
  I checked all of the wires, and the only one that needed to be replaced runs from a small box to the solenoid.  After reading the archives, I learned about people installing Ford Solenoids, along with the VW solenoids.  However, this box only has "Electrical System" printed on it (no Ford emblem/words).  
   
  Also, the cables spark when I attach them to the battery.  So, I checked all of the fuses for a short in the van, and the starter motor ran everytime I connected the battery with a different fuse missing.  How can it still run, if its fuse is removed?  
   
  Do I need a new starter?  What is the "Electrical System" box?  
   
  The problems began when I stalled out at a red light.  My condenser was shot, and the wire was fried.  After replacing that, the starter began to act up.  While the van was running, it would stall out when I would slow down.  I would have to pump the gas to keep if going.  ...And it would also have trouble running if I had too many electrical outlets on (radio, headlights, turn signals, etc.).
   
  Any tips are really, really appreciated!!
