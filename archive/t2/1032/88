Subject: bearing seal replacement

Hi to the list,

 

My son is driving my 73 Bus and came home the other day with a smoking rear
wheel - after it cooled down I pulled the drum and discovered black gook
coating the inside of it. Seeing as the wheel cylinder still looked dry - I
am assuming a bearing grease seal has gone. How difficult is this to
replace? Any tips or tricks? I've never replaced them before. I was also
wondering if I should replace the bearings? Bentley shows bearing being
pressed in and out. Can it be done by hand? 

 

Your replies are greatly appreciated

Ps what size is the big nut on the rear drum of a 73 bus and do I really
need to torque it past 300 ft. lbs?
