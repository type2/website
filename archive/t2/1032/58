Subject: Re: [T2] Starter Motor Runs When Connected to Battery; Does Not

What it sounds like you have is a hard start relay and its gone bad. or it  
could be a bad ignition switch. and last but not least a bad starter solenoid. 
 
Il the little box is black and about 3 x 3 cm and can be unplugged, then do  
that and see if you can connect the battery.
 
If you don't have a hard start relay problem then unplug the red wire  from 
the starter solenoid and see if you can connect the battery.  
 
 
Just my thoughts with out getting my hands bloody and dirty.
