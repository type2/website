Subject: Re: [T2] To seal or not to seal...

In a message dated 4/8/2008 7:49:32 A.M. Eastern Daylight Time,

1) Do I  have to seal the flywheel seal to the crankcase using something
like Curil  (sealing compound)?
(2) Do I have to set the endplay when reusing the old  flywheel? (I did
only a top end rebuild, no modifications to crankcase,  etc.)

Help is as always greatly  appreciated.

Cheers,

Timo



hey Timo  I don't seal the seal to the crankcase, I do seal the o ring  
inside the flywheel and the surfaces where the flywheel meets the crank.   You 
should reset your end play also  later  mark  D
