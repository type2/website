Thanks Chuck, but I believe the mounts are different on the 72. The ones I
need are from a 73-79? What's up with ICBC this time? They are unbelievable to
deal with.

  . Does anyone have a parts van they have good rear bumper T mounts on, and
  would move them along at a reasonable price?

  unless someone buys my 72 as a complete unit, I'll be cutting it up in the
  coming weeks. If anyone else needs some bits, let me know, it was a
complete
  running westy not so long ago, but is falling victim to ICBC paperwork
  labyrinth.
