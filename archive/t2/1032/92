KMM doesn't make brake parts, they distribute parts and they probably  
find the cheapest supplier they can and box the parts in their  
packaging. it's a miserable practice which is all too common in the  
auto parts business. your master is probably made in china.

as a general rule of thumb, use only ATE brake hydraulic parts, if  
they are available. ATE was the OEM on almost all older VW vehicles  
and most of these applications are still covered by genuine ATE  
parts. the quality is the best available and there is never a problem  
with their parts. FAG is another good german manufacturer of brake  
hydraulics, but in my opinion and experience ATE is made slightly  
better than FAG.

we will not use or sell anything from VARGA or any of the other off- 
brand brake hydraulics manufacturers, with the exception of front  
cylinder for split and early bay. the german stuff is no longer  
readily available for those vehicles, so Varga it has to be. there is  
just no point is trying to find cheap brake hydraulics that work  
properly. stick with ATE and you'll be happy and safe, and the bigger  
hole in your pocketbook will be forgotten soon enough.
