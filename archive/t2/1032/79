Subject: no reverse,any suggestions?

Hello?I am new to the list...?I have a '78 bus and ?my reverse gear went out on me the evening before I lost all four gears.luckily?I was close to home and discovered that the square head set screw that connects the front and rear shift rods had stripped.after hours of tapping and re-threading a new screw in there?I gained 1-4 back ;however, my reverse gear seems to be non-existent. I am able to shit throughout the forward gears with no problem,but when I try to get into reverse it stops me before it can engage,it's almost like trying to shift with no clutch,but only when going into reverse.any suggestions? thank you
