I haven't seen it mentioned, but what a joy this jack is to use on a '71.

With the engine resting on the two tines, one lowers the jack, grabs 
the handle and just rolls it out.  No tilting. No rotating. No 
coaxing. One can even leave the rear bar on the engine.
Later on, one drops the engine on the jack and rolls it in until the 
bolts from the bell housing slide in.
It is almost a reason in itself for owing the vehicle.
