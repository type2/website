I don't remember the discussion but basically the concept is that when
carbs are cold the fuel can condense in the manifold causing the engine
to run lean and stall, buck, etc. This is particularly apparent with our
old friend the Weber progressive as it has particularly long manifold
runners. One of the ways to help warm up the carbs is to feed in warm
air off the engine. However, once everything is warmed up the engine
will perform better with cool air. To accomplish this, most vehicles
have a thermostatically controlled flap in the air cleaner housing that
lets in warm air until it reaches a certain temp.
