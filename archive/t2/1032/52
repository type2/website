Happy KvS Day! 

I still have those bright green, rust free doors that
you sent me about 6 or 7 years ago. That is sad huh? I
had to sell the bus that I bought them for but I kept
the doors. They are still rust free and will one day
be replacements for my 68 bus when I get to it
(hopefully not another 7 years). Anyway, Thanks for
everything Karl!!!
