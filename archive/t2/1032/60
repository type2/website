Subject: Spotted at Home Depot-inexpensive torch/lighter

Less than $6, refillable Benzomatic Flexible Lighter with bonus butane 
refill and LED light that is actually bright.  Has a 7" flexible twisted 
metal wand that can be bent to reach into lanterns or windproof candles. 
I was surprised when I clicked it on that it is acutally a torch; you 
could solder with this sucker!
