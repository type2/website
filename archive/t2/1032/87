Subject: bad master cylinder

Hi,

Here's my ongoing problem. I've been working on my 83 Vanagon's hydraulics -
replaced every component except the steel lines and the servo, but try as I
may, my brakes wouldn't bleed!!! (I tried "bench bleeding" ,using the
MityVac , had someone push down slowly on the pedal while I opened the
valve, had some one pump the pedal, tried bleeding the the furthest cylinder
- didn't work.)

So I take off the new master cylinder (KMM brand) and it's wet with brake
fluid on the backside and the booster has oil on it. So I'm thinking this is
a bad master cylinder! Right?? and replace it with another new KMM unit -
from the same place.  I bolt it all up and once again get nowhere with the
bleeding. So. I take off this MC and this one is also wet on the backside
where the pushrod engages. Now before I go fire bomb my parts dealer, tell
me if I am wrong or is this also a bad master cylinder??? Should there be
fluid on the backside? Am I doing something wrong when I install the unit.
As a side note, each of these new MC's had some surface rust on the outside
of the unit - was this foreshadowing or is this normal?

 

Any replies greatly appreciated,

PS - any brand recommendations for master cylinders? (besides KMM)
