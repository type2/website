Great idea, Jamie. I own, and have used the torque tool from CIP, 
http://www.cip1.ca/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=ACC%2DC10%2D7036  and can 
attest to how well it works on Beetles. This model is for 36mm though, and 
not available in 46mm. I use a 3/4" socket set to do my 46mm. You can pick 
them up pretty inexpensively, and for the amount used, will be sufficient. I 
_have_ broken 1/2" drive breaker bars trying to remove axle nuts in the 
past. Fortunately, they had a lifetime guarantee. :)
