Subject: Roof Rack Question

I have a couple of examples of roof racks that I have been measuring for a
restoration. One fits, one doesn't.

 

The first one that fits:

54.5" across from mounting foot to mounting foot

10.5" from bottom of the foot to the bottom of the rack

 

The second one is too wide and too short (it sits directly on the metal of
the roof with no gap and the feet won't fit in the gutters):

57" across from mounting foot to mounting foot

8" from bottom of the foot to the bottom of the rack

 

It is strange, because both came from bay window buses (not 100% verified
though). The ZVW number off of the second one is ZVW153204.

 

What is this rack from? Is there a difference in roof contours or widths on
Bays? I was under the impression that the contour was the same from like
'58-'79 type 2's. This isn't a Vanagon rack is it? I've never seen a steel
industrial rack on a vanagon.

 

It is a very nice, nearly new rack. Please help with this little mystery!
