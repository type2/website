Subject: To seal or not to seal...

Hello all,

I've been doing some process on rebuilding my engine (Pictures here:
http://tinyurl.com/5nmspp). New AMC heads installed using special
washers under the nuts that bolt the head to the studs. The rebuilder
gave me very thick washers with a slight radius on one side.
(http://tinyurl.com/3ked77) Anybody know why these are better than the
stock ones? I installed a CHT gauge under #3 spark plug with the head
modifications according to the germansupply article. I routed the sender
wire through the engine tin by cutting a hole and using a rubber
grommet. You can also take a look at the "old" heads here
http://tinyurl.com/5zfp9o and here http://tinyurl.com/6o5a9a (bought a
complete rebuilt engine 4 years ago). They look especially bad at the
valve seats (small hole, dents, etc.). This seems to be really crappy
work!

Since I discovered some oil in the bellhousing, I replaced the drive
shaft oil seal in the tranny. Now I'm going to replace the flywheel seal
as well.
My questions:
(1) Do I have to seal the flywheel seal to the crankcase using something
like Curil (sealing compound)?
(2) Do I have to set the endplay when reusing the old flywheel? (I did
only a top end rebuild, no modifications to crankcase, etc.)

Help is as always greatly appreciated.

Cheers,

Timo
