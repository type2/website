Subject: Re: [T2] 77 bus exhaust

The biggest beef I have with this style of exhaust is that the materials and
assembly quality is rather poor.  These are made in the Far East and
distributed by EMPI to CIP, Mid America, etc., from a poor quality copy from
a much better USA made quality BUT no longer made assembly by Pacesetter
Exhaust from around 10 to 15 years ago - in fact.  I've never gotten one to
last more than a couple of years in dry climates, much shorter in wet
climates - unless you get it ceramic coated for longevity.  Just my nickel's
worth of past experience.

YMMV
