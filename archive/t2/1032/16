The ATV jack won't get the engine clear if the bus is jacked high enough to
get the engine under it. Is that what Dan's talking about?

Troy and I found out the hard way the best solution was to leave the bus
down, get the engine loose, jack the bus, lower the jack, then slide the ATV
jack with the engine out.

Am I missing something obvious in this discussion?

(BTW: The ATV jack has a larger spread at the engine than the motorcycle
jack I looked at once at HF. That's really important.)
