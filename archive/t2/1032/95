Subject: 77 bus exhaust

On this page there is a picture of 6 mufflers, I want a muffler for my 1977 bus that looks like the one in the bottom left hand corner http://www.mamotorworks.com/acvw-5-53-5095.html

Does anybody know where I can get one?  Preferably used but I will go new if necessary.

Halsey was no help, the only thing they would sell me was a QuietPack which I am not interested in.

My brother-in-law bought one from somebody off Craigslist for his bus to replace his QuietPack so I know that they are available for the '77.

Thanks,

James in Portland, Oregon


Longer story - my muffler clamp busted again and the weight of the muffler tore the elbow on the long descent into Eureka, California last weekend, I don't know how long I drove that way, I didn't hear it until I got into town and found something for the sound to bounce off.
