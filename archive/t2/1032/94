Hey Greg,
Reply to an old post, but we finally got the new 2L engine in and 
running like a champ.

I was looking at this post and wondering about the jets that you 
recommended.  He currently has 40mm Kadrons with the stock jetting that 
was being used on his 1.7L engine.  I don't think it was rejetted 
specifically for that engine and I don't know how the Kadrons are jetted 
  out of the box.

Would those jets that you recommended fit in the Kadrons and provide 
proper fueling?

Thanks!
Mike
