it's on the south side of town, on the east side of I-5.

You can see the yard heading northbound on I-5, just before you enter 
the town.  I think it might be a repair shop with a "parts yard" out 
back.

Lot's and lots of VW buses, vanagons, and cars.  I stopped in once a 
few years ago, I needed a few things.

Perhaps the owner was in a grumpy mood or I wasn't a large enough 
customer, but he basically shooed me away....most negative experience 
I had in the VW community.
