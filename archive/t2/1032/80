Subject: Rear Extension Tents by Fly Away Designs

All,
   
  Stephanie sent me a nice note saying there is interest on this site regarding the Rear Extension Tents we offer in our advertisement on The Samba.  If you have questions or would like to see photos, please contact us directly at the following e-mail address:
   
  flyawaydesigns(-at-)yahoo.com
   
  We alos have a website, but it is a bit out of date and we need to get in and fix it.  Please bear with us.  It tells a bit about who we are and it shows some photos of Bob (our 1979 Rivera Bus) and the Rear Tent Extension.  The price shown in the website is NOT correct.  The ad on The Samba is up to date.
   
  Website:  www.flyawaydesignsonline.com 
   
  Search for our ads my using our name - flyawaydesigns - both ads should come up.
   
  We alos have many photos on The Samba that may be of interest to you....many of Bob out camping and many of our other vehicles....a 1969 Porsche 912, a 1974 Porsche 914, and our recently acquired 1969 VW Karmann Ghia.  There are other miscellanewous cool pics we have there too.  We love our air cooled vehicles!!
   
  We offer several models in several colors.  Each unit is handmade and is custom to your specific order.  They are very high quality and meant to last.
   
  We also make decorative beaded Rear View Mirror Dangles for your bus or other vehicle.  We also have an ad on The Samba for those.
   
  We look forward to hearing from you, and thank you to Stephanie for mentioning us on your great site!
