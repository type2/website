I am amazed at the number of folk who think that you can put 250+ ft-lbs
through a 1/2 inch square drive!  You might get away with it occasionally,
but you'll waste more time in returning broken tools than you save money
by not buying a proper 3/4" socket set.

I broke down and bought the 1-13/16 socket and slide bar at Sears, which
set me back a bit of change.  Never had to make a return trip, though.
The English size sockets are identical to the metric size sockets and cost
about $5 less.  They are also more likely to be stocked locally.

If you're on a budget, large socket sets are available from Harbor
Freight.  The Chinese are pretty good at making large hunks of metal.
