Subject: Help needed in Pasadena, CA

Nikki sold her bus to someone who is trying to drive it home.  They have
broken down in Pasadena, CA and she called me asking who lives in that
area.  The only entry I see on AIRS is Mike Darrow, who lists himself as
"emergency only." If anyone lives in the area who can help this person,
please get in touch.  Also, if anyone can recommend a good shop in Pasadena,
please let me know and I will pass the information along.

I used to have a link to a list of VW repair shops by state, but I can't
find it now.  anyone?
