Subject: Re: [T2] Starter Motor Runs When Connected to Battery; Does Not

here are some guesses for you....

main battery cable connected to the wrong stud on the starter...
--this causes starter to turn as soon as battery connected,, and the drive
does not engage the flywheel.
it sounds as if the starter solenoid is bypassed, and the current is just
going to the motor

NO fuses are in the [factory] start or ignition circuit... other than the
one that MAY be in the aftermarket relay some folks install.
there are NO need for fuses in this circuit if wired as per the factory...
and that one in the relay can be bypassed when used in this application...
the fuse is put there,, as that relay is designed for a trailer package...
not this application,, but works and has pro's and con's in this application

the common relay used is a Hella.. WR-1 kit

You said "The problems began when I stalled out at a red light.  My
condenser was shot, and the wire was fried.  After replacing that, the
starter began to act up."

... and now ,, the starter turns but the flywheel doesn't..

I would pull the starter.. if just for routine maintenance anyway...
inspect it.. and if the gears,, and wiring appear in good shape,, and the
bushing in the bellhousing is good.. reinstall it..

then go searching for another wire that got fried when you had the condenser
problem... if the green wire fried to the points,, it sounds like the
ignition coil was bypassed as well...  usually this happens when the coil
power is put on the wrong terminal... not at the lights when it stalls...
and no one tampered with it to make it fry.

try those..  report back your findings,, see where that takes you..
