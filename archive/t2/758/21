Hi Charles,

The BN-4 was fitted in buses up to 1974. It fits fine with dual  
carbs, unless the left side of the engine bay is already being used  
for an auxiliary battery as was done with some westies.  The ducting  
enters the passenger compartment just inboard of the left rear wheel.


Happy trails,
