You'd probably get away with it with a pict-1 style carb, but it seems as
if the pict-3 carbs with the air volume screw are more touchy.  This gas
was really cloudy and the cloudyness didn't settle out, so I've a feeling
that the cloudyness was probably minute varnish particles that clung to
the surfaces where the gasoline vaporized.
