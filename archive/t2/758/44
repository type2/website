Ok, so it's been a long day of working on the van ... in the street
... I finally ended up getting a tow from town to my house, which was
a pretty penny, but worth it since it will take some time to diagnose
this properly.

What I did today was this:

I adjusted the valves, 3 and 4 were very tight, but not burned.  I
didn't check cyl's 1 and 2 although I will tomorrow.  I also checked
the fuel pump/tank by having someone crank the engine at the ignition
and watching fuel SPURT out of the line.  It seemed like a very
healthy amount of fuel, so I think the fuel related problems can be
ruled out.

I guess it is probably something internal.  We'll see what the valves
look like tomorrow.  I'm getting a compression tester tomorrow too, so
that will be useful in the diagnosis.  I also haven't ruled out
carburetor problems.  However, as the van is a 72, I don't have the
hatch in the rear to access the engine from above, so any carb work I
do will involve removal also.  I've never taken the carb out, but it
should be safe ... right?

Thanks, I feel better now that she's home.  I'm planning on doing more
work, so you'll all be hearing from me again.

Peace,
