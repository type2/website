Subject: Re: [Bulk] [T2] need a starter in Las Vegas

In that case, I should be able to take two wires and bypass the ignition switch.
I have a push button switch and big gauge wire that I can use. How should I
install that button (what wires sould be in contact) in order to get the
starter running will my key is at the start position? I suspect that I should
match the red with the Red and black, I this right? I have already done that in
my previous golf and it worked for many years...

Thanks
