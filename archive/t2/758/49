Subject: Advice needed on installing a new beam

Bonjour from Montreal!

I'm about to embarc on the installation of a new axle beam on my 77 Westy.
I have unlimited access to a lift so access will not be a problem.
I've read the material in the Type2 library and did a word search in the archives.
Haven't found much info.

I do have the Bentley manual.
I'm handy but certainly not a mechanic...

I have specific concerns about removing the torsion arms/ torsion spring assemblies and reinstalling them in the new beam.
My ball joints are tight but at least one boot needs changing. Should I change all the other 3 while they are easily accessible?

Any and all advice, tips, words of the wise and knowing will be appreciated.
I can read all I can but nothing beats the hands on experiences of those who've been there.

Thanks in advance

Mitch
