"how did you deal with a 12mm sensor ring and a 14mm spark plug?"

I too just ordered a Dakota cylinder head temp guage this week after reading 
Richard's postings on Samba.  To get the longer temp sensor wiring harness, 
I emailed Dakota temp support.  I got a quick response back from Mike 
Merritt at Dakota, and he added as an online order option an 18 foot harness 
on this page:

I asked Mike about geetting a larger sensor ring, and he suggested boring 
out the original one with a step drill.  I think I'll try a dremel, or order 
a larger ring from an electronic supply house.
