Good info!  Thanks! ;-)

Steve, can you please, please, please post the already-scanned pages to
the web??  Please???  Seriously, I would really appreciate it if you get
a chance. If you want, I can post the images somewhere for you, like on
ImageStation or something - I find that's an easy and reliable place to
put stuff and link to.  Feel free to PM them to me if you would like me
to do that.

I wonder if it would at least be possible to hook some duct and a
computer fan to the furnace to circulate the heat...maybe a project for
the fall...

Thanks again,
Jeremy
