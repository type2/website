Subject: RE: [T2] brakes and broken bleeder valve

I am not sure if it leaks or not. I am guessing that if the screw was turned
all the way in, then it should not leak. Could I fill the hole with JB Weld
and forget about it for now?

Don't worry about it!  You only need the top one to bleed your brakes.
