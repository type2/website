When I was living in Canada I was burned buy both UPS and Fedex. Sometimes they show up at your door, demand money or they won't deliver. Other times you get a bill in the mail later.

Unforuntantely the inefficient CCRA inspects every Canada bound USPS package and opens up a lot of them. I used to hate going down to the customs office to get a package that was supposed to be delivered to my house. Sometimes they would try to charge me double duty on an item I had already paid duty on which I had sent back to the US for repair.

Free trade, my ass.
