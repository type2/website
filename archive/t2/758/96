eBay owns PayPal. And the Type 2 list is privately owned as well.
Yahoo lists suck.

PayPal: "PayPal, an eBay company"
T2 List: "   Domain Name: TYPE2.COM
   Registrar: TUCOWS INC.
   Whois Server: whois.opensrs.net
   Referral URL: http://domainhelp.tucows.com
   Name Server: NS1.EVERYDNS.NET
   Name Server: NS2.EVERYDNS.NET
   Name Server: NS3.EVERYDNS.NET
   Name Server: NS4.EVERYDNS.NET
   Name Server: NS1.TYPE2.COM"
