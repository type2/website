Subject: Re: [T2] brakes and broken bleeder valve

From Messa, Corbett:
I finally got my brake hoses from BD the other and got them installed on one side of the bus. I was cleaning 
out the bleeder valve screws and broke the bottom one off. It looked pretty rusted and I was going to replace 
it, but
once the wrench went on it and a little pressure was applied, it snapped. Has this happened to anyone and if 
so did you have any luck in using some screw extraction tool on it? The top screw looked good, but the bottom 
was almost gone, so I am not sure how hard it will be to get out.

Anyone got any advice on how to get it out without doing to much damage or would I be money ahead (and safer) 
to just get another set of calipers? I
already have a set of rebuild kits for the calipers if needed.

Don't worry about it!  You only need the top one to bleed your brakes.
