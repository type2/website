Subject: RE: [T2] tire math

I googled a few different terms like "tire size converter" and "tire
size when changing wheels" and this is a pretty handy calculator:

There were others, like I saw one that gave you the effect on your
speedometer reading if you change from one tire to another, etc.
Depends what math you're trying to do...

So, can someone write a java app to do the tire math so I don't have to
think?
