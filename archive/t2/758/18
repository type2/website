thanks for all the great replies guys.

my 76 is not fuel injected.  I don't know if that's normal or not, but
it has an intake manifold and a single 2 barrel (I think) carburetor.
So that ECM thing does not apply to me?  I wish it would as it sounds
like an easy fix.

I'll try those things tomorrow and write back with more.

Thanks!!!
