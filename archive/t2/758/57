Subject: Broken Thermostat Cable

The cable that runs from the thermostat to the flaps has broken at the
flaps end. Flaps are in the open position. No worries about cold start
conditions since it's 90+ here today.

Any ideas/info/contact on cable replacment for a good thermostat? Or
do I just use an old shoe lace and duct tape.

Sweating in MI,

Saw a late bay Kombi yesterday. There is one in A2!
