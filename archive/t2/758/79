Subject: Re: Stranded ... Bus won't run. --> Fixed?

today I got some great help from the neighbourhood mechanic.  I think
what happened was that the electronic ignition unit that someone
convinced me to install failed, and when I replaced the electronic set
with conventional points and condenser, some parts were missing.
Namely the screw to ground the condenser and a little tab or something
(perhaps?) to hold in the plug into the distributor.

So we found a donor screw and taped the plug in place, and the van was
running much more normally.  Still al little rough though.  He
suggested I reset the valves pointing out that the valve clearances
were much larger than .006".  I thought that I couldn't check the
valve gaps unless that particular cylinder was in firing position, but
he pointed out that the gaps should never be larger than .006" no
matter what position the cylinder was in.

Alas, I think all my troubles (and my large towing bill) were the
cause of a faulty electronic ignition, and faulty installation on my
part of new points/condenser.  I'm going to do the valves in a couple
of hours when the engine is cool.  Then we'll see how she runs ... I'm
excited.  I hope this works.

I still think giving the fuel tank would be a good idea.  I'll ask
about that on list later, don't worry.

Thank you all for your support and help.  I wish you many millions of
miles of freedom and joy with your VW's.
