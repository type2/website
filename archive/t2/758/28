Well here's what I've decided:

It is probably the fuel pump or tank, both of which I should check and
I need to clean the fuel tank anyways.  I need the engine out for both
of those things, so I may as well do some minor repairs while it's
out.  I've got all new hoses and everything ... anything else I
definitely have to do while the engine is out? Check seals ... I'll
probably do all I can, cash and time allowing.

You've all helped me tremendously, thanks so much.  With the breakdown
of the van, my partner and I have been talking about getting another
(possibly new) vehicle.  Cooresponding with you all on this list
always reminds me that I'll always want to be driving an air cooled,
and there' s no reason to get something new, so long as I'm willing to
work a little bit here and there to love my vehicle.

Peace and good wishes to everyone,
 - Ian
