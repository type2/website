Hi Jack,

My personal preference is US Postal Service. Note that this is VERY slow (~6
weeks) currently on the west coast.... the problem is with Canadian Customs.
East coast deliveries are not a problem. I wonder if this has anything to do
with the ongoing softwood lumber tarriff dispute???

UPS adds a $40 "brokerage" fee to a cross-border transaction, and should be
avoided where possible, particularly with low-value shipments.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
