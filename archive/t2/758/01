Subject: [T2]Trailer hitches from walmart?

has anyone here used the hithes that they have at walmart that is for a suv light truck and vans?
 
it mounts ot the rear frame and bumper and has the tounge where you can pull it in or out....?
looks like a westy type hitch.
 
curious is there a weight issue in buying this hitch and/or has anyone had any luck or bad from this type hitch?
 
i know walmart wil let me take it back if it dont work but i would liek to save some of that trouble... i must have a hitch by friday also whcih gives me two days now to get on the ball>?
 
any feedback is welcomed.. exspecially if you have seen or used this hitch from there?
 
peace
chris
