I'm in Las Vegas and my starter is strating to do crazy things like not
starting
everytime I commanded it to. A bit odd when trying to visit. I can still get
it
to start using a gentle touch... My fear now is that it migth die on me
soon.

So is it a place in Las Vegas (im in a campground on las vegas blvd) where I
migth get a starter rebuild today (I have to be back to san diego by
monday!)?
Moreover, does anyone have a place where I migth pull it out and place the
rebuild one?
