Subject: cooling flaps and thermostat

I've recently replaced the thermostat on my '79 Federal. The old
one was definitely dead. From the rear of the engine, one can see
the control rod and where the spring and cable attaches to the
rod. When my flaps are fully open, the cable attach point is straight
up vertical...I'll call this the 12 o'clock position looking at it
sideways from the drivers side. When my engine is cold and the flaps
closed, the attach point is at about the 10 o'clock position....pointing
toward the front of the bus. Is this correct?  I operated the flaps by
hand before attaching the cable and that's all it moved. Warmup is
definitely faster. I just want to make sure my flaps are functioning
properly. After installing the cable, I drove my bus to get the engine
hot. Then took the slack out of the cable from the fully open position.
I'm assuming I adjusted this correctly.
