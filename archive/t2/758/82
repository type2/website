I'm not sure what brand it was or anything.  It hooked up to the coil
with two wires, one positive and one negative, and it was a small
black box that fit inside the distributor where the points were.  I
could look at it for a brand name or mark or something and let you
know.  Pmail me for that.  I had a regular blue bosch coil.
