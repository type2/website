Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel tank cleanout -old gas ridding

Here's what I would do:

(1) Run it through the $20 Mr. Funnel F3C (http://www.mrfunnel.com/) that I
use to filter ANY gas that comes from a can
(2) Pour the clean (but still old) gasoline into the gas tank a gallon or so
at a time, diluting it in fresh gasoline.

Four gallons of gas, that's worth at least $10 these days...
