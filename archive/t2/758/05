Good suggestions Dave.  While I have done extensive work on the thermostat 
and its flaps, I have not double-checked the temperatures as you suggest. 
Those readings will go far to diagnose the oil flow.  I'll report back to 
the group when I take them.

BTW, those flaps are tricky!  It is very easy for them to be installed 
incorrectly when rejoining the fan housing to the engine block.  One must 
hold them "closed" or the springs will push them such that the operating arm 
moves and they work "backwards".  They are also easily bent.  It took me 
several hours of careful bending and testing to make them seal properly.  I 
went so far as to create new rubber seals for the edges (missing on one 
piece of tin) out of silicone sealer material.

Joe,

You didn't mention how you measured with the multimeter temp sensor...or
where?

Just for grins, beg, buy or borrow an infrared temperature taker and make
the engine it hot.  Then measure the surface of the oil filter at the
bottom(where it is easy to get to and see.

Also the temp on the bottom of the case...say at the oil change plate.

Tell us what you get.

It sounds like you have done everything....but!

You didn't mention verifying that the thermostat works and that the
flaps inside the air dist "case" work correctly....they are counter
intutitive(at least to me) and I spent a lot of time when I rebuilt mine
making sure that they operated free and correctly and that all of the
meeting surfaces were even and tight.

Are your heat dump pipes and flappers in place and working correctly?
see these here  http://www.shockwaverider.com/newbus/picture-005.html

Can you actually measure the temperature at the oil cooler(probe next to
it) that shows the same heat at what you are reading on your gauge?

My oil temp ran 226 at the oil filter after 23 miles in 90 degree weather
at 75-80mph.  Next day it was 216 on the same run.

The fact that your heads are "too" cool and your oil "too" hot is very odd
and I understand your bewilderment.

Cheers, dave
