From Messa, Corbett:

I am not sure if it leaks or not. I am guessing that if the screw was turned all the way in, then it should 
not leak. Could I fill the hole with JB Weld and forget about it for now?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It would not have broke if it was loose.  Don't waste the JBWeld on a closed hole.
