Subject: [T2] Spam

I don't know about you other T2 list members, but in
addition to the "Paypal" spam, most of my incoming T2
messages are now identified as spam, and automatically
arrive into my spam folder.  Speaking as a computer
geek, not a good sign.  Since I use Yahoo! for my
E-mail, that Yahoo! is losing control.  Yahoo! owns
Paypal.  The spam I just looked at was "from paypal." 
And Yahoo! owns this T2 database.  Looks like Yahoo!
might be losing the battle against spam.  Hopefully
this T2 list doesn't degenerate in quality any
further.
