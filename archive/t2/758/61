Subject: need a starter in Las Vegas

Hi everyone!

I'm in Las Vegas and my starter is strating to do crazy things like not starting
everytime I commanded it to. A bit odd when trying to visit. I can still get it
to start using a gentle touch... My fear now is that it migth die on me soon.

So is it a place in Las Vegas (im in a campground on las vegas blvd) where I
migth get a starter rebuild today (I have to be back to san diego by monday!)?
Moreover, does anyone have a place where I migth pull it out and place the
rebuild one?

thanks in advance
