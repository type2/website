Subject: Intake air preheating flap thermostat

This is on a 1971 oil bath air cleaner. I would imagine that, like mine, 
a lot of these on our buses are no longer functioning and stuck in the 
hot air position. In theory, on hot summer days, running in the hot air 
position would tend to increase engine temps. I know some people remove 
the thermostat and manually wire these to the hot air position in the 
winter and the cold air position in the summer. I was wondering if 
anyone knows of any quantitative tests that have been done to see how 
much difference this actually makes? i.e. set the flap in the cold air 
position and run at highway speed until steady state temp is reached and 
record the engine oil temp. then repeat in the hot air position.

Sincere thanks,
