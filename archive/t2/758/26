You're right, I did say spurt didn't I?  Well ... I turned the engine
over by hand with a wrench on the alternator as I didn't have a friend
available to turn the ignition.  It was rather dribbly, but I'm not
sure what the volume of gas should look like and under what pressure
it should come out of the hose when the engine is turned by hand.  The
dribble of gasoline definitely did not get any distance coming out of
the line, it just ... dribbled off the end.

It's a mechanical fuel pump, which very well could be the problem
because I bought it used last year.  How easy is it to install a new
fuel pump?

Thanks a lot for the support ... I'm leaving home now to try out those
things, but I'll be checking my email sometime today hopefully.
