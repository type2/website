Well, I'm not into the uncontrolled "put it in a can and burn it" methods,
as that sort of thing can get out of hand as the gas heats up and
vaporizes.  All I need is a 20 foot piller of flame and smoke in my SoCal
back yard during fire season!  8-0

Back when I frequented El Mirage, some of the sportier folk would pour
gasoline in long trails across the lakebed and light it up.  Very
impressive and reasonably safe.  I don't know about the environmental
sensitivities, though.

Perhaps I should just consider it a multi-year supply of Liquid Boy Scout
for starting campfires!  :)
