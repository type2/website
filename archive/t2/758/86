Subject: power brake servo vacuum line replacement

In removing the power brake servo lines from engine to brake servo, I
stopped at the long metal line running down the bus because the
underlying portion broke off in the line I was removing.

Right now I have a crusty line running down my bus, with a gnarly 1
inch end protruding through the beam.   What to do?
Clean it up and connect the new line to it?
How would you go about replacing it?

Any suggestions on *not* snapping this off on when replacing the lines
on the other end?

Check valve passed the blow test.  Is this enough or should it be
replaced for safety?

Any other suggestions reqarding specifications when bringing in the
old lines to my FLAPS  for replacement would be appreciated, or
on-line source recommendations.
