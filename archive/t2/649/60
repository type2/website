Subject: typeIV dizzy update

Sorry i did not post the replies (got 2, one stating go with SVDA from 
ACN, or expensive Mallory setup which is too much a dent in the pocket 
for me)  got in a rush w/ kids and all.

I posted a question pertaining the 009 versus the ACN SVDA dizzy.  I 
currently have dual 35mm solex carbs, compufire and 009 dizzy.  ACN 
swears nothing beats the SVDA dizzy, and is better than a stock rebuilt 
dizzy.  Compufire will work on any dizzy to best of my knowledge.  I am 
suffering 12mpg or 150 miles per tank a gas on my current setup.  
Before my rebuild (by AVP w/ real, mild, mild cam)  ( was 1.8L, now 
2.0L w/ 1.8 heads) I got 19 mpg w/ progressive weber.   Installed 
motor, ran w/ progressive weber and conventional points, got 10 mpg.  
After rechecking timing, plugs, wires, valve adjustments, and engine 
compression all looked good.  Hmmm......decided to get new carbs and 
was tired of messing w/ points, so installed compufire as well.  
Mileage improved 2 or 3 mpg.  Have done plug checks, and are light 
brown on electrodes and black on outside threaded part.  So I don't 
think Bus is running rich??    Bus runs well, cold or hot.  idles fine 
too.  Power is decent except for maybe on top end in 4th gear, but 
still can go 70mph, or 55-60 mpg up a mild hill.   Don't know where 
else to look except turn to the dreaded 009 dizzy.  Don't think an 
extra .015" in valve lift could cause such poor fuel mileage.  I have 
no vacuum leaks either.  Plan on doing a lot of camping this summer 
across Oklahoma, Missouri and Arkansas, and 13mpg is not acceptable to 
me or my wallet.  TIA.

David, '74 Westy.
