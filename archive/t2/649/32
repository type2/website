Thanks, John.

That probably means that I have a heat exchanger that isn't closing to the
system when I use the lever, and some misdirected air up front.

I can see the footwell cable, but the other is the broken one.  Do you know
what the left-most cable does when the it's in the fully open (the lever is
down) position?  I want the air up front and in the defrosters.  I don't
need to heat the rear area.

Thanks.
