Subject: Should have taken more pictures of heat hoses

I have an 80 Vanagon that I finaly ordered a rebuilt engine from BD 2 days
ago. I've spent almost a year derusting, cleaning, rebuilding, painting,
testing everything that goes in the engine bay. Today I started putting some
of the things back in the engine bay that I think came out after the engine.
(double relay, decel valve, charcol canister, etc.) As I recall I couldn't get
the acordian looking heat hoses out with the engine in, so they probly won't
go in after the engine is installed.

Started to put them in but my memory has failed and I can't find any pictures
in my Bentley to show how they are oriented. The short one on the drivers side
has one in/outlet at an angle. Does the angled end go towards the engine or
the front?

The longer hose on the passenger side has a larger diameter at one end before
the part that goes on the pipe. Does the large end go towards the engine or
the front?

It's tough getting old!

Thanks,
Tom
