I am jumping in a bit late on this discussion. I have a Mallory distributor
on my '79 westy and it is excellent. If you have ever fussed with an old
stock distributor to try to get it in spec, you will be an instant convert
to the Mallory. 

I set my timing on my bus almost 2 years ago and it is still perfect. I
literally have not touched it in that time and I drive the bus a lot.

i do not think this would ever be a drawback in the real world. It may look
this way on paper, but in reality the Mallory will do pretty much anything
you need or want it to do as far as the advance curve. The only real
shortcoming is that the vacuum advance is only tunable for amount of
advance, not when it comes in. but again, there is so much adjustability
built in to the Mallory that you will always be able to make it work near
perfect for your application.

These are not issues, really. It is a tight fit, but it fits.

This is a real issue.
