I have a weber progressive on a stock recently rebuilt 2l with the original 
distributor and I get about 250 miles to a tank (more if I take it easy), 
so the progressive can get "reasonable" mileage.

If I remember tonight I'll post the jetting details (they're at home, I'm 
at work).

Cheers,

Martin Strandgard
