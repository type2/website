Hi, folks -
Can anyone out there give me an idea of what a 79 Riviera Campmobile "Project
Bus" would be worth, given the following:

On the PLUS side:
  a.. FI engine and transmission are in excellent condition, 25k on rebuild
  b.. Interior is in excellent shape, except for front seats - deluxe
cabinetry set
  c.. Has gasoline heater, propane furnace, table, sink, heater fan booster
  d.. Pop-top exterior is dirty, but in good shape - has sealing rubber all
around - it is the Riviera straight-up type - canvas/screens are clean and
intact.
  e.. No significant body damage other than the rust.
On the MINUS side:
  a.. Body has enough rust to be too much of a project for me
  b.. Needs a muffler
  c.. Needs new windshield & rubber (windshield is intact and doesn't leak,
but is fogging around the edges)
I am interested in divesting myself of this vehicle before Christmas. If it
sounds good to anyone, let me know and I'll send photos.  It drives as-is (but
is very loud).  Title is clear.

Cheers,
Kurt Selvig
