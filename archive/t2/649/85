Hi Richard,

Looks like the ideal answer would be a programmable electronic
ignition. Reading the literature on programming advance curves, it
talks about running on a dyno to find the max power timing setting at
each RPM. I wonder if standard programming parameters could be mapped
for each stock configuration, or if varying the fuel system would
affect the results. Optimal timing parameters should be independent of
fuel delivery shouldn't it?
