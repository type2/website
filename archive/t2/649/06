Subject: Re: [T2] Stolen Emblem/MTV Pimp My Ride

Just thought  I would pipe up here...

My dad pulled the emblem from our (now my) bus in '78, & put the spare 
on the front.  Nobody's ever stolen the spare.

It sucks, but I just have to say, why spend another $50+ if it's been 
stolen already?  Somebody (used to at least) make a VW-symbol tire 
cover; that might be cheaper?

Busses look like busses from any angle, they don't need to be ID'ed by 
the badge.

Somewhat related, in Germany, if you ever park your Mercedes on the 
street (at least at the time I was there) you could expect the hood 
ornament to get broken off.  It was rare to see a Mercedes w/a hood 
ornament; people just left them broken.

Point being, sometimes it's best to just relax & go w/the flow.  Mount 
your spare, paint an emblem on (have somebody paint on an emblem, 
probably cost less than replacing it a few times.)  You'll feel better.
