Subject: Re: [T2] typeIV dizzy update

Ok, Sorry for the confusion.
I used to have stock 1.8L w/ weber progressive and 009 dizzy.  Got 19 
mpg.
Thru a rod thru case.  Purchased AVP rebuilt 2.0L w/ 1.8L heads and 
real mild cam (slightly extra lift).  Re-used my weber and dizzy on 
rebuilt, got 10mpg.  Hated weber in cool to cold weather, so upgraded 
to dual Solex 35mm carbs and compufire for 009 Dizzy.  This improved 
mileage to 12 to 13.  Hope this clear things up.
