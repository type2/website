The strength of the advance spring dictates how fast the curve advances.

 I've always thought of this as a high performance dizzy but the
graphs don't show the advance slowing down after 3000 rpm. Say you had
a high reving motor that went to 7000 rpm. How would go dial in a
little bit of advance as the rpms creep up without hitting the advance
stop early because of the steep slope of the advance curve?
