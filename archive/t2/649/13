Subject: Shameless Plug!

A shameless plug for my wife's greeting card business - hey, it's got
classic cars & buses!

As the holidays approach and your thoughts go back to "what kind of greeting
card do I want to send out this year" and you just don't want to deal with
it. well, have we got a solution for you!

Why not send out a card with an image of your most cherished possession -
no, not your kids - your classic bus.  

Just go to www.woodhillhome.com/ready-to-mail.html to view our current
selection of greeting cards and when you're ready to order, we've now made
it very easy:  you only need to go to www.woodhillhome.com/onlinestore.html

So, what are you waiting for?
