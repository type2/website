Subject: RE: [T2] SUMMARY: Can't get engine out

I can see where this would make it easier but to answer your question, no.
I have not had to loosen the tranny mounts to get the engine out. Hopefully
it's nicer to you on the way in.  Replace those fuel lines while it's easy
:)

I seem to recall having loosened the transmission mounts so the tranny 
pointed downward (which made it much easier).
