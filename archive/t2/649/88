I'll try to remember to take pictures tomorrow (errrr... later today) of
the Mallory installed on my Raby built engine (that I still haven't touched
since I stuck it in the Rivi).

Y'all need to figure a way to get Jake in on the advance curve programming
discussion. He's mostly a forum type person now though. The email slam from
many lists was too heavy for him to try to sift through it and keep working
16+ hours/day.

John Conolly: I'll be ordering the oil extender. I knew I was forgetting
something. Will use stock idiot light plus CHT guage until I get it then
will be using stock idiot light guage plus VDO single sender unit for guage
on a "T" on the extender. I want them separate so if one sender fails I
still have the other working rather than using the VDO dual sender unit.

Do you have drilled/tapped taco plates for a VDO oil temp sender for the
Type4? I still have to mount that sender too. Be nice to have a pre-made
plate for swapping in when I drain the oil to change it before firing it up
the first time.
