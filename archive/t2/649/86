I don't think it is that different from programming megasquirt.
Instead of programming fuel injector release parameters at each
airflow point, you would be programming ignition time at each RPM. The
trick is having the data and knowing how to program it like the
megasquirt people had to do.

 then retard 4 degrees throughout the entire rpm range. Something so
