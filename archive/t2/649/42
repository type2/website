Left red lever all the way down = air directed to front defrosters
Right red lever all the way down = heater fan in the engine bay on

On a side note, I just got done insulating all my heater ducting under the
bus.  Very similar to what is spoken of here
http://www.shagadelic.org/VW/info/gmbulley-soundproof/heatdum.html.  If your
area is even half as cold as it is here in Colorado I highly recommend doing
this.  This morning's trip?  A brisk 23 degrees F.  Drove to work with just
a tshirt on and my jacket proudly hanging from my passenger front seat.

Do you know what the left-most cable does when the it's in the fully open
(the lever is down) position?  I want the air up front and in the
defrosters.  I don't
need to heat the rear area.
