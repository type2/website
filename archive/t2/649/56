The PO probably used the elbow for something else after disposing of
the AAR. It sounds like he used it for the brake booster judging by
your description.

Leaking fuel out of your carb is usually a bad float setting or bad
needle valve.

 Well my bus is still leaking fuel out of the left carb.  I'm  trying
to seal up all the loose or bad fittings to eliminate leaks.  I have
an elbow (022129637) which bus depot list as a Aux Air Regulator
elbow.  First, what is an Aux Air regulator?  I comes off my intake
manifolds and then goes to the front somewhere.  Second, Do I need it?
 Of course that depends on the first answer.  Third,  How accurate are
the bus depot listings.  With this part number it shows that it goes
in a 74-79. My bus is a 73.  There is no picture so I'm not a 100%
sure.
