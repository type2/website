Zach, you should be able to see everything by just opening up your folding seat.

 A while back you may remember I asked about seatbelts in a westy. I was
 sure I had seen the mounting bolts in there. Well, yesterday as I was
 working I thought I'd give it a looksie. I don't see any mounting bolts
 or holes or anything. Does anyone have any ideas short of gutting all my
 Westy cabinets and seat, pulling the floor and looking under there?
 (This is really not a viable option at this time). I was thinking of
 getting one of the $20 jobs from ACN, but I want to wait until I get
 this figured out.
 
 Thanks
