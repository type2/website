Seann,

you most definitely need an alignment. there is a bushing at the upper
balljoint that is used to adjust the camber. it was likely moved when the
upper balljoint was replaced.

call around & see who can do an alignment for you. you don't want to wear
out those tires you recently purchased.

good luck,
