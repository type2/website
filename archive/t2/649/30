That should have read "2. The other two cables are attached to the middle
lever.  The cable on the left hand seems to operate okay, but the cable on
the RIGHT is frozen with the lever in the "down" position.  The lever still
works, but the cable on the right bends rather than operates.  It's probably
going to break off if I don't fix it eventually.  What do these cables do?
I assume that this is the temp control lever."
