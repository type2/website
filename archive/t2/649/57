Subject: Re: [T2] Another seatbelt question

If you have floor repair panel installed, it may not have the seat
belt hardware. You can drill it, but you will want to back it up with
a reinforcing plate. Look at another bus if possible to duplicate the
design. Or else look at your front seat belt for an idea.

         I tried that, but I don't see anything. My floor is newer than
 the bus, maybe all the holes aren't drilled??
         Could someone tell me what's wrong with drilling 2 new holes and
 using bolts and lock washers to hold the belt in. Is this unsafe? Why?
