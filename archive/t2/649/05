Subject: Can't get engine out

Hi All,

I'm trying to pull the engine from my '79 bus and am having a helluva time.

I've been following along with the Muir book but it's just not working. 
He seems to indicate that the engine should kinda "drop" a bit once the 
transmission/engine bolts are off and the rear frame bolts have been 
removed.

The book says something along the lines of "Have a buddy push the car 
forward while sliding the engine backwards". Either I'm doing something 
wrong (quite possible) or my engine is really stuck.

I can see that the engine has separated somewhat from the tranny but 
that has only been the result of quite a bit of rocking and lots of force.

I've done this before and don't remember it being quite this difficult :-(

Any pointers?


Thanks,
Harry
