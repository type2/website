Subject: re: [T2] Ball Joints/Alignment/Tires

Gosh, are you going to have your camber set??  You may want to take with you 
a wrench to adjust the eccentric bushing on the upper ball joints.

This bicycle adjustment tool might work, particularly since your ball joints 
were replaced, and the eccentric bushing would have had to have been R & R, 
making it easy to adjust.

but is 36mm the right size??  It seems to be, on my '78.

BTW, I vote that your toe is badly out of specs.  You will find out in 5,000 
miles, when your new tires become feathered beyond your wildest 
expectations.  My second vote is for too much pressure in the front tires.
