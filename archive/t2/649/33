Subject: Re: brake bleeding sequence...

This Master Cylinder problem is driving me nuts...
Bentley sequence for bleeding is 
right front
left front
right rear
left rear

Is this correct? I've replaced the "defective" master cylinder, and
still have leakage from the front pinhole of the MC. What else can I
check? Front pads are new...Rear cylinders and shoes are new...
What am I missing... ?-(  Pedal still goes down half way before I get
resistance...
