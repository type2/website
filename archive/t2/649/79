Zach,

Assuming the seatbelt mounting points didn't get moved between 1970 and 1977, the seatbelt mounting points for the back seat aren't really in the floor.  The outside ones are on the rear wheel wells, and the ones in the middle are about at that height, on the tin that's almost vertical.

The right-most hole (when looking towards the front of the bus) will be inside your closet.  4 of the other holes should be visible in two pairs if you tilt your back seat bottom up and look straight back.  The left-most (driver side) hole might be hidden behind the bed hinges on that side.
