Subject: SUMMARY: Can't get engine out

Hi All,

Ok, I went back and with some serious fidgeting was able to get the 
engine out.

This reminded me of the last time I took an engine out.

I seem to recall having loosened the transmission mounts so the tranny 
pointed downward (which made it much easier).

Has anyone else done this (or am I starting to show signs of early 
senility)?   ;-)


Thanks,
Harry
