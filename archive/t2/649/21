Subject: Heater linkages

I found out to my delight this evening that my heater works.  The levers are
a bit stiff, but I did get hot air out of the defrosters.

This raised a couple of questions for me:

1. I have a '77 bay and there are four cables and three levers.  Two of the
cables are attached to the lever farthest to the driver's left.  Of these
two cables, the one of the left is broken where the cable attaches to the
lever.  It appears to be broken off with the lever in the "up" position.
The other runs to the two vents in the kick panels.  The cable covering is
broken, but works anyway.  What does the left cable run to?  From the little
indicator on the dash I assume that this lever is the vent control.

2. The other two cables are attached to the middle lever.  The cable on the
left hand seems to operate okay, but the cable on the left is frozen with
the lever in the "down" position.  The lever still works, but the cable on
the right bends rather than operates.  It's probably going to break off if I
don't fix it eventually.  What do these cables do?  I assume that this is
the temp control lever.

3. This is the first time I've ever used the heat.  The smell was sort of
"hot metal" rather than exhaust.  Is this indicative of something wrong, or
just the usual "first time heater use" thing?

In any case, I'm going through with a bilge blower conversion.  I plan on
placing the blower in the spare tire well, piping the air through a sealed
hole in the well to the aux. fan openings in the heater box, and insulating
the spare tire well to minimize the noise of the blower.  This should give
me cabin air recirculation as intake for the blower will be ducted through
the spare tire well cover into the cabin area.

Thanks.
