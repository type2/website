you can not PROPERLY run a progressive on a T-4 engine, because you have no
way to provide pre-heat to the intake in a supply that will work properly
(an electric heater don't cut it). This is why we do not sell progressives
for the T-4. The SVDA will help. The next thing to check is your carb
jetting, most "experts" couldn't jet the carbs right if you held a gun to
their head. Most carb kits are way way off out of the box.
