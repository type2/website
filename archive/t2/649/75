Can anyone point me to a good reference on diagnosing a front-end squeak on my
76? It sounds very repetitious (wheel related) but stops when I turn the
steering wheel.

My 76 Westy had a front wheel that squeaked and rumbled and I found several 
things to correct. The clip that stabilizes the front pads was cracked and 
barely functional. Replaced the clip and squeak stopped but the rumble 
continued. I inspected the front wheel bearing and found it to have an 
eroded and pitting race, so I replaced that also.
Now the front wheels are much quieter. Incidentally, I replaced the brake 
pad clip on the other side also, because it was cracked....but not making 
noise.
