Yes, but if you look at the spring kit and the instructions and the graphs,
the purple spring doesn't slow down the curve fast enough. So far it seems
that...

Mallory pluses:

- rock steady idle and smooth advance
- customizable curve

Mallory minues:

- limited curving options despite customization
- fitment issues
- cost
