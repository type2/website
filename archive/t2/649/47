Subject: Ball Joints/Alignment/Tires

Last 3 months - 4 new LT rated tires, working great

Last 2 months - 4 replacement Boge shocks, installed and working great

Last Week (Fri) - 4 new ball joints.

Drove on the shocks and the tires with the old ball joints and they were a
great improvement on what had been a not so uber ride.  Now that the ball
joints have been replaced, the entire front end is vastly quieter and is as
tight a feel between the steering wheel and the road as I could ever hope
for.. It literally feels like a new car with the response.

The trouble is that the car drifts.  It's like I'm trying to drive on a
balance beam.  The steering is very tight and responsive and the vehicle
rolls in a straight line, just hard to get it to roll straight forward.
There is a sweet spot that I can hit with the steering that will get me
rolling directly forward, but if I move the steering wheel even a hair,..
the bus will start a slight drift to either the right or left side of my
lane.  I'm thinking that my alignment is all jacked now that I have had the
ball joints replaced.  Any other opinions?  As I said before, the steering
feels very tight now, just misguided.  Toe in? Toe out?  Isn't alignment on
a bus (1976) hard to get done right?  What do you think?
