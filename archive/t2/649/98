Subject: 1979 Riveria

I looked at a 79 Riv in Co. whose eng had seized. Prob droped a #3 valve 
seat. It is prob still for sale in the classifieds. $300 was good enough but 
the engine was not a 79 like the person said. I don't think he knew the 
difference. The 79 Bay had rectangular exhaust openings, the one I looked at 
had round. It could have been anything. I want the original engine, no 
matter what, when I buy a Bay. That way I can look at the Bay and estimate 
how many miles on the engine. Rebuilding a 79 Bay engine is a simple mater 
of time and a little $$.  CREE
