The thermal time switch is only for turning on the cold start valve
when cranking.

Your aux air regulator prevents stalling when cold by increasing
throttle. It this is not working, it could be causing your problem.

If you have anything disconnected or removed, that could affect function.

If you caused a fine crack at one of the vacuum hose junctions, it may
leak cold and grab or seal when it warms up.

 I pulled the fan housing off to replace the oil cooler seals, and because it

 off.  I disconnected the termal time switch, the cold start valve and the
 aux air regulator.  I think I got everything back, including all the hoses.
 But I used the original (looked good) intake manifold boots (see Mike
 Benthin's recent experience)
 
 What should I check, the termal time switch or aux air regulator (it doesn't
 matter if the VW sits a full 10 minutes at first starup, so the engine temp
 and curent to aux air regulator does not come into play, I think) and it
 starts right away, so the cold start valve seems to be OK.
