Subject: RE: [T2] 1776 for 1971 Westy - Option

Thank you all for you kind and informative replies.  I have a line a
fiberglass dune with a 1776 single-port motor for asking price of $2,000.  I
will go and take a look at it tomorrow.  If things look good, I may buy the
lot, take the motor out (AE case) and put on my old dual port heads or buy
some new ones.  I might even be able to take some of the dune buggy parts and
swap them in-and-out with a dune I project I already have.  When is all said
and done, I will sell the left over parts and try to recoup some of my money.

Questions:

How much better will the 1776 run (HP, torque, fuel economy, etc...) with the
dual port heads than the single port heads?

Should I consider a carb upgrade (maybe to a Weber progressive)?

How much (and how difficult) would the 091 tranny upgrade be?


Thank you all,

Michael
