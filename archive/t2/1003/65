Yeah, well if Bentley expects people to know certain things, why on earth
would it contradict the knowledge it is expecting you already have? Bentley
says to start from the front and work your way back, when the proper
procedure is to start from the BACK and work your way front. WTF?

Either way, I have my brakes now. All I have to do is get a couple of bottle
jacks from Harbor Freight so that I can jack up the rear and polish off my
brakes again.

When I hit the brakes, she tends to move to the right. I think it is in need
of adjustment.

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
