Mike,

Prices are all over the place though.  Some guy has a 76 parked on a major 
street here and is asking $6900 for a non camper deluxe...not bad, but not 
too good either...usual rust spots, no restoration, seems to run ok.

At the same time, a friend of mine just bought a 75 with better interior, 
but the paint makes it look like a blue holstein cow.  Will run better 
with about $400 worth of engine fixes, but he is driving it to work every 
day....and he paid a little less than $3,000.

These were both standard non camper buses.

I think it has to do with how much money people have.  There was point 
just a few years ago, that $3,000 cash was just out of reach for a lot of 
people....now I think it is not.  Especially for people(frugal people) who 
look at $60,000(or more) minicampers and then happen to see a westy on the 
street.  How much less is the insurance for something you use a few times 
a year, and how much repair can you do for waaaay less than half of what 
the new stuff costs?

Cheers, dave
