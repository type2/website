IMHO that is a very good price for a 1776 longblock with new parts. (ask: are they rebuilding the heads also? include new case and oil cooler?)  I bought mine for about that price with a new counterweighted crankshaft BUT I provided the custom heads already flycut for the larger jugs.  Steve Sands, Pro-Flow Performance in Hiram GA built it.

You may assemble your own engine easily if you want the experience, let the shop do the machine work--but you won't get it done quicker or cheaper.  Consider a 100 cam, big-valve heads, and full-flow filtering.  you will also have to figure the extra cost of bigger carbs, exhaust if you go that way.
