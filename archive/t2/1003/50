Hi everyone,

I got lucky and had some sunshine here in the pacific northwest
yesterday. I found the exhaust leak, marked by a lot of dark soot. It
was located on the right (FIF) exhaust to carb preheat tube. The
gasket and bolts holding it together looked ok, I couldn't tighten it
any more so I put so jbweld around it to see if that eliminates the
problem. If it does, I suspect I will need to order a new exhaust, the
current one must be warped.

Thank you,

Max
