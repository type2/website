i have not made the flanges in stainless, but as you say, it could  
easily be done.

as i understand it, the flanges are mild steel because the stainless  
has a propensity to warp under the heat it is subject to. not sure if  
this makes sense from a technical perspective, but that is how i  
understand it. all the VW manifolds are made in this same way, so  
there surely is a reason the factory used mild steel. if it was  
simply to reduce cost, then why would the pipes be stainless and not  
also mild steel? i don't have the answer...

the pipes that we rebuilt are usually original, meaning at least 25  
years of service before needing replacement, not a bad life-span. so  
i am not concerned about the flanges rusting again without having a  
reasonable life-span. but it might be something to look into. we also  
don't have a welder set up for stainless, another hurdle for us to  
leap. all food for thought.
