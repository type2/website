Subject: Re: [T2] Can we weld new exhaust manifold flanges on our heater

<<My 77 Westy heater box flanges (the triangular shaped ones) are
corroding badly, yet the boxes themselves are in very good condition. I
was wondering if I could just weld new triangular flanges on where the
old ones are? >>

Sure , why not?
As long as your proficiant in welding, and have air welding down pat,
welding is the only answer--

I guess my question is Courtney--
If your a welder, why did you ask?

You shoulda been on the job already, had it all done, and then ranted
about how you cured the problem rather than waiting on the computer for
an answer of approval.

I've never been able to figure this out.
Why ask if you have the answer & the skills to repair the problem?
