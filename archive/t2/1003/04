Let me put the answer another way.

If your just a pigeon dropping welder, with very limited metal
fabricating tools, pay someone do the job that has the skills,
knowledge, and the right stuff to get this done.

That is--if you have any desire to have the job done right.

Anything can be duplicated.

A sheet metal break, shear, water cooled band saw's, air nibbler's,
grinder's etc. would be some good item's to have at your disposal, to
name a few.

I hope this explanation wasn't too harsh to digest.
