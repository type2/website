Subject: 1776 for 1971 Westy

Well my first rebuild is almost over before it began.  I took out the engine
for my 1971 Westy and had all intentions of rebuilding the motor to a 1776cc.

-I found a hole in piston #1.

I took the case, crank, heads, etc... to the machine shop and found...
-Case warped
-Crank was a re-turned crank with no life left
-Cam lobes were worn beyond repair
-One of the heads has a crack that will only get bigger

I had my machine shop get me figures on new parts for replacement to build the
1776cc motor and got a sum total of $1700+

Now with all that being said...

What is a good price for a 1776 longblock?
What is a good, reputable place, to get a longblock?
Should I build from scratch or go with longblock?


Ideas, suggestions, etc...

Thanks,

Michael
