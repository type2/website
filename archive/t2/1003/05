we do this, rebuild the exhaust components, that is. we sell rebuilt  
afterburner pipes and manifolds. they are not available new, and  
since the pipes themselves are stainless steel and the flanges are  
mild steel, the flanges always rust away but the pipes are almost  
always still good. our rebuilt afterburner pipes are as good as brand  
new ones. this is a look at how we do them:

what is missing from those photos is a picture of the fixture we use  
to assemble the parts while welding them together. without the  
fixture the process would be very difficult, near impossible to get  
the flanges in perfect alignment without it. you COULD do it by using  
your existing exhaust system as the fixture, temporarily assembling  
the parts, tack welding, then taking everything apart to complete the  
welding. not a big deal, just some extra time.

we also have the flanges available for people who want to make the  
repairs themselves. these ones will fit the heater boxes.

i have not renewed heat exchanger flanges but the principle is the  
same (as are the flanges themselves) as what you see in the slideshow  
in the first link.
