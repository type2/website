 Hi there, I checked with the dowel on #1 cylinder
 where top dead center really
 is on my 2 litre engine that's been rebuilt (PO). 
 It's at 12 o Clock straight
 up.  No where near the 0 mark on the scale.
 
 Is this common in rebuilt engines?  Maybe they used
 some other kind of crank or something?
 
 I have the same Calif version distrib that's
 described in the bentley (part
 #), so I timed accordingly at 5ATDC from the 12 o
 Clock position, the real TDC
 of motor (disregarding scale) and it runs nicely
 now.

Something is wrong in your "real TDC of the motor".

Remove the 3/4 [left side] valve cover. Get a remote
starter button and connect to the starter. Press the
button and watch #3 valves. You will see the exhaust
open then close. Immediately after that, the intake
will open and close. Go around again and watch the
exhaust. JUST as it closes, STOP. At the point of
'rocking', when the exhaust JUST closes and the intake
 JUST starts to move, look at the timing mark. It
should be on TDC ZERO. 'Rocking' is the point at which
both rocker arms 'rock' the same amount. If your cam
timing is correct, this is TDC for #1 to fire. IF at
the rocking position, the TDC is off more then 10
degrees, your rebuilder got the cam out of time with
the crank.
At TDC, the dist rotor should be pointing to the index
mark on the dist body for #1.

5 after is ONLY valid IF you have manifold vacuum
going to the retard side AND the retard unit works.
