Subject: RE: [T2] single cab parts...

Ive noticed a few locks/latches on the samba. They are going for over $100,
which is probably more than I think they are worth. Plus if they are old,
and brittle, I dont think they would last long. I imagine there has to be a
way to use some sort of modern locking latch. It is just a question of
figuring it out/fabricating something/or adapting soemthing. I was hoping
someone else may have figured out a modern solution to it. Ill get working
on it...;) and post results.

Kevin,
 
Bay SCs came with locks, where to find a set of locks and handles if yours
are gone is probably a real tough thing.  Keep an eye on samba for one being
parted or the usual used sources but finding a used set is going to be
tough.  The latch part is sort of brittle and don't last well.  The spring
rollers you just need to hit a junkyard that has buses, all the same
prop/rollers as I recall but I sold my '70 SC a few years ago.
