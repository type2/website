Actually I was bouncing this question off the list to see if the metal was weldable on the exhaust and if anyone has done it before. I'll just ignore the negativity. Scott answered my question, stating the flanges are just mild steel, and that is why they corrode. I was wondering if they were cast iron or not, as I've had trouble welding cast iron. I have a mig welder, but am def. not a good welder. Still learning. These are the kind of projects that I like to try. 
I ask questions on this list to learn. I am sure most others do too. Lectures I don't need, had enough of them in university and the military. :-/
