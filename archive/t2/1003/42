I've done it with a mig for a repair and it is just fine. The originals were
welded steel to cast steel.

Subject: [T2] Can we weld new exhaust manifold flanges on our heater boxes?

My 77 Westy heater box flanges (the triangular shaped ones) are corroding
badly, yet the boxes themselves are in very good condition. I was wondering
if I could just weld new triangular flanges on where the old ones are? I
thought the thickness of plate, added to the old ones wouldn't be much of a
consideration in clearance or muffler problems. Any thoughts on this?
Thanks,
Courtney
