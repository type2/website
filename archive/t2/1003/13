Subject: Re: [T2] cooling flaps cable

I think I remember now.
Engine cold.
Grab the rod going between the flaps with vice grips and turn it until the flaps are closed, don't get crazy and torque on it really hard, just until closed, then pull the cable tight and lock it down.
If the rod isn't twisted when the engine is cold then the flaps aren't held shut when the engine is cold, which means when the engine warms the cable just gets looser and looser until it falls off.
The cable-less rested state of the flaps is wide open to insure that you don't overheat if the thermostat fails (breaks).
