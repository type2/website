Subject: Re: [T2] Insulation

I have been adding this stuff called horse stall mat to the inside of my bus for insulation, I get it at feed stores, we have a place called Coastal Farm Supply that sells it off a roll, I don't see why you couldn't use it in there if you found a way to secure it.

I think it is mostly ground tires, it must be closed cell because one of the suggested uses is to put it under you barbecue to keep oil drippings from staining your patio.

I have a piece in the front so far, I put a drop from that in the back under the bed for kneeling on and it made a noticable improvement, just by having a 1' x 2' square laying in the middle, so I want to cut a piece to fit the space above my engine on the inside of the bus next, I am also going to use some and seal up the closet floor.

Drive around with the closet door open and the noise coming out is unbelievable.
