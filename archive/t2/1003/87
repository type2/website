Subject: Web-Site Creation Advise requested

I've GOT to get a web site going. Anybody who has any
advise for me, please drop me a p-mail (NOT on the
LIST please!)

I need suggestions from web-host to software selection
- everything! I have dabbled with an early version of
Front Page and that's it.

Please - OFF the List! It is VW busrelated in only a
very long stretch! TIA -BaH
