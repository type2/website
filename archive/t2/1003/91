Subject: pictures of 1st Annual Classic VW Treffen in Anaheim

Hi folks,
I had the chance to be in Orange County at the same time that the
1st Annual Classic VW Treffen was going on.

These were CLASSIC vintage VWs
from the 40's, 50's and 60's

I took some shots and have them posted on the
LiMBO bus picture site.
