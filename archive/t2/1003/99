Subject: Re: [T2] E-Brake Adjustment Preliminary Question

Did you adjust your rear brakes before doing the e-brakes?

You need manually adjust your rear brakes with slack in the e-brake
cables via the star adjustment nuts. No way to get a good adjustment
on your e-brake unless your rears are properly adjusted first.
