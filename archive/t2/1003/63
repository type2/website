My feeling is that pigs will fly first.

I like the bit about supplying
"stripped down" versions to developing countries and "tarted up" versions
to the first world.  I wish they would figure out that some of us folks in
the first world want their cars without the bells and whistles.

Microcars won't make much impact unless they also come with lower prices.
When you can buy a roomy Scion xB for the same price as the teeny Smart
ForTwo the choice isn't that difficult.  The difference in economy might
be significant in hyper-gas-taxed Europe, but not in the US.

Personally, if I wanted a 2-seat microcar, I'd get a T-rex:
