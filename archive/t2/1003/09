If being realistic, and straight forward is negative, so be it.

If you don't have the knowledge or capacity to tell the difference
between mild steel & cast iron, you've got big problem's.
Very Realistic.

If your dreaming out loud, well I guess that concept is OK.
Dream On.
More realism.
 
If your at the spit welding stage, and can't identify  metal, don't even
plug the welder in.
Hire somebody.
More of the real story.
