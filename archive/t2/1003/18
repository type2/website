Hello Kevin, yep, I'm still here! I live in Kamuela on the north end of
the island. Check out Cafe Pesto in Kawaihae, I'm the baker there
Wed-Sun. They also have a store in Hilo next to the Farmers Market,
excellent pizza! There's a guy that rents Westfalia Vanagons down on the
Puna side (near Hilo). Best way to see the island! Timo dba Forever
