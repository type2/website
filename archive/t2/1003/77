Hi,

I have a pair of 34 ICT's on my bus and one of them has started to weep
gas around the throttle shaft. According to the parts digram I
downloaded off the net, (  <http://www.racetep.com/weber/34_ICT.pdf>
http://www.racetep.com/weber/34_ICT.pdf), it looks like I need a pair of
shaft seals - part 26 - (part # 41575.010) but it looks like they don't
come in a rebuild kit (

Can anyone confirm whether or not they come in a kit? Does anyone else
have experience with this repair? Is this what I need to do or do I need
to rebush the throttle shaft like the old solex carbs I use to have?
Where did you get parts? 

thanks,
