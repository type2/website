yes,, the brakes need to adj well before worrying about the hydraulic
pressures

if the front cyls have to move more than the rear,, the master thinks that
is a leak.. the shuttle moves to block that port,, and the switch is
triggered for the dash light
the master was designed to move fluid equally ,, and if it doesn't.. the
shuttle inside will move to the side with less pressure..
the masters I have seen have 2 switches that are hyd pressure,,, and one
that is mechanical.. it has a button inside the rests on the shuttle.. the
shuttle has a dimple in it.. if the switch rests in the dimple,, the light
is off.. if the dimple moves.. the switch closes..

a trick i have used... instead of adjusting the brakes,, or if you don't
even have shoes installed yet....you can squeeze off the flex lines .. I use
needle nose vice grips.. gently, on the flex lines.. pinch them so the fluid
can't go thru.. then all I am working with is the master cyl,,, and air in
the lines... if there is any.

hope that helps
