Directions to Watkins Glen coming through the southern routes
++++++++++++++++++++
FROM Scranton area or from Albany and NEW ENGLAND (if you
choose to head south)
++++++++++++++++++++
Find your way to the town of
Binghamton NY.  Bignhamtom is at the crossroads of Routes I88, I81 and 17.
From Binghamton head WEST on the Southern Tier expressway (Route 17) for about
65 miles towards the towns of Elmira, Horseheads and Corning. 
In the town of
Horseheads  Take the Route 14 turn off and head NORTH to Watkins Glen.
++++++++++++++++++++
FROM Western PA 
++++++++++++++++++++
Find your way to
the town of Williamsport PA. 
It is on a major freeway - Route 15 heading
south from Rochester to Frederick Maryland and further south, and near I80.
Williamsport is the last big city before heading into the mountains toward NY
and Corning.
 
From Williamsport, Take Highway 15 and head NORTH for about 75
miles through the mountains to reach 
the Southern Tier expressway Route 17.
Head EAST towards the towns of Painted Post, Corning and Elmira.
In the town
of Corning take Route 414 NORTH about 15 miles.
Take 414 to the end where it
will merge with Route 14 in the town of Watkins Glen.
 
+++++++++++++++++++++
In Watkins Glen
+++++++++++++++++++++
 
As you are heading north on Route 14
into the town of Watkins Glen it becomes Franklin Street. 
There will be a
good size grocery store on the left as you enter the town. 
Continue past
"11th Street" on the right 
Take the next LEFT on Corning Street (Route 329)
and head up the hill to the State Park.
It becomes "Old Corning Road"
Bear
right on "Walnut Road" following the signs to the State Park.
Continue (on
route 419) into the State Park.
If there is a park official at the entrance
booth, let them know that you are with the VW camper at the Club house.
You
should not have to pay anything here.
Continue into the park past the pavilion
and bear left up a very steep hill, indicating "Campground"
Creep up the hill
to the next ranger booth.
Stop there and register for a pass, again do not pay
and tell them that you are with the VW group.  
I will collect $20 for each
day of camping from you and turn over the money to the State Park once we have
a known count.
Continue past the ranger booth up the hill to the Club house.
It will be about 1 mile further on the left.  
A big open field and a warm
club house.  Pick your spot on the grass and come register.  
 
If you have a
GPS, these are the numbers that I am getting from goggle maps 
for where we
will be camping at Watkins Glen State Park:
42.367621, -76.885554
 
 
PS I've
ordered some T-shirts and have 5 different colors and 5 different sizes
including XXL.  Cost will be $12/shirt.
 
 
Let me know if you need directions
from a different area or if you need any other information.
 
 
Cheers,
Joel
