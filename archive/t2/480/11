Subject: Tire size change

I have a 68 Westy that I have restored and installed a new Bus Boys Albatross
front beam. I have lowered it approx 2" and have the stock 185R/14 94R tires.
I am thinks about going to a 15X5.5 wheel and running 185R/65/15 87R.  BFG
Touring TA's. I was recently at a show and saw a 67 Splittie and 70 Bay
running the same tire and rim combination and the owners had no problems. The
busses had been customized but the engines were basically stock.As for my 68
the following has been updated.
1/ New  German Ball Joints (4)
2/ New Steering from the drag link back.
3/ New Albatross Front Bean (Lowered 2 inches.)
4/ New KYB Gas Adjust shocks (all 4 corners)
5/ New Anti Sway Bar Bushings (Rubber)
6/ Original Steering Box (not rebuilt)
The 68 is garaged and not a daily driver. We use it for fun on weekends and
mostly on 50mph county roads but will be hitting the highways in the summer of
2004.
