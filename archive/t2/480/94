Subject: Rubber Gear selector shaft boot premature deteriation?

Hi All:

When I was under the car this evening working on the transmission I
noticed that the gear selector shaft rubber boot (251-711-167A) that I
put on just about a year ago has developed cracks and is just about
ready to fail. I used MoS2 grease (don't know the brand at the moment,
but I got it from Napa) when I did the repair. The van has not seen more
than 600 miles since the repair as it has been sitting while we have
been rebuilding the engine.

Any ideas what would cause the boot to go so quick? I got the boot from
CIP, any ideas for other sources for better quality rubber boots?

Regards
