FL's link is full of good info and there is also advice in the library:

It's not hard as much as it's messy. Plan to burn any clothes your are
wearing that get CV grease on them. I couldn't get the smell out of my
mechanics overalls every after several washings and a trip to the dry
cleaners.

You can't replace a boot easily under the car: the joint needs to come off
and some come off harder than others requiring pullers. I imagine a press
works best like Bentley depicts.

I don't know about those button up boots, but if you search the archives
you'll find a lot of Kudos for US-made Rockford Duraboots
<http://www.rockfordcv.com/> and lots of complaints about boots from quality
CV manufacturers.

So far my OEM Lobro (GKN) boots are a little more than a year old and
holding up fine.
