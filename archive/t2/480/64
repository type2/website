Subject: Re: Rear-end groaning under accelleration...confused

I thought it might be the brakes, so I backed off the rear adjusters 
almost completely (so they're not even really engaging) just to see if 
that was it.  Remember, it doesn't make the groaning sound unless I'm in 
gear and up to about 35mph or so.  Definitely vibrates a bit as 
well...feels kind of like I left my pager in my underpants.

I've heard a lot of people making the suggestion to open the filler port 
before draining the oil.  Advice I will certainly follow.

The case looks nice and clean.  If it's leaking, I can't tell where.

The "chirping" noise sounds more like a fat girl wearing courduroy 
trousers quickly walking by, and less like a chirping break shoe.

I'll keep you posted.
