how difficult of a job this is.  I've seen it done but never myself done
the whole job.  Question is, is it easy enough to take the shafts out to
do or shall I get the boots that screw on without taking the shafts off?
Or are these crappy? The shafts look easy to get off but the boots look
hard to get on.

You don't want to use the "wrap-on" boots on a bus.

The job isn't difficult, but it is one of the greasier jobs around.  You
remove the axle (12 bolts using special triple-square wrench), remove one
of the snap-rings holding a CV in place, pull the CV off (this may need a
little persuasive tapping using a _brass_ NOT steel hammer) and then
remove the torn boots.  Clean up everything well with paper towels (lots
of them!).  If the boots are recently torn (not run a long distance with
torn boots) you can simply install new boots, regrease and install.  If
the CVs have dirt in them you need to disassemble them and clean with soap
and water.

Some skip this whole process and simply buy and install a rebuilt axle
shaft.  It saves a lot of time, but somehow I still like knowing the
conditions of my CVs and their greasing.
