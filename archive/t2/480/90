Subject: '73 Rear Bumper Bracket Source

Duane,

I set a set USED ($50 plus shipping/handling from Seattle)

I have a 1973 VW T2 Standard Bus/Station Wagon that is missing the rear
bumper and rear bumper brackets. I have lots of sources for the rear bumper,
but am coming up empty for those rear brackets. Can anyone help me with a
source?

I would use them on my buses, but they are
