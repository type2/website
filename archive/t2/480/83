One advantage a long-block or a shop doing a long-block install might 
have could be a warranty.  I certainly gave that a lot of weight when I 
made the decision to purchase a rebuilt long-block and have it 
professionally installed, rather than getting a top-end rebuild on my 
old engine.  (Top-end rebuild was only a few hundred bucks less than 
the complete long-block replacement.)
