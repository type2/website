Subject: looking for info on curtains and coloring books 

Going through the emails this last past 2 weeks I came across someone's
website with links to coloring stuff of vw vans.  Another link to designing 
your
own bus with colors and options and then printing them off.

I lost the link. Could someone email me with it if you know what it is or 
it's
your website please?

This weekend I am making curtains for the van (78 bus) and was wondering if
someone has measurements already on the net for them.  I have no problems 
coming
up with my own design, just wanted to see what others have done and all that
neat stuff.

Roof is also going in this weekend, heck or highwater. (insulation). I will 
take pics and
post my little faq for those interested when it's done. Also installing some 
foglights.

Thanks in advance

James (yah, it's snowing again)
