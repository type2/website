Subject: fuel filter location for carbureted engines

For years the fuel filter on my 71 westy had been located after the pump.  A
couple of years ago I tried relocating it before the pump.  No good in my
case - the bus ran just awful, as if starved for fuel.  I put the filter
back where it had been on the discharge side of the pump and all is well
again.  I am now very carefull to keep tabs on the condition of filter and
fuel lines, and I am using high pressure fuel injection line in lieu of the
usual braided stuff.
