Subject: primer recs (over POR-15)

does anyone have any specific recommendations for primers to use over
POR-15??  i am planning on attacking the below windshield rust on my '76
Westy in the near future (windshield and seal need replacing), so i'm going
to sand etc, cover with POR-15, prime, and then likely finish with a white
topcoat.  the westy is green, but i want to take care of the rust, so i
guess its gonna look like a cow for awhile.

so are there any specific types/brands of prime coat that anyone might
recommend??

thanks.  enjoy the weekend.  getting ready to go camping here in louisiana!
woohoo.
