Hi Justin,

I'll take this one, I have lots of pics of Collie's bus (He calls it 
"Manana" ) here:
http://www.pottsfamily.ca/BOTC/BOTC3pics/pictures/mvc-007s.html

This pic shows my dad waving from Manana's  sunroof as my mom pilots 
the bus through the slalom course at Buses of The Corn.

There are a few more pics of Manana  in the pic section of the BOTC 
2003 website:
