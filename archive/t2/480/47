If the boots are recently torn (not run a long distance with

I wouldn't suggest using soap and water on anything prone to corrosion, even 
if you intend on using the oven to dry the parts immediately thereafter.  
Use a solvent that will evaporate completely, without leaving any residue.  
I like Brake-kleen.
