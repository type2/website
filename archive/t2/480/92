Subject: re: '73 Rear Bumper Bracket Source

 Hey Duane,

 I bought a rear bumper bracket for my 72 at http://www.bus-boys.com in 
the Spring.  the service was fast and good. their telephone is 1 800 792-
2697.

Good Luck,
Scott

I have a 1973 VW T2 Standard Bus/Station Wagon that is missing the rear 
bumper and rear bumper brackets. I have lots of sources for the rear 
bumper, but am coming up empty for those rear brackets. Can anyone help 
me with a source?
