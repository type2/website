one way is to post a pic somewhere for us to see. changing out is
really simple. really to get good access to everything you will need
to pull the engine. I'd say several hours since you will have to pull
the engine as well as pull the housing and pedestal for the
alternator.

but now that I think about it. perhaps with the top access hatch you
have in your 74 you can do all the work inside the bus? i dunno about
this.
