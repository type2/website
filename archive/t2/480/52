try the Yoko Y356. available from http://www.tirerack.com for about 50 
bucks each in C load range & about $58 in D load range.

they are the stock 185R14 size.

however, if you drive your bus in mud/snow then i would advise against 
them.

it is a great highway tire with excellent rain performance and low 
tread noise.

if you want off-road tires then you'd probably be better off with the 
Michelins.
