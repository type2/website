Subject: Re: [T2] fuel filter location for carbureted engines

Hi Russ,

With the amount of traveling I do, and the resulting variety in fuels, 
I would be VERY hesitant about running unfiltered fuel through my fuel 
pump.

This may be less of an issue to those running type1 engines, since they 
enjoy a MUCH better selection of affordable fuel pumps available. Type4 
mechanical and electrical pumps are a lot more expensive than the T1 
mechanical pump. Even so, I'd rather try swapping in a different filter 
in front of the pump to keep the entire fuel system protected.

As with so many things, both fuel-related and not, YMMV.

Happy trails,
