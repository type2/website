Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild vs. LongBlock

I spent about 1400 so far on my type4 rebuild.  That included line bore, 
grinding the crank, heads cleaned up (bead blasted, valves, etc), 
tapping oil galley plugs, crank, flywheel, pressure plate, and fan 
balanced, new pistons and cylinders, pistons and rods balanced to .5g, 
all new cam, rod, and crank bearings and new cam/lifters/gear.  I pretty 
much had Rimco do everything they could to the case, heads, and crank 
that they could.

I would find out exactly what's going into the engine as far as what's 
new and what's used.  Obviously, yes, there is an advantage to having 
your mechanic do it, however, it hasn't been that particularly difficult 
to rebuild mine... and it's been quite enjoyable, too ;)

Hope that helps,
Mike
