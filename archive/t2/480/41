Subject: ECU :What is the Difference?

HI Volks,

So here is my senario. I have a '77 Westfalia Deluxe, AUTOMATIC TRANS. I 
want to replace the aftermarket carb. with FI. In regards to year and type 
of transmission how compatible are the different year/transmission types. I 
am looking at a system from a '78 with a manual tranny.

Questions:
1. Will this FI system work on my bus?
2. Will the majority of it work, minus the ECU?
3. Am I just going about it the wrong way and should stick to finding the 
exact year and type tranny?

Thanks,

Michael Knight
'77 Green Westy Machine
