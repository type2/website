A number of people have reported good results with new mexican engines.  
At $1300, they aren't terribly expensive.

I paid ~$650-750 for a rebuilt engine.  32,000 miles later, said engine is 
toast and needs to be replaced/rebuilt.  This engine never got "hot" 
(meaning 250-260 degree oil temps or when the machinists' "dot" melts), 
the valves were regulalry adjusted and the oil regularly changed (<1500 
miles in most cases).  The engine generally ran hotter than one would 
expect given my driving style (I rarely went over 57 mph and frequently 
pulled over to let the engine cool).

I'm not particularly happy about this, but I realized at roughly the 
15-20,000 mile mark that the engine builder I got my engine from did not 
put as much time and care into building my engine as I would have liked.

Having learned a lot in the interim -- both about engines, builders, and 
how not to burn up your air-cooled engine -- I am ready to build my own 
engine.  I am convinced that by taking my time, being meticulous, and 
using quality parts, I can build a "better than new" engine.  I expect 
this to cost me $1500-2000 but I am looking forward to the prospect.

My suggestion is this: if you want an engine that will last you 25-50,000 
miles, buy a rebuilt longblock from the mechanic down the street, knowing 
that while he has experience on his side, that he might not spend the 
amount of time being as meticulous as you yourself will hopefully spend.  
You will get an engine which may last you a long time if treated right, 
or, may not last more than 20,000.  It's something of an unknown but if 
you only put 1500 miles on your bus a year...

If you think that you have the time and energy required to rebuild your 
engine, and, that you will take your time and be patient, making sure you 
get it right, do that.  Chances are that you'll end up with a better 
engine and amazing sense of accomplishment.  You might make mistakes, but 
as long as you correct them as you go and verify that you're doing things 
right, I have every confidence that you'll end up with an engine "built to 
last".

Good luck!
