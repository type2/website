Subject: Re: [T2] Tires (again)

I just got Bridgestone Dueler A/T's put on a couple of weeks ago.  I was 
told by three places in town that this was the only tire that they could get 
in the 194/R14 C load range.  They were pretty expensive - $130 CAD each, 
but I really like them so far.  I didn't know my van could handle this well.
