Subject: Anyone need a 2276 motor?

I'm selling off the 2276 motor in my super bug to generate some cash
flow (just signed a check for $1300 for a plumber ouch!).

It has a universal case & so should fit most non-Type4 engined busses.

You might need to change the flywheel though because it has a
lightened one right now.

Email me if you want more info on the motor. It has less than 900
miles on it as of today.
