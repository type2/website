Subject: Re:  fuel filter location for carbureted engines

Hi Russ,

What were the symptoms when it ran awful. Did it ever just cut out while
driving? Was it more pronounced in hot weather?

Thanks,
Bill

| For years the fuel filter on my 71 westy had been located after the pump.
A
| couple of years ago I tried relocating it before the pump.  No good in my
| case - the bus ran just awful, as if starved for fuel.  I put the filter
| back where it had been on the discharge side of the pump and all is well
| again.  I am now very carefull to keep tabs on the condition of filter and
| fuel lines, and I am using high pressure fuel injection line in lieu of
the
| usual braided stuff.
