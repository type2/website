Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild vs. LongBlock

I think the general rule here is that you can rebuild an engine better than
a volume rebuilder, but you can't rebuild it cheaper.  If you're unsure of
yourself, if you don't have the tools and the time and the patience to do an
excellent job nor the willingness to educate yourself about all the bits and
pieces, then buy a longblock.  If you're very confident in the skill and
integrity of the rebuilder, so much the better.  There's a lot of
satisfaction in doing the job itself and no small amount of learning that
goes along with it, but those things don't really translate into dollars.
