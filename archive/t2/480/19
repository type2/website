Subject: Re: [T2] cv boots

Chris,

I have done it myself on my 73 Westy.  I consider broken boots a matter of
urgent maintenance.

It is easy but you must use the proper tool to undo and then torque down the
c.v. bolts.

I never use the split type boots.

To use the stock boots you have to take the joint off, it is retained by a c
clip.  A proper pair of pliers helps allot here, but it is not difficult to
do.

Take advance of this opportunity to repack those joints.  You can take them
a part and clean them really well before you repack but mind the orientation
and position of the inner and outer races, ideally do change position of the
balls in the races.  If you put them back wrong they will not extend, you
could not put back on the van.  Wheli the shafts are naked might as well
paint them too.  It is nice to get under the van and see neat work.

I buy a kit, (or 4 as the case may be) and it contains new boots, clamps and
grease and c.v.'s bolts as well , which I consider indispensable because
they are so highly stressed in service.

Regards, Andrea
