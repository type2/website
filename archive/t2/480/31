Subject: RE: fuel filter location for carbureted engines

Bill,

My experiment took place during mild spring weather, say mid 70's.  I didn't
leave it that way for long, needless to say, so I don't know about effects
of other climate conditions.

I don't recall that the bus ever completely stopped, but, it lurched and
bucked and missed and everything short of stopping.  The only variable was
placement of the fuel filter, i.e., I did not attempt to change timing or
anything else, just put the fuel filter back where it was (after the pump)
and the bus was back to normal again.  BTW, it was a new fuel filter, and I
do not have issues with crud in my gas tank, etc.

Access Bob,

No attempt made on my part to challenge your statement as to the requirement
for the fuel filter to be ahead of the pump on fuel injected engines.  I am
just relating my experience with my bus, which is carbureted.  FWIW, I would
PREFER to locate the filter ahead of the fuel pump, and if I could figure
out how to make it work on my bus, I would do it.  So if anyone has any
suggestions, I'm open.

Hi Russ,

What were the symptoms when it ran awful. Did it ever just cut out while
driving? Was it more pronounced in hot weather?

Thanks,
Bill

| For years the fuel filter on my 71 westy had been located after the pump.
A
| couple of years ago I tried relocating it before the pump.  No good in my
| case - the bus ran just awful, as if starved for fuel.  I put the filter
| back where it had been on the discharge side of the pump and all is well
| again.  I am now very carefull to keep tabs on the condition of filter and
| fuel lines, and I am using high pressure fuel injection line in lieu of
the
