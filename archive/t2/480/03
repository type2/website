Subject: Re: [T2] alternator / generator???

I also moved to the alternator in my 71. I called one of the mail order 
parts places. They had all the parts in one kit, backing plate and 
everything. It was around $100 three or four years ago.

The one thing that was not a "drop in" installation was that the 
accelerator pump pushrod mechanism had to be swapped to the other side of 
the little bracket thing on the 34-pict3. It was about a 2 minute job as I 
had the carb off anyway to make the installation easier.

Money well spent. No problems generating power for the 100 watt H4s and the 
dash lights don't dim when the windshield wiper is running. Also, 
Alternators generate power at lower speeds, including idle, so I keep my 
battery charged, even though I spend a lot of time in stop and go traffic.
