Subject: 1/3 middle seat padding size

Hi list,

Just wondering if someone could measure the top and bottom pads for the 
1/3 middle seat of a westy (I have a 71).  That's the seat to the left 
of the sink in a regular walk through early bay setup.  I have finally 
found a good company making custom high quality foam at a descent price, 
and I would love to finally install that seat.

Thanks a lot,

Yann
