Subject: UPDATE ON BN4 GAS HEATER

Hey people,

I just wanted to give an update on my BN4 gas heater.(the model with a single
glow plug)
I recently posted the question of why my gas heater would run for about 3
minutes
and shut itself off. I recieved the manual and trouble shooting from Espar in
the mail.
It mentioned the adjusting the screw on the thermo switch.
I slightly turned the screw and the heater stayed on and cycles in and out of
having
the pump running and cutting out. It fixed the problem! Something so simple as
turning
the small screw on the switch.If anyone out there would like the manual and
troubleshooting
i could fax it to you.
Let me know, i could bring it tomorrow if any one wants.
Darren
