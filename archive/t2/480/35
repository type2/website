Subject: Groaning  Rear End...not sounding/looking good.

I did try the old "wobble" test with both rear wheels, and it didn't 
move at all.  I also had a look at the axle nuts possibly being loose, 
but that's not it either...no lopsided squatting I can see either.

I'm starting to fear that my transmission might be saying its goodbye's.

:(
