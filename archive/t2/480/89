Make a decision, up front, on how long you plan on keeping this particular vehicle.
If you say forever and its not a rust bucket then put the extra money to get a new
case for about $400. A good rebuild (by definition that excludes engines from GEX)
should last from 25-50 thousand miles or more. By using mostly new parts you can
bump that number up to something approaching the reliability of the original
engines. Knowing the mechanic that is doing the work also has its advantages. I
bought an engine awhile back and after running it for a few weeks realized that
something wasn't quite right so I took it back to the builder and he found that the
cam was defective and replaced it at no cost. Yes it was guaranteed but having it
local has its advantages.
