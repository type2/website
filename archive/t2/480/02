I did it, and I think that the alternator is a much better system.  I
wouldn't replace a working generator, but if it's bad there's no reason
not to switch.

If you're replacing a 38A generator, the parts you need are:

Stand for an alternator
Fan hub for an alternator or a 30A bug generator.
the three pieces of round tin in front of the generator from a 30A bug or
for an alternator.

If you're replacing a 30A generator all you need is the alternator stand.

I much prefer OEM tin and stands to the "conversion kits".

At the regulator, you have to make a couple of double ended spade
connectors to attach the big red wires together and the green and blue
wires together.  At the alternator end you need to make an adapter to
adapt the screw terminal to a spade terminal.

Check these connections for yourself, as my memory might be faulty!
