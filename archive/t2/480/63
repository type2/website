Thanks a lot for the help.  I'm starting to think it's actually in the 
transmission--probably the differential.  :(  When I coast to a stop (no 
breaks, in neutral) I hear a whiney/grindish "chirp, chirp, chirp, 
chirp, chirp" (about five chirps per second as the bus gets close to 
stopping).

I'm going to have a look at the fluid tomorrow.  Hopefully it just needs 
to be topped off, and all will be good in the world (not that I'm 
expecting that to be the case).

If you come up with any other idears, please let me know.

Jonathan
