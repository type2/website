The complete body and running gear minus the engine. Both front doors 
have vent windows removed. Sliding door is missing the hinge and sliding 
mechanisms but has the latches, it's sitting inside the bus. Brakes, 
wheels, axles, transmission, front seats, pedal assemblies, all fixed 
glass, and more. I have removed the back seats, gutted the dash of all 
electricals, removed head and tail light assemblies, inside door 
handles, window regulators, louvered windows. I may pull the trans. and 
axles tomarrow unless someone will take the whole thing and wants the 
tranny with it.

For all of you asking about individual parts, it may take a couple of 
days to reply to each of you. I need to sort through what I have and 
what I want to keep. I am interested in selling some of the stuff I dont 
need for my bus. but please be a little patient for the replies. I want 
to make sure I am not selling or giving away any trash. I pulled most of 
the stuff off without doing much inspection for quality.

Need to get rid of the bus by friday/saturday time frame. If anyone 
wants it please let me know quick, or it's off to the crusher.

Tom
