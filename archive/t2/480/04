Subject: ALTERNATOR/GENERATOR

I was recently informed that my 72 van has an alternator, not a generator.
I looked in the Bently, and I think that prior to 72 it was called a
generator
and after 72 it was called an alternator.
Can anyone out there verify this?

PS: sorry i cant't help with the original question, but i do want to clarify
       the difference between alternator & generator.
Alternator - alternating current?
generator - generating power?
