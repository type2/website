Darren,

Generators generate D.C. current(like your battery).

Alternators generate A.C. current("like" your wall socket) and then
"rectify" it using a set(generally 4 rectifiers) to output D.C.
current....this is supposed to be a superior way of providing charging
and running power over a generator.

Unless I have missed something serious, his t4 engine should
already have an alternator.  As I am almost 99.99% positive that
all t4 engines(72 and up) used alternators.

Cheers, dave
