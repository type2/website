Subject: alternator / generator

I do have a '74 bus, however, the PO took out the
type4 engine and replaced it with a single port
upright engine.  I am positive that is a generator and
not an alternator.  But from what it sounds like it
would be a solid idea to get an alternator instead. 
about how long does the whole install of a conversion
kit and alternator take?  Will i have to pull out the
engine?  If anyone knows, I'd appreciate the input
even more.  Thanks All!
