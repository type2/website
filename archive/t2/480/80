Subject: Rebuild vs. LongBlock

  This is a Friday question.  I am looking for opinions of rebuilding vs.
purchasing a long block.  Rebuild costs seems to be within $100 or $200 of the
cost of a rebuilt longblock, so, is it worth it to do the rebuild.  There is a
VW shop near me that has specialized in VW's since the 1960's.  I was told
that machine shop work would average about $500 to $600 for the average
engine.  Then I would have to purchase the necessary bearings, pistons,
cylinders, gaskets, etc etc to complete the rebuild.  This same shop has
rebuilt engines (each one is rebuilt by the owner of the shop) for $850.   So,
other than gaining experience, what am I saving by doing the rebuild myself?
I am a novice, the owner of the shop should be an expert by now.  Opinions
please, either p-mail or on the list.  This might be of interest to others
besides myself.
