Subject: need tow bar in Atlanta

The selected body shop is now ready to take my bus, which rolls, but has 
no engine installed.  I need to move it about 2 miles up Moreland Avenue 
on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning.  If I can't do it myself, I'll 
hire a flatbed tow truck. (Atlanta listees: don't use Northside Towing- 
they damaged my Beetle)
