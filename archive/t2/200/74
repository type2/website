 Thanks for the info Michael,
   I appreciate your help on the shipping. All I need for the stove are the 
guts. Everything is rusted to death and leaking proapne everywhere.
I keep you in mind on the seals, getting ready for the rainy season 
here in the North West.
Thanks,
Paul Saulsbury

direct link to search page for parts is

A search under dormobile should give you three results, one for a skylight 
and 2 for seals on the roof.

DORMOBILE SKYLIGHT SEAL £14.95
DORMOBILE ROOF WINDOW SEAL & INSERT £4.50

Ive used JK before without problem, im unsure if they will ship to the 
states (ill help if they wont) but im sure they will be very willing to 
answer any questions you may have regarding the size of the seals via email 
(mail(-at-)justkampers.co.uk)

Hope that helps
Michael
