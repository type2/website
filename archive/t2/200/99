Subject: On the road - New Jersey

Hi.

I am on the road this week.  South Eastern New Jersey.  Beach side.

Atlantic City and Cape May

Wanna hook up??  my cell is 703 861 9506 (Virginia area code).  I am in 
Lakehurst public library right now, so I wioll not be reading my e-mail

And I am always looking for yards or stashes of type 2's

BTW, on my trip back home to Northern Virginia, I will be looking at a '77 
camper with 'possibly' good canvas top.  My cohort in this suggested I take 
the whole poptop with canvas still attached.  This would make it easier to 
replace.

I don't need this canvas, but I can be approached.

The '77 also has a clock ($10 probably) and the catches on the dash for 
connecting the small table.  Again, I don't need any of this, but I hate to 
see this go to waste.  Willing to share for karma.

Barry B
'78 Westy
