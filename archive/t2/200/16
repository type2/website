Subject: Rebuilt heads needed


I have a '74 westy, and I need a pair of rebuilt heads for it (1800).

I was going to order them from Bus Depot, but they said they would
be 2-3 weeks out, and I really need them sooner.

Does anyone have a recommendation for another vendor who might be a bit
quicker? 

Another option might be to get my current heads rebuilt -- anyone know
of a decent shop in Eugene Oregon to rebuild VW heads?

Thanks.
