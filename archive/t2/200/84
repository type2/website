I'm getting ready to move in a few months and need to sell my 73 Westy =
project.  The body on the bus is good.  The fees are current.  Also =
included with the bus is a complete 2.0 engine from a 76 bus with =
manifolds and injectors, fuel injection computer, fuel tank from the 76 =
(fuel injection tank with the port for the return line),  fuel injection =
fuel pump, air cleaner, heat exchangers, a complete dash from a 71 bus, =
4 or 5 extra bus wheels, an extra set of bus front seats, extra engine =
cover, and some other small parts that I'm going to pull out of my =
storage unit and throw in with the deal.  I believe there are some extra =
fuel injection parts in there and some other pieces.  I'm asking $900.00 =
for everything.  Email me for pictures or with any questions you might =
have. =20
