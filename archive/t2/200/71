Subject: Solution: Name that mechanical failure #1

*drum roll please*

It was the fuel pump, apparently it failed outright.  When I disconnected 
the fuel line just after the pump and cranked the engine, I saw no fuel 
other than a small splash every 3-4 revolutions which I guess was 
responsible for the engine catching but not staying running.  I even 
removed the front cover of the pump to "burp" it, but it didn't help.  It 
was also leaking both oil *and* gas.  Lucky for us, I had previously used a 
Facet electric pump and had left it installed on the frame rail just in 
case of an emergency such as this.  I simply hooked up the positive wire to 
the coil, attached the two fuel lines and off we went.  I don't like to 
think about what we would have done without the backup pump (visions of a 
5-gallon pickle bucket on the rear bed, gravity-feeding the carbs come to 
mind).  No more Brazilian pumps for me, it's NOS or rebuilt german pumps, 
or maybe I'll just keep using the facet pump - it really wouldn't be that 
bad if I used some rubber mounts to subdue the noise.  In fact, I have a 
real soft spot for the Facet pump now that it saved us from being stranded.

Thanks for all of the replies!  Several people identified the fuel pump as 
the problem, including:

Frank Biffath
Greg Potts
Mathew Nardon

I tip my hat to you guys.  Hope you're on the AIRS list.  :)
