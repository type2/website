It is very difficult to do this.  You have to bend apart the two halves and
replace the diaphragm and seals.

The best thing to do is to call H&R automobile parts:

H & R Auto Parts Rebuilders =A0
10328 Oakwood Dr, Dallas, TX 75217
Phone: (972) 286-5516

All they do is rebuild vacuum boosters.  For $74, they disassembled my
booster, sand blasted inside and out, repainted, replaced seals and
diaphragm, and sent it back to me.  That is hard to beat.

I shipped it from Virginia to Dallas via US postal service parcel post.  It
got there on the 2nd day, it was ready and on the way back to me on the
third day.  Great bunch of guys.
