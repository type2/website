Subject: Re: [T2] What a find! I got my 0mile rebuilt engine from a junk yard.

I think it fits any bus but beware the compression ratio is higher and it 
may be more prone to detonation or overheating than a regular low 
compression bus engine.

There is another bus lister that has a 914 engine in his bus.

Congrats and good luck!
