Subject: Re: [T2] What a find! I got my 0mile rebuilt engine from a junk yard.

You will have a couple of problems:
1) The FI system is D-jetronic like a Type 3.
2) The spark plugs are on a different angle and bus tin won't work. The plug
holes don't line up.

This engine has 3 studs and nuts holding the intakes down, correct? Not 4 like
a bus engine with L-jetronic.
