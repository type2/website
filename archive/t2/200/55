Subject: Re: [T2] RE: hole in tin??

If you read my message, I said it was on the 75 1800. On those engines, the
temp sensor 2 went thru that hole in the tin. The sensor mounted on a 45
degree angle ABOVE #3 intake port. You have just been looking at 76 and up
2.0L engines. They made FI engines in 75 also.
The Bentley does not have any pics of it but go to section 10, 14. Read the
paragraphs after 4.7 testing and replacing temp sensors. On the next page is a
drawing, fig 4 -12. See the angle of the sensor and the fins??
Here is the 2nd paragraph:
"Temp sensor II is screwed into the front of the left-hand cylinder head,
above the combustion chamber of the no 3 cylinder. The sensor's rubber air
seal is visable in the top of the cylinder cover plate, directly between the
intake manifold of no 3 cylinder and no 3 spark plug hole."
Now go to the next page and read about how "To replace temp sensor II"

Unless you have a 75 1800 head, you will NOT have a sensor in that position on
the head. That is why you see nothing under it.
