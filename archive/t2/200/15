I have a 009 dist on my type 4 engine...It was suggested to me to put the old one back on...I looked in the archives and only found 11 matches on this...I am a bit curious what the opinions floating around about this might be...so far I have asked 2 people and both have said to change it to the regular one...I have noticed the little hesitation in 1st gear..is this the only difference?

thanks
