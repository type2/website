Hi again

For the cooker you may want to try http://www.volksheaven.co.uk/, its 
advertised as the biggest breakers yard for ACVW in the UK and its only 9 
miles away from me. If he has a cooker ask for a price.

Unfortunatley prices of used spares in the UK have gone up IMHO so you may 
be in for a shock, and then as you mention theres the exchange rate.

Michael
