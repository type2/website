Fix it before you have a uniquely burnt bus...

Do you have raw fumes coming through the heater or through the rear door 
seal or real window seal?

Does the engine hatch above the engine leak?

I bet you've got a fuel leak that only happens on downhill curvy roads and 
this is not exhaust but gas fumes.

Fix it!

Check all of the fuel lines, the vent lines, and the filler neck. The 
repair will cost less than $50 but will save you the cost of a replacement 
bus.
