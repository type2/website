Subject: Fwd: Name that mechanical failure #2

I got a lot of good suggestions for this one, but nobody guessed the exact 
problem.  I first found that the wire going from the condensor to the coil 
was frayed at the condensor.  I replaced the condensor and points with 
spares (brand new Wells parts) and the bus wouldn't start.  No spark.  I 
then proceded to curse the infidel American parts while digging out my 
soldering iron.  Found the soldering iron but no solder.  Guess I packed 
just a bit too fast.  In the end I just stripped some wire from the end of 
the Bosch condensor and twisted the coil wire around it.  Reinstalled the 
Bosch condensor and points.  When I was putting the cap back on, I checked 
out the contacts inside for corrosion and noticed that the button in the 
center was missing.  Then I looked at the rotor and the tab in the middle 
was also missing - broken off.  How this happened I will never know, but 
there was clear evidence (burn marks) that the spark had been arcing from 
the spring up in the center of the cap down to the jagged edge of the metal 
strip left on the rotor for some time.  I can't believe it ever ran this 
way, but it did!  I put on the spare cap and rotor and the bus roared to 
life again.  Guessed the dwell, set the timing and we were on our way back 
to Texas.

Thanks for the replies,
