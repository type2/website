Probably not.  I have left the covers off (while testing some things. at 
idle just little spray and a dribble that flowed back in.  Hit a high 
rev and watch the oil shoot out.  Not recommended for driveways or with 
engine in vehicles.  test stand with lots of clearance only and rags to 
catch it..  This oil running through  is not going to do a lot for 
cooling of the heads though.
