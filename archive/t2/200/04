Subject: Re: [T2] Used Mexican Bus?

You can go there and buy a bus to drive there and sell. I did this in Italy 
when I lived there. You can't bring it across the border and sell it here 
if it is less than 25 years old.

They will make you sign some paperwork and possibly pay a deposit to bring 
it across the border.

If you don't get it south of the border before a certain date you lose your 
money and they come looking for you.

As I understand it - anything 25 years+ old can come across the border now.
