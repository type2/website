Before you do anything else, make double sure you don't have more gas
leaks and do have pressure. If that's okay, my guess is your carb jets
may be clogged (usually from pieces of deteriorated cheap gas line). You
could either pull them and check by blowing through them both ways, or
try reversing two plug wires and crank to create a backfire through the
carb, which often clears clogged jets (some people don't like doing
this, but I've seen it work many times with no probs). If it is a clog,
Once it's cleared I'd add some fuel treatment and make sure your fuel
filter is in place and fresh.
