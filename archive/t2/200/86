Subject: Need help from one of the "masters"

I'm having some ignition trouble, and my VW Guy here in town told me I 
needed to replace the points. I went and bought some points for the stock 
dizzy for a 79' Bus only to get them home and realize my dizzy isn't the one 
that came with the bus. After looking in the list library, I've identified 
it as the dizzy out of a 1955-1960 beetle (0231 115 020/040). Can anyone 
tell me how to get to the points to replace them? Also, am I losing hp due 
to this dizzy? THanks,

Jared
79' Westy "Damn Dirty Bus"
