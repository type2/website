Subject: Re: [T2] 1800 heads

I have bought quite a few mofoco parts over the years.  only had one 
minor delivery prob out of about 20 orders.  In those days it was all 
type 1 stuff.  The only type 4 heads i can locate at mofoco are rebuilds 
with all new valves, guides, springs etc.  price is okay though.  same 
description pricing at busdepot and bus-boys.  Aircooled.net has new 
type 4 heads by Remmele (not spanish AMC) these are at 400 a head.  I 
did a lot of digging on parts when i first got the westy so as to 
determine how big of a parts shelf to put in.  t4 is a lot different 
than t1 in availability of parts.
