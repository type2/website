First, thank you all that responded yesterday. =20

Now my woes....

I crawled under the bus last night and plugged the vac line going to the =
brake booster.  It did not seem to make a change for the better.  I =
finally got the bus to idle and put the timing light on it.  It was at =
about 3ATDC.  Hmmm...   then I got to thinking, maybe when I took the =
dizzy out awhile ago, I put the vac lines on backwards.  Which hoses go =
where?  Or should I say, which port on the left carb is the advance?  I =
switched the hoses anyways, just to see.  I started the bus, it idledat =
about 800RPM for about 30 secs, then increased to around 12-1500RPM.  =
The advance also increased, could not tell where it was. Can anyone lend =
a couple of brain cells on this one?  Oh yeah, after I switched the =
hoses, the timing was at 5BTDC at 900RPM idle
