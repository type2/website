Hi Mark,

Happens a lot. The shoes are rusted into the drums.

Hit the wheel a few times between each of the lug nuts with a big hammer.
Then jump in, rev the engine and dump the clutch. Reverse will get you more
torque than first. Hopefully there's no-one parked in front or behind... it
will likely be dramatic when it breaks free.

This is one of the times it's an advantage to have a standard transmission.

Happy trails,
