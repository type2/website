Sounds to me like the shift coupler may have come apart.  This is the steel 
cage w/rubber bushings that connects your shifter and transaxle together.  
Take a look where the two meet, and have someone opoerate the shifter while 
the vehicle is parked(and not running).  If there is any flexation there, 
replace the unit.  I've had some strange effects caused by this same 
occurrence.
