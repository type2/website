Actually, I am back in the country.  But we didn't get your email.  As
you know from previous emails you've sent us, we do answer email sent to
sales(-at-)busdepot.com within 1-2 business days.  Perhaps you used a
different/wrong address this time around. 

Anyway, your order shipped via Global Express Mail on Feb. 26, just a
few business hours after you approved the shipping quote.  Tracking the
package (# EU07 9265 126U S) at www.usps.com shows that it left the U.S.
via Kennedy International Airport the next morning at 11:18 AM, but they
show no tracking data since it reached Italy.  As Cheri noted to you in
her emailed shipping quote, Express Mail is "somewhat trackable,
delivery within 2-5 business days, insured, but delivery time not
guaranteed."  The reason is that once the package reaches Italy it
becomes the responsibility of Italian Customs and the Italian postal
service, so the U.S. postal service doesn't control it after that point.
In this case, it apparantly reached Italy in less than two days but
hasn't been seen since.

We have initiated a tracking request with the post office. They will
contact the Italian postal service and your local post office, attempt
to locate the package, and get back to us in 1-5 business days (at which
time we'll get back to you).  If they have not found it by then, there
is a more intensive search procedure that lasts 45 days, after which it
is deemed lost.  If this first 5 business day stage doesn't produce any
results, we can ship a duplicate order, and defer billing on it for 45
days until the second stage is completed. This means that if the first
order showed up, you'd have to return it to us to avoid having your
credit card charged for the second one in 45 days. However, if the post
office determined it to be lost, you would not be charged at all for the
replacement shipment.   You may also want to contact your local post
office and see if they can do anything to check its whereabouts on their
end. Perhaps it's sitting at your post office for some reason.
