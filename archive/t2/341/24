I don't remember mine doing this.  If I recall, the spec for bearing clearance is only a couple of thousandths of an inch.  With the surfaces oiled (I assume that area is not "dry", even though you've started to disassemble it) there should be no "pivoting" of the rod at all.  If there was no oil on the bearings at all, it might pivot a tiny bit, but even then I think 2-3mm is way too much.  Just for the sake of knowledge, go buy a plastigage kit and measure the clearance:

My opinion is that the bottom end of your engine will need to be rebuilt.  :-(
