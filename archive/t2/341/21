Subject: VW Emblem???

Hey guys,

 

            Quick question.... the VW BUS that I bought used to have the
spare tire mounted on the front. The original owner decided to remove the
spare tire and the mounting bracket. He sent the car in to have all the rust
repaired, and all the holes patched, and have a professional paint job. He
paid something like $2,500 bucks just on the paint job. In any case, the
front of the bus now, doesn't have any holes or anything. I'd like to mount
a VW emblem (I prefer this over the spare tire). However, I don't
necessarily want to have to drill holes, because I'd be insanely worried
that I wouldn't drill them EXACTLY centered. Is there anywhere that I can
get the front Volkswagen emblem for my girlfriend's bus and have it affixed
using some sort of an adhesive or double sided duct tape?
