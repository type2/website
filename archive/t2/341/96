Deck height is more appropriately described as the closest point
of contact between the piston and anything it may contact
within the combustion chamber.
In your particular case, it's the edge of the piston and the cylinder head.
In another situation, the piston may be domed ( and not necessarily tallest
at the center- there are many styles of pistons in the VW world )
You may have a high lift camshaft, and the point of contact could be a
valve.

Try this- Make a ball of Play-Dough (tm) and place in the combustion
chamber.
Fit up the cylinder head ( spark plug removed ) and turn the engine
through two complete revolutions,  to verify the intake and exhaust valves
have completed their functions.
Remove the Play-Dough and carefully slice it at the thinnest area.
Measure the "deck" clearance.
Drop the Play-Dough in a graduated beaker.
Measure the difference in displacement.
This is your head chamber volume.
Do not throw the Play-Dough at your little sisters.
