Welcome to NJ, where you can be any age and still get those rates...All of the
lo-buck insurers you hear on radio or see on your spam, always end with the
line: NOT IN NEW JERSEY !
As to 'cheaper insurance', you might (but you didn't hear it here) consider
registering it somewhere rural near you, even if you hafta 'move' your
license there too... (Shh).
