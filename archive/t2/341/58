12 to 15 for the whole bus w/o curtains.

Method#1 Take the bus to an upholstery shop and get an estimate. Slip them 
a few bucks for the trouble.

Method#2 Go to the fabric store and measure the width of a roll of fabric. 
I think it is 4 feet.

Imagine the seat laying flat (cushions off) on the ground. Now decide if 
you can get enough fabric going front to back of the cushion with the roll 
(no - b/c the cushion is wider than 4 feet - right?) or left to right 
(probably the only way you can do it).

Is there enough fabric there to cover both the bottom and backrest cushions 
out of the same 4 foot roll going side to side? If not measure the width of 
the seat (i.e 5 feet for the backrest and 5 feet for the bottom) and divide 
by 3 to get the total yardage. 10/3 = 3.3 yards so buy 4 yards.

Don't forget to figure in for the amount you need to wrap around the edges 
to fasten it on. Same with the curtains - they are essentially 18" wide 
strips of fabric with sewn edges for the curtain rods at the top and a 
simple fold at the bottom.

Hope this is correct and helps... Anyone want to correct me and teach me 
something? Education is welcome...
