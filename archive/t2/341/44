Thanks for all the responses.

I'd be tempted to tow it with my Passat wagon - don't think the turbo would 
hold up, but I'm currently looking into a Jeep of some sort, so I can do a 
little wood trails exploration, plus tow the bus to a mechanic and/or to the 
campground (that's until I can get it running again).  Looks like Jeeps have 
about a 5000 tow capacity which should work, and now that gas prices are 
going up I'm waiting for the perfect deal to jump in on one....luckily I've 
only got a 6 minute commute and once the bus is back on the road, she'll be 
my daily transportation.

btw...i've seen the tow bars for beetles that look like they hook somehow to 
the front of the beetle's frame...they make one of those for buses?  I'd 
rather go that route than having to pick up a small trailor.

Thanks again!
