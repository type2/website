To answer Billy's question here, and include an update on the other bus
projects that I'm working on at present...

Can I?  Yes, if Giacomo's `77 lenses will fit a `79.

How much ($)?  I won't know until I run the figures.

At present, I'm catching up jobs that fell behind due to the flu in
February, and my getting slowly chlorine gas poisoned over the fall and
winter.  I should be able to have the figures for the side markers and other
lenses by sometime next week.

I've been following lens sales at TheSamba to get an idea of what they're
selling for, but from Bradley's post I realized that all is not as it seems
there.

If I do the lenses, they'll be mastered from the ones on Giacomo, so they
should fit `73 through `79.  Right?
