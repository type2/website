From the be grateful anything's still available files:
Send me the specs on your mounting holes and
I'll hand make a spare tire mount for you but
only if you return the favor and make up a spare
tire mount for my Morgan...
Be grateful that 'stuff' is still available for your
VW, and at reasonable prices and quality. You'd
hate to be like the guys on the Austin-Healey
list who just got a 'recall' on kingpins from
Moss Motors (Sorta the "Sears Roebuck" of
orphaned British cars)...Those kingpins are not
easy to replace (again), nor are they cheap...

BTW, those air defectors at the corners of the
Bus dashboard, Jags have them too; $200 a pop.
