Subject: Bus Depot where are you?

Hi... some days ago I placed an order with Bus Depot, now after more than a
week and despite my continuous requests Bus Depot seems disappeared; they
don't answer my emails too.
They said shipping to Italy was no problem, I asked for express delivery
which should have taken my stuff here by last monday at worst... 

Does anyone know why they don't answer?!? Did I trust too much? what about
my credit card!?
