Subject: !still looking for someone in east SC going to Everybus!

Hey folks,
posted a couple of days ago looking for anyone on the
east coast of South Carolina who is going to everybus.
I have a friend in Myrtle beach who needs a ride up.
I'm in Anderson and would rather not have to go all
the way down there and then back up. The Saudies have
enough of my green already. My friend is nice doesn't
bite unless in the middle of a burger and I promise to
buy you a beer when we meet. 
Thanks 
Giles
