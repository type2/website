Subject: Re: [T2] Timing help

> I'd like some help timing my 1970/1971 Westfalia. The issue is that the
chassis number indicates that the vehicle is a 1970 (2302128146), whereas
the engine code is for a 1971 motor (AE000404X). There are 3 timing marks on the crankshaft pulley similar to
the original 1970 pulley. Additionally, the carburetor seems to be the original model (30 PICT-3) . As for the
distributor, I can find no distinguishing markings to indicate the type other than "Bosch made in Germany".
With this information, should I be setting the timing at TDC vacuum hose
disconnected and plugged (as for a 1970) or 5 degrees ATDC vacuum hose
connected (as for the 1971 engine)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 3 notch pulley is correct for a 1970 engine WITH a single unit vacuum advance.

The number on the case means nothing, except in 1971 it came in another vehicle. I believe the X on the end
means it was rebuilt?

Timing a stock engine must be done by the distributor that is in it.
If you go by the AE and want to use the 5 after figure, then you would need this dist. :

Bus & Pickup 1971 * 1600
Distributor: VW 211-905-205Q, Bosch 0231 167 055 or 211-905-205S, 0231 180 001 > 043-905-205D, 0231 176 033
Can Use: VW 043-905-205D, Bosch 0231 176 033, 113-905-205AH, 0231 167 053
Vacuum Can: 07 092
Timing Set At:: 5deg ATDC (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose(s) connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 2-5deg Adv, 11-13deg Ret; Centrifugal: 12-16deg (-at-) 2200rpm, 22-25deg (-at-) 3800rpm

You will notice that it has vacuum advance and vacuum retard, hence it is a dual vacuum unit distrbutor.

If you have a single vacuum unit you should have this dist:

Bus & Pickup 1969-1970 * 1600
Distributor: VW 113-905-205T, Bosch 0231 137 035 or 036
Can Use: VW 113-905-205M, Bosch 0231 137 021
Replacement: VW 111-905-205AA, Bosch 0231 137 039
Vacuum Can: 07 024 (Replacement uses 1237 121 400)
Timing Set At:: 0deg TDC Static or (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe w/vacuum hose disconnected and plugged
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum (Advance Only): 17-19deg (-at-) 1.3 In. Hg, 32-35deg (-at-) 3.2 In. Hg

This is the correct 70 dist. But all it has is vacuum advance.

Look real close around the body of your distributor and try to find the numbers on it.
Another question: does it have a vacuum unit on it?
