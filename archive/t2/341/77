My apologies to Ron and company at Bus Depot.

When I wrote "... if those were repro lenses, you may have been ripped off.
Quality repro lenses should not turn white or get brittle.", I meant that
the manufacturer may be responsible, not necessarily the retailer.

I tend to respond as a manufacturer as well as a direct retailer, and I
sometimes forget that repros are also sold through retailers who get their
stock from another party.

While some retailers might pass along a bad product, from what I've read
here, Bus Depot does not.

Kudos, Ron.  Sorry for any offense.
