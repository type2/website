Subject: Re: [T2] Some more on "measuring deck height"

I use a flat bar with a hole in it to measure deck
height, calaper has a rod that sticks out the bottom
of the scale, measure the thickness of the bar, depth
from top of bar to cyl head, subtract thickness of the
bar and you have deck height in thou's. Phil
