Subject: disposable propane bottles

Has anyone besides me noticed that those disposable 16oz propane bottles leak 
after you use them once?  They don't leak a lot, but if you listen carefully 
you can usually hear them leaking a little.  What I've done is to buy caps 
for the partially used bottles at dyersonline.com.  It's a special 1"-20 
threaded brass cap that I haven't found anywhere else.  Might as well be 
safe.

I just got rid of my Westy propane tank and converted my stove to disposable 
bottles.  It works great and it so much lighter.  I bought an adapter from 
gleasoncamping.com that has a shutoff valve.  That valve has a 1/4 inch 
output which I ran to a barbecue pressure regulator with hose attached.  The 
hose connects right to the Westy stove.  When I'm not using the stove I make 
sure to use the shutoff valve on the adapter.  That cuts the gas off right at 
the bottle.  A leaky pressure regulator inside the van would be disastrous.  
Just in case, I also have a 12V LP gas detector in the same cabinet.
