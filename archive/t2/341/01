I always shy away from assembly line, high volume builders. I want to be 
able to talk turkey with the craftsman/journeyman that does the work. This 
is typically someone who is well worth 3 or 4 times the hourly rate of an 
assembly line nerd. I use NW Con Rod in Seattle, but just north of you in 
Boston is Boston Bob, a similar operation. Even if I lived in NJ, if I 
needed a motor for MY keeper Bus, and I didn't have the time or facilities 
to do it myself, I would not hesitate to ship one from Seattle, because I 
KNOW I will get the kind of quality parts and enhanced specs that can give 
200k+ miles with decent maintenance (T-IV motor). But I am not like most. I 
know that to reduce the risk of failure to nil, you cannot compromise 
actual time/money/skill invested. It ALWAYS takes more time/money/skill to 
do the job right than it does to pretend to do the job. There are far far 
more pretenders out there than there are true craftsmen. How do you find 
such a craftsman?? Ask around, just like you are doing here. Hire your 
builder by reputation only. I have never seen anyone of impeccable 
reputation overcharge for their skills. Expect to pay twice as much as the 
pretenders and get 3 times the value. These are all rules of thumb. Success 
or failure always hinges upon compromise.
