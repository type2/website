You have a good point there! Currently I live in Northern Arizona where 
we have no smog checks, but should I ever decide to move I guess I might 
have trouble. Is there anyone who lives in Phoenix Arizona who knows the 
ins and outs of smog regs. in Arizona's big cities?

If I were to put the 78 engine in the 81 I hope to put the 81 f.i. setup 
on the 78 if possible and maybe the catalytic converter in the exhaust 
system. I realize that if I keep the original heads on the 78 I can't 
use the 81 pipes due to the difference in the port shapes between the 
two years. Do they check that closely in most states?

Mainly I'm wondering if the oil fill pipe and dipstick tube from the 81 
will fit on the 78. I didn't get a very good look at the 81 but did see 
that the engine compartment is much shorter on the 81. Consequently it 
has a neat little door in the back  center to access the dipstick and 
oil fill pipe. I think the pipe and tube on the 78 would wind up in an 
inaccessible area of the engine compartment. Does anyone have any advice 
on this?
Thanks

P.S.
Yes I might rather have a loaf but this box is in such nice condition.
