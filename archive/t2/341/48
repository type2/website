Subject: side marker lens

I need a suggestion from the collective wisdom of the list.

I bought a set of side marker lens for my bus 18 months or so ago.  All 
four, front and back, are starting to turn white and the plastic is 
brittle.  Has anyone gotten a set of side marker lens that have lasted a 
long time and is satisfied with them?  If so tell me where you bought 
them and I'll go there.

Thanks for your help.

Bradley,
79 bus
