Dave,

You are correct. Deck is measured at the high point of the main piston body
not at the base of the dish.  For CR calculations you then measure the
volume of the dish in the same way as you would measure the volume of the
head chamber. This volume is added to the chamber volume to calculate CR. A
stock 2.0l bus piston has a 15cc dish. If the pistons are domed, you still
measure deck the same way, but subtract the dome volume from the head
chamber for the CR calculation. Domes are harder to measure, one way to do
it is to make a casting of the piston top and then you can use the disc and
liquid method to measure the amount of liquid it takes to fill your cast
dish. The only domes are on 1.7l motors, I believe.
