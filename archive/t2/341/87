Unfortunately I have the style of dial gauge that has the movable rod
sticking out the back of the gauge so I can't try to duplicate your method.
Too, the Vanagon engines have pistons with wide dishes in the middle of the
piston so any method of measuring deck height always has you working on the
edges of the pistons, not near the middle.
