Subject: NAPA  ball joint snafu

Would anyone else care to forward a note
to Casey < GotUnailed(-at-)aol.com > and
explain why a hacksaw is not the proper tool 
for replacing ball joints in the torsion arms ?
Her NAPA machinist is having a hard time.
He says it's the "worst" set he's ever done.
I'm thinking she misunderstood, and he 
actually said it's the "first" set he's ever done.
I've suggested she take a Bentley to the store
and request to see the tools required.
