Here's an idea.  Untried, but I'll wager that it will work:

Get a half-dozen neodymium magnets:

Glue them to the back of the emblem with epoxy or somesuch.

You now have an emblem that you can simply stick on when you want it.
Each magnet can hold 10 pounds of force, so if you use six the emblem will
stay put!
