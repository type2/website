Subject: Re: [T2] inside slider handle

 door from the inside and the other normal on is for
 closing.  btw, both handles are in excellent condition
 if someone wants to run down and get them.

ONLY the front handle works the latch.
The rear handle is a helper handle ONLY, to use to pull the door closed..
It does NOT move.
It does NOT pivot.
Here is a pic of the door:

#16 are the handles. Front and rear are the same.
#15A is the rear handle mount.
It is bolted to the door. All it is is a bracket to hold the handle.
It is NOT attached to #9, the rear latch, in any way.
Only the front handle operates #20 which in turn operates #9.
