Bradley, if those were repro lenses, you may have been ripped off.  Quality
repro lenses should not turn white or get brittle.

At the very most, when the lenses that I produce are exposed to extreme
ambient outdoor heat (normal outdoor temp, not the campfire!), they might
get a little bit flexible; but they should never lose color, clarity, or
molecular cohesion (sorry, I just like that phrase... they shouldn't get
brittle.)

The clear urethane resin that I use is actually more durable than the
original lens plastic.  I sometimes demo a lens by tossing it across a room
onto a hard floor...

... I just went outside and "tested" a CF&Son's 3" round repro lens (1943
A-C tractor tail light lens) with my reconditioned antique Crossman Arms "M1
Carbine" BB rifle.  With an ambient outdoor temp of 81.8 degrees F, at 10',
6', and 3', the BB's left almost no discernible mark on the lens.

It wasn't until I brought the rifle to bear at 12" (inches), that I was able
to crack the edge of the lens.  Even so, the lens is intact.  There's a
small, 0.5" x 0.25" "T"-shaped star, but it's all internal to the lens and
the lens is still completely functional.

... and I did NOT lose an eye!

Question: What buses will `77 lenses fit?  Side marker, turn signal, tail
light and license lenses?  Thanks!
