It depends what you have in it, but unladen figure 3300 lbs for any Westy.
Add people, gear, a full water tank, spare tires and the number starts to
approach 4000 lbs.

See the manual for more data and this message in the archives:

An "American" car with a class 2 hitch could perform the emergency towing
you are thinking about if the terrain was flat but you'd be pushing the
limit. Any big truck or truck-like SUV with a heavy duty class 3 or better
hitch will have no problem.

I had to push my bus uphill once with the help of three other people. Busses
are heavier than they appear.

This is a picture of my bus getting towed by a 2002 Ford Expedition on a
heavy full size trailer. We had no problem and we were rated for ~7000 lbs.
