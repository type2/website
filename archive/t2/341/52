That rules out a Wrangler.  Short wheelbase + light weight = dangerous tow vehicle.

I am continually amazed when I hear people claim they have towed xyz vehicle with their little Golf, Beetle or what have you.  These people have simply been lucky, and are accidents waiting to happen IMO.  Having the power to pull a vehicle is NOT the concern.  Having enough weight, stability and brakes to safely control the load IS the concern.  Sure, I could pull a Suburban down the street with my bus, but one good wind gust or panic stop and I would be toast.  If you pull a bus with a Jeep Wrangler, you will be toast also, sooner or later.  Even a V-8 Grand Cherokee is only a marginal tow vehicle when you're talking about pulling 5,000lbs (bus on a trailer).  If you want to tow your bus, get a tow vehicle that is based on a full-sized truck with a class 3 or better hitch.  Anything less is just asking for it.
