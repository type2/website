Shouldn't her address be "gothernailed(-at-)aol.com b/c I think the mechanic 
needs to be replaced and is looking for reasons to jack the price. 
Measuring her ability to pay and how much she does or does not know.

Good luck - Casey - I've got to second Dave's statement. If he can't get 
the old out, I have no confidence he'll get the parts installed correctly. 
Make sure he stays away from the arms with a torch. A little heat might 
help (shouldn't need it) but alot might ruin the heat treatment and you've 
got an instant safety hazard on the road.
