Subject: Re: [T2] improvised clock dash install

I had the instrument panel out so I took a quarts clock movement and 
installed it in the right pod by removing the center riveted button from the 
blank dial and screwing the clock movement in it's place.
But in the spirit of not really caring EXACTLY what time it is there are no 
numerals on the dial.
I also added a tiny light to illuminate the clock.
