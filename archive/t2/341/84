Yes, but a limited inventory at present.  Usually client specific
commissions.  We sell both retail and wholesale (wholesale to qualified
dealers and/or retailers).

It's usually something for an antique vehicle when I do, or for my own
vehicle.  I've done tractor lenses, and I'm currently working on lenses
and/or lens sets for Toyotas, Audis, and for Giacomo (`77 VW buses).

For the record, I do not do European altezza-style tail lights.  Way too
much liability involved, and most of the desired types are very, very
difficult to produce.
