All true but not very helpful. I'm sure the Austin-Healey and Jensen folks
shake their fists at us as their lists overflow with messages stating how
lucky they are to be paying $200 for a piece of small plastic compared to

I'll rephrase my question: do new mounts exist with two different bolt
patterns or will I be forced to drill more holes.
