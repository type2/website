Subject: IGNITOR

I just wanted thank everyone for helping me out while I tried to get my
bus back on the road.  A couple of weeks ago, I pulled he engine to
replace the clutch and well once I put the engine back in, nothing
happened.  It turned out that I connected the IGNITOR up wrong.  So now
I have a new electric points module and everything is running great.
It's nice to back on the open road.  I have a 72 bus and I used a
universal IGNITOR part number 1800062, 1847V, Per-Lux Ignition.

I also pulled my gas tank and replaced the fuel sender with an early
beetle model.  The beetle model is a float type, while the one that was
in my gas tank was a column sender.  It's working fine also.

So thanks for all the help list.  I  hope I'll be able to do the same
someday.
