In addition, every one I've seen requires you to have another vehicle with separate insurance that is your "primary" vehicle.

Still more:  Most if not all will want pictures and it had better look good.  They also require that it be kept in a locked garage and never parked on the street.  My bus meets all of those requirements except the one about looking good, so I still have standard insurance.

Sorry but there is no free lunch when you're 17 and need insurance.  When I was 17 I had a $250 car and $100/month insurance payments (liability only).  Get ready to pay, and pay, and pay.  Sorry...
