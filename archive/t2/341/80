List,

I just bought some rear wheel bearings and seals for my VW Thing from NAPA.
I shopped around quite a bit before I bought them, as they are pricey
everywhere, and I wanted good parts. Before I had them brought in, I made
sure to ask where the parts were made. The NAPA ones were SKF made in
germany, OE quality. The seals were also german, Elring brand and much
better than the seals sold by our local VW specialist.

So go figure.
