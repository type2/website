My 66 does that.  The "front" most end of the bed tilts up a bit.

Not difficult. but you might want to remove the icebox and jump seat
first.  You may not need to remove it, though.  Look at the hardware and
mechanisms that support the bed.  They're pretty simple and
straightforward.  Look for bend/broken/loose pieces....these things tend
to see a lot of abuse.

As for repair...that depends on what's wrong. :)

OTOH it could be something along the lines of added carpet that goes under
the front of the base of the bed causing it to be mounted at a slight
angle....

No substitute for a hands-on investigation.
