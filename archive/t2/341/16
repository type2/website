Subject: Low clearance adaptor to use large filter w/ progressive carb

Re the odd to find air cleaner element for aftermarket carb kit-I had a
71 bus (still in the woods) where I installed a kit Pinto carb
progressive that came with what I thought was too small of an element
air cleaner- so I adapted a 2"?? tall large diameter (10"??) Toyota
filter in a mannner that it needed only 1/4" of clearance to the engine
compartment roof (the adaptor for the stock manifold lifted the carb
significantly)....essentially I replaced the lower plate of the filter
holder with a larger diameter one (flat, with 6 eyebolts fastened to it
to surround the large filter. The hexagon this defines should have one
flate facing  the rear.  Make a similar solid plate (I used masonite, I
recall) that will go above the filter. Grind/cut the upward protruding
bolts flush to their nuts. I used 6 springs bent to stay on the lower
plate and manually hook over the upper eyebolts. (requires bending the
end uppwards to form a semicircle).  To install the filter, grease its
lips or use nonhardening sealer, and slip it into the circle of upper
eyebolts.  Slide this over the lower plate and clip all six springs to
the upper eyebolts.  I epoxied a pipe to the lower plate to which the
breather hose would go.
