Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Filtering fuel (NOT IN THE BBQ)

A frined of mine from Montana, real cowboy, taught me a neat trick for  lighting charcoal.  Take a toilet paper roll, stuff it with a  couple of paper towels, put it in the center of the grill, pile the  coals all around it,  and douse the paper towels in the roll with  vegetable oil.  Light it and walk away.  In a little while  the coals will be perfect and ready to spread.  I never use any  kind of fuel anymore other than the vegetable oil.  Try it.   We're already carrying gasoline and propane.  Most of us carry  vegetable oil on campouts anyhow.  Why add another dangerous  accelerant to the mix?

There will be plenty of pain when you use gasoline to light the bbq.
Don't be foolish. Gasoline flashes off quickly it isn't of much use to
light charcoal. It's dangerous. And there are better products for
parts washing.

Like I said before, this things works great!

If you want to blow up yourself and your friends up by using it to
light the Kingsford, have the phone handy to dial 911.

Use the gas the way Sheik Yerbouti intended, in the Bus!
