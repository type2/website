Subject: Re: [T2] stool

Speakin' o' stools - I have an orange stool - it is one of the ones that 
have the arburite on two sides and not 4. I'd like to trade it for a sage 
green stool for my 78. I know there is some one somewhere in the world with 
an orange bus and a sage green stool - just waiting to meet me - will he get 
this email?
