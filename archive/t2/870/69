Subject: Re: [T2] wires

I've TEED to that wire to power up a 12v socket (any auto store) that 
screws PERFECTLY into that hole next to the stove controls. Powers the 
rear TV. BTW, in mine, the stock fuse for it is an inline fuseholder 
that's hard to get to behind the accessory under dash shelves.

quoth Kevin Roberts: Maybe you guys can save me some time.  I'm about to 
install a new  stereo.  What are the wires that run under
the driver's side  carpet, through a hole under the front seat and back? 
  Looks  factory.
