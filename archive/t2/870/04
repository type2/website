Subject: SVDA and Kadrons

I just got an SVDA distributor and ported throttle plate for my Kadrons 
and without directions being included or available at aircooled.net I'm 
having some problems. The first thing is with the SVDA. When I installed 
it number one was pointing in a different direction than the 009 was so 
I rotated the plug wires around to match. Then after I installed the new 
base on the left carb I discovered that it was next to impossible to 
attach the vacuum hose. I found one reference in the T2 archives from 
someone who had installed theirs on the right carb. When I started it 
the engine didn't want to idle and after a lot of fiddling it wants to 
race for a couple seconds and then die way down before repeating the 
same symptom. What have I done wrong?

Since I'm on digest I'd appreciate any answers to both me and the list.

Larry
