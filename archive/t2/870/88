Subject: Front Bumper Tag Holder/Bracket

The center heater tube is in, sealed and insulated. Looking at my A/C condenser, I can see the insulation may cause a problem, I will see.

Anyway, my Florida Tag now says "1972 BUS" because everyone kept asking me what year it was. My old tag "OYUKI", (Oyuki means Honorable Snow in Japanese, my Bus is completely Bright White), that I have had for many years is now retired. I am going to remove the renewal stickers from it
and I want to hang it on the front. But, my Bus does not have a front license plate mount.

Since some states required front and rear tags, VOA must have had something for this.  Was there something special for this or did they just get a generic tag mount and drill holes in the bumper?
