Hey Larry
      any info you want about the Kadrons set up  you should contact AJ Sims 
at  _http://lowbugget.com/_ (http://lowbugget.com/)  He truly is the  Kadron 
expert. He can tell you what jets and any other info you need to make  them 
work.
 
Why anyone is still buying from aircooled.net  is beyond  me , I  see he's 
selling bus backing plates at twice the price of anyone else.
