Try Candy Hill Campground just West of Winchester, Va (rt 50 West, left 
Ward ave or Hwy 1317- cleasnest family run place I'ver ever seen with a 
garden display of Americana you'd have to see to believe. Interesting RR 
cars. I haven't seen a KOA yet that wasn't too cheek to jowl for me.
We tried to find Cunningham Falls St Park on our way down 15 from 
Gettysburg; found it poorly marked as though the locals did not want you 
to find the campground and it was closed on our way to Everybus.
