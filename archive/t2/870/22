well the same camp spot were using for John Browns Buses is first rate.
also you are not far from the C&O canal where there are some camp sites.
state parks with camping
my favorites include
. Greenbriar state park
. Cunningham falls state park
also
. Gambrill state park

couple commercial campgrounds in the Antietam area but I am not familiar
with em, I like the state parks myself.  try Greenbriar, my kids liked it
there best.

also in the area is
. Harpers Ferry
. Sheperdstown
. the first Washington Monument
. Crystal Grottos
. the Ziem winery is near Antietam for the big kids
. the outlets in Martinsburg for the shoppers
. night racing and slots for the adult in Charlestown.
. "rump bump" tubing on the Shenedoah river.
. Gettysburg is not far but far far more touristy and crowded than
Antietam
. maybe one of the largest fleamarkets around on route 340 between Harpers
Ferry and Charles town. if your interested I could give you more detailed
directions, it's at an old drive in movie theater.


lots to do

Bob
