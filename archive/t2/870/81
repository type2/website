I believe the '68 thru '72 (maybe '73?) Westy interior is in the
Bentley.  The Z-bed is pretty straighforward.  IIRC, the only tricky
bit for me was getting it flat on the floor.  The wood floor height (if
you throw out the original) needs to be higher than just the bare steel
floor.
If the Z-bed is from a different year, things get interesting.  IIRC,
the '74/75 is a wider bed, and '76-'79 assumes the cabinet is on the
LH-side not the right.

The only thought I'd have is in regards to getting it to fit properly
after you've modified it.  You could just replace the plywood with
fresh wood, but it sounds like you have a larger scope in mind.

Good Luck,
