This "argument" is of no value to anyone who subscribes to a list like
this for support and knowledge, and more likely would make even a
lurker like myself want to unsubscribe or worse yet, never be willing
to share his own opinion or experiences of relavant "list" information
for fear of being flame broiled.

This is a little like being in the same room while two relatives
fight, and they are either unable to take it out side or looking for
back up, which neither is obviously going to get as this isn't a
couciling list.
