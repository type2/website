How many coats did you put on, Greg?  And you must not have seen  the email where I asked you how your oil temps looked on your  trip.  Mine were running estremely high.  I know it wasn't  correct because the oil wasn't hot to the touch.  Then it quit  working altogether for a day or so and now I'm getting what I think are  reliable readings.  I've got to get back on it and find out what's  up with that thing.  One thing I know I did wrong was use thread  sealer.  Didn't have the manual and when I downloaded it to check  out the wiring, I saw that note.  Too late!  It can affect  the ground.  Glad you had a good EB trip.  Cheers...KR

The original color of the westfalia pop-top was unpainted fibreglass.

I painted the poptop on the westfakia back in the spring of 2001. I  
cleaned it with "VIM" cleaner and scotch-brite pads and it looked  
excellent, but since I had already purchased a quart of interlux  
premium yacht enamel I decided to use it. Five years later it is  
still gleaming white and shiny. It's expensive, but it applies very  
well with a brush and roller and the end product is worth the  
expense. From a cheap-(-at-)$$ like me, that's saying something.

Happy trails,
