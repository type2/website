Subject: Breakdown in CA: Help needed

78 Bus, stock FI:
Symptoms:
Bus has less power than it did before.
Cuts out in 2nd at 28mph. Ignition just shuts off (not from the switch
though but in the engine compartment). Popping the clutch will start it
again. Will often backfire when this happens.

I verified the timing, plugs are tan/gray, swapped in a new points and
condensor. No difference. I tried a hotwire to the coil. No difference.
Spent an hour checking for vacuum leaks. Nada. Pulled all the plug wires one
at a time, each cylinder was firing. Double relay passes Bentley tests.

I'm going to limp back to my in-law's in Anaheim (I'm in Huntington Beach
right now). I should have been on the road back to Colorado already, so any
help ya'll can provide would be greatly appreciated.
