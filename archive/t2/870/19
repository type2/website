Subject: westy camping trailer and Antietam battlefield camping advice 

All,
I am planning on the build of a "Westrailer" type of camping trailer.  I'm
looking for any tips, tricks, or construction ideas you all have used.  I
have studied the Pott's family trailer, and really like it a lot, but as
always, I'm open to any and all ideas.
Also, to the listers in VA area ... the family (wife, 3 kids) and I are
planning a Memorial day camping trip to Antietam Battlefield, and I am
looking for any good advice on camping spots, other things to do in the
area.  While there we are planning on attending Bug Out.
Let me know, and as always, much thanks in advance!
Have a great day!
Mark
