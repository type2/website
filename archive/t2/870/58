Not to continue the pissing match, but Genuine VW means doesn't
specifically mean that a part is German.  Remember, VW is building
Baywindows in Brazil to this day, even if they *did* start using those
disgusting "radiator" and "water pump" things last year. :-)

Back to the original topic --
I don't see why the butterfly section with the vacuum port couldn't be 
put
on the other carb.  There's no left or right carb with the Kadrons, 
though you
might have to swap the linkage connector/arm from the other one to make
it work .. it's been a few years since I've worked with them.  Yeah, 
*ideally*
you want the vacuum signal coming from the 1/2 bank of the engine, but
sometimes you've just gotta go with what works.
