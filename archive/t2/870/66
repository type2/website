Subject: wires

Maybe you guys can save me some time.  I'm about to install a new  stereo.  What are the wires that run under the driver's side  carpet, through a hole under the front seat and back?  Looks  factory.  Do they snake behind the cabinets?  Any advice on  the best place to run the wires?  I'm thinking of running 8 guage  from the battery to a 4-way splitter in the cabinet under the rear  seat.  I've got a nice 4 fuse box .  I think I'll mount the  ham radio and stereo amp under there and put in a couple of accessory  outlets.  I could probably just power the head unit off of the  main fuse box.  Thanks....KR
