I don't have a vested interest in either John, Aircooled.net or  
Mario, but I saw that Mario immediately (2nd reply) responded to this  
original thread with:

"Why anyone is still buying from aircooled.net  is beyond  me , I   
see he's selling bus backing plates at twice the price of anyone else."

This seemed like a personal attack to me, and had it happened on one  
of my sites, would not have been tolerated.

This community should be about mutual respect and support, not about  
personal attacks...

Just my 2 cents.
Anton
