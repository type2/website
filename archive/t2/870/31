The KOA in Harper's Ferry where John Brown's Buses was held is very 
good and not far away but it is expen$ive. You get what you pay for, 
the facilities are excellent and there is Civil War history right 
there in the park, and even more close by downtown.


Not anymore, which is why we moved John Brown's Buses to The Brunswick
Family Campground in Brunswick, Maryland just a few miles away. KOA doesn't
even list it as a location anymore. And last year, while still expensive (-at-)
$36.00/night, the facilities weren't all that great either. Check out
http://www.watermelonpark.com/ in Berryville, Virginia, right between
Winchester and Round Hill (where I live). I've never camped there but it
looks like a nice place. It's also only 15-20 minutes from Harper's Ferry.
