Lots of things in life are dangerous.  With a proper amount of caution you
can safely use gasoline to light fires and wash parts.  Without proper
caution you can kill yourself with "safe" charcoal lighter and "safe"
cleaning solvent.  Ask any emergency room doc.

It won't turn stale or liquid-contaminated gas into fresh gas.  No matter
what the cost, discard the old gas.  It's not worth recontaminating the
system.
