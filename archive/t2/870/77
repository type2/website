 Alright, I've decided to do it.  I'm going to make a
 stool repro  out of MDF and turn it into a subwoofer
 box.  At one time or other  I had a blow up that
 showed the dimensions of the original stool.   Of
 course I can't find the link now.  Anybody recall
 where it can  be found?  It's not on Type2.com
 anywhere that I can find. I need  the dimensions for
 the taller '76 stool.  Thanks...KR
