Hey John- it's over. Get over it. Your contributions have been very valuable
and appreciated; don't let this controversy stop your contributions to the
type2 list. This is not the arena for your problems with Mario. If your
directions for the Kad install are not proprietary, please post them as I am
sure many of our members NEED this info.. I know I could use them.... Ted

Don't take life to seriously -- you'll never live throught it....
