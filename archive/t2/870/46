Subject: A/C Questions

My '72 Bus is now ready for the A/C installation.  I am currently reattaching some of the vent holders that had come loose.  For something that was stored in a VOA box for 25+ years, everything is in suprisingly good condition.

Since I am going to set the A/C up to use 134A fluid, do I need to obtain a new/different expansion valve?  I would use R12, but it is way too expensive, even though it cools better.  I have heard of Freeze12, but I also heard it contains Butane!  Not something I would want to have leak into my Bus.

My center heat transfer tube is now installed and sealed.  I will be ready for the next "cold" Florida winter.
