sounds almost exactly like what I just fixed on my 78bus, the vacuum
advance diaphram got a pinhole. wouldn't advance the engine so no power
above about idle.  take your distributor cap off. take the vacuum hose
from the advance diaphram to the air box off and suck on it, see if the
point plate moves and if it will hold a vacuum.   mine would advance but
then just return on it's own.  replaced the diaphram unit and instantly
back to normal.

worth a look, also check for loose wires

good luck
Bob
