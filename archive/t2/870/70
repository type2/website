Subject: Re: [T2] Scamp Trailer Behind 78 Bay

Good luck sourcing a Scamp right now, as their factory burned to the ground
recently.  I understand that they hope to be back in the trailer-making
business within the year, but that may make getting a new Scamp near to
impossible at this juncture.

I myself am hoping to eventually find some sort of camping contraption to
pull behind the '84, as the '69 is just getting too small for our family.  I
am considering the idea of a pop-up camper, but something like a Hymer Eriba
would be ideal.  Too bad they don't import them.

Good luck,
