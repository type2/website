First, e-mail Aircooled.Net instead of the list, and you'll get an adequate
(and more accurate) reply then asking listmembers. You get it because that's
what you paid us for. Besides, I'd prefer you did this because we have more
expience on these things then anyone in the World, and I do not want you
getting misleading or flat out WRONG information from someone else that may
be trying to help.

When you purchase these parts online, you get 5 PAGES of instructions. If
you did not get them you should check your SPAM/Bulkmail folder for them,
all your questions (and far more) are addressed there.

If you did not get them, e-mail me (with your name so I can verify the
purchase) and I'll e-mail or fax them, whatever you wish.
