I  are
planning a Memorial day camping trip to Antietam Battlefield, and I  am
looking for any good advice on camping spots, other things to do in  the
area.  While there we are planning on attending Bug  Out.



hey mark  remember that bull run is right there in manassas also. I  found it 
very interesting to see just how close these crazy fools were to each  other 
.Nice thing about bull run was that there were two battles fought  
there.Standing there makes you wonder why Lee stopped Stonewall from taking DC  when he 
want to continue at the first bull run when there was no way they could  have 
stopped him. Bunch of campgrounds around the battlefield. Harpers ferry is  
really nice and interesting . Of course going up the valley you have Lexington  
Va. where Robert E Lee and Stonewall are buried, well most of stonewall his arm 
 is up the valley a ways :) , Then there is New market, Where the VMI cadets 
ran  the yankees off. Also remember that the following weekend is 
_www.naturalbus.com_ (http://www.naturalbus.com)   in Natural Bridge  Va.  later  mark 
dearing
