Hi Mark,

The KOA in Harper's Ferry where John Brown's Buses was held is very  
good and not far away but it is expen$ive. You get what you pay for,  
the facilities are excellent and there is Civil War history right  
there in the park, and even more close by downtown.

There is also camping in Luray caverns just south of there on I-81, I  
think SteelersBus camped there last year on his way to EveryBus 2005.


Happy trails,
