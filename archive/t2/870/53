Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum advance problem

Jack,

Are your vacuum lines connected to the correct ports on the carb? The
advance line should be coming off the left side of the carb (it is
ported above the throttle plate). I don't have retard on my carb but
I'm pretty sure that would be connected to a vacuum line on the rear
of the carb (rear is rear).

Also, how are you timing it?

Hope this helps.

peace
