Subject: zeBed

I have some camper interior that came with the 68 I recently
purchased. I want to reinstall it but it is all in pieces. I have two
questions, that may certainly lead to more. . .

1. Is there somewhere I can look to see how this stuff goes back in or
is it going to be trial and error for me?

2. The ply-wood that (I assume) is the base for the zBed is all moldy
and I would like to have a frame welded out of aluminum tubing as a
new support as it won't promote more rust and it won't mold, How
should go about finding accurate dimensions and options?

Any thoughts or ideas would be appreciated.
