come on John get real who's the thief 
as far as that judges decision you keep whining about why don't you stop  
lying abut it and tell everyone that the court in Salt lake city had any  
jurisdiction and you wouldn't come here. you just wanted to whine and have  everyone 
feel sorry for your whiny azz.
 
And Yes I have been owner and operator of Vintage Werks restorations for  the 
last 7 yrs and never had any criminal charges against me or my business. 
I also have hundreds of very satisfied customers and getting new ones  
everyday. I also drive nothing  but aircooled VW's. 
 
As long as you keep telling lies about me I will post how you are tring to  
rip off the VW community by over pricing your parts.
