An entertaining trip, thanks. You're right about the stopover, the 
movie lost 'something' after dark.
I'm not sure where EveryBus was but spring had arrived wherever that 
was and on the trip north there were places you could spring hadn't 
made it that far yet.
The other thing I noticed was that you were in a VW bus, everyone was 
passing you <g>.
Thanks for thinking of us, I enjoyed the daylight part.
