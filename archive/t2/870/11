well I  don't use "old" gas in the bus, but use it instead in my generator
or other  gas appliances that aren't quite as picky as the bus, or maybe I

thousand  dollar bus if I screw up,  I also usually dilute it with fresh
gas  mixing maybe one part old with 3 or 4 parts new  gas.

Hey Guys  I use all of the old gas around here in my old 63 single cab  work 
truck, normmally dilute it some with good gas. That damn thing will run on  
anything. It hasn't seen a gas station in 5 years :)  Later  Mark D
