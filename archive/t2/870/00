Subject: Poking around behind the Dash

OK. Sorry to bother you guys with this, but...

I took a glass lens off an extra dash to replace the missing one in
the dash of my '79.  the round glass lensis the one that goes where
the clock would be if I had one.

I had lie down between the stickshift and the gas pedal to reach under
and behind the dash take the top and bottom 5mm screws to get the back
of the metal cover off.

This went well and the new glass looks good.  By the way, as I had the
cover off, I thought it would be cool to paint a VW logo or Buses by
the Beach logo on there since it's blank.  Anybody ever do this?

Now, the flashers won't flash and the turn signals have no blink.
Headlights work.  They were working fine before.  I checked all fuses
and even started the bus up.  The flashers make a "clunk" sound but
won't flash.

Did I knock off a plug or pull a wire somewhere back there?

Thanks for any info.
