Yawn.

Likely Bus Depot bought them at a lower price then we did, they regularly buy
huge quantities and pass it on to consumers. We are also not MAKING anyone buy
them from us, are we? That must explain why we only sell a few sets a year,
LOL. I had not figured this out already, thank you LMAO.

This is a BIG DIFFERENCE then stealing someone's car or parts from them!
