Are your vacuum lines connected to the correct ports on the carb?

Jules: Excellent point. I just double checked and I believe they are 
connected correctly.

But you have given me an idea.  I have not measured the vacuum at the 
carb ports. I have two mityvacs. Tomorrow, I'll connect these to the 
ports and watch the vacuum reading as I open and close the throttle 
plate.
Thanks, Jack
