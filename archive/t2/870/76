Alright, I've decided to do it.  I'm going to make a stool repro  out of MDF and turn it into a subwoofer box.  At one time or other  I had a blow up that showed the dimensions of the original stool.   Of course I can't find the link now.  Anybody recall where it can  be found?  It's not on Type2.com anywhere that I can find. I need  the dimensions for the taller '76 stool.  Thanks...KR
