When using the SVDA Distributor, use the port on the LEFT side of the
carburetor for an accurate vacuum signal.  The port that is on the base of
the carb at an angle is for the EGR Valve activation hose for 772-74 Bugs
equipped with an EGR Valve.  It is a very poor source for vacuum for the
SVDA. This and others are to be plugged and not used.
