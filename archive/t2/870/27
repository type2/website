and if there is a train lover in your midst.

Brunswick MD is a "Railroad" town.  the main line of the CSX railroad has
a crew change there, there is Amtrak passenger service (it stops in
Harpers Ferry) and the MARC commuter railroad has a major base and
maintenence facility there. a weekday between 5-7PM is a parade of trains
one right after the other as the straphangers from DC make their way home.
 the Capitol Limited comes thru at 4:50PM West Bound with a long train of
Amtraks finest.  East bound is scheduled at about 10:30 AM not as reliable
time wise. the evening train is almost always on time and blasts thru at
about 80MPH (ok track speed is 79MPH)

and Brunswick is an antiquer's paradise.
