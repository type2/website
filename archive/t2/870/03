Subject: Re: [T2] Westy pop-top color ?

Hi Lee,

The original color of the westfalia pop-top was unpainted fibreglass.

I painted the poptop on the westfakia back in the spring of 2001. I  
cleaned it with "VIM" cleaner and scotch-brite pads and it looked  
excellent, but since I had already purchased a quart of interlux  
premium yacht enamel I decided to use it. Five years later it is  
still gleaming white and shiny. It's expensive, but it applies very  
well with a brush and roller and the end product is worth the  
expense. From a cheap-(-at-)$$ like me, that's saying something.

Happy trails,
