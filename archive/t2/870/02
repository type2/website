Run the tank down to about 2 gallons.  Pull the big nut out of the
bottom of the tank and gently pull the filter screen out, letting gas
drain into bucket.  Plug hole with rubber stopper.

A good filter for the gas would be a plain old cotten T-shirt.  Stretch it
over a bucket and pour the gas through.  Allow the gas to settle as well,
to let particles go to the bottom of the bucket.

Pour gas into tank, rock bus back and forth to agitate the gas in the
tank.  Put bucket underneath and pull rubber stopper.  Continue rocking
bus while fuel drains.

Repeat process until fuel comes out clean.  Clean screen and replace
screen and big nut.

Now, I know it pains you do do it, but use the "cleaning gas" for
something else, like washing parts or lighting the barbeque.  After all
that work, you don't want to recontaminate the tank. Put fresh gas in the
tank.
