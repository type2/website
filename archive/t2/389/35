Subject: Installing Nose Bra on 72

Hi Folks,

Just got my annual spring order of goodies for our 72 (California
Imports).  This year I decided to treat Norman to a bra and a new poptop
canvas.

I tried fitting the bra on tonight and I am not sure what holds it on.
Is it those material covered metal tabs?  Do I just bend them around the
front edge of bus between the body and the door?

I realize this may not make a lot of sense unless you actually have the
bra I am talking about but any help would be appreciated.  I do not want
to loose my new purchase on the next 50 mile per hour run.

Cheers,

Craig
