Subject: friday...shop insurance

Folks, 
I live in an area with great potential for tornado damage.  

My problem is that I have found out that my homeowners insurance
will only cover $2500 worth of "tools/equipment" in my separate
shop building.

I am having a hard time finding insurance to cover such a situation
where I am not using my tools for a "commercial" gain, but only for
hobby type use.

Apparently, most homeowner insurance will cover a minimum amount
of tools, even in your attached garage...think about it, I suspect that a 
lot of us with (even minimal tools) have a lot invested, and folks who 
actually have a small welder and drill press along with other 
"necessities" of restoring cars would have more.

Anyone got a solution to this problem?

Cheers, dave
