Your oil is too light. Change your filter and go to something like 5W50,
15W40, 15W50, a little heavier grade of multigrade, either in dino or synth,
your choice. 10W40 is not recommended, it suffers from too much viscosity
breakdown(I read this on a lubrication website). 10W30 is too light except
in winter.

<Hey guys,

Quick question... I've started driving the Bus a little bit more now
that I've gotten it in driveable condition. One of the things that I was
curious about was.. every time I start the Bus where it's been sitting for
more then 2-3 days, I hear the lifters (I believe) rattle for a couple of
seconds. It lasts maybe... what, 3.. MAYBE 4 seconds. But it's still there.
