The 009 is mechanical only so it relies on engine speed to advance the
timing. The best method to time a 009 is by making sure your total
advance is in the 28-32 degree range. That will help you keep from
cooking your engine. Trying to set it from a static point will not
always tell you what this max advance is. For instance what if someone
has gone in & monkeyed w/ the distributor and the advance is much
greater than a stock one suddently you set it at 7.5 degrees & it
advances to over 40 degrees. That much advance really can't be good
for a VW engine.

But I will say this. since a 009 is mechanical only & doesn't rely on
vacuum signal it can be static timed if the real total advance is
known. But like I said 009s are supposed to be timed at total advance.

could be, or perhaps it's the electrical/mechanical system actually
going 400 rpm that is causing the difference.

no. a timing light is always the proper way to time an engine. it
tells you exactly what the engine is doing in it's running state.

I believe so.

timing light.

look here for timing a 009.
