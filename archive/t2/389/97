Quick Answer- Split the case ( Type 1 ).
The base is a tight tapered fit and may require a hammer.

Unsubstantiated theory- Make a puller with a coathanger.
Hook one end to pull, and wrap a washer with the other
end to trap a piece of tubing as a slide-hammer.
Let the chips fall where they may :)
Get a new lab-coat like those guys in the Bentley :)
