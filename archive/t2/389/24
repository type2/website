Folks,

I used to use a pencil, but switched because the fuel will melt the paint 
on it and sometimes the fuel will literally flow thru the wood.

Pencils are made by gluing together two halves and I don't think the glue 
is fuel resistant.  I would sure hate to have to quit and leave the pencil
in there overnight and find 10 gallons of fuel on the floor in the 
morning...

I much prefer the vise grips or metal plug method.  An old valve stem
ground down to a point makes a perfect size for non fi hose....and maybe 
fi also since the stems are around 8mm I think.

Just a safety thought, dave
