Subject: Re: [T2] WHat works well as fuel line plug?

anyone
had some novel solution for plugging fuel lines?

I use needle nose vise grips. Never use those cheap fake wood pencil. They are
made from some sort of rubber that the fuel cause to turn to a gummy mess. I
had to replace the line because i couldn't dig it all out.
