Subject: Re: [VB] power converter sources.

I've had some responces so far, but I didn't do a good job of
explaining what I was looking for. The power converter i'm looking for
isn't the inverter type (i.e. 12 volts to 120 volts) but the battery
charger style (also called a rectafier). So that I can keep my battery
topped up as well as run assorted 12volt stuff while camping if I
actually had a land line. Sorry for the confusion.
