Subject: Re: [T2] 12vDC vs 120v AC for a fridge (was power converter

Okay Bro,

Your Wal-Mart fridge runs on 120v AC (what you have in a house). A Westy
fridge is either 12v DC or propane. You can turn 12v DC into 120v AC using
an Inverter (not to be
confused with a Converter, which just changes the voltage of DC current),
but there is some loss of efficiency. Also, you would require a larger
capacity, and higher quality (modified or true sine-wave) inverter than the
ones you have seen at Wal-Mart (square-wave), and a very large battery bank
(read heavy, large, expensive) to handle the load. To keep this battery bank
full you would need either a Generator, or to spend most of a 24 hour period
with your engine running. All in all, not a good solution, unless you intend
to be plugged in with a long extension cord.

If you must have a reefer, (It is Friday;) look for a 12v DC marine or RV
fridge, and redesign your charging and battery system. I don't have any
experience with the propane units, so hopefully someone else will chime in.

There is lots of info available on basic electrics online or in your local
library, or p mail me if you have any specific questions. One place to find
some very accessible info to get you started thinking in 12v is
www.westmarine.com . (They are the ... Depot of the boating world.) Click on
"West Advisors", scroll down to "Electrics", and substitute the word "bus"
for "boat".

Cheers,
Matthew
Living luxuriously on 12v.

What is the difference in the fridge that comes in the vw than that of the
college dorm fridges?
