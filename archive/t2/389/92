 Um... I thought that the reference was to one of those $70.00, 12V fridges
 that comes with an AC adapter?

"What is the difference in the fridge that comes in the vw than that of the
college dorm fridges?
besides that the plugs for a power source are diffrent?
i seen a cool little fridge in wal mart that would fit rigbt in the bus that
i could build my own cabinet round but how do i power it and keep the
battery charged if i it is to be powered byt the battery."

I took this to mean that Cha had seen a dorm-style fridge at Wal-mart. If
the question was about a Powered-Cooler style 12v unit, much of the same
applies.
You will still require increased charging capability and battery bank size.
In round numbers: A cooler drawing 4.5amps at 12v DC will kill your 100A/H
starting battery in about 9 hours (100 A/H divided by 2 to get usable
capacity divided by 4.5A minus a bit for efficiency loss).

These coolers (in my experience) chill enough to keep beer cold, but are not
really capable of keeping meat or dairy at a safe temperature.

That being said, if you want cold drinks while you are driving they are
great!

Enjoying a cold drink (but not driving) as we speak.
