I though this was a bunch of baloney when I read it, but decided to
look into it before flapping my e-mouth. :) The source I found [0]
seems to indicated that the problem w/ the 10w-40 is the viscosity
spread (of 30 points). To create such a wide range of viscosity this
oil must have lots of polymers added to it, which according to that
site is bad. Makes sense also.


In my late izusu trooper I found some warranty information (circa 1989)
that said that the motor warranty was invalid if 10-40 wait motor oil was
used. I never knew why, now I do.

I'm not sure about the problem being the viscosity spread. I have used
20-50 in a bus (in the desert with daily temps over 100 deg) without
problems (ok thats anecdotal, but its all I have got.) and commercial
diesels use 15-40 wt. If it is simply the spread, why is 30=bad and 25=good?

BTW I run castrol straight 30wt in my busses, and warm it up on cold days,
and back off on the gas on steep hills on hot days I also realize that I
live in the land of mild climbs ( i have lived in Vermont, so I know of my
good fortune in the winter). My last bus had an oil temp gauge (definitely
a must when I have the cash for the new one). and I could keep the engine
running between 190 and 200, which I was told were good temps. Now my
current bus (75 1.8 formerly fuel infected) has a sticker saying oil temps
should be between 110-158? Is this a emissions thing or what? I thought oil
had to hit a certain temp to shed water? I also remember starting my car up
on hot days in So Cal and the temp gauge would read 110 before I turned the
motor over!
