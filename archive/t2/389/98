Subject: parcel tray found - rehab help request

holy honeycomb batlist, i found an oem parcel tray in a crusher-destined
carcass this week. i'm encouraged to save the tray, but  wonder about the
material replacement; it has a 3 x 4 hole. anyone found material that
replicates the old honeycomb fabric?   thanks,  - steve
