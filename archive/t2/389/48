Subject: RE: [T2] Engine Rattles??

Yeah, I'm on a trip, so I'm stuck in the hotel room watching Speed Vision,
and I noticed on "My Classic Car", Jay Leno and Phineas Gage were cruising
around an a car called a 1915 Hispanic Suazo or something. It had an
electric oil pump that primed the system before they started it. It
basically went in-line with the mechanical oil pump and functioned until the
car started.

Not to worry onthe rattle, as long as it goes away in
a resonable amount of time, you must have some lifters
that are bleeding down after shutdown. Never seen a
electric oil pump. Phil
