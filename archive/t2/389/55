Do be careful with running multi-visc oils in your aircooled engine.
The multivisc oils are created by adding polymers to the oil to give
it it's properties. These polymers have a top temperature which after
that point they will break down & what gave that 10weight oil the
properties of a 30 weight at 100 degrees is damaged, so the oil will
behave more like straight 10 weight. I should mention that this
applies only to dino oil. the synthetics are created completely
differently.

I like synth but many people will tell you all the reasons to run dino
as well :)

I though this was a bunch of baloney when I read it, but decided to
look into it before flapping my e-mouth. :) The source I found [0]
seems to indicated that the problem w/ the 10w-40 is the viscosity
spread (of 30 points). To create such a wide range of viscosity this
oil must have lots of polymers added to it, which according to that
site is bad. Makes sence also.

> 10W30 is too light except in winter.

I agree. but then again my 79 has a wooooorn out motor. I usually ran
around w/ 40wt before I fixed my leaks & went to synth.
