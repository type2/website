The older push rods were solid Aluminum. In 78 they changed to 1-piece Steel
rods with the center lubrication passage.

I think you found an error in the Bentley. On Engine And Clutch p31 it
probably should say:

17. Pushrod - solid through 1977, tubular steel from 1978 (8)

You have the right ones; they feel heavy.
