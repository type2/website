Dunno why you bother with mixing 10W-40 and 10W-30. That means you've got 
something like 10W-35 in there. Just run 10W-40 and be happy.

That rattle means the lifters have leaked down. Be happy it is only a few 
seconds! <grin> It is related to the fact that our engines are horizontally 
opposed engines. Oil leaks out of the lifters.
