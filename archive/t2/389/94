Hey all,

I have been planning to go to the bugorama campout tomorrow for some 
time now. Unfortunately something has come up and my wife has to leave 
town for the weekend, so she will not be able to watch the dog. I am 
trying to find a friend to do it, but if I can't, then I will have to 
either not go to the campout or bring the dog with me. Anybody know what 
the dog policy is at Bugorama?

Thanks,
- -Nick
