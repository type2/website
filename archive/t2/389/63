Subject: Re: [T2] Rear bearing maintenance??

Richard- I'm interested in greasing my rear wheel bearings too. Problem I
see with drilling and tapping in a grease nipple is, you're introducing
filings into the hub, which will find their way into the bearings. What
about my idea of removing the bearing retainer on the backing plate, and
installing a grease nipple on it? At least this part can be easily removed
and cleaned up after.

The grease would be forced throughout the hub, and presumably leak out on
the other side, at the seal. Could the grease get out, or would it blow the
seal do you think?  You mentionned bleed points, so you've looked into this
idea further than I have. I do really want to grease those bearings, without
disassembling them or ruining them, what's your best guess?

George Lyle said that having a hub full of grease will run hotter. Balance
this against having fresh grease to replace the rusty old crud that's been
deteriorating for 33 years.

So who here regularly re-packs their rear wheel bearings?
How silly would it be to add a breather and drain plug and run a heavy gear
oil in there?
I was planning to install a grease nipple into the hub and two 'bleed'
points between the bearings and the seals so I could add some grease each
service, but adding the bleed points in the right spot is proving difficult.
Any better suggestions?
