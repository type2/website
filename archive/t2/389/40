If you're *not* talking about the distributor drive gear that fits on to the
crankshaft but are, instead, talking about the distributor drive shaft that
slides in to the case, then I've pulled these by using a dowel, slightly
larger than the hole in the center of the shaft.  Whittle a slight, blunt
"point" on one end and jamb this tightly into the center hole.  You can then
pull out the dowel/shaft with a slight twist.
