Subject: Mechanical Fuel Pump Studs

Hello fellow typeII list members:
I have a type 4 case with an opening for a mechanical fuel pump. I have
purchased a block-off plate from BD and a set of cardboard gaskets. My
question is what sized studs to use to secure the block-off plate to the
case? The holes are approx. 8mm in diameter. I could guess at the length and
the diameter but am clueless about the thread pitch.

Also, the block off plate itself has an approximately 10 mm diameter,
threaded flange in the center. What is this for?
