richard,

solid lift type IV motors have aluminum pushrods, but they are not solid.
they are tubular, albeit a heavy wall tube. they have hardened steel tips.

if you know what a 1600 DP pushrod looks like, then the solid lift type IV
pushrod looks similar only much beefier.

the "solid" pushrods are the hydraulic lifter ones, but they are still a
tube. the solid moniker comes from the fact that they are made from one
piece of material - steel - not the three-piece affair found on a solid lift
motor.
