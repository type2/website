Chris,

So ok, now i know what the faraday effect is.

Question...what would keep you from "painting" some powder 
down in the crevice with a brush either before or after you 
powder coated?

I have some powder, but haven't had to try that yet, cause I haven't
done any wheels yet...but soon...

I *did* do the fan belt/timing ring off of my fan and it worked out great.
Did the fan too!(in clear)


Cheers, dave
