Scott,

So, if I understand correctly how this works, it holds oil under pressure
and if the external oil pressure drops below a certain threshold, it
opens a valve(of some sort) to the oil galleries and provides oil under 
pressure until the stock pump picks back up again.

It might actually be cheaper in the long run(on t1 engines) than an
oversize oil sump....interesting....what about the extra oil that it would 
hold though...especially when doing an oil change....I guess you would 
manually release the pressure and then add oil again after initial 
startup.

Hmmm....gotta think about this one....wonder if it is better than the
dry sump type system that porsche uses?

Scott, I don't think it would keep the galleries pressurized after the 
engine was shut off though....just pressurize them on pre start up(with 
the electric valve)....hmmm what about cold weather starts???and the oil 
cooler....would you plumb it before or after the cooler some way?  or 
would the relief valves protect the oil cooler....lots of 
questions...requires more thought!

Cheers, dave
