Hello, folks!

I was just shocked to discover two ads in the local Metropolitan
Spirit, and I thought I'd share:

1977 VW Bus, 35K original miles, new am/fm/cd, great condition,
could be your groovy ride, $3500, 706-737-0842
1982 VW Vanagon Westfalia Camper, sink, stove, refrigerator, CD,
sleeps 4, everything rebuilt, $3995, 706-733-7613

Now you know as much as I do.
