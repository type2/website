beautiful cars, absolute works of art. "hispano suiza", by the way.

i wonder if anyone has ever tried an accusump on a type IV with hydro
lifters?

http://www.accusump.com/

this is not an electric device, it an oil accumulator chamber which holds
oil pressure. it is plumbed into the oil system and keeps the galleries
pressurized for some time, days even. i wonder if it would prevent lifter
bleed-down?
