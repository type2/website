Subject: Re: [T2] Dynamic vs. Static Timing Adjustment

Matthew,

The static timing method is just to get close enough to start
the bus and then adjust per the specs with a timing light.

009 with a t4 engine is a bad idea...much more power and better 
mileage with the correct dist.




Cheers, dave
