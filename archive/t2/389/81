Subject: Re: [T2] power converter sources.

I seen some good converters at walmart for like cigarette lighters and then you could plug fridge or tv what notss? in there.

i also have a question for you now since you are thinking about the power of things.

What is the difference in the fridge that comes in the vw than that of the college dorm fridges?
besides that the plugs for a power source are diffrent?
i seen a cool little fridge in wal mart that would fit rigbt in the bus that i could build my own cabinet round but how do i power it and keep the battery charged if i it is to be powered byt the battery.

can i somehow run it into the alternator or something so it will keep the battery charged and will it kill the battery if indeed it happens to be the source of energy?

hope havent confused anyone?
