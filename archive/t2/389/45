Subject: Engine Rattles??

Hey guys,

	Quick question... I've started driving the Bus a little bit more now
that I've gotten it in driveable condition. One of the things that I was
curious about was.. every time I start the Bus where it's been sitting for
more then 2-3 days, I hear the lifters (I believe) rattle for a couple of
seconds. It lasts maybe... what, 3.. MAYBE 4 seconds. But it's still there.
I don't hear that on any of my other cars. The motor in question is a 1.8
with the hydraulic lifter conversion. I am currently using a mix of 10W-30,
and 10W-40 Castrol Synthetic.  Is this a good combination? The motor runs
very smooth, and I never see the oil light come on when the motor is
running. 

I have not yet replaced the filter... I plan on doing it this weekend, but I
was just curious if it could be because of the filter.. maybe causing
drain-back or something?

Has anyone installed an electric oil pump on their car?
