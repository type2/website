Subject: Dynamic vs. Static Timing Adjustment

Howdy-

A buddy of mine told me that the best way adjust timing on a Volks is to do a
static timing adjustment, because the dist is already advancing even at idle
speed, so I gave it a try.

I rotated the engine to TDC on #1, then rotated the pulley until the timing
mark lined up with  7.5deg BTDC on my scale. I then rotated the dist until I
got 12v between the neg side of the coil, and ground.

When I check this dynamically with the timing light, it reads about 9 deg
BTDC. (Presumably because the dist is advancing 1.5 deg at idle.)

Question 1: Is my buddy right?
Question 2: Did I do my static adjustment correctly?
Question 3: Which method is more accurate?
Question 4: Is the 7.5deg BTDC (on my 009) adjustment point for dynamic or
static timing technique?

Thanks!

Cheers,

Matthew
