 First, get the engine on TDC on cylinder 1, as per your timing mark and
rotor direction.  After pulling the dizzy, reach in and get the coil spring
out of the drive with your strong magnet. (the spring is there, right?)
 The drive can be pulled by forcing a pencil into the hole, and turning the
engine backwards and forwards to take up the lash, while pulling up with a
twisting motion. Under it are usually 2 shims
(I think and somebody correct this if wrong) On your life, don't drop them
into the bottom end!!!!!!!!!  Carefully get your magnet in there and get em.
When you reinstall the correct shims, first put a pencil down in the hole.
Now, slide the shims down the pencil till they seat on the shoulder where
they live. Then you install the drive as per Bentley- it must be in the
right spot or your timing will be off.
