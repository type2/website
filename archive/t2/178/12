In the type 2 library:

I'm sure someone knows exactly what this is.  From my own experience, my
door had not been opened for several years.  At first it was very stiff and
the handle had to go all the way down because the door didn't want to
"spring" open on it's own which it should do.  I lubricated it and worked it
and now it's back to normal.
