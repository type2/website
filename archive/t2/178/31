Subject: Bus in the 4th of July parade

I am going to have my Bus pulling a float (farm wagon that can be
pulled by one person so isn't to heavy) in a parade and was wondering
if the List could give me some advice (besides not to do it) on
keeping my engine cool.  Of course it will be hot that day and I will
be going at idle speed.  There will be a generator to operate
something else so was thinking about having a fan blow through the
hatch on top.  My Bus is a 74.  I do have a oil temp guage and an
external oil cooler.  It would to very hard to have a fan blowing on
the cooler.  
Thanks for any advice you can give me.
