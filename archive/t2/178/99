Hang in there, Matty !!!
LOTS of people are only one paycheck away from homeless.
As for your question, valves too tight will not allow a sealed
combustion chamber, causing poor compression ( burnt valves ).
Loose is a little less power and far safer.
Think of the boundaries of the combustion chamber.
You have a cylinder sealed with the rings at one end
and the head / valves at the other.
Many factors contribute to the loss of compression-
Keeping oil clean and the air filter system intact,
not overheating or stressing the parts at their limit
to name a few.
Scratches in the cylinder, large ring gaps, worn ring lands,
low torque on head , case /  head studs not secure,
valve seat imperfections, worn guides and valves, cracks,
carbon build-up on valve stems and seats, warped heads,
worn pistons,all contribute to loss of comprression.
So there is is- Empathy. and Entropy.
