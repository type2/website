Subject: Re: [T2] alignment done, problems still

> I went to an alignment shop after replacing my tie-rods.  I new the adjustment would be off because the old ones were off and I simply counted out the threads on the old adjustable tie-rod in order to help set the new one.

Richard
the steering wheel centers using the adjustments in the drag link. I
wouldnt trust the shop to do the torsion bars if they dont know this as
they really dont know busses very well.>
