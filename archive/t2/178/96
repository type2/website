Subject: sliding door lock problem

Speaking of sliding doors, I am unable to lock or unlock mine from the
inside, though I can open it from the inside or out, and i can lock it from
the outside. The little thumb lock on the inside seems frozen, won't move at
all. This is for a 71 westy. Anybody know if this is repairable, if so how?
I took it apart right after I got the bus 2 years ago, couldn't figure it
out, and haven't looked at it since, so I don't remember what it all looked
like. Any suggestions?
Wink
