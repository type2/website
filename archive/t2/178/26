Subject: Brake booster

>>When I press the brakes, the brake booster seems to pull the engine idle 
>>down
quite a bit.  Does this mean the shoes aren't close enough to the drum?

>Does the idle stay down as long as you hold the pedal down?  That would
indicate a leak in the booster diaphragm.

If the idle increases while the pedal is down.......what does that indicate?

Thanks
Best wishes
