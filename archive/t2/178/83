Two thing I know of cause this, both related to wear. No.1, the backing 
plates have several little bulges that the iron of the shoes rest on. Those 
bumps wear and the shoes can hang up on them when you apply the e-brake. 
No. 2 is wear of the drums. If the drums are too worn, the shoes will wear 
unevenly and will lock up. Measure the drums. If worn to or beyond spec, 
replace them. If the bumps on the backing plate ore worn, replace the 
backing plates.

Old and rusty e-brake cables might also cause this, and also check that the 
e-brake springs at the ends of the cables aren't broken. Pulling the drums 
and inspecting everything should reveal the source of the problem.
