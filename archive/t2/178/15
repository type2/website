Hi all,

I am going to install a 96 plate mesa oil cooler and electric cooling =
fan on my 79 camper bus.

It comes as THE ULTIMATE OIL COOLER SYSTEM KIT from California Imports:=20

li&Product_Code=3DACC-C10-5520&Category_Code=3D02-06-01-02

The guy at California Imports said most people install the cooler above =
the transmission.

If anyone has done this before, please email me with any tips, =
step-by-step instructions, pictures and/or links on how to do this.



Thanks,

Charley S.
