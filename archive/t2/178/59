I received similar advice from the list earlier this summer and it has
worked out VERY well.  I bought one of these helmets

It was on sale at the time so look around.  I was pleased with the brand
and model.  Truly a revolution especially for a beginner.  I taught one of
my young buddies to (satisfactorily) weld in no time. 

I also bought a flame proof shirt and some gloves. Better than having lots
of tiny holes in your work clothing and the gloves were very comfortable
and inexpensive.

We have Lincoln 175 without the gas and it worked fine albeit with a great
deal more splatter than with gas. A light coat of PAM (or for the
connoisseurs, extra virgin olive oil ;) )on the nozzle helps to keep the
wire feeding and the tip in good shape. Keeps the splatter from sticking.

I do recommend starting with the manuf suggested speed and current
settings before experimenting.

pick up a small MIG welding set up (I like the Lincoln Weld Pac 100 for
beginning) get the MIG adapter and a tank of Argon/CO2 gas.  also I think
the best thing I have bought was one of those outragously expensive auto
darkening helmets

then get some scrap materiel and practice, practice...
