>The wheel cylinder piston has a wire ring going around an outer groove

>This wire ring has a "gap" in it, since it cannot be a continuous wire.
>It is "snapped" into place on the piston when assembly occurs.

>This wire ring "gap" had managed to route itself to where it was "open" in

>Conclusion note:
>The wire ring on the wheel cylinder piston must be oriented so that is

>The wire ring must be oriented so as to place it's "gap" off to the side
