Subject: Re: [T2] New Westy Owner - Sliding Door Question

Caldwell et.al.,
  
  I too have a '78 Westy whose sliding door is a PITA.  One thing I
found that helped, was to replace the plastic guide that is part of the
rear of the sliding door.  Check this piece and replace it if need be. 
Also, a general cleaning, lubing and examination of the tracks will
help.  If you're interested in how to remove the door, let me know and
I'll send more detailed directions.
  On another note, further examination of my sliding door revealed this
problem.  The guide track on the lowest part of the door has been
damaged.  Possibly from a side collision or just plain worn out.  I'm
working on my auto body skills and plan to beat it straight again when
I get confident.  Get a flashlight out and check all of your tracks...
