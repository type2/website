Subject: VW BUS HEAVEN BURNT TO THE GROUND
 =20
I regret to inform you of a great loss.  VW BUS HEAVEN in Pembroke, Massa=
chusetts
May 5th 2:00 am a suspected electrical fire started and burned the entire=
 building and its MANY NOS parts, vehicles, tools etc. to ashes within a =
half hour.
 =20
If anyone knows Bill and Dottie you would know that they are great people=
 with many stories and vast knowledge of Volkswagens, especially type 2s
 =20
This is a horrible loss, even if they had insurance, the majority of the =
parts were irreplaceable.
 =20
I would like to help them by informing you guys of the loss, and any tool=
s or parts I'm sure would greatly be appreciated, or even a letter of sim=
pathy.
 =20
With help from fellow VW enthusiasts, I think that it would make this a l=
ittle bit easier for everyone.
 =20
I have pictures of how little was left behind, It won't let me attach the=
m to the text, but I can try to get them to you if you are interested.

 thank you for reading, and if you are interested in donating anything to=
 the cause, I could get you in touch with Bill.

Regards
