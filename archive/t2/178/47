Subject: wife and I trip -- luggage rack

I just want to thank all of you for your great ideas and information -- and 
for being willing to let my and wife and I hang out with you some time this 
summer

Does anyone have any good ideas about what the best way to utilize the 
luggage rack on top of my 74 westy??? I am taking a several month trip this 
summer -- if you did not read my last email...

any good ideas for cheap bike racks??

Thanks.

TJ and Julie...
