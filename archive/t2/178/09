More than the cost of a welder.
Do you realize that you will need other things welded in the future ?

 No time like the present.
Welding is a skill , expect a learning curve.
 Visit local welding suppliers and get a hands-on demonstration.
 Check out local ***"adXlt"*** ed classes in welding and autobody repair.
 The three areas listed each have different specific problems:
 1) Jack supports must be Strong. Start here.
 2) Sliding Door Track must be fitted Exactly. Tack and measure.
 3) Rocker panels are Thin, must be Smooth and Finished.
My most favorite complementary tool is a 4" disc grinder.
( And welding gloves. ) Amaze yourself with joining metal.
