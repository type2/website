Find out.

Just this morning a friend was telling me that our local college has a
welding course (6 Saturdays for $115).  You need to buy about $50-60 in
additional "school supplies". It depends on the college, but the one here
has MIG, TIG, plasma cutters for steel, aluminum, stainless, etc and let's
you sign up and start work on your own projects right away.  There is even a
dock to let you drive your car up to so you can work on it.

Even if you don't get any work done on your car, you'll at least find out
what's involved in going down the DIY path and you will make some contacts.
