Subject: Re: [T2] alignment done, problems still

>>First question: can I take off the steering wheel,
 re-align it horizontally and re-seat it?<<

yes, but if your other side tie rods are shot you can also just
put an adjustable one on that side. (but since you have already
paid for alignment in this case i would say just wait until 
next time)

>>Anyway, we went through the Bentley and the procedure
 was to reset the rear torsion bars which they do at their shop.
 What should I do?<<

its really your call. i like the tree the guys at the shop
were barking up. check the tires & if no funny wear then you
are probably fine.

hope that helps,
