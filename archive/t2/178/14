You didn't list that you saw good spark.

Chuck, Karl, Dave and others,

No I didn't and I never checked, because after recruiting bug-drivin' buddy to push bus home, it started right up like usual.

Maybe I retightened something, or maybe I had a "hot-start" situation, but she's a-goin'. Maybe I should test that spark anyway.

Thanks to those of you who wrote back.

Ever grateful to the list,

Billy
