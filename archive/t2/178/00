17ft Grumman on a 60sunroof, 65Westy, 71 & 78 found the best way to carry
it is to put pipe foam insulation on the Gunwales and pull it tight down
against the roof.  Don't crank it down super tight, just enough to keep it
from getting lost.  
  an aside, I actually get better gas mileage with the canoe up there than
without it....not much about 1/2 MPG but it does exist.

enjoy buses and canoes go together well
