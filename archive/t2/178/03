Subject: Re: [T2] Junk oil filters was Re: [T2] *Long distance drivers

When I am changing oil, I fill the new filter with fresh oil which takes
care of getting oil on the seal and the threads! The filter usually takes
about .5 quart which I deduct from the 3.7 quarts that goes into the
crankcase. This is how I was taught to do it many years ago and I have
always done it since. Supposed to be better for the engine when you start up
after the oil change. Any opinions?
