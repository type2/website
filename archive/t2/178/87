Thanks.  Too bad I un-rented the puller last night.  The drag link looked ok
so I didn't bother to replace it along with the tie-rods.  The skirt
underneath kept it in better condition.

I wrote them down because they said it was too late for a printout (another
minus from the visit).  One was -2.2 (-2 degrees 12 min) and the other -1.8
(-1 degrees 48 min).

How bad is this?

They weren't VW experts by any means.  We looked in the Bentley because the
manager was curious.  They had no intention of working on the torsion bars.

It used to look a little saggy when I had 185's on the front and 195's on
the rear.  I measured approximately at the jack points (good enough?):

Right front: 15"
Right rear: 15"
Left front: 14.5"
Left rear: 14.25"

All the cabinet and spare tire are on the left side.  Is the sagging a
little in the rear left only?
