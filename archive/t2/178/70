Subject: Re: VDO vacuum gauge install question

Adam,

I am installing this gauge in my air-cooled vanagon.  The hose that came =
with the kit is not long enough..it was quite sturdy.  would regular =
vacuum line be sufficient to finish the job?

In a word, yes.

I had some spare vacuum line lying around at it STILL wasn't long enough, so 
I put a saddle tee on the metal part of the brake booster line and I use that 
for monitoring manifold vacuum.  It works for me.  It's been there for 
several years and hasn't failed me yet.
