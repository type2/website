Subject: Replaced tie-rods

My tie-rods were badly rusted and I decided to replace them.  I also had a
small alignment problem which I attribute to driving over a concrete divider
with the right wheel a long time ago.

First I wanted to say that getting the ends out proved to be agony.  I
attribute this to the crummy tie-rod puller that I rented from Autozone
(OEM27022).

It was missing the shoulder of the puller in the Bentley picture and it kept
slipping off.  I had to ratchet the puller a click at a time in order to
apply direct pressure to the tie-rod end while keeping it aligned and
eventually it popped out.  Getting the rusted cotter pins out wasn't a
picnic either.  Oh well, watch out for cheap pullers like the one I used.

Anyway, I measured the adjustable tie-rod by the exposed thread count of the
old one but I realize this probably will not give the correct toe-in because
who knows what it was set to before.

What can I use to align the wheels myself?  It's only $59 to get a front
wheel alignment which I'm overdue for but I'd like to know anyway.  The
tools in the Bentley aren't commonly found are they?
