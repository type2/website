Subject: hardcover manual for sale

list:

Parents got me a HARDCOVER euro-spec haynes manual for my birthday. Unfortunately, am under T4 power.

Directed Dad to Busdepot for new Bentley tho!

Anyway, I'm trying to unload this Haynes for pop as he bought it while in Oregon for me.

Brand new 68-79 1600cc HARDCOVER haynes manual.

20.00 US plus shipping anyone?

You guys in Britain are winning on the exchange rate alone here!

Later,

Billy
