Subject: Bus parts for sale in Wisconsin

Hey all,
   Anyone in the Wisconsin area need a middle or rear seat for their bay 
window bus?

    I have several for sale. Choice of 3 different middle seats (all 2/3 
style) and 3 different full width rear bench seats.
    I also have a complete front bench setup from a 71 bench seat bus.  
Includes 1/3 2/3 seat, also the correct trim that goes on the full width 
bulkhead. 

     Also, I have a brand new spare tire from 1975.  This is a steel wheel 
and tire that was never mounted on a bus. Tire is a bias ply with correct 
load rating. Was stored indoors (out of the bus) for most of it's life, not 
dry rotted.   For the resto purist.  

    Email me direct if interested in any of this, for obvious reasons, I 
don't really want to ship this stuff. 

    Thanks for this great list
    Brian
