STAHLWILLE GERMANY OFFSET WRENCH LIKE NEW Item # 2030839543

See the above eeeeBayyyy item. This is the wrench I have been using for 
years for the air cooled valve adjustment nuts. They are a long pattern and 
very nice for overtightened nuts. This style of wrench is made in both a 
13x14 and 13x15 size. Just ideal for the valve adjust application, high 
quality German product at well less than half the cost of Snap On.
