there are a couple places that have these parts and the folks are on the
list here and some give discounts,   check BustedBus, Bus Depot, and a few
others that escape my mind at the moment.

well before heading out to the beach can I suggest a few other things to
do before heading to the beach so you can enjoy the drive

.  change all the fuel lines, they are 24 years old.
.  change the fuel filter
.  change the oil and oil filter
.  check your brakes and brake lines.  
.  give her a tune up.
.  check your tires  (they should be rated with a weight capacity of at
least 1480 lbs) many folks have put under rated tires on the buses 
.  practice driving it, it is slightly different since in effect your
sitting on the front bumper, over the front wheels. it's a heavy vehicle
and it doesn't stop on a dime either.

sounds like you got a good price if the engine is in good shape,  you
rarely have to change all 4 CV joints usually only one goes bad at a
time.  they are a tad pricy.  it is a simple ( but very dirty) do it
yourself job.

first thing get an "official service manual" usually reffered to on the
list here as the "Bentley" since it was written by Robert Bentley co.
