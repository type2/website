Subject: 79 CAMPER BUS 

Hello all , I new to this list but I have some questions . Where can I find
good quality upgrades for my 2.0L type 4 motor ? I'm looking for an external
oil cooler that can mount to the driver side ( I saw one on a 70 bus ) .
Also , my bus has the automatic transmission , I would like to get an
electronic ignition system and a few more horses so it can handle highway
speeds better . I live in Atlanta Ga. There are a few bus people out here .
They wave at me when I drive by , I wave back , I think that's awesome .
