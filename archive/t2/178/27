Richard,

I am afraid the only pullers I trust are expensive because, alas, they are
snap-on.  I do not by and large recommend them becaues they are hideously
overpriced, but in this case, they must have a patent because they are the
only maker.  Search e-bay for "snap on gear puller" and look for the CJ
series.  Right now there is a CJ2002 set which will probably go for
~$250-300 and a CJ85 which will go for ~75-100.  That CJ85 is what you
need tho.  It will do any front-end pull and pop the early steering wheels
off w/o breaking them up.

Alas, another job it's just too cheap to pay someone else to do.  I do
find that I have to stand over them, tho as the shops have not done a bus
in the working lifetime of any of their employees.
