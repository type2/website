Subject: RE: [T2] 1976 - 1600cc Cuts out at idle

Hi Andy,

Just as important as the body to battery ground strap is the engine to body
strap - often this is of the uninsulated plaited variety so is prone to
corrosion. You will find it on the left (I think) side of the vehicle (left
as you sit in the drivers seat) from the gear box to the body.

However if the bus idles fine while stationary but cuts out (sometimes)
while under braking - particularly down hill - then you may have the same
problem as I had on my previous bus namely worm bushings for the throttle
flap in the carb which was causing irregular closing and therefore not
enough mixture to
run the engine at idle - sometimes.

Could be the idle jet is (partially) blocked a dose of fuel treatment for
carb engines along with the next tank of petrol will help to clear it out.

could be that the fuel filter needs changing - or a partially fuel line
blockage. It is possible that the fuel lines are original so its a good idea
to replace them throughout especially as they rot from the inside out and
the rotting can cause blockages.

Good luck

I suspected a grotty earth connection from the battery the body, so I
replaced the lead and cleaned up the connections, and replaced the battery
at the same time..

This seemed to fix the problem and the idle was pretty good, but it still
occasionally cuts out.. any ideas?
I checked the distributor cap, points, coil HT & LT, all seems good, the
plugs are good too.

I am tempted to think its electrical but don't know if this is a 'common'
problem?
