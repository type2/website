Subject: treasure chest door latch modifications

Does anyone know if there's a way to modify the latch on the door to the 
treasure chest on a pickup?  It seems that the factory latch is in the 
default "locked position" and you must use a key to open it.  It would be 
nice to have a simple pushbutton latch that could be locked only when 
needed.  tx, greg
