My interior of my pop top is quite discolored over the years....from =
mold, etc and other stains.  It does not clean up, and i have tried it =
all.

Has anyone either repainted or found some white flocking to spray on the =
interior of the roof? I am replacing the pop top canvas in a few weeks, =
and would sure like to take care of this at the same time.
