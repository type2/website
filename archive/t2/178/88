having driven and worked on my auto tranny for ten years I guess I can

they can be good units, and they do have some advantages

first there are two types of auto tranny and 74 is on the cusp so check to
see what kind you have, the older is the vacuum shift tranny and this will
have a vacuum line from you intake system to a can on the bottom side of
the tranny.  the second newer type is a govenor shift version and it does
not have the vacuum line...the later type with govenor shift is much
better and as the guts of it is the same as the rabbit tranny parts are
somewhat still avaliable.

the good.
. great in city traffic
. next to impossible to lug em or overrev em
. you can put a newer tranny (if you can find one) into the older tranny
spot with very few mods

the bad
. harder to find parts for
. tough but not as tough as the manual

the ugly
. actually lowers the value of the bus
. some folks will turn up thier noses at you

it's been done but it makes the ghia conversion look easy.

personally I like mine and don't mind the little quirks

can you drive it?
any other questions?
