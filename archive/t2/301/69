If they came off of a 1600cc and they are going on a 160cc engine, then I 
expect the jets could stay the same.

Why not gain 2-3 HP and go with dual port heads. Surely you could find a 
set used and cheap.

I always try to move to better parts when I can. Not slamming your choice 
of heads though. I've had a couple SP Beetle engines too.
