Subject: Tank to body seal

At the junkyard one day a few months back I found a piece of foam behind the firewall that seemed to seal the tank to the body so the outside couldn't get in.  I was intrigued by this because when I cleaned my tank out I noticed quite a lot of dust and some rust in a place I thought shouldn't have been spotless:

It seems this seal was used on splits because I found it in a parts catalog...

...but the seal I found was glued to the body on an early bay and appeared factory installed to me.

Does anyone know the story on these?  I'd like to seal up this area in a similar way but I am wondering if there's a good reason not to do it because VW seemed to stop with the practice themselves.
