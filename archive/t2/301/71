Worst case the cross shaft has failed that actuates the throw-out bearing.

Or the pressure plate has failed (unlikely IMHO). Either way out comes the 
engine.

Start with the pedal and cable since they are easiest. Maybe 80% of the 
strands in the clutch cable failed and the remaining 20% stretched?
