My experience also except I originally cancelled my tool order then the new boots came and I discovered that only the original boots had hex head bolts.

I posted this back in Nov. regarding the tool needed for the other type of screw used:

It's a triple square or sometimes called a serrated wrench. Get the right 
tool in case this happens again in the future. 

Visit your VWFLAPS. They either have BugPack Tool #7057 or EMPI #5796.

...or try Pepboys for K-D which for the same price as the socket you'll get 
4 bits (6-8-10-12mm I think) which fit into a 3/8" socket...

Whatever tool you purchase, be sure to clean all dirt and grime from the bolts otherwise the heads will likely strip trying to remove them.
