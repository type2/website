Richard,

I had a "foam" like seal on mine when I took it out.
It was around the two small inlet/outlet pipes at the bottom.

I also had dust in my compartment, but no rust.  I think the idea
is to pretty much try to seal it from things going into the body cavity 
there, but if you get condensation in there, you want the moisture to be
able to get out....your call...kinda like the drain hole below the 
battery.

Cheers, dave
