Mmmm...
It's winter, well for me! so take the time and do the job yourself!
Don't only change the boot, degrease/re-grease and inspect velocity joint.
I did this da*n job 8 times so i now what i am talking about.

It's a nice job (Not), but an easy job. (2 hours per joint, 8hours for a 
nice job)
Buy german/good boot from Ron or other, if one (or more) velocity joint 
is worn, replace with german made velocity joint.
$40 complete axle = scrap and cheap stuff!
Remember to clean the inside of the wheel hub and trany hub, they are 
full of... stuff!

Cheers, Ben
