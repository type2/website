Dear list,
Bus owner in trouble! My son who goes to Towson University, just north of
Baltimore has run out of luck with the '79 I restored for him 4 years ago.
He's had it parked on the street but today, on his last day of finals for his
4 year degree, the bus was towed for lack of current tags and flat tires.

He can't find a place to store it and may have to sell it. It's a great bus
but he has some time constraints to deal with here. He's coming out to Denver
Friday for 3 weeks so has to find a place to store the bus tomorrow
(Thursday). The tags and insurance have expired so he'll have to have it towed
somewhere I guess.

Is there anyone out in that neck of the woods that can give some friendly
advice or assistance. We'd really appreciate a friendly hand here.

Thanks and God bless you,
Joel in Denver
