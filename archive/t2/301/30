Subject: BA6 help, small parts needed!!! - existing owners/users???

Hello,

I took my bus over to the buslab in Berkeley this morning, and Marco, one of 
the owners of this great new shop helped me take a look at all of the BA6 
parts I have and figure out a gameplan on getting this up and installed on 
my 76 westy.

(510-841-6400) - buslab in berkeley. if your in the area, thats where to go. 
nicest guy ive met in ages...

Everything looks great, but I am two parts short. One more important than 
the other...

I need a heater relay. Apparently, when it was shipped to me, this part was 
lost in the process. Its the one that mounts behind the glovebox, not the 
one with the safety switch that mounts over by the dash on the drivers side. 
This is the most important part, as I cannot fabricate it...

The other part is the recurculation motor that mounts to the back end of the 
unit. It came with a baywindow bus blower motor, which the guy I purchased 
this from said the PO was using, and it worked fine, but I don't see how it 
would have worked, and would prefer to do this the right way instead.

If anyone has either of these parts, i'll trade you my left, um, you know, 
or purchase them outright. either or, I just want to get the heater up and 
running so my wife, dog, and I can do some winter camping up at Yosemite 
soon. Also considering the trek with the SV2's up to Mt Shasta in the end of 
Jan.

I have all kinds of parts Id trade for these items...  Fuel sender, westy 
table/leg, vanagon hubcaps, clock, chrome yellow westy curtains, chrome 
yellow westy plaid fabric, deluxe steering wheel, speakers, an amp, 
firstborn child. name it. =)
