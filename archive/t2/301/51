Subject: Hello List, a couple more free things

Hello List,

Well, I have been working on boxing up some of the
free stuff tonight. Some of the itmes still need
cleaning so I won't be shipping any of the tin
tomorrow. As I was going through some things I found a
good used timing scale and a set of new German push
rod tube seals. These are NOT Viton but they are alot
better than the leaky ones that you might have. I
still have a partial set that I am going to keep
incase one of mine becomes cut or starts to leak. I
also have the oil filTer neck available. Let me know
if you need any of those items. Thanks!
