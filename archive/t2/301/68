IF I am not mistaken the BN4 uses a similar fuel pump to the BA4 that I
have....these fuel pumps are metered injection pumps, NOT continous flow
and a regular carb fuel pump is likely to pump far too much fuel possibly
causing a fire.

please check before firing that thing up, don't heat your bus or yourself
into cinders
