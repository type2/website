The original ones were rectangular (see
http://www.vw-bus-museum.de/html/galerie_2.html). The VW switch for
these is an orange one, located next to the one for the rear window
defrost. The switch is a two position one: position one for the rear fog
light, position two for the front fog lights.

Volks,

All this talk about fog lights got me a-thinkin'.

I can only assume VW offered optional fog light assemblies for
our beloved
Loafs... can someone point me to a vendor or an image?  The
ala-WalMart
fog lights that came with my 78 Westy (installed by PO) were not
only
useless, but they were ugly.

I did my trip into E-b*y town, only to find $200 models for
Beetles and
Porsches (though, they were very nice to look at).   All the
aftermarket
ones were gaudy, too.  I'd think something big,  round and
chromed
would look real nice on the front of my Bus,  but I'd like to see
what the
real deal looked like, if there was one.

Cheers!

Hello List,

Well almost all the free stuff that I have so far is
gone. I do have the new German push rod tube seals
left (not viton). I also have the oil Filter arm left.
That is about it. Let me know if you want either of
these 2 items. Have a great day!
