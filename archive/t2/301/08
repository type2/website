Subject: CV Boots

I have to replace the CV Boots on my 72 bus.  Can anyone refer me to a
site that I can order them from.  And thanks for all the help on the
engine problems.   It turned out that the coil was bad.  My coil was
arching and the enging was loosing power.  Thanks again and I hope
everyone has a great holiday season.

Dean
