Subject: driving light wiring...

Hola,

My new Bosch driving lights came in the mail today, and I was checking out 
the wiring setup and ran into a question...

They want you to wire them to the highbeam (+) connection, so they only come 
on when your high beams are on. Can I connect this to something other than 
my highbeam (+) connection so that the toggle switch will always work? Where 
I can just turn them on via the toggle switch whenever I want, headlights on 
or not?
