www.busdepot.com, of course. :-)  New German CV boot kits (including,
grease, bolts & hardware) are $9.95 each.  Make them part of a $50 order,
and then the 5% listmember discount kicks in. Part #  251 598 201

Yes, but those are remanufactured.  Typically you get a used sandblasted
axle shaft, a Taiwanese CV boot, and a rebuilt CV joint with oversized
bearings.  However, we do have brand new units available (albeit at a higher
price), which are much higher quality. Price is $114 each with listmember
discount. This is a complete axle shaft with joint and boot already
installed. Just bolt it on.  Fits '68-79 except auto trans.  Part # 211 501
203.
