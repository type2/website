Subject: Next Christmas (Was ... a couple more free things)

Dave,

You have inspired me and perhaps others on the list as well. I too have a
number of excess parts lying around that would be better served by being
given to someone who could use them.

I'm going to stick a little note on my calendar to remind me right after
Thanksgiving to to start categorizing them and offering them free.

Perhaps this could be part of a new tradition. It seems in keeping with
busma.

Cheers,

John Rogers
