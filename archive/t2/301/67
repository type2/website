Subject: Tank to body seal

Hi, Mines a 75 and when I stripped the firewall out to get to the tank it had 
foams seals along the bottom and down both sides. They were in bad shape and 
so I replaced later. At the time I noted the sizes, the one across the bottom 
was 1.2 cm wide and about 5 mm deep and the ones on each side were 1.2 cm 
wide and 4 mm deep. The sides included the sections that are at an angle at 
the top.There was nothing along the narrow section at the top of the 
firewall. I can't vouch that the seals were original, they looked old and I 
was replacing a sender unit and painting the tank etc so I guess no one had 
been in there for a long time !!
cheers

At the junkyard one day a few months back I found a piece of foam behind the 
firewall that seemed to seal the tank to the body so the outside couldn't get 
in.  I was intrigued by this because when I cleaned my tank out I noticed 
quite a lot of dust and some rust in a place I thought shouldn't have been 
spotless:

It seems this seal was used on splits because I found it in a parts 
catalog...

...but the seal I found was glued to the body on an early bay and appeared 
factory installed to me.

Does anyone know the story on these?  I'd like to seal up this area in a 
similar way but I am wondering if there's a good reason not to do it because 
VW seemed to stop with the practice themselves.
