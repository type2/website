List!,
Thanks a lot to the dozen or so generous folks that responded to my call for
help. Especially to Nick and Chris. Bob at
http://www.type2.com/~airswork/rescue/us/md.html#Maryland was a lifesaver.

The bus is rescued from the man and safely stored away. May have to bring it
back to Denver from Maryland. Two cars may be one too many for a recent
college grad looking for work, especially when it needs the care that a bus
does.

Thanks again,
Joel
