A little U-V would do the trick.  Get yourself a U-V lamp and give those 
spores a tan!

Hi,

Well, its the rainy season here in San Francisco, and im noticing
more and more little mold spots on the inside of my poptop.

Has anyone been able to address this issue on their own? I have the
whole interior out of the bus currently, so taking on a project like
this is definetly an option right now. Sand all of that green fuzz
and mold off of it and paint it or what?
