Subject: Aircooled heater control box question

I figured out part of why my heater did not heat very well. In one of the
heater control boxes there was no gasket if that is what it is called. So no
matter if the lever was on heat or not the heater air was being discharged out
of the box & not channeled into the interior of the van. maybe these pics will
help show what I's talking about.
My question is can I get the rubber gasket the seals off the 2 way the heated
air can flow? Or do I need to buy a new complete heater control box or maybe
find one in a junk yard.
Look here for pics one has the piece & one does not.
