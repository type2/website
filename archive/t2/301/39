If all you need are hinges, we do sell a European made hinge kit designed
for putting a Westfalia style sofabed in your bus, for $95 with listmember
discount (part # 98553).  This creates a full sized bed at the same height
as the rear deck (same as found on a Westy).  Unlike the Z-Bed, which uses
your existing Bus back seat, this $95 kit assumes that you will make your
own sofabed (i.e. use your own wood, foam, and fabric).  While this requires
using your own materials that the Z-Bed kit would not require, it also has
some benefits:  It allows you to choose your own fabric, and results in a
flatter bed (the same as found on a Westy, which is also a wood bed with
foam as with this design).  Also, it's $95, whereas the Z-Bed kit is $280.
So a little time, effort, and basic materials results in a cheaper and
better bed.
