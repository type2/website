I wonder how well that WindeX mildew shower spray
would work? You know, that stuff that you spray in the
shower after each use. I wonder if you could mist the
inside of your pop top with this after you wash the
old mold away? I wonder if this would work for that
pesky mildew that grows on head liners too. Just a
thought. It might stain the material. Who knows. Any
way, good luck!
