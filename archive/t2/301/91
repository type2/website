I've never Christmas'ed up my Bus but won the hearts
of a lot of trick-er-treater's with this quick
Halloween Dress-up:

Note: I don't recommend scotch tape as an affixant.
:-(

At that space ( http://nomad.freezope.org/photos/Bus )
you'll also find a local coffee shop that has
memorialized a bus by putting the body up high in
their shop, and a (currently MIA...darn toddlers) toy
vintage single cab with a (partial) *cement mixer* on
the back.

p.s. Thanks for the Stomp on Your Brakes testing
advice. Before a tow trip to the mechanic I tested the
brakes, found them quite lacking on fluid, added, then
excitedly pressed the brakes feeling the pressure and
*P-SSST*! No pressure, fluid all over rear tire.  Tow
truck time...ouch, front tow hook half torn off!
Flatbed today, but is band-aid welding the current on
an OK fix for this, or do I need to attach a brand new
one in a similar location?

Happy Holidays from Central Wisconsin!
