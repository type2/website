Subject: Clutch just stopped working, Help

Hi all,
The clutch in my 78 Volks just stopped working. The
pedal now goes to the floor with only a little action
actually getting to the clutch. Not enough slippage to
shift gears. I'm guessing its something in the linkage
but its raining and I cant look till the morning. Any
ideas what goes out most frequently on these. Is it
linkage?
I'll give more info in the morning but if you have any
ideas let me know,
Thanks
Giles
