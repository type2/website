Chris Mills in TN said:::


Back in 1995 in the Norfolk, VA area right across from the Little Creek
Amphib base I rented a place to keep my partially complete '65 Beetle for
$65 a month. MUCH cheaper than the impound lot...


Chris, the Ft Myers Virginia MPs had a late bay Westy in their impound lot 
for a bunch of months.

They said that they would keep it there for -3- months before they 
would/could process the paperwork for disposal.

They said that the owner could retrieve the VW if they paid just the towing 
charges (like, 1 mile!!) which, on post, was a set fee.

They DID NOT have to pay for the months it was impounded.

This is a cheap way to store your vehicle for some 3 months, and man, it IS 
REALLY secured storage.

BTW, I called the Towson campus police station, and they are strict about 
parking on campus, even during the holidays.  No $200 parking fee/year, no 
parking!!

Barry sends.
