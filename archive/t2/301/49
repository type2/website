Subject: New Tire Rack Facility Sighting

Hey all--

I had to take a blast on I-90 over to Elkhart Indiana today--and as I
was passing through the outskirts of South Bend--
WOW---

The tire Rack now has a brand new building 3 city blocks long and, 4
wide--
Unbelievable--
The front half where the offices are is top to bottom green tinted
glass, and has to be a quarter of the front part of the building.

They used to be in downtown South Bend, in the old Studebaker plant
facility--this was kinda neat--seeing the old water tower with
"Studebaker" on it--

I drive there from the west side of the Windy--it's an hour and a half
drive for me--good people to do business with--
This new place is totally unbelievable--
They must be doing well--  

Maybe their prices will go up to cover the expenditures---:>) 

Later,
