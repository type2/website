Subject: Re: [T2] decorating the bus for Xmas

This year my bus is just a frame in a carport, but she and I have had great 
Christmas' past.

I have the tire on da front, so I put on a wreath with a bow, 12v x-mas 
lights on the inside. And two years ago I went so far as to fake snow the 
windows....it was hilarious.

A wreath looks great on the front of a bus! -Better so than on the front of a 
SUV or the like.
