It looks like this:

Pay no attention to the name of that file: the sender had to be replaced.

Note that there is an o-ring just underneath that will probably be cracked. The sender can be on pretty tight so tap it on an off with a screwdriver.

This is the shape of the opening so you can see it only has to rotate a little before the tabs of the sender unlock with the tank body:

Refer to your pictures to help you orient the float the correct way when you re-install.
