Subject: Parting out 76 Westfalia

For anyone intersted, I'm (unfortunately) parting out
my 76 westfalia this week.  Most of the parts are in
good shape.  I have the engine and tranny out, as well
as most of the interior.  Things of note:

-dash with console
-front seats (recently reupholstered)
-all windows
-front doors
-engine tin pieces
-all fuel injection components
-some cabinets
-tranny

There are a lot of other things I'm missing, so if you
need a part, let me know what it is and make an offer.
 Any of the heavier parts (i.e. tranny) are pretty
much limited to driving distance (I'm right near
boston).
I'm trying to get the bus out of the yard relatively
soon, so if your intersted in anything let me know
soon.
