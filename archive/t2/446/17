If you can confirm that there is no spark (like you mentioned) then
that is where you MUST start. The other stuff like not getting fuel to
the carbs I would worry about later. Is there a mech or elec fuel
pump? 

if you have the muir book there is a good section on spark.

However I would first determine if the coil has 12V when the ignition
is turned on. if so, then see if you have spark from the coil itself,
if that passes then move to the spark through the distributor. HTH
