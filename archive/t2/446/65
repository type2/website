True, alas.

Richard,

I have used 3-4 of these in different bay and vanagon applications.  It is
the gasket I was referring to in my post.  As far as I can tell, the slope
and diameter of the cone on both the air distribution box and the throttle
body appears to me never to have changed, even on the digifont engines.
I'd love to have one next to a NOS Bay gasket, but I doubt you would find
one :-(
