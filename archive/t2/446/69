Subject: engine cleaning??

could someone tell me what if anything special I need to do if I want to clean
my engine. I just fixed an oil leak(s) and the bottom is sort of gross and I
would like to clean it up. Should I just spray her off at the car wash? What
about inside the engine compartment? Does anything need to be covered?

Thanks
