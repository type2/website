Subject: perfect friday topic Limousine-Westy abomination combination

Hello,

The following link is an ebay auction of a very interesting combination
(abomination combination) of a Westfalia, sort of stuck onto the top of a
Lincoln Limousine. The pictures are interesting. The best part is, it makes
you really appreciate all the space you get to walk around upright inside
your really comfortable Westy.
