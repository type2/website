Subject: re:[T2] Cylinder 3 Exhaust Burnout Help.

I had the exact same problem this summer in my '72 bus.  The list 
helped me out pretty good. Here's what i ended up doing.

1. adjusted all the valves as St.Muir says.

2. i bought a litre or so of diesel, started and warmed up the van.  
then poured a bit down the first carburettor not letting the engine 
stall.  it will smoke really bad so do it out doors.  i repeated it for 
the other carb. i did them both maybe 4-5 times each. i'm not sure 
how you would do this with a fi bus.

3. Drove to the gas station. put the left over diesel in the gas tank 
and filled it with high octane.

4. drove about 1000km rechecked the valves and they were perfect 
and compression was up from 70lbs to almost 110lbs in #3. the 
exhaust valve was almost hitting the rocker tho. i took off the 
rocker and shimmed it with a washer on each stud (50 cents). 


This is only a temporary fix, if it works for you at all.  you will 
probably need your head rebuilt sometime in the near months so 
save up some cash.
i have drove it all summer with out a problem. i have one more 
month left before it goes in for the winter and i'll get the head rebuilt 
during the down time.  i have also reduced my speed from 65mph 
to 50-55mph after the valve problem and noticed a big differences in 
both handling and gas mileage.

good luck,

Well, I do believe my third cylinder exhaust valve burned out.  After 
a 
recent valve adjustment I noticed it was real tight, about 002., I set 
it back to .006 and she seemed to run fine.  Today I was driving her 
and first a slight tapping, then a huge pop, and I was only firing on 
three Cylinders.  She did get me home though.  I read John Muir 
and I am 
pretty sure this is what happened?  Any advice on what to do  or 
what to 
inspect as I ready for this repair? 
 
Thanks,
