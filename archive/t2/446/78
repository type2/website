Subject: Sealing the engine tin...

Volksies:

Speaking of completely sealing the engine tin, does anyone know a 
source, other than a junkyard (Tried that... the ones I have contacted 
say that seems to be the first part lost, and there are not many of 
them around...) for the little black plastic access door that plugs the 
tin over the generator bolt on a '73 Westie?

I had one side of my engine rebuilt in a far-away town not mine---a 
long story---and when I got home after picking the Bus back up, the 
little black plastic door was missing.  I have checked with my 
not-so-friendly local VW dealer (He sells a lot of Audis, so busses 
don't blow his skirt up.), and they say that the part is unavailable.

If everyone customarily loses them, you'd think that someone, 
somewhere, would be making a replacement that doesn't involve duct 
tape...
