Subject: Friday survey: Stuff that doesn't break.

Hi Volks,

All the time on this list it's questions about stuff that breaks. How 
do you fix this?, where can I get one of these?, what did I do to cause 
the other thing?? Newbies on the list cringe in horror as the collected 
troubles of hundreds of list-members are paraded before them.

So I'd like to propose a Friday Survey:  What component of the bus can 
we point to as the most perfect engineering you've yet encountered, the 
part that you've never seen busted. The part you can't give away at a 
swap meet, because no-one ever needs it.

I'm not even sure it exists, but I think it's worth thinking about.

Please reply off-list, and I'll post a summary of your findings late 
tonight.


Happy trails,
