Subject: Painter's photos

My painter was kind enough to send me a CD of photos he took documenting
some of the work done to my bus and some of the rust I didn't get to see.

It was pretty scary to see major rust behind the rear valance on a bus that
has only seen four winter snows. There are some good shots of the rusted
windshield area also.

Enjoy.
