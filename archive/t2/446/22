    When I bought a 1600DP engine from Bob Donalds, of Boston Engine
Exchange, I talked with him about oil temps.  He said to use the Berg
dipstick for oil temp indication.  He said that once the light started
to flicker on, that it was time to cool things down.
    I hope this sheds a little more light on the subject.
