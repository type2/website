I've been over that pass a few times, both on my BMW motorcycle and
in my '71 bus.  The bus was much slower.

I use the altimeter function of my GPS as a way to guage performance on
hills.  With low power, you can really see the effect of steepness on road
speed, but once you get below 45 or so the rate of climb stays pretty
constant.
