The 022 133 073A gasket has been NLA from the VW dealer for a long time. I've tried to order them in the past and I made another attempt after this post just to make sure. I believe folks have been ordering the 1.8L 914 gasket from the various Porsche vendors as an alternative.

What is still available is the late Vanagon gasket, 025 133 073A. It looks very similar in size and shape with the only differences I can see being that it has more ribs along the circumference and there 3 small cutouts at the perimeter are missing.

Has anyone tried using this gasket? There's a lot in stock still and the rubber is like new.
