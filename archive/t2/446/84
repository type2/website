I lost one years ago and never new why the heat wasn't so good. When I
finally found another one I lost it after a couple of months. Don't make the
same mistake I made and please use a thread locker on them because they
screw in from the bottom.

BTW, new gaskets are still available from the VW dealer but cost a fortune.
Best to make your own. The part numbers for the gaskets are:

021 256 325A
021 256 326A
