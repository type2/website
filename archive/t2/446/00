For some reason my GE case has the cutout. The last PO was in 1979 and the case number matches the number that was recorded by the dealer at the time of purchase. There's only one receipt for engine work and no mention of milling that part of the case. It still looks like a sloppy cut the factory wouldn't make. Go figure...

WRT the temperature differential, I agree that the units tapped into the Type 4 sump plate that lack the 914 air deflector read cooler than they should. I think that's universally acknowledged. I've never read a complaint from a 914 owner about reading the temp there.
