Subject: bus doesnt want to idle!!

it did idle before, but its just been pretty much
parked since i've been painting it..

now it dont want to idle, my question is what could
cause this? i put a new fuel filter back on, also i
have determined it has an exhaust leak, and want to
know if the exhaust leak from the heat exchanger can
cause this thing not to idle..
it has a stock solex 30h on it.


thanx,
rob
