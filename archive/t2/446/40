Looks like something that all those Enron and tech bubble CEOs might be
driving now.

I'm usually attracted to hideous creations such as this, but I find
myself strangely repulsed, maybe because it appears to be a waste of
both a good limo and a good westy top. Its just not practical and
defeats the purpose of the original design... sorta like a lowrider
truck (apologies to the lowrider truck crowd among us)
