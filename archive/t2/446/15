Subject: '72 conversion needs help!

Hello, we are the new owners of Isabella, a 1972 Bus, that just stopped starting the other day.  Here's the story:She was sitting on empty basically and I went to fill her up.  Everything was fine until after I finished pumping and tried to start her again.  She wouldn't start.  Coincidentally, a mechanic pulled up beside me to get gas, and asked if I needed help.  He checked the points, all of the wires, sprayed starter fluid on the carbs, said I needed a new fuel filter, and left.  I replaced the fuel filter, that didn't help.  We have had several friends look at her.  Everyone has a different diagnosis, but nothing we try seems to work.We have:replaced the fuel filterreplaced the coilpulled a spark plug- no sparktested the spark from the old and new coil- no spark tried to buy a jumper wire at NAPA, but the sales guy stopped us and told us to make sure that there was a steady spray of fuel getting into the carbs (she's duel carbed), so we took the air filters off, put our fingers
 down in there, pushed the throttle, and felt nothing on our fingers.  Does that mean it is not getting fuel to the carbs? But, still there is no spark, and no fuel spraying into the carbs!  We are new at this, and really do not know what to check next.  If anyone has any troublw shooting ideas, we would love to hear them.  We just want our new baby to run, and we are excited to learn so much about her along the way!  PLEASE HELP ISABELLA!!!!!!!!!!!Peace, Candra & JonathanAlamosa, Colorado
