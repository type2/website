I like 3M Citrus Base cleaner.
Very effective, spray on wipe off. It doesnt leave
a residue. You can hose down with water after you
use it like on the bottom of the engine or heater
box... but if you arent comfortable hosing the inside
of your engine this works well. On Heater boxes and
valve covers  hose it with this cleaner and the hit it
with water.... The nice thing is the smell is like
oranges and doesnt last long at all.
  My experience useing this has been good as it doesnt
seem to affect painted parts or rubber/plastic as
advertised.
