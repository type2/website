Subject: Re: [T2] OIL LEAKS -push rod tubes

On a 74 bus the push rod tubes are easy to do if you
know how to adjust the valves. First get some new
seals for the push rod tubes and the valve covers.
Remove the valve covers. With a 11mm socket remove the
rocker arm nuts then remove the rocker arms and the
tube retaining spring, keep them in order so they can
be put back in the same place, remove the push rods
keep them in order for replacement. Reach into the
push rod tube with a outside snap-ring pliers and
remove the tubes, clean and replace the "O" rings on
them. clean the holes on the head and the case, make
sure there are no sharp edges to cut the "O" rings.
Put some light oil on the "O" rings and put them in
with a slight twisting motion, install the push rods ,
rocker arms, making sure to seat the push rods into
the rocker arms socket, torque the 11mm nuts and
install the wire making sure that it positions on the
push rod tubes to hold them in place.  Adjust the
valves. Install the valve cover making sure that it
seats properly. That's all folks! ! !. Phil(Whew!!
