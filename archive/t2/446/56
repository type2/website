Subject: High beams won't turn off

Well, in my never ending battle with electrical problems, it seems that
once I turned on my highbeams while driving the other night I could then
not dim them. Needless to say the hand gestures and flashing lights I
got along the way didn't help with my displeasure of the situation. Any
one know how to reset or turn off the highbeams or is it time to look
into a new turn signal assembly (since that's where the control for
turning the high beams on and off)?
