oil temp = rpm related. you can run nice cool head temps at 3800 rpm on flat
ground, but your oil temps may go up.

head temp = load related. climb a long hill at 3000 rpm, and the oil temps
may stay low, but your head temps will rise.

with oil temp, head temp and pressure you will always know what is going on
back there...
