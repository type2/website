-Measure the circumference of the hose or the tin opening with a string.
-Cut the string to length
-Cut a 1/2 inch fuel line a little longer than the string
-Carefully slice one side of the fuel line for it's entire length
-Press the sliced side of the fuel line unto the tin opening all the way 
around. 
-Trim to length
-You may adjust the fit by varying the size of the fuel line 
-Works
-Looks good
-Lasts a long time
 
 While on the subject...Have you checked your fuel lines lately?
