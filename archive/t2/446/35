err... make that fuel, vacuum, compression, spark :-)  Vacuum is one of
the big four, but only one.  And you still need to reset your dwell to 50!

Yup, it sure was.  These gaskets get very hard as they age and if they are
disturbed at all they leak like a sieve.  I have had this problem before
and should have seen it sooner but when Barry said the EGR filter was not
installed, I suspected that system first.

The cone gasket is still available from VW for under $5 and *must* be
replaced if disturbed.  Our permatex fix worked, but I am not a big fan.

Yes and no... I *HATE* starting fluid.  It is way too flammable and in
anything like an enclosed area (like your engine compartment) can be
deadly.  It works, but it's dangerous.

AMEN!  Buy a vacuum gauge, use it.  The minimum vacuum reading you want is
15".  16-17" is far better.

I think that if you reset the dwell to 50 exactly and the timing to 7.5
vor that your vacuum will rise to 17" and that that is the highest you
want to go.  You can get it up to 19-20 by advancing the timing per
american V-8 timing specs (advance it til it stumbles, then back off a
hair), but you will burn your engine right up.  VWs have, by american V-8
standards, very retarded timing, but this is necessary to prevent damage
to the engine.  Try to get it to 17" and steady, then rest and be happy.

You are welcome, Barry.  Thank YOU for the AFM and ECU!

Yup.  As I said above, they get old, they get hard, and any movement will
create a leak.  If it had been daytime, we'd have been at VW buying a new
one.  Wait til you see where that RTV has gone in your throttle body! :-(
