It's probably your high beam relay.  Turn the ignition on but don't start
the engine.  turn the headlights on.  Work the beam control and listen for
clicks from under the dash.  If you hear clicks but don't get beam changes
it is probably the relay.  If you don't hear clicks it is the lever
switch.

Leaky windshields kill these relays because the relays are mounted upside
down.  Any water that leaks into the relay stays there.  I drill a tiny
hole in the cover so that anything that gets in has a way to get out.

If it is the relay, you'll find it plugged into the bottom of the fuse
block.  You have to release the fuse block from its holder to access this.
Be sure to disconnect the negative lead of the battery before you do this
as the fuse block is always hot!
