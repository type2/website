Hello Guys   Do so tests first.  check your valves. check the compression 
next, examine the valve train, try to determine what the huge pop was( broken 
valve, or spring, or vacuum leak or worse broken rod thur the case) I seen some 
with a big hole in the top that still ran!! really neat to see the workings of 
a motor but not what you want. Start with all 5 senses    listen , look smell 
, feel and well I don't know about tasting.but if you want go ahead.  Later 
and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service Salem Va
