there is only one relief valve on a hydro case.

i am not certain about this, but i believe the function you are referring to
is taken on by a passage at the rear of the case, across the parting line,
that connects the galleries on either side. it does not regulate in terms of
valve action, but it may have this effect you are relating to.
