Subject: Re: [T2] Oil temp sender/sump plate

Well, my case is also a GE and is the original according to the paper work
that I have from the first owner and place of purchase. I'll have to check
it out at the next oil change and keep the fingers crossed. Now I just need
to find that sump plate.

case number matches the number that was recorded by the dealer at the time
of purchase. There's only one receipt for engine work and no mention of
milling that part of the case. It still looks like a sloppy cut the factory
wouldn't make. Go figure...

Type 4 sump plate that lack the 914 air deflector read cooler than they
should. I think that's universally acknowledged. I've never read a complaint
from a 914 owner about reading the temp there.
