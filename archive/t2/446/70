Subject: carbs in an 83 cali westy AC

Can it be done?  is there enough room in the engine
compartment, if so, what carbs will fit in there?
Can you still run the electronic ignition without the
wiring harness and FI?  I have reason to believe the
FI in my car is blowing my engines BC i have blown two
in the past year after replacing all the vacuum hoses.
 Would anyone recommend against putting in carbs?
