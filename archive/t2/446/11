Subject: Re: [T2] Oil temp sender/sump plate

Just to throw something else into the mix here, I have a non-hydraulic case
(CJ) which is only single relief and which has the cutout under the sump
plate.  I have fitted a temp sender to it but who knows what temperature I'm
getting because I haven't fitted the gauge yet!
