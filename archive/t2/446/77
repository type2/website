Looks like this is now fixed. The next time this occurred, I reached behind 
the dash near the wires going to the switch and wiggled the bundles and the 
motor died properly. Did this several times. Then when I had a chance to 
look into it more closely, it was apparent the dash switches for the 
interior light and wiper were loose. The little collar nuts that hold the 
switches had loosened. I oriented the back of the switches and tightened 
them down and no more faults.

Several years ago I had a problem of the wiper fuze blowing. Same cause, 
the wiper switch was loose and turned until one of the terminals was 
shorting to ground. Now I have to follow up and make a tool to fit those 
little collar nuts so I can get them truly tight. If they still come loose 
I will add a drop of thread locker.

Further, last year I finally replaced the original ignition switch. I know 
it was original because it was a pot metal housing which hasn't been 
available for a long time.  I put in the plastic bodied replacement switch, 
probably of Brazilian species.

So, suggest that you verify all the dash switches are tight with the behind 
dash portion oriented to insure clearance all around. If they rotate they 
will short to either the dash or an adjacent switch terminal.
