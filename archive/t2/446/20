been there done that, my 65 Westy just barely got over Red Mountain Pass,
and the engine never ran right after that, sorry I didn't have oil
temp/presure guages then. I drove it back to Baltimore without turning the
engine off, parked it behind my house and the engine never ran again.  

sold it cheap too, and it was a pristine (well almost) white westy. (of
course this was 73 or so)
