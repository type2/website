Marcus,

been there and done that...in a 67 I once owned.  The brass fitting
**did** come out of the carb...with the new fuel line still firmly
clamped to it.

I actually leaned in and blew out the fire(I was *much* younger then)
and went and bought new ign wires and fuel hose.  Went back,
put them in, hammered  the fitting back into the carb and drove off.

Whenever I work on a carb like that now, that is the first thing I do.
The second thing is to tap the accelerator pump fuel injection
nozzle down with a punch and hammer so it doesn't fall down the intake and 
into the engine.

Sorry about your splity.  :-((

Cheers, dave
