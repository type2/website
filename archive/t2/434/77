I'm NOT the expert here, but since no else has piped up...if your case is
magnesium and you try to weld, you will create an awesome fireworks display
which might take out your garage, house, and you, depending on how fast you
can run.

Not sure what years were mag v.s aluminum, but be sure before you try
welding.
