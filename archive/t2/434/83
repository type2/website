Subject: Who just painted their pop top?

I read a post about a week ago from someone who had just painted his pop top
with a roller and a brush. I want to do mine and would like to know the
process and the product you used. Do you have any pics of the final product?

Did you reuse your old seals? I just replaced mine about a month ago. I could
reuse them couldn't I? It would be a pain to get the silicone off of the top
seal.

Thanks,

Nik
