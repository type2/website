Subject: ball joint booty

Can you replave the ball joint rubber boot without going through that crazy 
process that Mike Gensler lists on the type2 library?

I think the front right ball joint is making noise, and when I checked, the 
boot is all torn and missing any grease. Is that a sign I need to replace it 
completely, or can I somehow repack it with grease and slap a new boot on 
there somehow?

thanks!
