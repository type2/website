Safety features yes, but air conditioning??  Why do we have to sacrifice that?  The past two days have been 105+ here, and if I didn't have air conditioning, I wouldn't be driving my bus.  At least not very far.  I installed the whole system in an afternoon - certainly less work than, say rebuilding an engine.  I don't like sacrifices, and my wife likes them even less.
