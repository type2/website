Subject: Brake light switch

Hi folks...

The brake lights on my "new" '76 Westy are not working.  I am pretty
confident that the problem is the around switch on the master cylinder
(the tail light assemblies are in kinda bad shape, but the reverse lights
and turn signals work, and the dim lights that come on with the head
lights work fine, as well).

My trouble is that it's been about 13 years since I last worked on an
air cooled VW (which was a Super Beetle), and I would like some advice
on the easiest way to reach the master cylinder/switch on the Bus.  I've
checked the Type2 archives and the library, and couldn't find any advice
there... unfortunately, my Bentley manual is inaccessible right now (in
a box of parts that the seller, who is out of town for 2 weeks, has for
me).

Thanks!
