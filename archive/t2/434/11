Heyup! Just for newbie's sakes, That's not EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) that's the fuel tank venting system. The gas fumes being vented to the air intakes from the gas tank have neither become exhaust nor have they been recirculated.

However, do check the rubber connectors of this venting system as mentioned.
