Thanks, Karl.  I wasn't sure if the reference was to the interior clips
(which might, maybe, be reproducible in plastic), and the exterior trim
clips which I suspected were metal and probably not reproducible in plastic.

What are the dimensions of the clip?  The #33 in the fiche seemed to be out
of scale to make it more visible.

Meanwhile, a "thank you" to Richard for the pics of the interior clips.  I
hadn't realized that there was a plastic "cup" that the clip inserted into.
Time to pull a set out of our bus for research purposes...
