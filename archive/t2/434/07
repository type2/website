BTDT - first noticed lack of power going uphill, so I shifted down,
still no power. Then I looked into my rearview mirror: Oh s**t!!

No smell, no apparent smoke up front. This was the result:

Note that this camper actually had new fuel lines. Maybe the brass fuel
line fitting fell out of the carb. But who knows - it's pretty hard to
diagnose a melted down engine.

Always having at least one fire extinguisher on board is the lesson
that I learned.

    With as much as I have been seeing posts related to replacement of
fuel
lines to avoid fires (which I think is absolutely imperative), I
started to
think about how much time it could take to realize it if a fire did
break out
(God Forbid) in the engine compartment while driving. It would seem
that it
may not be apparent until the engine starts to die or the until the
driver
smells or sees smoke coming from the rear of the vehicle.
