Subject: Re:Early detection of fire in engine compartment

    With as much as I have been seeing posts related to replacement of fuel
lines to avoid fires (which I think is absolutely imperative), I started to
think about how much time it could take to realize it if a fire did break out
(God Forbid) in the engine compartment while driving. It would seem that it
may not be apparent until the engine starts to die or the until the driver
smells or sees smoke coming from the rear of the vehicle. Either way, it would
seem that a lot of damage could happen before the driver notices. This brings
me to my next thought;

    Has there ever been discussion on the list about early detection of fire
in the engine compartment? I have a few ideas on how one might do this and I
am wondering if there would be any interest in a system that would alert the
driver to the presence of fire in the engine compartment?

    Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to do market research through this
list; I am just trying to get a sense of if it would be worth me putting some
time into developing such a system. I certainly would'nt propose that such a
system would replace using good  maintenance practices on our buses to prevent
fires, I have just always felt somewhat detatched from what is going on back
in that engine compartment ( to the point of considering putting a used closed
circuit camera back there....... a little obsesive I suppose).

    Any input would be appreciated. - Jeff
