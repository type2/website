Subject: RE: [T2] Brake light switch

Crawl underneath just behind the wheels. The master cylinder & brake booster
are right there. The switches (you probably have two) are screwed in the
master and are readily accessible. Normally I'd recommend methodical
troubleshooting on electrical problems before replacing things, but in my
experience those switches fail a lot and are dirt cheap. You need both
switches for the brake failure warning light to work.

CAUTION: the switches are taper thread! Screw them in nice and snug, but no
further, or you'll crack the master. Ask me how I know...
