not really the safest thing to do to use belts out of a junker as 30 yr old
belts are for the most part very stiff and have lost most of their
elasticity which will allow them to break easier on impact.  new fixed
belts are cheap enough that unless you are worried about having original
stuff work and look just fine.

A '76 Westfalia sounds like just the ticket for you (because of the age and
tax issues). In the US, all '76s had rear seatbelts and you find one in
Europe
without, I'm sure it has the mount points. You could buy a set from a
listmember cheap (or I bet you could get some for the price of shipping -
as
there are many buses of that era that go to the crusher here).
