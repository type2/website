I broke off an alternator mounting stud from a type 1 case and had the
surrounding material come apart with it.  I took it to a welding shop
and asked them to build up the missing magnesium for me.  I'm not sure
if they used a magnesium alloy or aluminum but it worked out fine.  I
smoothed out the glob of metal that they put in place using a grinder
and then hand sanded it to a shiny surface.  I then re-drilled and
tapped the hole to insert a new stud.  That case is still in operation
today with no problems.
