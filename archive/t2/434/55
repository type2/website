Subject: starter relay problem

My 79 westfalia came to me with an aftermarket relay installed for the 
starter.  It appears to be a black Bosch relay with an inline 15 amp fuse mounted in 
one of the wires.

It has worked fine for two years until now.

The fuse first blew a couple of weeks ago.  I replaced it and everything 
worked fine for several days until it blew again.  Now installing a new fuse only 
results in it blowing at the first starting attempt.  I replaced the starter 
with one I know to be good and this made no difference, the fuse still blows 
when I try to start the bus.

Any thoughts?  Is this indicative of a failed relay? Should I just remove it 
and rewire things?  How necesary is it anyway?

thanks,
