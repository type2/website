Subject: BTW..Eureka Springs show sponsor

Folks, 

I took the liberty of sponsoring a class of trophy's for the 
Eureka springs show in the name of the list...www.type2.com

Hope that was ok with the list admins....

www.nwavwa.com

Some of the folks on the list have been and it is *the* premier
event in the middle of the country.

Cheers, dave
