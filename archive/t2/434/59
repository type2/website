Mike,

I had great success using a Sprint PCS phone and a USB cable that I had to
buy through Ebay - Sprint had discontinued this cable because it circumvents
their $300 pcmcia card solution.  I am able to surf cross-country at about
14.4kbps for no extra charges.
Best info I found was:

Good luck!
Sean
