Subject: tranny oil

So I figure I ought to change the oil in the transmission of my new 78 since
it hasn't been changed in ... at a minimum 7 years - probably a lot longer.
What's the scoop.  Do I need to start hunting for GL 4 again, or will GL 5
work.  It's proven pretty much impossible to find GL 4 in Canada so I've been
using Amsoil synthetic - at about $35.00 a quart in my 60.

TIA

jdd 60 std (got 2 coats of epoxy primer and 3 coats of high build on the roof
today), 78 westy (still waiting to get safetied)
