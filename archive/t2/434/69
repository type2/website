These are indeed genuine Volkswagen. But unfortunately, "Genuine VW' is
not synonymous with "exactly the same as Volkswagen made 30 years ago in
Germany."  The ones we ship are the only genuine VW ones, and are the
best available on the current market.  They are equal to (although not
superior to) the European made aftermarket ones we sometimes ship
interchangeably for '72-79.  They are also far superior to the
aftermarket ones that are available from Mexico, etc. (which are
frequently sold elsewhere for about the same price). They are the same
ones that West Coast Metric, Wolfsburg, and others sell for much more
money. They are also the same ones that are claimed by other vendors to
be German Volkswagen seals. But personally I am very skeptical about
this claim, having seen the identical seal in Brazilian VW packaging as
well. While VW does sell them in Germany (hence the confusion), I
strongly suspect that they actually originate from VW/Brazil. For this
reason, I stop short of calling them German. 

While the profile is not identical to the circa-1971 VW/Germany seal, it
will seal acceptably, and in fact is the same seal that VW has used for
the last 20 years on their own Brazilian/Mexican made Kombi's. Line the
corners and latch area up first and work your way around from there. You
can use weatherstrip adhesive, available at any auto parts store. Rubber
cement will also work.
