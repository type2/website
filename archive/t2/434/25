Subject: late model Westy going to Ecology...

We were going to breakfast this morning in Saugus and saw a flatbed
heading south on San Fernando Road.  On the flatbed was a late model westy
that looked totally complete.  Air in the tires, Vanagon spoked hubcaps,
curtains in the windows, decent paint, straight, no-rust body, etc.  It
looked better than most of the buses on the road!

In any case, it was on an Ecology Wrecking truck, heading south toward LA,
so if someone acts quickly they can have a nice Westy, or at least some
decent parts from it.
