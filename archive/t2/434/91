Subject: Engine Problems after tune-up

Well,

Today, beside adjusting the valves, I also changed the points, spark plugs 
and spark plug wires. Unfortunately I switched No2 and No4 wires and 
noticed my mistake when I tuned it on and it started backfiring. I put the 
wires back in the right place. I adjusted dwell to 48 degrees and timing to 
5 degrees after TDC. It seemed that everything was fine.
I took the bus for a test drive and the engine is misbehaving.

It has a strange sound to it, like puffing. The right half sounds ok but 
the left half has this strange puffing sound which is accentuated by the 
tailpipe since the gas comes out in puffs.
Also, the engine has no power, it's almost impossible to start moving the 
bus and I barely made it back from the test drive at less than 20mph. I 
could also hear couple of backfires?
When idling, speed will oscillate until if finally dies. I also noticed a 
little hissing in engine compartment that's almost imperceptible.

Some questions beside the obvious of what did I do wrong, or what could be 
wrong
.
1. My user manual (in french) says that spark plug gap should be 0,70mm 
(0,50 in cold weather) while Bentley says 0.60. I gapped the spark plugs 
per Bentley since the engine is not the original one (AD series now). Am I 
right?

2. I'm thinking of tomorrow morning restart the tune-up process just in 
case I missed something. I also have a Compression gauge. Should I try to 
measure the compression in the cylinders? How do I do that?

Thanks in advance for your insight.

Regards,
