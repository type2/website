The only difference is the rear carrier. There is an adapter but it is not
the greatest of inventions for your bus. I have always simply drilled the
holes in the correct spot then tapped them for threads. It is a simple deal
to do and worth the time to do it. The engines are the same other than that.
The fan shroud is a little different but not enough where it doesn't fit. I
had a bug motor straight from a bug in my 66' westy for years. It being a
split didn't need any mods to make it fit.
