REPLACE THE FUEL LINES!!!!

Yes, I'm shouting. Also, check the rubber parts of the EGR system. Reach up
into the air intakes and follow the metal lines towards the front of the bus.
There you should find a couple points where the metal lines are connected with
rubber lines. Replace this rubber.

Other than that, sounds like you got quite a deal! Definitely join your local
VW club and start going to campouts!
