Subject: How do you set up your camp?

We finally got our 76 Westy on the road after a slew of problems. As of this
week end, we've been camping in it 4 times. I've scanned different web pages
for suggested items to take/pack, so I have most of those things down pretty
well. We are keeping a list of little things we need.
What I'd like to hear about are ways you all keep your camper organized
while camping- We're getting good at putting stuff right away, but there has
to be more to keeping things organized.
What kinds of containers do you use for wet/dirty clothes, where do you put
the table at night, what do you keep in the overhead compartment (we have a
couple board games in there which take up space, and we have the front
curtains and rear screen), what do you keep in below the bench seat?

How about mosquitos? We have the rear screen, and I know a sliding door
screen is available, but it's a little pricey if I recall correctly . Have
any of you thrifty people come up with a cheaper alternative? How about the
front windows?

Outside. We have a largish pavillion type of thing with a roof and no sides
which folds up nicely. It's nice for sunny days, however, it's worthless in
the rain. The rain splashes in, and if we set it up right outside the
sliding door the rain pours off the roof and gets the inside of the open
door wet- I know, close the door, but it's nice to have it open. I'm going
to get a tarp to bridge the gap- any other cheap alternatives?

Rain- what do you all do in the rain? We have a mat outside the door, and we
have to take our shoes off to keep the inside clean/dry. Any suggestions for
camping in the rain? PA has had an exceptionally wet summer this year.


Sorry for the long post. Thanks for any tips.
Anyone near Erie, PA want to hook up and camp?
