Subject: Re:Early detection of fire in engine compartment

I don't have a detection system but I do have a suppression system.  I
have two fire extinguishers strapped in the engine compartment with a
cable attached to both of their actuators.  All I have to do is pull the
other end of the cable which is inside the bus to set both of them off.
If the fire is under the bus I'll just have to hit it with another
eqtingisher.  I also keep one behind the drivers seat and one mounted
next to the rear bench seat.  The system in the engine compartment took
me 2 afternoons to hook up.  The way I figure it though:  6 hours labor
= saving 3,000 dollar bus = 500 dollars per hour labor.  Not a bad
payoff if I ever have to use it.
