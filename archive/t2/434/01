A '76 Westfalia sounds like just the ticket for you (because of the age and
tax issues). In the US, all '76s had rear seatbelts and you find one in Europe
without, I'm sure it has the mount points. You could buy a set from a
listmember cheap (or I bet you could get some for the price of shipping - as
there are many buses of that era that go to the crusher here).

There is sleep space potentially for five in a '76: two in the back, two in
the pop-top and one in the cot over the front seats. You're kids are all small
and would probably get a kick out of rotating through the different sleeping
spots to see which they like the best! The childs cot stoys away neatly under
the back seat. I like the interior of the '76 better than prior years (I have
a '74 and took out the cabinets because they were more annoying that useful).
The '76 can go from 'full camping mode' to 'grocery getter' in a matter of
minutes (later models are the same - but as you said - tax reasons make a
pre-77 more desireable).

As far as safety is concerned, I'd bet the highways in Europe are alot more
bus-friendly that the US and the country rodes even more so. Here we have to
deal with large semis/transfer trucks blowing past us at 90mph. The bus really
excells at traveling down country lanes at 45-50mph. Rough roads are no
problem. In fact, the ground clearance and rear-engine traction of the bus
makes even seemingly impassible routes possible.

For the money, I really don't think they can be beat. But you do have to
sacrifice the modern conveniences of air conditioning and safety features. But
the most important safety feature is the person behind the wheel.

P.S. My 9 year old daughter and I put about 16,000 miles a year on my bus
going camping and visiting family.
