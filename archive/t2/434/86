Subject: RE: [T2] tranny oil

Consensus is GL-4, legend has it that GL-5 will eat the brass parts in the
tranny (synchros?)
I think GL-5 MT(?) is supposed to be ok.
I got some amsoil from aircooled.net last year, not sure if they still have

So I figure I ought to change the oil in the transmission of my new 78 since
it hasn't been changed in ... at a minimum 7 years - probably a lot longer.
What's the scoop.  Do I need to start hunting for GL 4 again, or will GL 5
work.  It's proven pretty much impossible to find GL 4 in Canada so I've
been
