Subject: new vaccum advance available?

I have what I believe to be a good working distributor, but the vaccum is 
shot on it,
and by that I mean when I suck on it, it doesnt move the plate at all. 
(thats the sign, right?)

I have two right now, one of them you can blow into and out of with total 
ease, so im guessing thats completely kaput?

the other I can only blow into a little, then it makes a little noise like a 
little bladder became suddenly full with air, however, when I suck in on 
that hose, it does not move the plate at all on the distributor, so I guess 
its kaput also? Or maybe I just need to greese or oil or loosen something on 
the body so the strength of the vaccum can move the plate on the dist as 
needed?

thanks,
and yes, I know I should just suck it up and buy a new rebuilt one, im just 
really broke right now.

I should sell some of the spare bus parts I have for some money, but I just 
have a hard time parting with them. =(
