Subject: Re: [T2] pushrod retaining wire broken?????i need one

thanks james...
yeah i know i can run wihout them for a bit ,,,,,
i am goign to do just as you said though i am going to get me another quick..
i am leaving her sitting until i find one or get one somehow...
maybe latter this week...
i have someone that is suppose to be sending me a couple of them from cali...
i would rather be patient rather than messing up the engine that i have spent so much time on...

besides the push rods have some wear on them already from the wire being broke...
the evidience is there ...
the three rods closest to where the wire broke are the ones worn down in a circular motion...
i think they will be fine though once i get another wire in there ...
thanks for the advice well taken...
peace
