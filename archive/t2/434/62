I have the same bus, sans the Coca Cola logo.  Not sure what they're selling

vacation to Myrtle Beach, SC and while there they found an interesting
souvenir at the Gay Dolphin Gift Cove (Ocean blvd. & Boardwalk at 10th; 916
North Ocean Boulevard, Myrtle Beach, SC 29577; 843-448-6550.)  (Our friends
have a champagne bay.)

approximately 1:48 scale, with operating double side doors (don't remember
what they're called, the ones that replace the sliding door).  The text on
the underside labels them as a 1962 Microbus (Welly Product #9764).

(all molded in, except the middle seat which seems to be glued to a slightly
raised platform the same size as the seat bottom.  A splittie owner would
have to look at the dash to see how authentic it is...
