Subject: Re: [T2] pushrod retaining wire broken?????i need one

thanks dave for the heads up...
i wondered about that...
i think i will use them for now but will keep a new set of pushrods in mind for my next parts order.. they are only like 8 bucks a piece at bus depot...
i will check around and see the best deal i can get and go ahead and replace them all ....
this will be better insurance in the long run for me...
thanks again..
peace
