Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Early detection of fire in engine compartment

I also had the brass fitting pull out of the carb on my Campmobile, but I
was lucky, I found it before it caused a fire ( petrol POURING out of the
engine bay is not a good sign, and leads to investigation. )

As Dave said, it's something that needs to be checked regularly, as well as
the fuel lines ( which I'd replaced a couple of weeks before that, WITHOUT
checking the carb fittings, as I didn't know that they came loose ).
