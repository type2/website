Are you assuming the stock setup? Where can I get these rebushed? What 
if I want to rebuild them?  So far the ammount of parts for the stock 
setup seems to be a bit weak.

What about that nasty little flat spot during that hard accelleration 
push? I had a bug with a 009 and was really not impressed with it's 
performance. Judging by the discussions regarding the 009 the mechanical 
only advance is far from sufficient for daily driving. This is my daily 
driver and I want it to be a cream puff ;-) Seriously, if I'm having to 
wait for the engine to rev up to shift that seems like a waste of fuel 
and power during that initial take off phase of driving.
