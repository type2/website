What Bentley is referring to is the equivalent of an "EZ-out."  They are
cheap.  They are not "easy to use" but rather easy to mis-use.  Before you
buy one, go to a hardware store and ask after a left-hand twist drill bit.
The reason for that necked bolt was to limit torque during installation
and nine times out of ten drilling the bolt with a left-hand bit will
catch and remove the bolt with no need for the EZ-out.

                             OOK!
