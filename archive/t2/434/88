Subject: Stock dual carb setup.

Perhaps I wasn't totally clear during my first post. Repair parts for 
the stock dual carbs for a 72 are rare at the least.. My question was 
about alternatives and what others have tried. I'm trying to get a 
consensus as to where to head with my bus. I'm tired of asking questions 
and having the canned "man, 72 carbs are so hard to take care of blah 
blah blah" answer thrown in my face. Should I go FI? How much does it 
cost? Should I go dual  {weber|dellorto|kadron} in it's place? Come on  
lets do some talking here! :-)
