Subject: Re: [T2] Name of "partial" pop-top?

Actually, they did appear on 68 to around 74 Type 2s in Europe, installed
usually at the center of the vehicle.  Over the years, I've heard it called
the "European Poptop" that Westfalia installed then.  I used to make and
sell the seal  and replacement canvas for it back in the 80s and early 90s,
although not very many of them.

64-67 Westys began what was called the "Center Poptop"  In 68 it was
continued to be made by Westfalia and sold mostly in Europe and into Canada
as well.  Never sold in the USA to my knowledge.  It was a bit longer in
length than the 64-67 Variety.  I used to have a very nice used Euro-Poptop
cover in my stash until around 15 years ago.  I haven't seen one in about a
decade.
