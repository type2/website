Next time (AFTER you've cleaned the holes for the Allen wrench...),
insert the wrench and tap it a few times with a screwdriver handle
or somesuch to vibrate the bolt...Then, tap the wrench clockwise
a few times before attempting to remove the bolt...A mechanic
I know swears he gets better results removing old nuts and bolts
by first going clockwise and then counterclockwise... YMMV, of
course... ;-(
