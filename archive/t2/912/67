Subject: 72 pushrod tubes

Okay, I've read the archive but it's not helping me.  I have a 72 with some
serious oil leaks.  It's been sitting for years and now that I've gotten it
going, fluids are finding their way out.

Anyhow, I have removed the pushrods (dripping in oil)but how in the world
do you get the pushrod tubes out?  There's nothing to grab hold of!
