Subject: Re: [T2] Popping out of first

Clutch or shift lever adjustments might be in order. 
Both are easy to to do if you have an after-market
manual.  Most air-coolers use "VWs for Dummies" and
thae Haynes manual.

Also, a worn-out tranny will likely manifest by
popping out of first under load...mine will do that
sometimes on a VERY steep hill, but it's been that way
for years with no other problems.

Howdy!  I'm David Bradley in Atlanta.  Just bought a
'72 Transporter; just
joined the list.  I'm trying to figure out why it's
begun popping out of
first gear whenever any serious load is put on it.  I
can start off just
fine, but as soon as the RPMs build, pop goes the
weasel!  Any suggestions
as to what's most likely and where to start looking? 
I'd appreciate any
advice.
