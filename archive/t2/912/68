Subject: [T2]rear wheel cylinder

is there a way to tell if a wheel cylinder is good off the bus?

i have a rear wheel cylinder here i think is good but not sure by looking at it... its old but came form a good neighborhood so it aint all shiny.... came from a old shop that closed down years ago and i pulled it out of my extra parts bin now cause i need it but wonder if it is still good and how to tell cause in this case looks aint everything but maybe they are? it is in the box and wrapped in plastic and still has little book down in there but the cylinder it's self has a bit of brown to it and just isnt shiny... the little black boots still look ok etc...
i am am sure it is not used but that is also another reason for my questioning if there is a test to see if it is good off the bus?

i can push on the brake shoe holders there(*little slots) and they wont give like the one on the bus now... the one on the bus is gone its soft soft soft....

so since there is resistance on this one i thought i'd ask..

211611047for  76 bus.... 

thanks
