Subject: Name of "partial" pop-top?

I am interested in possibly retro-fitting my standard '76 with a pop- 
top I have seen occasionally. I would like to know the official  
terminology for the style of top that is only around 1/3 as long as a  
full Westy top. To be fair, I think I've only seen these on pre-68  
buses, but would still like to know how to refer to them in my search.

I believe my current bus is in very good mechanical condition - don't  
want to go through what I did on it with another unit. Though, in the  
end, I might settle for another project with a Weekender version.

Thanks,
Ron Johnson, '78 2.0 FI
