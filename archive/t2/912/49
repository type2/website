Subject: Re: [T2] Name of "partial" pop-top?

I tried to translate this as literally as possible, so it may read like
written by someone who does not really know English too well ...
"aufstellen" translates to "erect", but I figured that pop-top would be the
better translation. I am not sure what the folding top (last paragraph
refers to).

Marcus

The VW camper is available with a lift-top, with a pop-top, with a large
tent

The fiber-glass lift-top raises your living area to 1.9 meters. It is 1.12
by 0.9 meters, easy to collapse and extend, and locks automatically. The
sides of the lift-top consist of weather-proof cotton. It has three screened
windows that can by opened by zippers.

The pop-top gives you an extra bed, three screened windows, and a luggage
rack. This roof is also made from fiber-glass; thus it is light and sturdy
at the same time. It is raised in one single operation and locks
automatically.

You want an additional living- and bed-room? There you are: you can order a
large self-supporting tent with your VW camper. It has a rubber floor and
exterior poles.

Also there is the folding top. With that you have a 2.47 meters high
apartment and two addtional beds.
