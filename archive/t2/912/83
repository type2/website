Subject: Odd occasional starting problem

Hi everyone,

'71 westy 1600dp stock.

Finally back from Spain and have the bus up and going after some
tweaking with my recent rebuild. The bus will start the moment the key
is turned if it has been sitting for a couple of days but after a
25-35 minute drive if I turn it off the bus won't start. The battery
acts dead. With jumper cables on it won't start either. A good push
though and the bus will fire right up. It sits for a few days and then
it starts again with the turn of the key. My generator light never
comes on and this never happened before the rebuild. After tinkering
and thinking I am leaning towards a bad cell in the battery, maybe it
doesn't get charged fully when driving around. What are some other
ideas or opinions?

Thanks,

Max Bronsema
