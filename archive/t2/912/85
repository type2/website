Busted Bus, Interstate Used Parts, Bus Boys, are good places to start.

Your oil cooler hasn't been getting the airflow it needs with the flaps
missing. They direct air to the oil cooler when wide open.

Not in any of the ones I've seen.

The orange high heat RTV might work. But I'd get some aluminum tape (listed
as bumper repair tape at my FLAPS) instead. Or JBWeld if you never want to
touch them again.

Sorry, can't help with the flappers or connections. I haven't messed with
those yet.
