Subject: CVS Cooler $4.99 38 cans 24 qts

Hey, I finally found the perfect cooler that sits between the front seats.
It is on special from CVS from $19.99 to $4.99.  I was willing to pay $10
for this cooler, and I was shocked when they said just $4.99

This was the last one that this out-of-the-way CVS had; I got it yesterday
about 10:00.  Other CVS didn't have them, out already

The top folds up easily, and the top has indents for FOUR cups or cans.
Well, I don't expect the indents will securely hold a can on a real hard
turn or spot, but good enough for normal driving.

I will post picture on thesamba ASAP and send another msg, but you should
really call around to yout local CVS and ask if they still have a 38 can
cooler with a flat top w/ four indents and a folding handle.

At this price, they are well worth it
