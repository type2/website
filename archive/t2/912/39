<<What's so great about these Sears Craftsman?? Well, they are the
READABLE sockets, and you can actually see the sizes engraved on the
socket.>>

Huh---
If you can no longer see what size the socket is maybe you should
consider two things;
(A) a trip to the optometrist

(B) Hang it up.
If you can't tell what size the socket is how in the heck are you going
to find the bolt? --: )

Stevie Wonder and wrenching don't make it.

<< They use to be the Harley-Davidson special sockets.>>

The only tools I've ever seen specifically made for an Milwaukee
Vibrator is a Crescent Wrench, a sledge hammer, and a bike trailer.

And you can clearly see all of the above.
No size discrepancies.

No other tools are needed.
