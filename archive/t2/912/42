One of the toughest things of getting older is having the eyes get 
tired, damn hard to read the light engraving of the socket size sometimes.
Duluth Trading company ( http://www.duluthtrading.com/ ) sells safety 
glasses with the bottom part being reading glasses of various degrees 
of magnification and at $30 they are affordable.

When I see someone poking fun because their eyes still read well I 
have to smile & wonder if they will remember this when they are at 
the drug store shopping for their first pair of reading glasses.
