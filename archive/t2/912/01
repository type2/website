From what I understand if you take the flywheel and bellhousing with the
1700 it would work. But the gearing would be all wrong. The higher torque in
the 2.0 lets you have taller gears. That means higher speeds in each gear
and easier in-town rowing. Plus, as I said, the effective RPM limit is lower
in the 2.0, requiring the taller gears.

I would swap them as a unit, personally. Then you know "everything" is 78,
and it's easier to remember when things break.
