ASI/Rivieras had 4 different tops.  (1) No top.  (2)
The pop-top which went straight upwards (like on my 78
Plan One), (3) the Penthouse model which was a fixed
upper bubble area, and then (4) the one you are
talking about.  In the sales literature,
http://members.tripod.com/~wetwesties/riviera/ (this
hyperlink will take you to an example), I believe the
pop-top you are speaking of is shown page top, far
right or third picture.  See the early Vanagon with
that real short pop-top?
