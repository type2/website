I've read Richard's FAQ (http://www.ratwell.com/technical/FAQ.html -
4.1)since sending this, and it got me wondering if mating a '78 engine
to the original 002 transmission would be feasible.  I thought this was
a big no-no, but could the flywheel from the 1700 go onto a 2L to allow
a fit?  The FAQ doesn't explicitly say "no don't do that", nor does it
say "do that", so I ask you folks.  Sounds reasonable, but lots of
things sound reasonable right before they sound stupid :)
Thanks in advance--
