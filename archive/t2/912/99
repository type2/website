2007) to reserve spot. Cost for BBB XI Vendor spot is 50 dollars, this
includes entry, a reserved spot to suite your needs close to the stage and
enough room to fit your wares. Last year I ran out of spots for vendors so
decided to pre register for BBB XI.
Vendors who do reserve a spot will more then likely be placed outside the
main show area (the dirt area where non VW swap people are placed).
If you are not camping and are only going to swap in a non VW standerd
weekend entry fee applys . There will be an area set aside for swappers
only, close to the main event area.
VENDOR spaces can be reserved by contacting Ronnie 928 680 7664 or at

VW and as many people you have in it. Price is the same reguardless of

or so.
Pre paid vendors can enter around 6 a.m. (information will be sent along
with your entry pass)

More info and the web site (will be udated soon) will be added as time

The London Bridge Bullis are looking forward to see everyone next year and
