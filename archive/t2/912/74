Subject: Front / Rear cabin dividers?

Hey guys,

    It just occured to me that I noticed some difference between various Bus
bodies that I've seen over the past couple of years. My VW Bus (73) has a
"firewall" of sorts that's fixed directly behind each of the two front seats.
There is a pass-through in the middle between the seats. I had originally
thought that ALL Busses came like this, unless they were pickup truck Busses.
But then I found in the junkyard one day, a Bus (probably a ~71 or earlier)
that had a complete solid firewall that completely blocked the front area from
the rear area. The firewall didn't go any higher up than the tops of the
seats, but there was no pass through. In addition, it had two seperate seats,
it was NOT a bench seat (like you'd normally expect). There was nothing in the
middle.

THEN, just yesterday, I was at the junkyard pulling parts from a 1975
Westfalia, and it had the firewall behind ONLY the drivers seat! There was
nothing behind the passenger seat AT ALL. The passenger seat was still raised
on a platform (on top of the front right wheel), but there was no frame behind
the passenger side seat.


I'm really curious how VW decided what they were going to do, and what models
got what??? It doesn't APPEAR to be anything year specific from what I can
tell...???

Just curious!


Thanks!!

Todd
