YES, typographical error! I meant BENTLEY, not Haynes.
The dummies book is good for the somewhat less
mechanically inclined to understand how it all works.

For major work sometimes the haynes can shed a little
additional light on things after you check Bentley.


<SNIP>Well, I gotta take exception here...  If you are
only going to have ONE
manual, it's Bentley.  Then the idiot book - though
it's less useful for
the later years but a psychic boost...
