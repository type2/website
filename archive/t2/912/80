Subject: Re: [T2] Front / Rear cabin dividers?

Most of the campers in the U.S.  until '75 had the divider on either side 
like your '73. I feel pretty sure that all transporters had the two 
dividers. The trucks had a full width divider with the 3/4 bench as you are 
familiar with.

In some of the early European campers there was a full divider too and some 
of them have made their way to the US. Dave Cochran has one and I wish I 
could remember his website for some pics. They generally had a cool full 
width cabinet with a propane stove directly behind the divider. That is 
probably what you saw and it is pretty rare to find. The European models had 
a trim strip on the bumpers that the US models didn't have...that's the 
quickest way I can think of the distinguish them.

All of the Westy campers from '76 to '79 had only the divider on the 
driver's side so you could use the swivel seat and face the rear cabin. Here 
is a picture of my old bus:

I wonder if maybe the bus you were pulling parts from was maybe a '76 and 
not a '75. Was it a camper? Did it have a full width bed if it was a Westy? 
The '74 and '75 models had a full width bed, but didn't have swivel seats so 
they had the two dividers on either side. If it was a '75 and didn't have 
the passenger side divider it was either hacked up or something I am not 
familiar with.

I had never thought about it before but I wonder if VW actually cut that 
divider off of the passenger bus to incorporate the swivel seat. Has anyone 
ever pulled that rubber off that pedestal to see if it had been cut or 
manufactured that way? Just curious...
