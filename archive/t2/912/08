I, too am irked at the cost of proprietary battery packs versus
individual cells.

Unfortunately, I've never been able to solder tabs to the cell terminals.
They aren't copper, so lead/tin solder doesn't stick.  The factory cells
have the tabs spot-welded on.

There are outfits that will rebuild battery packs but of course they want
to sell you the cells.  Still isn't too costly, though.
