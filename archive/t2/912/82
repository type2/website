Subject: AC Compressor Question

A quick AC question for the list:

Will an AC Compressor out of a '79 bus fit in a '76?  I had the
underdash unit with the Borg-Warner compressor.  It for sale right now
on the Samba and I don;t know the answer.

Thanks for any reply and for all the help in the past!

Camped at a Bluegrass Festival this weekend in the '79 and it ran
really well thanks in part to knowledge from the good minds on the
list.
