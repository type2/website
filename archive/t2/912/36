Subject: Swap tires + rims for bare rims

OK, how's this for a deal!!

I will swap four mounted tires on rims for just four bare (1973 and up)
decent rims.  Or sell for $100 of BO

These tires are very old, but lots of thread and can be used to salvage a
set of decent tires/rims from a bus might be destined for the salvage yards.

I plan to have the rims powder coarted (again???) when I take some bumpers
out to be powder coated (again??)

(Hey, why 1973 and up???  isn't the 1971 and 1972 the same size rims??
Answer - yes, the same SIZE but not the same STYLE.  Go figure....)

I am in Fairfax (Springfield) Virginia
