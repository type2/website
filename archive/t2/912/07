It sounds like putting a 78 eng/trans into a '72 has its complications
(according to Richard's FAQ).  Just doing the 78 engine w/o the tranny
limits the benefits of the swap and would require a 091 bellhousing
anyway.  I wonder how the BusDepot makes a bolt-in 2L for the 72-75
buses.

Thought about it.  I want to stay air-cooled, though.  If I were going
to go water-cooled, I'd probably start hunting for a TDI engine. That
gets us into Raby territory on costs, plus running a radiator
somewhere, and lots of other complications that I really don't want to
get into.

> Or talk to Jake Raby.  
Thought about this too. The $3700/$4500 for an engine (plus more for a
tranny that can handle the torque) is more than I can do.  I'd be
sleeping in bus year-round after that while my wife enjoys the house :)
 These sound like amazing engines though.  Maybe after I hit the
Powerball...

pleased with the power. 
I had a similar set up when I bought this bus (no 009 anymore), and
loaded with camping gear, food/ice, spare parts and a family of four,
the Coast and Cascade mountain passes get white-knucklish :) On the
flats and downhill, the 1700 is fine.  Especially when its just me and
no stuff.

about tossing the Weber for the EFI instead of switching complete
motors...

between '72...
