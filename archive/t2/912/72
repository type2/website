HI Dave,
That is exactly where mine are.   It sounds great unless the bus is full of 
stuff.   People are OK, it is just when I pack heavy for a vacation that I 
can't hear them at all.   The rest of the time it is great.
Peace,
Rob

Once in a while you get shown the light, in the strangest of places if you
