Subject: Stripped Allen Head bolts =(

So, despite my best efforts (Soaking the bolts in pb blaster on the
front and back side, hex bit on a socket) I still managed to strip the
3 allen bolts that holds the fan onto the hub.  I believe they're #10
in this picture:

I'm about to order a sock-it-out set to get these guys out
(http://tinyurl.com/g3pey) but I was wondering if anyone had any other
tips for removing stripped allen bolts.  Any help would be
appreciated.
Thanks
