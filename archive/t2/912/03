I'd be interested to know what you find out.  But if you're  looking for more power over a 1.7L I don't think you're going to find  it in the 2.0.  Or better said, you won't notice it.  I'd be  looking at a Subaru conversion.  Or talk to Jake Raby.  But  then, what do I know.  I run a 1.7L, single Weber, 009 and am  pleased with the power.  Cheers...KR

I've been looking into ways to improve my push up the hills surrounding
Portland, and I was hoping the list had some advice about swapping in a
'78 engine/trans.  Would this be a genuine bolt-in 2L (or 300cc bump)
or are there lots of mismatches in mounting that took place between '72
and '78 that would make this a pita?  I checked the library, and David
Schwartz labeled the '78 the "bastard" (his word, not mine) for some
reason.  I didn't quite follow what he was saying.  Any help on that
would be appreciated.  Anyway, I went so far as to investigate the old
transvair thing, but those kits aren't around much anymore.  
Regardless, if I can keep from driving through the Cascades without my
flashers on with a VW engine, I'd be happy.  This 1700 just don't cut
it.  I'm tired of getting waved at one finger at a time.  All advice
(p-mail too) welcome,
