Not sure if this was a rhetorical question or not but..as a "geek kid"
(Is 24 still a "kid"?) here's a few things my fellow geeks and I do:
1) Linux - A spiffy customizable operating system
2) Overclocking/Watercooling your computer
3) Build robots/battlebots
4) Programming (I don't do this personally but many of my fellow geek
crowd does)

I don't play video games personally, and people who do play them 24/7
aren't really "geeky" imo.
