It was somewhat rhetorical, but you answer is pretty much right on the
money.  I came across a magazine called "Make" http://makezine.com/ that
is kind of like the olde skool Popular Mechanics when folks were
actually expected to build things.  Problem is, this magazine is mondo
expensive (like $10 an issue) so I doubt that it will be very widely read.
