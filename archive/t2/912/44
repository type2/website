LOL---

My Geunine 2.50 Wal Mart Cheater's for 9 bucks a pair work well---and
very disposable.

BUT---when I take a peek at my socket rail cheater's or not, I can still
tell the difference between a 1/2" a 9/16's a 10 mm or a 13mm socket.

Old age is a bitch---it's the black years--not the golden as I've always
heard, but I don't need the number's on my sockets or wrenches in 3-D to
know what they are.  

Funny Stuff---
