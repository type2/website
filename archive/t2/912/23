Use the 210mm clutch & flywheel you've got on the 1700.   I *know*
you've got a near-new clutch in there, so don't worry about replacing
anything .. just swap & go.

I've got a 2L and the 002 gearbox in my '75, though my gearing is
different than the '72.  Still, it's got plenty of juice and no big 
jumps
between gears.  And I spend a good bit of time in the mountains too.
