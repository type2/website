<<Then, tap the wrench clockwise a few times before attempting to remove
the bolt...A mechanic I know swears he gets better results removing old
nuts and bolts by first going clockwise and then counterclockwise>>

Yep--it works every time Anthony.

A impact driver would be the thing to have in this situation.
Give it a blast to the right--then back her off to the left.

Grab the stripped allen bolt with a curved headed vice grips---
Give it a wack tight--then beat the vice grips to the left.
She'll spin off eventually.

Using a flat jawed vice grips will be a bad move in attempting to remove
the bolts--
