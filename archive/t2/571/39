Subject: Temporary move: store vs ship?

I am moving to Australia for two years and can't decide if I want/can
afford to ship my bus or if I should store it here.  Has anyone shipped
a bus between the US (I am in California) and Australia?  I have a free
place to store the bus but I'll have to build/buy a shelter for it.
This bus (1970 westy) is in good shape with little rust, 3 year old
paint job and a strong rebuilt motor.  I really don't want to store it
if sitting for two years is gonna cause major problems.  Additionally,
I'll likely have to buy a car when I'm in Australia... so why not put
this money plus the money for a shelter towards shipping it back a
forth?  Selling it is not really an option.



Thanks for the insight.
