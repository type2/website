Robert,
The dimming headlamps coud indicate a bad ground connection too.
I'd clean them all prior to yanking the starter---

But if the starter was under water--this sounds like it could very well
be the problem too--

Why don't you just for grins take the jumper cables and give the starter
a direct drive connection--
This would sure tell you the story real quick, if the starter is water
logged, and shot----

Good Luck--
