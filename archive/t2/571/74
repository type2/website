Subject: Fuel Line replacement 68' 1600SP

I'm in the process of putting my engine back together, and I need to 
replace the fuel line.  What is the propper line size?  I recall reading 
someone's post stating that it should be 7mm, but according to the Bus 
Depot site that size is for the fuel injected models.  I have a stock 
1600SP (68' Kombi).

If I need something other than 7mm, please let me know who sells the 
correct line.

TIA
