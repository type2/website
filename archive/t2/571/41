rob
each tire has its own charactaristics of load vs pressure.
the max pressure would give you the correct tread on the road only at the
max load (or in the neighborhood)

If you run these tires at max pressure you will find the response very
squirrly and the center of the tires will wear out prematurely. and it
will make driving dangerous.


as an example. ford explorer and firestone. they specified too low a
pressure and boom. bad stuff.
