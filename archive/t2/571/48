Subject: RE: [T2] Continental Vanco-8 tires

So how can we know exactly what PSI to put in our tire or should we go
entirely by the manual. I figured that the tire company would know best, but
they just list a max psi. How does the old owners manual know the type of tire
that we have. I just put Vanco's on my bus this week and the place the mounted
them put them all the way up to 65 psi. What do I need to lower them to?
