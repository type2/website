Hi Rob,

As you increase the tire pressure you decrease the size of the contact 
patch between the tire and the road.

Back when I had car tires on my bus I found I got a much more stable 
ride with 44 PSI in them, but I also immediately noticed a lot more 
road noise. Not enough to be a problem, just a different pitch of sound 
at highway speed.

The change in the size of that contact patch wasn't obvious until the 
first time I fit the brakes in the rain... The high-pressure rubber 
skated across the tarmac almost immediately. It was very scary. Luckily 
no-one got hurt, and I reduced the tire pressure back to stock ASAP.

Here's the deal: A tire at 32PSI with a 1000 lb load on it gives you 
31.25 square inches of contact patch. Pump up the pressure to 40 PSI 
and you are down to only 25 square inches of contact. Are you willing 
to accept 25% less traction in your steering and braking???  I know I'm 
not.  But as they say, your milage may vary.


Happy trails,
