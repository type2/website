Yes you need to lower them.
from my handy wog up to 3/4 load 28/35 full load 28/40

I dont know what year your bus is so check an appropriate manual to see if
yours is slightly different.

the tires are rated to handle our load at an appropriate pressure and
sidewall stiffness for handling.

the place that mounted them is dumb as dirt and should probably be closed
down.
