Subject: Brake Booster Line

I've had a weird thing happen twice in the last week. My brake booster line
is metal from just after it exits the carb to where it goes through the tin.
Just before it goes through the tin there is a 'wye' or 'T' in the metal
line that goes nowhere. This wye is capped with a rubber cap. On two
separate ocassions when starting the bus this cap has blown off the line
creating a huge vacuum leak. Easy enough to find tha cap and put it back on,
but what could cause this. I've driven this bus daily for 44,000+ miles and
never had it happen before. Any ideas?

Oh, yeah: 1974, 1.8 ltr AVP with webber progressive.

Thanks in advance,
Dave
