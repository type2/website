it doesn't. it assumes that you have the stock size, which is usually 
the best choice in most cases.

unless you have a tire size that is waaaay off the stock size (a.k.a. 
BigFoot), then go by the PSI indicated in the owner's manual and/or 
Bentley.

i'm surprised a tire shop would put the pressure so high. don't go back 
there!

just my .02,
