Subject: RE: [T2] exhaust inside the bus

Over the weekend, When cutting up a bus for the scrapper I noticed on this
'71 you could see two "bulges" in the cargo section floor where the rear Y
comes over the rear axel, pin hole rust hear could be an issue,

Also have you "tested" for an exhaust leak??? I always do this by starting
the motor then get "shop rag" and stuff it in the tail pipe. if your motor
keeps running you have a leak!!!!! If your motor dies then your exhaust is
"air tight"... 

Just my thoughts

Good luck
