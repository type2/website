Subject: dash clock

I got a dash clock at Pomona Antique Car Show last weekend. I tested it and
the light comes on however neither the hour nor the minute hand moves. I hope
it can be fixed, the model is a KIENZLE 61 3.71 and the guy who sold it to me
(not for much luckily) said it would fit in dash of a '68 bus. Can anyone
please confirm that?
thanks,
jacopo
