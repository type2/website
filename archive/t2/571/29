Subject: Early Bay Rear Bumper - What year bus??

I saw a rear bumper on an early bay (1968-70) that had a horizontal bumper 
strip.  The bumper strip (rubber) ran about a foot long, and one on each 
side of the bumper.

It looked original and cool.

I could not find the year of the bus; there was nothing on the driver's door 
jam, nor a VIN plate on the dash.  There  is no engine bay lip on these 
early bays, so I could not easily find a VIN number in the engine bay.

Could there be a VIN type plate on the firewall, or the wall behind driver 
seat?

Any idea on the year??  It had round reflectors on the side behind the front 
doors, and the front door handles were the  push button style.  I don't 
remember if it had back up lights.
