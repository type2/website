I don't know how the vacuum assist works on the bus since I have a 68' 
which I believe does not have any assist.  But on my old TR-6 which had 
vacuum assist, if the booster leaked whenever you applied the brakes you 
created a vacuum leak which caused all of the usual engine running problems 
associated with them.  Usually, the car would stall, which is quite 
inconvenient.  Having to re-start the car at every traffic light/stop sign 
is quite a pain and leads to an over-use of the parking brake :-)

Blocking off the vacuum line solves this problem.
