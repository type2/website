If you're buying the stock size, 185R14, the pressure is in the manual, at
least for later baywindows which had this size stock.

If your tires start wearing on the outside edges, go up a couple of
pounds.  If they wear in the middle, go down a couple.  My tires seem to
wear fine at the stock pressures.
