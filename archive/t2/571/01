What's the most likely cause of fuel smell in the cab
after fuel up?

check behind the spare tire holder.. the part of it
that
hangs down in the engine compartment..
the steel vent lines have a rubber hose splice that is
just behind the tire holder.. you can feel along the
metal line and find it... easy to replace.
