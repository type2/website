To be fair, the "ply" was originally a layer of cotton fibers.  A 4-ply
tire was originally four real plies of cotton fibers.  After nylon and
other stronger fibers were introduced it was found that they could do the
same job with fewer plies.  Thus the idea of "ply rating" was born, to
equate tires made with modern materials with the original materials.  Two
plies of nylon can do the job of four plies of cotton.

It's rather silly, though, to worry about all the ply ratings, load range,
and load index numbers when VW has a clearly stated minimum load capacityi
in pounds.  That 1540 pound figure applies to all tires, regardless of
size or construction.
