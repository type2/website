Jonathan,

the manufacturer's suggested tire pressure is based on factors like
load/weight rating, vehicle/suspension design, fuel mileage and as someone
previously mentioned keeping the correct amount of rubber on the road.
there are probably several other factors that engineers have figured in -
ones that the shadetree mechanic types such as myself haven't even
considered.

but of course its your bus.

keep on truckin',
