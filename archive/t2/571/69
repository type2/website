Subject: Re: [T2] Continental Vanco-8 tires

i'd like to know why the list is suggesting that a pressure of 65 psi is
way to high and anyone that inflates tires to that pressure should be
avoided?  i'm running a vanagon with michelin 195/75/14 tires.  i run
them at 60-65 psi and i have logged 10,000 or more miles on them.  i
haven't experienced any negative effects that i know of.  my personal
feeling is that its for the most part its personal ride preference, am i
wrong?  i like my van to drive like a truck not ride like a car so i keep
the pressures up at max inflation.
