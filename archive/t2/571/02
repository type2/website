My exhaust exits from under the bumper just to the left of where your's
does.  It would be right at the point where the left side of the upright
bumper bar thing is, about 2" to the left of the right taillight.  The end
of the pipe is even with the outer edge of the bumper and is probably less
than .25" from the bottom of the bumper.

I'm guessing that this isn't "out in the slipstream"?  I've noticed a slight
exhaust smell at times and was trying to figure out where it was coming
from.
