Well, it looks like I now have something worse than just a little water in the 
crankcase:
After changing the oil the first time, I had t attend a 4-day symposium in 
Little Rock. So I parked the VW on high ground and now, after 4 days, it 
won't start.

The engine can be turned by hand...so it's not water  in the crankcase seizing 
the engine... I charged up the battery all day and re-hooked it up..stll no 
tunover when the key is turned but the lights dim. I jumpstarted it from my 
other car: no turnover.

I cracked out my haynes: when I turn the key to the start condition, the 
lights dim. They dim even when jumpstarting. The double relay clicks in back 
but the solenoid doesn't click. I crawled under the vehicle and tapped the 
starter and solenoid with a hammer. No change.

So, now I've got the passenger rear jacked up and I guess it's time for 
starter/solenoid surgery.  It's like a zillion degrees out and I REALLY don't 
wanna be out there wrenching; Any suggestions  before I commence removing the 
solenoid and starter ?
