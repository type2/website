Subject: RE: [T2] old? charcoal canister

The canister will probably not work if you do not refresh the charcoal. I
needed to do this when I changed the vent lines in the bus. I decided to cut a
hole in the canister and remove all the old charcoal and add new stuff, then
seal the canister. It did not look that pretty when I got done, but it seems
to work very well. With the new vent lines and the new charcoal, I have no
more fuel vapor smells. Try hooking it up and drive around and see if it is
working at all, then cut a hole in it and replace the charcoal. Then drive
around and see  if their is a difference.

I think the Type 2 website has a link to how to remove the charcoal.
