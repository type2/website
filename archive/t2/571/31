Subject: Re: [T2] Continental Vanco-8 tires

These tires were discussed a couple of weeks ago, but to reitterate I also
am raising the cash now to put a set on my 77 Westy hightop.

John Baird has a set on his 77 Westy and loves them. They are a nice looking
tire, with aggressive tread and they are D Load range and pretty affordable.
Even the Continental tire site lists them as "tires for the VW Van".

I thought I knew about tires until the Bridgestone thread started, but I am
rereading those posts and, although the max load weight listed on Tirerack's
site is for 65psi, the tires should have a desirable max load rate for your
bus even when running a lower psi.

This brings up two questions I am still wondering about....I know the bus
lists the tire pressure at around 35 psi and it has been stated that we
should go by the manufacture's suggested pressure and not what a tire can
handle (65 psi max for example), but does that consider the actual tires
they used back then or is that strictly what a bus should be running
regardless of technology and what tire is used? Should I run something like
45 psi with a stiffer tire to make sure it's not underinflated?

Also has anyone tried using the 205 (27" diamater) tires? I believe I had
them on Spiffy a few years ago, but it's been so long I can't remember if I
was running 195's or 205. I do remember the guy telling me that the tires I
ordered were not the stock size, but the Bridgestone's handled great and I
was very happy with them. And although this should be the least important
item...those oversized tires really looked good and helped to make the bus
look more proportionate. I hate the dinky tires on my large bus.
