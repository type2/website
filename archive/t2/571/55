Subject: Long delay in getting the vanco-8 tires.....

I will let the list know how I like my new tires after I drive them for
a while. Which are now going to be Michelin Agilis not Continentals. I
didn't realize how Looonngggg the delay would be for the vanco-8's.....I
was quoted at least Sept. wow I don't want to wait through the summer.
Others may want to know that also.
