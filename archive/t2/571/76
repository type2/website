Subject: Tow Hitch needed for 68' Kombi

I'm looking for a tow hitch to attach to my 68' Kombi.  I need to tow a 
small boat (14' sail boat), as well as the empty trailer from my "big boat".

Recalling the posts about towing capacity of the Type 2, I'll add that each 
of these items weighs less than 500 lbs and will be towed less than 10 
miles/trip across flat prarie roads :-)

TIA.
