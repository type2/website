Subject: Re: [T2] Early Bay Rear Bumper - What year bus??

The rubber strips are a giveaway that the bus is a European spec model. Here
is a brochure from the Neatherlands showing some of the early bays with the
rubber strips:

Also the late bays also had the rubber impact strip as found on the US
Champagne buses.
