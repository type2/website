Subject: Endplay Question

Sorry if this sounds like a repost, it is. I have sent this to the list about 6 different ways, now I am resorting to a different email.

2.0L GEX Croker,  Pulled the flexplate off,front main seal(FIF), three shims. The crankshaft seems to be traveling too much. 2mm - 2.5mm. Is this normal? Will the slack be made up for when everything is reinstalled. 

Thanks,
