Sorry about the way I phrased that question, just frustrated about my email situation.

What I meant to ask was:

Is it normal to have that much travel at the crank "without" the flexplate/flywheel, seal, and shims installed. 2.5mm just seems like so much. I will reinstall the flexplate and the shimms tonight to see if it relieves any of that "travel". Then I'll check the endplay. 

Does the flywheel or flexplate contact, via the shims, something to decrease this travel? Say like the case or main bearing?

Thanks,
