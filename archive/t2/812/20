Subject: Reverse gear only in an Automatic

Hey Y'all,
This is actually a Vanagon question, but I am not on
the Vanagon list, and I bet that the Auto trannys are
are not that different from the bus auto trannies,
sooo....  I have an opportunity to pick up an 87 Auto
tranny Vanagon very cheap ($200), it is supposedly in
good shape and runs EXCEPT that it will only go into 
Reverse gear on the auto tranny.
SO, is it likely that alll four forward gears would go
out on a tranny OR is there a good chance that it is
something minor such as a linkage problem??
I am an air-cooled guy, I and I have no idea what it
takes to pull a water-cooled engine and tranny, so I
don't want to get the bus if that is the likely scenario.

Peace, John Baker
