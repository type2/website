Yeah, what's your point?

;-)

One thing at a time. Interesting thing though... The light doesn't come on
when coming off the freeway or idling or anything, but if I'm maintaining
speed every so often it will come on for a few seconds, then go off. Really
bizarre. RPMs don't seem to matter. I'm monitoring to see if I can find a
pattern. Otherwise it works beautifully.
