The coleman catalytic heaters are weak.  I have a Procat which is
advertised as being 3000BTU.  This translates to 900 watts or about the
output of a mild blow-drier.  At BBB one of these would warm the interior
of my bus after quite a while when it was 50 degrees outside, but I
wouldn't depend upon it for colder climates.  You also have to deal with
the condensation and venting issues.  I wouldn't run one of these while
sleeping.

You'd actually be better off to get a Coleman 2-mantle propane lantern.
It will provide both light and heat, and also makes more heat than the
heater!  Same caution about sleeping, though.

There are stronger propane heater solutions out there such as the Buddy
heater.

Cadillac solution is the Espar Airtronic 2:

which is the modern version of the Eberspacher gas heater used for
heating truck sleepers and boats.  Bring your Visa card, though!  About
$1300!.
