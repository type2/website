Even better than shrink tubing the self soldered connections are the ones I
get from NAPA.  These little babies are great.  They have a bead of solder
in them.  Just make your connection and take a heat gun to them.  The solder
melts and the plastic sleeve melts too as it is its own shrink tube.  I use
these exclusively.
