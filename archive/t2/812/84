Subject: Re: [T2] Westfalia: Baywindow or Vanagon?

Hi Joaquim,

We've had both in the family for quite a while:
http://www.pottsfamily.ca/VW_type2/BBTF0201_small.jpg

The baywindow is smaller (6" narrower) and lighter. The Vanagon is  
larger and has better suspension and steering. Since they are both  
powered by what is basically the same engine the choice (aside from  
looks) comes down to load. If you want to have more interior space,  
go with the vanagon. If you plan to haul more weight, go with the  
baywindow.

I prefer the baywindow personally due to the simplicity of the design.
