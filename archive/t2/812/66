Subject: The Squeek is Silenced - This is really Part 2

Hiya All,

Sorry about that last post - my computer is having an apoplectic fit - me too!

Here's the actual follow-up...............



Well, I did some online scanning for the diagonal arm bushing and I found it 
at three onliners.

Part number 211-501-121

Available at Bus Boys for $3.65
Available at Bus Depot for $12.04
Available at Wolfsburg West for $19.48

Besides the profit motive, does anybody have an idea why there is so much 
difference in the prices?

Mike
