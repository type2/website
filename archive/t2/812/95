Subject: Re: [T2] Westfalia: Baywindow or Vanagon?

hey guys  I can say anything  about a bay as I dont own one  went from splits 
to watercooled vanagons  BUT  I do a lot of work on both  I personally prefer 
the 83-85 vanagons both if you get the early vanagons change the front seats 
to the later stlye  much better  The vanagons go down the road a lot better 
than bays or splits do and are a lot easier on you driving for long times and 
run better at interstate speeds  the watercooled vanagons have the advatage of 
power steering , great heat, AC   the running part  seem to be a lot tougher 
than the bays  .     Bay windows have some certain problem areas that the 
vanagons dont such as the center pivot on the front axle breaking ,  the valve seats 
getting sucked, major oil leakage,  then there is the room difference . If I 
have to drive a long way at interstate speeds then I am taking the 85 westy   
if it isnt real bad of a ride and I can mostly stay off the interstates then I 
take the 66 westy  but to each his own  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
