50-60? I do 70 here in the mountains...

A real pain to work on,but doable.


Eh? I'd rather work on my bus than my Volvo any day!

78 Westys have nearly identical interiors. Pain?

The 83.5 to 85 Vanagon's gained some heat, AC and bumped the highway

AC was available. And with the upgraded compressors available at Bus Depot
they don't suck much power. Yes, "real" heat would be nice, but that can be
achieved in a bay as well. Can't compare FI systems though. I prefer the
Jetronic series to the Digijet series personally, but I doubt there's much
difference performance wise.

1.9's pull pretty hard and long.


Until the coolant pipes rust out or the rat's nest of head gaskets start
leaking...

Not too bad to work on--a bunch easier than the suitcase engine's of the

Still not seeing that...

I could drop a Raby engine in a bay and get the power. As for monster...
Weren't you just saying they were easier to work on than a bay?
And so on...

We could debate this all day, but preferences will remain. Either way we're
talking about decades old vehicles that will require lots of attention
unless they've been meticulously cared for. A bucket Vanagon and a bucket
Bay will both be PITAs until lots of time and money have been invested.
Water or air.

I do love the ride of the Vanagon. And the increased interior space is
awesome. In fact before I bought my S-10 in 97 I seriously condsidered an 88
Vanagon. It was blue and had jumpseats and AC and lots of goodies for $5k.
The dealer sold it before I could get the bank to clear my financing. :(

(BTW: I'm just teasin' ya about the engine work differences. heh)
