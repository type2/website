I'm surprised you don't burn up the shrink tube before the solder melts-
does the solder inside go the length of the tube?  I'm very handy with a 
minitorch and hand-held solder and often have roughed the spade lugs 
with a 12v Dremyl chain saw sharpener and bridge-soldered the lug to the 
wire.

Even better than shrink tubing the self soldered connections are the ones I
  get from NAPA.  These little babies are great.  They have a bead of solder
  in them.  Just make your connection and take a heat gun to them.  The 
solder
  melts and the plastic sleeve melts too as it is its own shrink tube. 
I use
  these exclusively.
