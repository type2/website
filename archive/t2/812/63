Ah, PB Blaster saves the day yet again.  I'm going to do just as you said.  I think that's my problem.  The lock works too good most of the time to have a serious problem now.  It's been a few days since I noticed anything.  But thanks to several list members, when I do have a problem, I know what to do.  Cheers....KR

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
My locks on several 80's-era VWs all have to be lubed annually or they stop 
working during the rigorous Ohio winters.

PB Blaster is fine for cleaning them up initially, but they need a 
lubricant that won't evaporate and which won't harden up at very low temps.

Blast them with the PB product AND operate the levers at the same time. Do 
it till they work easily and then do it a few more times.

Be prepared to wipe off the Blaster as it streams out the drain holes and 
openings between the lock and the door.

I use sewing machine oil delivered the same way, after a blasting. The oil 
stays there all winter, while the Blaster is gone in a short time.

Some locks/door handles are already so damaged internally by rust that they 
must be replaced. Mine failed when a spring that returns the handle to its 
starting position snapped. Others have failed when small cast parts fractured.
