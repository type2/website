Subject: new curtain time

since it's cold and rainy out today i decided i would start on making
some new curtains.  too bad i can't seem to find my tape measure
anywhere!  here's some pics of the new fabric as well as the curtains
that came from the PO.  i've never sewed before.  this should be fun.
