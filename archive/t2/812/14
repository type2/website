Subject: Re: [T2] 1979 Hot Air

From Andy:

The '79 has pipes that carry the hot air that dumps out of the heater
 control boxes when the heat is shut off to the rear of the bus, and they
 look something like exhaust pipes, one for each side (wow! Duals!).
 Anyhow, the pipe is held onto the van with two bolts & nuts into the
 bracket for the mustache bar, and extends up under the van toward the
 heater control but stops about 14" short. Does anyone have any idea what goes between the pipe and the
control? Some kind of flexible tubing? I don't remember taking anything off.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, there is a heavy foil tube that goes between the flapper valve and the pipe. # 39  in this pic, lower

Additionally, I wound up with only two right side pipes. I'm looking for
 a left side one. Anybody got one?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have one.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another perplexion. On the left side, the engine tin doesn't enclose the
 exhaust manifold. The first four pics on http://home.earthlink.net/~airhedz/
illustrate what I'm taking about. Is this supposed to be open?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The more I stare at those pics, the more they don't make sense.
It appears as though you have 1 screw going into the bottom of the head??

That front lower and pushrod tube cover tin appears totally wrong for 79 Cal engines. I know I have that
one-year-only pushrod tin. And I think I still have a complete 79 Cal engine in my driveway. The pushrod tin
looks like 80-83 Cal Vanagon tin but is it not as wide.
