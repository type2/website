Unless you have a $300+ timing light static timing is the way to go. A cheap
timing light will never be accurate. By the time the inductor picks up the
spark from the wire and turns it into a flash of light you loose a degree or
more. I've always timed all my VWs the static way. I have a 74 and a 79 (
both fuel infected... I mean injected, hehe ) that I static time to 7.5
BTDC. I've tried a professional/expensive timing light and found that static
timing them works better. I been doing it this way for the last 10+ years
with absolutely no problems.
