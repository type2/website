Hi Zach,

Look under the dash. There is a thin metal strap that retains the
glove box. It has a set screw at the end that secures it. If it is not
already loose, remove the screw, lower the strap, and slip your
glovebox up, then strap it in.

 Okay so my type2 didn't come with the glovebox.   I bought a new one but
 can't quite figure out how it fits.  Has anyone done this?  Can you give
 me some tips?  Thanks
