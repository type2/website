 Hiya All,
 
 This question is about time......................
 
 I'm looking at adjusting my Baywindow clock (a gray
 face) and on the back of 
 the clock there is a set screw.  OK so far.  But
 above the set screw is a 
 horizontal double headed arrow.  And above the arrow
 there is a + to the left and 
 a - to the right.  
 
 My clock is running slow.  My first impulse would be
 to turn the set screw in 
 a clockwise manner (in other words toward the -) to
 speed it up.  But that - 
 thing is giving me second thoughts.  Any advice out
 there on which way to turn 
 the set screw to speed up the clock?
 
 And does anybody know what the notched increments
 around the set screw are 
 supposed to indicate (if anything?)
 
-------------------------------------------------------

+  speeds it up
-  slows it down

Turn it to the + direction. 

Not a clue as to the notch amounts.

But usually, on the analog clocks, when they run slow
it means the movement is gummy from old oil.
