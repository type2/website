Subject: Hah! It wasn't the carb!

I was driving down the freeway this morning and the engine cut. No lights. I
pull over and find the fat + wire from my relay to the + terminal on my coil
had come loose from the crimp connection.

I jammed it back in to get the rest of the way to work and the idle is
smoother, more power, and no cut at high rpms. The (-at-)#%$%^^ thing must have
been barely making contact!

Yay!

Back to my original plans for the weekend now!
