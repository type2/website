Subject: The Squeek is Silenced

Hiya All,

I posted a few days ago concerning a squeek coming from the rear of the Bus 
that was driving me crazy.  Problem was it was just impossible to locate 
precisely.  Thanks to all who made suggestions - I tried them all.  And, using those 
suggestions and a lot of trial and error I found the offending area.  It was 
the top mount of the driver's side rear shock.  Really incredible because to 
everybody who had listened to the squeek it sounded as if it actually came from 
within the passenger cabin.

I tightned up the upper shock bolt and lubed it with silicone - I'm good to 
go.  But in looking around down there I have another question for all you 
suspension experts............

I thought the condition of my diagonal arm bushings was a little marginal.  I 
went on over to my FLAPS and was told that they could not get the diagonal 
arm bushings for a 1970 Bus.  Are these available anywhere?  I'll get out there 
and scan the onliners - but I thought I'd ask here first.
