if it is the 010 tranny which was used on many but not all vanagons I
think

if no drive in aall forward gears it could be

. 1st gear one way clutch not holding,  ($$$$$$)
. forward clutch plates worn/not holding ($$$$$)
. forward clutch diaphram spring broke  ($$$$$)
. forward clutch piston seal damaged ($$$$$)
. forward planetary gears damaaged ($$$$$)


in other words no cheap fix, unless the shift linkage is completely broken
I doubt if you will get out of it without at least a tranny swap
