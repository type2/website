Subject: IM "invite" unintentional> DONT respond...

Am *COMPLETELY* sorry for any potential spam invite to any instant messaging
groups.

I responded to an invite sent by my young nephew. Next thing that I knew - I
had
"invited" everyone in my email book.

VERY sorry as I have been intentionally been attempting a low profile.

DONT link up to or join this service. I am bailing asap.
