C13-4023 - EMPI BRAND - SELF TAPPING 10MM CYLINDER
HEAD REPLACEMENT STUD - 8 INCH (204MM) LONG
 Our Price: US $5.95  
Stock Status: In Stock 
Product Code: C13-4023  This is what I found at CIP1 
http://www.cip1.com/   look up "studs" under the type
of VW that you have and it should pull them up to look
at. You don't have to take anything apart to replace
the bottom ones of course on the top ones you have to
pull the tin, I would recommend pulling the tin and
torquing all of them at once. Phil
