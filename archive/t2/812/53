Don,

See my yearly "electrical rant" in the archives<big grin>.

Quit doing the hit and miss and set aside a whole day to
refurb the electrical system.

You will love it....and your 30+ year old electrical system will love you 
for it.

Don't forget to examine each and every one of those spade lug terminals as 
they like to corrode and break at the back of the spade 
connector....oh...and don't buy the chinese spade lugs.

Even better are the totally insulated ones from the local Lowe's type home 
store...pick up shrink tubing to go with them and you probably won't have 
to touch them again in your lifetime!

Cheers, dave
