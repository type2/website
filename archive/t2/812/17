Don,

Bite the bullet and go buy a gallon pail of "real" carb cleaner.

Gunk brandname I think....the stuff that stinks to high heaven and gets 
carb parts **really** clean.....the bucket in the gallon container is so 
that you can imerse the whole thing....and if you don't have compressed 
air, then just use a fresh can of wd40...

*Read* the instructions....you wash it off with water!....*outside*!!

Cheers, dave
