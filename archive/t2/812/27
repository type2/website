Subject: engine stand

In the library is a picture of Dale Meuller's engine stand.  Who can tell me
how to get the bell housing separated from the transmission body to create a
stand like this?

Maybe someone has a better "mousetrap", I envision getting an engine stand
from HFreight, and mounting the bell housing to the stand .....  Comments,
Concerns, Insults or Snide remarks?

Make it a Great Day!!
