Subject: Re: Hey Phil whats a "Super Stud" was - Engine\Power loss

John, It is a self tapping stud and you don't have to
take anything but the bad stud out, and screw the
super stud into place and torque it down. I may not be
using the correct terminology, but this is what we
here in the south call them. It is a self tapping stud
with the correct threads on one end and a larger self
tapper on the other end, now we just need to find
them, I have a few here which stud is bad? Top
outside, top inner, or bottom.. Phil
