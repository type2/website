http://www.bulkpart.com/ Here is where to get the
parts for your transmission, for me it's a no brainer;
rebuild the tranny. there is a problem with that
though, I build transmissions often; a big advantage
over you, but you can do it, just use the book, and
take your time. It requires no special tools, just a
little common sense, which all of us are missing most
of the time.This is the cost of the kit             # 
 65006BA 
Master kit, 087 AUDI 5000 1983-UP with diffrential
seals
Includes: overhaul kit, friction clutch plates &
standard steel plates...More info-> 

  $131.70    I don't consider that too expensive. Or
you could find a AUDI, in the Pick & Pull, and use one
of those used ones at a reduced price. Phil (bear)
