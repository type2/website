 So I have a garage, but my driveway points down at an angle to the garage
doors. Will this make any difference to the adjusting I do? For some reason,
it's 5:30 and my brain is shutting down. ???

the ones I see are 1000's of dollars!!

I remember them, but I never had one.  I just point the car down the
street, adjust the beams to where they look good, take a walk 100 yards or
so down the block, squat down to driver's eye height, and make sure that
the beam isn't glaring.

There are also ways to adjust them on a wall.  IIRC, some of these methods
are covered in the service manuals.
