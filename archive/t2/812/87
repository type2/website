Subject: Re: [T2] Westfalia: Baywindow or Vanagon?

I've been in both and it's a toss up. I own an air cooled Vanagon and  driven 
hundreds of both. The Vanagon might be better in finding used parts. The  
parts are similar on all Vanagons and they are found more often. The bays are  
are the same in parts for Bays but, they are harder to find parts in good shape. 
 Alot of the parts are as beat as the ones you might need. The Vanagon lacks 
that  "cool" factor. That is one of the reasons they aren't as popular. 
Overall which  ever one you get you will enjoy it more than you could ever imagine. 
Take your  time and find a good one. There are alot of bad ones out there. 
Please if at all  possible do not believe what the seller tells you. Take it to a 
VW shop and have  them look at it. Spending that $50-$100 on a prebuy is 
worth more than anything.  Better to lose that little money up front then to lose 
hundreds or thousands  later.
