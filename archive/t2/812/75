#1: I didn't know you could static time with that kind of accuracy!
#2: What work was done at the shop? Points replaced? Adjusted? Something
similar? The reason I asked is if they replaced the points, they may have
forgotten to retime after installation and that would cause a discrepancy
between before and after.
