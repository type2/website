Subject: Re: [T2] engine stand

Frank, the stand is great, the only problem that I
have with them is once the engine is built, I can't
set the engine from the stand to the floor, to heavy
and I'm too old to do it anymore. I use short tables
that sit close to the floor so I can get a jack under
the engine to put it in the bus/van. The start housing
is mobil, it will fit to the engine anywhere sitting
on the floor or table. Phil (older than dirt)
