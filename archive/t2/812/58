Hi Courtenay:
I'm in Victoria and have been meaning to email you cuz
I'm up your way often working with the Globe and Mail.
 I got my Propane Buddy last year in the US but they
are now available at London Drugs.  They were on sale
there a few weeks ago for around $89.00 now I think
they are over $100.  I won't use it at night while I
sleep just because I'm not convinced its safe while
sleeping but it lights up quickly and works very well.
 

I use my little electric heater at campgrounds with
plug ins but carry the Buddy during the winter in case
I get stuck somewhere without power.  

I drive a beige 79 with a mural  of the ocean and
lighthouse on the side.  I was up in Courtenay/Comox a
couple of weeks ago staying at Bates Beach - my fave
up there and wondered if it was you every time I saw a
westy.

Would love to get a campout going on the island here
as heading across the border is a bit much for me with
all the island traveling I do.

Cheers,
Connie
