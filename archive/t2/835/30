It may be that he's upset that the hubcaps being offered are not going to 
last.  It comes from experience with offerings of the past from BD on these 
caps.

I also bought the genuine VW caps back about 6 years ago from BD.  As I 
recall, the catalog claimed these would last and not rust like the cheaper 
ones, so I spent the extra bucks and bought a set.  They looked great, the 
backs were painted gray, but within 6 months the chrome began to split and 
rust glazed over the surface.  Money not well spent.  If these caps being 
offered as genuine VW are the same as in the past, save your money.  I then 
bought a set of the cheaper reproductions, coated them with a clear coat, 
and they show no signs of rusting after over a year.

If it isn't made in the US anything goes, like the "Genuine 
made in
Germany, China", caps that the BD purveys---

They are garbage , no better than the low dollar units, and do 
 rust just
as fast
