 Sorry, I just can't resist on the olive oil thing.  I was in Italy a  while back and learned that the Italians consume much more olive oil  than they can produce.  Most of the Italian olive oil is actually grown  in Spain, imported to Italy in bulk, bottled and exported as Italian  olive oil.  So just buy the cheaper Spanish stuff and you'll get the  same thing.  
    
   Ok, bus content:  A shop dented one of my  hubcaps yesterday.  That ticked me off.  I'm going to try to straighten  it out.  It's original and the finish still looks pretty good on all  four.  So I may not be buying any Mexi's after all.  Cheers...KR
  
  
I just had an education from Steve Dolan on Italian olive oil, where the 
olives are brought into Italy and processed there.  Not GROWN in Italy.

If   the box says 'Made in Germany' it could mean that just the box is made in 
Germany.  (If it says 'Made in West Germany', this could be some NOS stuff 
that was packagged before the lawyers got into the picture..)

Which hubcaps are German made and non-German made can be diistinguished by:

    The German hubcaps extraction holes will always be 'open', where you can 
slip that liittle 'U' clip through the two holes to pull the hubcaps.  The 
non-German ones usually cover the holes very slightly so the extraction clip 
will not fit. This is a visual assessment.

    The German hubcaps have a sharply raised VW, very noticeable to the 
touch and also visual; the non-German hubcaps have not such a sharp 
definition, and the difference can be seen and felt.
