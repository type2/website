Subject: Rod bolts hitting

Got a motor that someone put together and the rod bolts hit the case.  Case 
is AS41 Mexico, I'm guessing a universal replacement case, no number on 
pedestal mount, on top of case, ect.  Hole in right case half front flange 
for timing mark, block off plate for oil fill.  Pistons and cylinders and 
heads 1600 (85.5mm).  Haven't split the case yet, but have pulled the 
cylinders and the rods are 1600 self-centering and the crankshaft is not 
counterweighted and the flywheel is a 4 dowel, leading me to believe it is a 
stock crank.  I;ll have it apart tomorrow but would like to know what I 
should be looking for as to what needs to be changed.
