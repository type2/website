And now the other fun information.

Weber 40's -- no balance tube between them

No manifold vacuum port ever drilled on the intakes so no booster hose
hooked up

Mallory Unilite Opto-electronic (built in, not an added module like
Pertronics) distributor so no points to adjust

That's what has me stumped about the no idle problem. Seems to run OK at
speed.
