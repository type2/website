Hello again all

Just wanted to let you guys know that i did a
compression check on my THING engine and it came back
1=145 2=155 3=140 and 4=135, which i thought was good.
I readjusted the valves, reset the timing and adjusted
the carb a little more........runs great now......i
think that when i was adjusting the valves i turned
the engine the wrong way while adjusting.......how
embarrassing, but i appreciate everyones help.
THANKS
