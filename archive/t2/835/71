Subject: Re: [T2] Re: HELP with pinging

I brought it home on an 009 because it wouldn't start with the
original distributor. Had light pinging with the 009, so I installed
an early Mallory. That's the one I've been working with the most. The
16 to 40 thing didn't work out. It was better at 14 to 38, but still
not good enough to put back in service. I have another dizzy from a
Porsche 914 I will try next.
