Subject: Re: [T2] Re: HELP with pinging

Have been experimenting with timing. Retarding seemed to make it
worse. I am nearly ping free now with an advance range of 14 BTDC to
38 BTDC. Tonight I adjusted to 16 to 40, so I will see if that helps.
I started out at 6 to 30, tried 3 to 27, even tried some ATDC. So lets
see where that gets me.

I might look into valves again. Compression is now much lower than
when I first installed the engine a little while ago. I've adjusted
twice. I am afraid #1 intake is dropping or strechting as the valve
touches the adjuster inside the rocker arm, so it is difficult to
adjust accurately. When I had the head off, I didn't notice anything
wrong with the valve or seat though.

Thanks for the suggestions.

 if regular high octane gas isn't enough it isn't the compression or octane
 that is your problem.

 check you have the timing right
 check your valves
 check your spark plug wires
 check you points
 check your distributor cap
