Uncanny timing for this thread!  Coincidentally, I happen to have 5 sets of
OEM German chrome hubcaps on their way to me from Germany as I write this.
In fact they are in a container that left for the steamship company this
morning.  Unfortunately, 5 sets is all I could get from the German supplier.
I was told I _might_ be able to get more sometime this summer, but it's
uncertain.

The listmember price is $179.95 per set of 4 - which works out to $44.99
each.

While they are not advertised on the website yet, I have created an order
link for any list member who wants to reserve a set.  You will not be billed
until they come in (around 30 days from now). When they come in, your credit
card will be charged automatically and they will be shipped. Once all 5 sets
are spoken for I will take down the link.
