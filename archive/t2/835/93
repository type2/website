Subject: Re: [T2] front door handle

Darren Evans-Young asked,
"Here's my question, can I buy a new door handle and remove the 
new lock cylinder from it and put in my old lock cylinder so 
that my original key will work? I can't see why this wouldn't
work, but I thought I would ask in case there is some reason it 
won't work.  Thanks."

Darren, the problem I had, and probably others have had as well, 
is that most of the after-market front door handles are mexican 
made replacements that require a different lock cylinder.  I 
have two separate keys now, one for the two front doors and one 
original for everything else.  I hope you fare better than I did.
