Subject: front door handle

Dang! My drivers front door handle died. I took it off today to see what
was wrong. The part that pivots towards the inside of the bus that
releases the door latch broke.  Here's my question, can I buy a new door
handle and remove the new lock cylinder from it and put in my old lock
cylinder so that my original key will work? I can't see why this wouldn't
work, but I thought I would ask in case there is some reason it won't
work.  Thanks.
