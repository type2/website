Guys,

Gotta be insulation and noise abatement.  Left my old stuff out so as to 
replace it with thicker after the restore.

Oh, and I missed the point that someone had 1" insulation instead of the 
1/4 stuff....1" has gotta be really nice!


Haven't put anything back in yet and I swear in 15 degree weather it sucks 
heat out that way faster than you can believe...even with a killer heater.

You can almost feel it radiating cold *thru* the kick panels and when a 
Texas sized grasshopper hits the metal down there it makes an awfull 
sound.

I have more styrofoam now, really, really need to get working on my bus 
"list".

Cheers, dave
