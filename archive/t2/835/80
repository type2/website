Subject: RE: [T2] Dip stick boot I found a easy way

Another method is to just throw the boot in boiling water for a minute or 
so.  It makes the rubber nice and pliable, and then installation is a snap.  
Takes more time watching the boot get soft in the water than it does to 
actually put it on. :)   FWIW, I generally do the engine side first.

I've done it this way a few times and don't have any leaks there either.
