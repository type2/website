Subject: flanging tool and automotive adhesives for rocker panels

So my rocker panels will be going on this summer, and I'm wondering who has used a flanging tool to replace the rockers panels, then used the new adhesives from 3M etc to attach them? I'd be interested in chatting with them about it. It seems like a good way to go, as some of the sites I've been visiting are showing excellent results with the new adhesives and a minimal amount of spot welds.
