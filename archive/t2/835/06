    Sorry to say I don't think the Harbor Freight vacuum  pump will help
you. It is "driven" by compressed air, and takes a large volume of air at
that! If you read the description it has "no moving parts". I have one and
it works by way of air moving across a venturi causing a vacuum. Not to
mention it makes a very loud hissing noise!
    How about a Rabbit or other VW Diesel vacuum pump? They are driven by
the intermediate shaft in the block. So it would take some "red neck"
rigging, mount, drive, etc. But there plentiful and cheap, and make the
right amount/volume of vacuum for power brakes as that is there main
function on a Rabbit.
