Subject: Re: [T2] OEM hub caps

Semanticism:

Connotation and denotation are two oft-used terms in linguistics.
OEM, which is rarely spelled out, is well understood by its
denotation in our volklore to mean "as originally provided from VW".

Also, is OEM actually defined in the Oxford or something?
Suppose I defined it personally as "Original Equipment Manufacture"?
