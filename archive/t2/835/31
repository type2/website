<<<It may be that he's upset that the hubcaps being offered are not
going to last. It comes from experience with offerings of the past from
BD on these caps.>> 

<< so I spent the extra bucks and bought a set. They looked great, the
backs were painted gray, but within 6 months the chrome began to split
and rust glazed over the surface. Money not well spent. If these caps
being offered as genuine VW are the same as in the past, save your
money.>>

Absolutely right on the money with your description of what happened
Brad---

And not to just you and me.

Quite a few other Bus and Vanagon folks were duped by the "Genuine"
offering.

And just as the "Genuine" chrome bumpers I bought from the BD---they
went to hell in a handbasket real quick.

After the fact's--it was casually mentioned to me that he has no idea
where the caps came from--

I did--
I found a forgotten to be removed "Made In China" sticker on the back
side of one of the " Genuine" hub caps---on the painted back side.

The bumper's I was told came from Germany alright---but they were
actually (maybe) made and plated in Italy, and (maybe) of poorer
quality.

( it took maybe 6 months to show a real nice rusty red patina)

Ya gotta pay attention to the catch phase--Direct from--or just from.

It might be sent from there--but what was the product's real point if
origin?

Who know's----???

Live and learn---
