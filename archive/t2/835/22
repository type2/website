Subject: noise problem

Hey, guys.  Thanks for all of the responses  on my noise problem.   Solution turned out to be one I had  suspected.  Right rear axle.   I didn't have time to do it  myself so it cost me $140 at Lockhart VW.   Luckily, they  could get me right in.
  
  Also, I greased the zerks while it was up on the rack. Now it is  eerily quiet!  Next time I'll do it myself but it's nice that they  allow me to stand under the bus and watch them.  Most places won't  do that anymore.   
  
  Now I'm going to need balljoints.  Mine are almost gone.  Any  suggestions?  I'm sure I can't press them out myself.  I was  hoping to find some unsuspecting place like Pep Boys with a $29 any  ball joint installed deal.  I took my Saab there for a deal like  that on shocks and it took them all day!  But I saved a  bundle.  Jim Lockhart says it'll cost over $400 for them to do  it.  Probably not unreasonable but I'm a little on the broke side  right now.  Thanks again and cheers...KR
