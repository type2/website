Subject: RE: [T2] Dip stick boot I found a easy way

Or you can use a hand-held hair dryer to make the rubber pliable. Also works
for alternator boot.

Another method is to just throw the boot in boiling water for a minute or
so.  It makes the rubber nice and pliable, and then installation is a snap.
Takes more time watching the boot get soft in the water than it does to
actually put it on. :)   FWIW, I generally do the engine side first.

I've done it this way a few times and don't have any leaks there either.

>Then I tried to stretch the ends with sockets IT WORKED. You
have to be quick it doesn't take long before the rubber shrinks back to
original size.
