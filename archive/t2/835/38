Subject: Smog Check - Passed!

Passed California Smog II almost a year ago.

Now in Tennessee getting registered.

Stats:

76 bus w/ 79 CAL setup.

TEST  #/Allowed

HC    56/500ppm
CO    0.00/%5
CO2   10.94/No limit

The tester had me put my foot on the gas a little, I guess it was idling
too low for the meter.
He said, "It's your lucky day, you pass because you followed directions!"
