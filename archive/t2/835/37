You probably have a couple of the ones detailed in this article:
<http://www.type34.org/article.php?story=20030316134838162&query=hubcaps>
They are correct for '66 & '67 Type 3s and '67 Type 1 Ghias (with 4 lug
wheels and disc brakes). They are heavier than the '68 & later ones and,
in my opinion, better looking.
