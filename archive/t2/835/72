Terry K bashes me periodically, and it has little to do with hubcaps. It has
more to do with the fact that he's pissed off that I'm selling a German set
of Vanagon coolant pipes that competes with a set that he makes. In fact, he
sent me a "This is war" email a while ago telling me so. So every month or
so he repeats the same personal attacks on me on one VW list or another.

I will not allow myself to be be dragged into a pissing contest, now or in
the future. Please do not misconstrue my tendancy to ignore such attacks and
take the higher ground as an agreement with any claims that are made. That
includes the attack that will undoubtedly ensue as a response to this post,
in an attempt to further provoke me and get in the last word. (Just wait,
it's coming. :-)

I feel confident standing on my reputation here on the list (to which I have
been a contributor since its inception). Most of you are also my customers,
so you know firsthand the quality of what I sell. You know how far I go to
find quality parts for our old Busses. If anyone has any questions or
concerns about the quality of any Bus Depot product (or anything regarding
the Bus Depot), please never hesitate to email me directly. I am always open
to feedback, good or bad, and am always concerned about taking care of my
customers.

Witrh regard to the hubcaps, the ones I have coming from Germany are NOT the
Hella's that I had six years ago. Those were very inexpensive ($15 each;
hardly more than the price of aftermarket ones), and while they were
definitely Hella, I never represented them as being German made, as Hella
themselves had not made that claim to me. (Hella has factories in many
countries. However, despite Terry's allegation, Taiwan is not one of them. I
confirmed this with Hella myself, years ago when Terry first made that
claim. He has been repeating it for that long!)  I sold a ton of those Hella
hubcaps when they were available, and generally got no complaints. Maybe 3
or 4 out of hundreds sold. (Terry K was one of them ... although in all of
the times he's been rehashing this, he has never once mentioned that when he
needed a set of coolant hoses some time later, I took the full price he paid
for the hubcaps off the price of his hoses.)  The set I used myself held up
relatively well (a couple of years, which I thought was fair enough for $15
each and an East Coast climate). I don't know why an isolated set here and
there seemed to fare worse than others. In any event, Hella didn't offer
those hubcaps for very long, so they've been a "non-issue" since the 1990's.


The ones I am getting now are German, and come to me from a supplier in
Germany who is personal friends with some of the Volkswagen "movers and
shakers" from the 70's and 80's. He says these come from the OE supplier to
VW/Germany. He is in a position to know; he knows more about what VW has
gotten from where over the years than I will ever know. I never cease to be
amazed at some of the tidbits I learn from him during our conversations!  I
have dealt with him for years and so far he has never steered me wrong. Of
course there could always be a first time, but it would really surprise me.
So while I have not tried these particular hub caps personally, I do trust
the source.  Now you know exactly as much about them as I do.
