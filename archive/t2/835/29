Why is it that nearly every thread turns into a personal attack 
on Ron Salmon and Bus Depot?  I'm sure that nearly everyone on 
this list knows that you will get what you pay for with ANY VW 
parts retailer.  If you by a thirteen dollar hubcap rather than 
a fifty dollar hubcap you can expect something one-fourth as 
good.

I don't know Ron Salmon personally but I have received good 
parts and good service from his company.  I also appreciate his 
comments and input on this list.  I am also impressed that he 
has the graciousness NOT to comment on the personal attacks.  We 
have been through this all before but I wish to say it 
again...let's keep this list clean and valuable to all and stop 
airing our dirty laundry. 

Thanks, Jeff
