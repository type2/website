Subject: To-Do List for this Weekend

I had planned on taking my time and really fixing up the engine compartment
of the GWB.

But the Volvo flunked its smog check due to being "unsafe". They heard a
rattle under the car during the smog check. Bleh. So I need to get the bus
on the road with current plates NOW.

I believe the problem I was having is a massive vacuum leak. Yet another
intake stud boss stripped out.

I'm pulling the heads. Having a shop remove those bastard exhaust studs.
Helicoil the intake that's stripped. Inspect all the stud bosses thoroughly.
Re-ring the pistons. Hone the cylinders. Reassemble. (All without dropping
the engine. There's no room in my garage at the moment. I need a week just
to shuffle stuff around so I could get in there.) Give up in the Empi
muffler and put the 411 car muffler back on.

Take it for smog Monday.

Think I'll make it?
