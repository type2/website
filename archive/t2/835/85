Good morning all.

Took the Rivi for a 700 mile pre-BBB test drive.

But...

I made it home. And after 700 mile the bus now won't idle at all. 

Ideas to check?

Jake Raby 2L with dual Weber 40's and a Mallory Unilite  distributor.

Going to try to see if a gentleman in Houston will be able to look at it on
my way out Monday. 

If not then I'll try to keep it happy by puttering along to AZ at 50 mph if
I have to and just drive longer days. If I get worried I'll drop back down
to the interstate and travel that way. Got some REALLY long stretches of
nothing in west Texas even on I-10 though. I'll be packing 15 gallons of
fuel to extend my range in case of an "oops".

 I'll be going out through Houston if Marcelo can look at it then North to
190. I'll be taking 190 through Texas until it dumps me on I-10 just before
Fort Stockton. Then NW out of Fort Stockton on other state highways and
back roads. I'll skip the Houston part if I'm on my own and start where 190
meets 69 about 30 miles north of me.

Doesn't show the Houston part of the trip because I generated it before I
decided to do that. Couldn't get it to zoom in close enough to show highway
numbers with the "create html" option of Streets and Trips or make it
generate multiple small maps with closer zoom -- yuck. I may install my
Delorme software and see what I can do with it.
