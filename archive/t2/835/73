Thanks for the link.  It was most helpful.
it looks like we have 2 x Bug hubcaps & 2 x type 3 caps??  if I
read the article correctly.
Anyway will have a site up shortly as I want to list a collection of
photos of the bus as we are having it resprayed as i write.
The colours will be cream on top with a blue below.  The painter has
taken the liberty of spraying the gas bottle door cream ( as most  
campers
seem to have here in Australia) & also the front cold air intake to  
"break"
blue a little.
He is also painting the bullbar cream plus the bumper bars with new  
paint
for the wheel rims.
hope to show it off soon!!!
