John, the Michigan show is in its 19th year.  They
have aout 15 years on you! I have been there since the
very first one held in VWOA Headquarters parking lot
on Big Beaver Road, LOL.  It has always been the same
weekend. It is kind of an unwritten courtesy VW clubs
and shows have as not to conflict with each other.
Each have their weekends and it has worked well for
past 20 years!

I hope you understand this is not a pissing contest.  
Myself I am a laid back guy, everyone is free to do
what you want. The Michigan show is the VW Classic of
the mid west, there is no competing with it anyhow.
Have it the same day a MI if that is such a big deal
to you, it does not matter to me nor the 2,000+ people
at the Michigan show. 
 
I just think if you planned it a weekend that was open
for all us VW people you would be stunned and suprised
at the huge numbers of VW people that would turn out
to your camp out! I gurantee you are missing out on
tons and tons of people. Ever been to the Kelly's
Island Camp out, it is huge now..I gurantee all of
those folks would be there too! The extra plus is then
you could check out the Michigan VW show weekend too!
It is stunning and best VW weekend in the midwest.  

You know, now I recall now you sending me or the
Toledo club an email the very first time you had your
Cinci gtg. I think I discussed the same thing with you
then.  I recall I got the exact same reply, LOL!

Hey Terrible Ted from Michigan, how many cars did they
have last year that weekend, do you know?
