Subject: scary moment for me thrusday

So i decided to take my bus out and drive it around
for the day on Thrusday. It was such a beautiful day
on thrusday so while i was running around town doing
errands driving on the highway. As i was driving home
on the secondary roads i heard a sound like metal
vibrating around the rear and i have a bad gut feeling
which i really didn't like since i just got a new
engine with less then 300 miles on her. So i heard
that sound ever time i took my foot off the gas petal
and at a idle at the traffic light. Luckly i made it
into a auto parts store parking lot. At that time i
called my mechanic i explained to him the symtoms. At
that time he said don't drive it get it down to me. So
i called aaa thank god for aaa plus after waiting 2
hours the driver pulled up in a flatbed with in 8
minutes i swear he had the vechile on and he was gone.
I called my mechanic at 3pm today and i said nervously
did you find the problem he says to me hes 100% sure
it was the altinator he believes a bearing got loose
and thats what was making the sound oh boy did a
weight get off my chest. He goes to say thats proably
why your 2 batteries were not charging. He told me he
was installing a good used one for me and he is going
to keep it in the garage this weekend and i will be
able to pick her up on monday so had to share my scary
story if anyone has any imput i would love to hear it
thanks to all who have helped me and gave me great
adivce i couldn't have done it without this list
