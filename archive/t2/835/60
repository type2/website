          Don wished you lived closer than other side of staTES i would surely let you do mine for me....LOL.. it always gives me a fit.... but its nice when i get both sides on there without ripping the boot...
   
  you knwo they make two diffrrent kinds ..
  one doesnt have to be changed as much but i can tel you this i dont want to even try to put it on....
   
  the other one is lot more flexible and is what i mostly find for sale..... it needs replacing more often from wear and tear....
  and when it goes out and gets a crack or hole what a mess that can make...
  peace
