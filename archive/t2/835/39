Subject: Head Part number

Hi,

I ordered from a bus supplier part number 043101355CK "	Cylinder Head
Brand New, stock 1600cc Dual-Port"

What I received was a head with the following part number stamped on
it: 025101375CK, its also got "AMC" cast into it, it also looks
rebuild..

This head doesn't look anything like the picture on their website.
There's no fins for one thing. Also, its got extra ports on it and
what appears to be the output for some kind of rubber hose. Is this a
water cooled head perhaps?

I'm about 10 miles from my bus so I can't run outside right now and
visually compare the parts.

From the previous description can anyone confirm for me that this is
indeed the wrong part? The supplier wants me to ship this part back
before they resend the correct part - because they want to confirm
they sent me the wrong part first - I think that's just outrageous.

What do you think?

Thanks
peace
