Subject: Complete, Working BN-6 Heater for Sale

Okay List Folk, with winter on the way, I offer up this trinket: One fully 
functional BN-6 Gas Heater out of my ' 78 Westy<soon to be Corvair Corsa 
180hp Turbo Powered project/platform bus> Includes everything, wiring 
harness, triple relay, dash timer, all duct work, distribution chamber with 
over-temp switch, etc. This heater worked wonderfully up to five hours ago 
when it was removed. We live in the warmer climes, and don't need the 
incredible BTU output of the BN-6, as if the temps in these parts ever got 
below 50deg, the AARP would petition to have a restraining order put on the 
Weather. I'm looking for 400.00 OBO + shipping from So. FLA. I'll keep it off 
Ebay for a week or so.
