I have been gradually researching the possibility of fitting power assisted 
steering to the 1968~79 VW Type 2, on behalf of a fellow member (owns a 1973 
VW 1600 Type 2 Westfalia Continental, like mine) of the British VW Type 2 
Owners' Club, who had a heart triple-bypass operation sometime ago.

During next week, I will try to dig out the details that I have collected so 
far. If there is time, I will post details, when I next use the public 
library Internet terminal.
 
From what I recall, you would need to modify the drag link of the existing 
steering (attaches to drop-arm from the steering box) and incorporate a the 
power steering component; details of which, I have in my files.
 
The thing which is delaying my progress, is that of identifying suitable 
donor vehicles. It is rumoured that one or more of the older BMW models, 
might feature the necessary components!

Regards.
