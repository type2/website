Tom Conner in Deer Park (?), WA. Spokane area, IIRC.  Check the
archives.  It's there.

He's right, those are some very nice handmade racks, and I'm certain they'd
last a lifetime. However, the original post metioned a financial need as
well. Isn't there anywhere you can get these type of things for less than
300-400 dollars?

I guess make one yourself!
