Subject: RE: [T2] New to list / help with windshield wipers

Just following up on this topic from last week.  I talked with
Joe at bustedbus.com.  I can convert to the more common wiper
setup by swapping out the 68 wiper shaft for the shaft kit from
a newer (69-72) model.  Then I can mount the new arms, etc.  
Next, I'll get to figure out what's up with the motor, wiring,
etc.  

With 4-6" of snow hitting my area tonight, my next project
will have to be getting the heating system working.  Looks
pretty straightforward, just need to order more parts....

Thanks for everyone's help on the wiper arms...
Brad Baker
