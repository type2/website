Subject: Status of me 

Hiya, Folks, Surgery went ok ,(doc's opinion, not mine)ended up have to do a
small amout of work on left side as well as alot on right side( felt like he
was digging for gold or something ), anyhow went back yesterday for cking
and removing the packing (not fun either). Doc laid me up completely till a
week from next monday, then possiblity of letting me do small part stuff /
resparator(sp). I'll be working on the webpages to post this weekend
sometime and should be avalible for calls most of the time hopefully more
info and he'll cut my down time when i see him next monday afternoon. (thats
my hope anyway).
 I have recieved several calls and e-mails thanks for the concern to the
people for that. NOTE , this was a bit scarey for me due to the fact i lost
my mother to lukemia in 84 so the reassurment really helped , thanks alot..
Thom send those parts pics and i can figure on those while i on vacation.
( and good pain killers ) grin ,,later ya'll
