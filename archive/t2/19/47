Subject: engine out, time to replace seal!

Well after dinner I invited my 2 biggest friends over to pull the engine 
out, only a couple of snags, and a lot of rusty bolts. Turned out to be a 
little tougher than that bug engine I pulled this summer, and somewhat 
heavier (thats what the big guys were for). So tomorrow I will install the 
rear input shaft seal and hopefully the engine will slide right back in. As 
always suggestions are welcome.

Lookin forward to gettin back on the open road,
