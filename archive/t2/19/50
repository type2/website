Pete:
About 6 months ago, John Anderson posted something about brand new injectors
available from Autozone/ Advanced Auto Parts for something like $28 each. That
gets it down to the point where cleaning may not be cost effective, if, indeed,
it would help an injector with 160,000 miles anyway.
I'll be looking for some soon myself and will report back to the list with my
findings.
