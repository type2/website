I have them on 3 vehicles, no air leaks.  But they were an utter PITA
to get seated well and I used a quality set of new seals (here at least
even I used Dumb Methode and used German) not the junk that came
with them.  The tips are not as long but in my comparison actually had a
superior flow pattern to OEM  Bosch injectors.  They require that all the
hoses of the ring main be the exact perfect lengths to get everything to
fit and don't fit well with the steel ring main bits, another reason I like to
revert/evert to rubber like pre '77 or post '83.  As you should be replacing
the ring main hoses anyway, it's just a matter of careful work to get
them to seal in my experience and once they seat they have stayed well.

But YMMV as always.  They are also up to about $35 each, still pretty
darn reasonable for the new "chimney" design injector at that.  Anyway
my experience.
