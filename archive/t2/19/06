Ric et al. 
My 70 westy seems to get too hot when driving over 50 miles and keeping over 
65 mph.
I am adding an external cooler with a fan and a bypass so that the oil is not 
overcooled in the winter.
I will let you guys know how it works.
I went to Buses by the Bridge 2 years ago from N. Cal (800 miles) and it was 
a very slow drive back through LA and over the grapevine. Once home in 
Northern Cal everything is fine unless I drive over 50 miles for too fast, so 
the 15 miles drive to work does not get us too hot.
PS BTW when is the Bus meet in Sevierville?
