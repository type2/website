If you release the brake pedal while the bleed valve is open (as in pumping 
the brakes), you will probably pull air into the system.  Not 

much, but enough to annoy you with small bubbles.

Try a section of tubing fitted from the bleeder into a jar filled with fresh 
fluid.
Keep the jar below the level of the cylinder you're bleeding. This way even 
if the
pedal is released, only fluid is sucked back in. In a pinch, the second 
person can
be substituted with a short painter's extension pole. Pump the pedal and ex-
tend the pole between the pedal and the seat or the steering wheel (where-
ever you can get it to fit and keep pressure on the pedal and not slip off).
Don't reuse the fluid in the jar; dump it and keep adding fresh fluid to the
reservoir.
