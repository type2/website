Subject: importing goods to USA

I have been asked by a number of people in the last few days about importing old
cars to USA from CANADA

I have no personal experience doing this,, but I do know bringing a 25yr old Vw
Bus into CANADA is extremely easy,,

Mike Moore pointed me to this page which has a great deal of information on
everything,, not just cars
http://www.customs.ustreas.gov/impoexpo/impoexpo.htm

If anyone has personal experience with U.S. Customs at the CANADIAN
border,,especially with Vw's over 25yrs old, it would be nice to hear

Thanks
