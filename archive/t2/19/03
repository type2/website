Subject: 2nd Gear Popping out


 My '72 Type 4 Westy is running great- except for 2nd gear.  I can decel
fine using it, but when any forward pull is applied (I mean ANYTHING,
maintaining speed, accel, any pressure at all)  it pops out into neutral.
I've driven
a bug with reverse doing that crap, but never 2nd Gear.  Is it more likely a
 shifter-related item or deep in the tranny?

 Thanks,
Wade
