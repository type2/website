Subject: Alternator Issues

Hey Ya'll
Wednesday Night I turned off my bus and the alternator light came on.  
Started the bus and the light went out.  Yesterday, I noticed that the light 
was now beginning to come on while I was driving.  Last night sensed that the 
headlights were getting dim and the light was pretty bright.  This morning 
went to start it up--nothing.  Not a big surprise, right?  Was that the 
alternators way of saying it would like to be retired, or maybe a loose belt? 
The fact that the light originally came on only when at rest perplexes me.  
But then again I'm new to world of VW.  I am going to check the tension on 
the belt.  If that's not it I am going to replace the alternator.  Can a 
purchase one at a FLAPS or should I order one from the many dealers on-line?  
If you know of a place that sells VW parts in North Central Indiana I would 
love to know about it.  Any advice appreciated!  Thank you.
