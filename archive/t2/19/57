Subject: RE: [T2] New to This, Need some Advice

Stephanie,

With a basic set of metric tools those things you mentioned are pretty easy
to do yourself. You might need some help adjusting the toe-in on the front
wheels after the replacement of the tie rod ends. Of course doing it
yourself is part of the fun and also an education. I'm relatively new to
working on VWs too. I did brake shoe replacement and the like back in high
school but it's been within the last year that I rebuilt a dune buggy and
discovered how simple and well designed VWs are. Once you become familiar
with them they are rather enjoyable to work on yourself. Major engine work,
timing and tune-ups your might want to leave to the pro mechanics but
otherwise jump in. You have one GREAT resource right here in this list and
the fine volks who frequent it. Do you have any friends into VWs and a
friendly VW shop nearby to get parts and advice from?
