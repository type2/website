Subject: Air Flow Meter problems...

Hello list-

I'm in need of a photo of the top inside of an air flow meter.. mine's out
of a '76 Westy. Daisy's been in the hands of strangers for the last 2 months
and someone screwed with the airflow meter and bent up some of the contacts
and "whatnot" inside.

She runs with the air flow meter disconnected, but will not run with it
connected. I've put a picture up on my website with a circle around the part
in question... I think it's bent but I have nothing to compare it to..

Thanks!

Jeff
