Can any one tell me, in which back issues of Dune Buggies & Hot VWs, did the 
various articles about "Project Westfalia" appear.

I am interested to find out, what was covered in these articles.

There was a passing mention of them, at least three years ago, in a website 
regarding the Wayback Machine, belonging to someone by the name of Scott, 
but I cannot find the URL.

Scott had fitted some homemade air intake duct extensions, which he claimed, 
improved his engine cooling, so I would like to find out more about them.

Any ideas folks?

Regards.
