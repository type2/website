Stephanie:

Doing the brakes and shocks are straight-forward DIY repairs and should be
the first things you try, particularly if you have some knowledgeable help.
Even though the manuals indicate you need to get the rear axle nut off to do
the rear brakes (and another respondent also mentioned this) you *don't*
need to do this.  Plenty of rear brake jobs (probably the vast, vast
majority) have been done without removing the axle nut.

Since this is an old van and you probably don't know its history, you
probably should consider replacing the brake hardware (springs, clips, etc.)
while you're in there, finances permitting.
