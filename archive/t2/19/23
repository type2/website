You can get finest spec trans work done here. <http://www.aatransaxle.com/>
I have installed several from Darrel and you can rely upon the use of real
German parts and great specific knowledge in it's assembly and refinment.
Tell him I sent you.

Just beware of low cost wannabees. Rule of thumb, do not buy from people
with full page 4 color ads and half the price of a properly assembled unit.
