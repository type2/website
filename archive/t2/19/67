Subject: Drop an engine, giving away a bus

Well, I think I'm gonna be dropping my own engines the following
weekend.  My engine is making funny noises and doesn't have compression
on the 4th cylinder.  I'm gonna be soon getting rid of my other 76 so if
there's anyone that wants to come help drop an engine and in return get
a bus, here's your chance :)

Actually, you don't have to help me drop the engine unless you REALLY
want to.  I just want to try and do it anyways.  But, I will have a 76
westy available for the taking coming up pretty soon.  It will be
stripped of practically everything because I want to have the extra
parts handy for my new 78.  I live in Long Beach, CA, so email me if
you're interested.  It'll pretty much be a box on wheels (no engine, no
tranny, no cvs, no front brake calipers, no master cylinder, no steering
column, no door locks, no interior, possibly no windshield, etc). 
Body's in descent condition with minimal rust.  It'll have to be towed,
obviously :)  Email me if your interested.

Next thing... I was wondering if there are any references that I should
look at before dropping the engine.  I have the bentley, muir, and
haynes manuals so I'll gives those a thorough look-through.

The thing that I really want to know is what tools do I need!  I will
have two floor jacks (the pump type), jack stands, wheel stands, a
buncha your normal sockets and drivers, and I'm gonna go buy some
ratcheting box wrenches.  Is there anything else I need?

I'm concerned on how high I need to lift the bus to get the engines
out?  I'm going to be swapping the 76 into the 78 temporarily while I
fix the 78 engine.  I'm thinking of driving the bus onto wheel stands
because I'm weary of working under a car with jackstands and being in
earthquake country :)  Any thoughts/suggestions on this process would be
very nice :)

Mike
