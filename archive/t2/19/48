Subject: new product: Silver Socket Accessory Set

I just added a new product to our shopping cart
http://www.digicart.net/catalogs/catalog.asp?prodid=29070

I put together a euro 12 volt socket, a cover, 2 plugs and a cigarette 
lighter adapter and I'm offering the whole lot for $24.95 including postage.  
All parts are made in Germany.

You can only order this from the website, or by phone.
