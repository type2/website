Jeff,

As Ed pointed out, the metal arm that you circled is way out of wack.  But 
it should not be causing your problem.  Your fuel pump will just run any 
time the ignition is on, even if the engine is not running.

Chances are that if they messed with this thing then they screwed up the 
position of the contacts which wipe on the resistive strip (that semi-circle 
black area).  They may have even messed with the spring tension, which would 
really mess up things.
The reason it runs with the AFM is that the control unit substitutes nominal 
values when things are not there.  It will idol fine but will not run under 
load.

Unless you can find out exactly what they did, the only thing I know to do 
is, follow the Bentley check procedures.  (Anyone else out there have any 
other tips). It has some nominal readings between contacts then 
disconnected.  This may not tell you the real probelm though.  May need to 
get ahold of another AFM.  I had a problem with mine for awhile and tested 
everything to no avail.  Finally got a used AFM and everything has been fine 
since.  They are about $100.  Try Bus Depot or www.partsplaceforallvws.com.

Ted
