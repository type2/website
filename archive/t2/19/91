Subject: Re: [T2] Fan removal

I don't know if there is a Harbor Freight Tools near you but I picked up a
bolt pulley puller kit or what ever it is called for $7.99. It works on my
type 3 but I'm not familiar with the type 4 - According to the "How to
Rebuild Your Volkswagen" book a puller isn't needed and just the three bolts
hold it in place. The instructions are "Unbolt the fan, pull it off and set
it aside".
