Subject: AFM Woes solved!

Thanks to everyone's advice today with my air flow meter problems! Whoever
messed with it did a number on it.. all kinds of things were bent out of
shape inside the AFM. But armed with some pictures that you guys sent and my
Bentley and multimeter, I got it all bent back in the right spots, and she
started right up!!

We just drove her for the first time since "The Flood". The engine is
running strong, but it sounds like the front bearings are shot, perhaps due
to her being towed around the last couple of months, maybe just because the
rust. The brakes still seem good, though. Now I just have to fix all the
little nagging problems, including some minor grounding issues with the
lights. The clutch seems "weird".. it was under water, does rust form on the
clutch disk? I figure the flywheel has some surface rust on it..


Again, thanks to everyone who helped with this. This list is great.
