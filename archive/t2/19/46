Subject: Fuel pump hooked up wrong?

Hello List,

I think that the fuel pump is hooked up wrong on my 73
bus. The mechanical fuel pump has 3 metal hose
connections comming from it. there is one protruding
near the base and the other 2 make almost a "U" or "V"
shaped pattern. what hooks to each one? Does each
carburator hook to one and the other one near the base
hook to the gas tank? I couldn't find a diagram in the
bently. The previous owner installed a progressive
carb and pluged off one of the metal ports on the fuel
pump. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
