Subject: 68 Westy engine timing, etc...

I'd like to adjust the timing on my (new to me) 68 Westy.  Unfortunately, I
can't 
find any timing marks...  Where are they?  As a warning, I'm a novice at
this
stuff.  I adjusted the timing on my Jeep to spec, but that was easy since
the
degree marking were obvious.  On the bus, I've looked at the pulleys and
cannot find any degree markings (like those shown in the Bentley manual).  
As delivered the distributor was cranked all the way clockwise (to the stop)
and the engine was lacking in power.  I turned the distributor
counter-clockwise
a small amount and got a decent amount of power.  If I have to do the timing
by ear, what should I use as a guide? 

Also, when coming to a stop, the engine often stalls.  Any suggestions on 
how to fix this?  I've read (probably somewhere in the Bentley manual) that
this could be attributed to the fuel/air mixture.  How do I go about getting
this ratio set correctly?  Thanks for any help...  Oh yeah, I have the 1600
engine with the PICT 3 carb...
