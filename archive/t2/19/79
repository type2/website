Subject: Paint & body work/visit to San Diego

I worked out a deal with a local rod & custom shop owner.  He is doing
all the body work and arranging for the paint job on my bus for a 1947
massey-harris pony  (tractor)  and some cash.  He has had my bus all
summer but it's beginning to look like he is going to finish after all.
He has replaced all rust holes and weak spots with metal and has the bus
striped to the metal from the windows down.  I am going to replace the
two middle windows with louvered windows and new rubber for the rear
window.  I will also buy hatch, sliding door and engine door rubber and
as many of the seals for the lights as I can find.  No questions to the
list I just needed to tell someone who might care.

I will be in San Diego/Chula Vista from 9/16 - 22 this year.  This is
the first trip of several to California I will make in the next 12 mnts.
on business.  I would be proud to meet any of the local bus owners.  I
would also be happy to spring for gas for anyone who would like to show
me some of the local sites.  I will have evenings and one Sat. free, the
22th.  I would also be glad to return the favor if anyone comes to the
Charlotte, NC area.
