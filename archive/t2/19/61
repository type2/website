Hello Stephanie,

Welcome to the list. I own a 74 bus as well. Mine has
gone through more than one back yard mechanic
(including myself)and the wrath of my repair
experiments. I am currently working out the last
details to get it back on the road sometime this year.
(I hope). I just wanted to let you know that working
on your bus is not as hard as it looks. You can do
alot of the work your self. Most repairs/maintance
just takes studying your manuals,searching the
archives, asking questions, and of course, getting
your hands dirty and trying it. The people on the list
are verry knowledgable and friendly.I have learned
ALOT from them, and I am still learning quite abit
every day. Good luck with your bus!
