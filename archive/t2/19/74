Stephanie:

welcome to the list! i must agree with most of the replies i have seen
already - you CAN work on your bus yourself.  if an idiot like me can do it,
anyone can. haha.

seriously - the mechanic you took it to sounds legitimate from your
description. >> They did stuff like : Upper and Lower Ball joints, steering damper, fuel
lines, oil pressure switch and one of the idle jets.<<  yes, all normal
things for an old vehicle to need.

>>Here's what wasn't done that they said needed to be: Tie Rod Ends, Outer
Axle Boot - right rear, front brake pads, front shocks, rear brake
adjusters and screws.<<

you can DEFINITELY do the brake pads/shoes yourself & all of the shocks.

>>Now I've got a some people around here who are much more mechanically
inclined and I'm armed with four manuals...<<

good.  buy then some beer or something & get them to walk you through the
brake & shock replacement. (let them drink AFTER they finish. haha.)

as far as your tie rod end goes well, thats another thing that really isnt
that hard to replace, but keep in mind that you will need an alignment after
changing them. let the mechanic do the axle boot also.

your absolute priority for this vehicle should be the BRAKES. they are by
far the most important aspect of your vehicle.

next is TIRES. be sure you have the proper tires for a bus. there is LOTS of
info on this in the archives & the library, so check it out.

have faith in yourself & if you need confidence, then consult the list or 
read the Muir book.
