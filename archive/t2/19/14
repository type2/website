Subject: Sportsmobile Light Cover Needed

I need a interior light cover for my '70 Sportsmobile.  It is round, =
just at 5" in diameter, and is whitish/clear color with a square pattern =
to diffuse the light.  The light housing reads "lo-volt inc."

If anyone has one that they are willing to sell, please contact me.

Thanks, Chuck
