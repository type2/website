The library at type2.com lists " tent" and has a lot of
information , including mention of the date code location
for the Drive-Away tent.
On my new one, purchased from the original owner,
the date " August 1969 " is rubber stamped to the right inside
of the front door on the orange canvas, while the inspector's stamp
is on the gray floor material just below that.
I was concerned that the " mattress police " would be upset over
not finding an actual tag sewn into the floor/ wall seam
( This tag not to be removed -under penalty of law :) but
the owner assured me that never happened.
Other tents do have a tag, sewn inside at the left of the door
or under the left side window ( facing out ).
