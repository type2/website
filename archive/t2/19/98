Bill;
   For what it's worth, here's my experience. Was doing the same thing.
Removed the three bolts, tapped it with rubber hammer. No go. Applied
penetrating oil. Tried again. No go. Attached a three armed gear puller,
tightened it up to a frightening level. No go. Left it on overnight. No go.
Applied physics, heated up the hub with a pencil torch going round and
round to avoid too much heat and then, BANG, the hub, gear puller and the
end of the pencil torch flew a good ten feet. Hub off.
   Try it, but stand to the side and wear goggles.
