Subject: My bus is being violated!

Hello all!
 
     My poor bus is being violated, I work right by a high school, in
fact I park in the teachers parking lot. Anyway school has just started,
and now things are being stolen, First Tuesday my Billet aluminium valve
stem caps were stolen after being on all summer, Yesterday was my day
off, so nothing was stolen, Then today when I got off one of my center
caps are missing, from my alloy wheels, I bought new one's from bus
depot, and they fit to tight to fall off, plus I checked my wheels this
morning and it was there, and I doubt it fell off by it's self and
walked off.

     The school doesn't have any camera's over looking the parking lot,
and the cops won't do anything unless I can prove who did it. I'm
getting so mad,  I might hurt someone. I guess I'll have to buy a old
beater just to drive to work, something not worth stealing off of.
well thanks for listening!

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
