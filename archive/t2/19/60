Dear Listees.

To any who are interested, I have FOR SALE, a few of the following 
moderately uncommon, half-inch drive socket tools, which are needed for 
repair or servicing work, on VW Type 2s and other VW-Audi models :-

8mm, 12-pointed, XZN spline tool.

These are used for the M8 socket screws, on the drive-shaft constant 
velocity joints and the mechanical fuel pump, of 1972~83 VW 17/18/2000 Type 
2 and VW 411 & 412, with twin carburettors.

11mm AF socket

These are used for the 11mm AF hex-head bolts, which retain the rear brake 
drum on 1971~79 VW Type 2s and some of the clutch components.

Regards.
        Nigel A. Skeet
