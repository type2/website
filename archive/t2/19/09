Subject: Re: [T2] Over heating continued: today's work LONG

Have you check the oil pressure reliefe/regulation valves. The one at the pully end (rear) will stop oil passing through the oil cooler if it is stuck closed.
The one at the fly wheel end will prevent adequate oiling of all bearings if it's stuck open.
They use different length springs so you would get over heating if the springs were swopped - look in Bently or similar for how to check operation and which spring is which.

When I had my old bus - I had overheating problems which were due to a previous owner fitting a replacement engine on with a pully wheel that did not have the correct timing mark on - and until I found that I was permanently running hot due to be over advanced.

Good luck
