This is the oil pressure relief valve location on a 914.
Remove the plug with an allen wrench, and you will find
a spring and piston. If you have a 914 engine case,
there will be a vertical dipstick at the breather box,
the casting for the bus oil filler tube will be casted
but not opened, as well as the location for a mechanical
fuel pump ( carb engine ). The engine number will be either
by the breather box or on the case seam front.
Lets start with your engine case #- What is it ?
