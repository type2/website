They warped your rotors by overtorquing the lug nuts.

At least this would be my first guess.

Loosen the lug nuts and re-torque - even a basic torque wrench or even a 
calibrated mechanic will work.

Hopefully this will fix it. I don't know if this will release any warping 
they might have caused.

I had this happen to a Honda I used to own - each lug nut was on about 45# 
too much.

Now I won't even let a shop tighten the lug nuts on my car (different shop) 
with an air ratchet. I request permission to torque the nuts myself when 
the wheels go back on. They think I'm crazy but instead of a 12 year old 
Honda I am driving a 2 year old Honda with 40K miles versus 140K miles and 
I am a little more picky... <grin>

Every - every - time I check they have missed the shop manual toque spec on 
the tight side. That includes when they use those little colored extensions 
on their air ratchets.

One fellow didn't believe me and asked to let him try with his little air 
gun. He did and still missed by 20#'s or so.

By the way I use a click type torque wrench - worth it's weight in gold to me.

I'm really curious so post any answers you might find.
