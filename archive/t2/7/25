Subject: Kelly's Island Ohio

Hello All,
 I heard a rumor at the Central Ohio Vintage Volkswagen show this past
weekend, that there is a campout planned for Kelly's Island in early
October.  I believe I heard that it was sponsored or planned by NEATO.
Can anyone confirm or deny?  Additional information would be greatly
appreciated.
By the Way, 350 ACVW for the show!!! Great time.
