Subject: What's this hole- part 2

I didn't get the correct answer to my original post, but I've got additional
information.  The "hole" in my crankcase at #1 cylinder between the pushrod
tube holes is pluged from the inside with a thin aluminum hollow plug.  I
looked at other type 4 cases at a local repair shop and it appears that
there's supposed to be a 12 point plug there.  It's shown on page 5-55 of
Bentley but no reference number is given, nor is there an explanation of its
function.  Does anyone know what this is?
