Subject: Re: [T2] Good used head needed for a 80-83 aircooled vanigon

I have two AMC heads with 8K miles on them. $200.00 each or $380.00 for
the pair. Even got the original shipping boxes to ship in.
Ship from Dallas Texas 75220
Approximate weight 22 Pounds each.
I can take paypal and ship the same day.
They are square port exhaust and are in excellent, very new condition.
They've been cleaned since I removed them as you can see in the picture.
Be sure to match VW heads with VW heads, don't run one VW and one AMC,
whatever head you get make sure its the same as the other.
