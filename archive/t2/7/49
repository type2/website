Rebuild them yourself by all means. Just remember that everything must be
antiseptically clean and don't get any hydrocarbons in the works!  I like
using copious amounts of Girling Brake Rubber grease on all the rubber parts
and believe it's one of the reasons I have 20 years on the last rebuild and
the calipers are still free as can be. It prevents water from entering the
area beneath the dust seal and rusting the pistons. We get lot o' wet in the
NW.  I separate the caliper halves so I can scotch brite the cylinders,
clean and reassemble easily, but I've only ever found the caliper half seals
at the dealer.

I'm starting to see a little clearer here... I had my caliper off the
spindle, disconnected from the brake line, sitting on the garage floor and
STILL it was a huge PITA to get the pistons back far enough to accommodate
the new pads.  As the caliper had free access to expel fluid from the
resevoir, it seems that I need some caliper work.

Now, someone indicated that there exists rebuild kits for calipers.  What is
everyone's preferred method: home rebuild of own calipers or purchase
rebuilt units?  Are these rebuild kits available from FLAPS - are they
rather generic - or are they VW-only and available from folks like BusDepot
and BustedBus?   And how much are they, and how long does it take?  T.P.
will note that I put a price on my time :) and will need figures before I
decide either home repair or outright purchase (and exchange).
