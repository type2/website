I bought a 3/4" drive socket set at a flea market for $37.50. Not super
quality, but it does get those high-torque nuts, bolts and screws off. Works
good for tearing out walls in Butler buildings and removing heating elements
from water heaters, too.

I am a Tool Collector of the first order, and not even I want an $800 socket
set.
