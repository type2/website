Subject: green westy curtains 4U

i nabbed five pieces of '76 westy (10/75) green curtains. i left the one
behind the cabinet because it was soooo faded. the rest are decent. some
minor fading in the folds of some of them. but when seen from the inside of
the bus, the curtains are 100% perfect. two need a run through the sewing
machine since the previous picker yanked some off without unscrewing the
curtain rod. no rips; just hems needed. 2 minute job once the bobbin is in.
anybody need these original curtains? soopah cheep cheep. flag me down off
list with p-mail.   - steve
