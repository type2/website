I bought a new 1971 van, dealer demo with a few miles on it.

I put just a bit over 100,000 on it when it dropped a rod. 

took reasonably decent care of it but nothing peculiar
did run Mobil 1 in it after that came out.

I kept records (mpg etc) but I'm not sure where they are now, if I run
across em I could figure out some of the statistics
