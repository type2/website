Den et al.,

I'll check the rotors against a 10mm wrench this afternoon.  And, I am sad
to report that the pistons DID NOT go back into the caliper easily to make
room for the pads.  In fact, I had to use a screwdriver laid across the
piston with as-even-as I could get pressure to force them back in... if my
caliper is hosed, can it be rebuilt?  By whom?  How much?  I'm not keen on
the idea of buying new calipers (-at-) $90-ish a pop.

And T.P.: I suspect you are absolutely right when you mentioned recently
that removal of the hub makes installing brake shoes and cylinders easier...
while I accomplished it with just the drum removed, it certainly would have
been nice to have the extra room to play with.

Additionally, I did not lubricate (gasp) nor did I do the 25mph
go-and-brakes.  With all that bloody noise coming from the wheel, I wasn't
about to start jamming things up!

Cheers
