George,

I neither saw these plates when I dismantled the brakes, nor was I issued
any with the pads... Ron has the front-brake hardware kits on B.O... perhaps
I should have waited?

And Ian, brother, I have no idea whatsoever what you're talking about.  I
suspect it was humor at my expense, but my wife occasionally accuses me of
being dense.  Sorry.
