Subject: Good used head needed for a 80-83 aircooled vanigon

Hello List,

I know that this list is ment for bay window busses
but I figured that there were a few air cooled vanigon
owner in the bunch. The previous owner of my bus has a
vanigon who's valve seat droped and he was looking for
a good used air cooled vanigon head. He mentioned
somthing about it haveing a square port or somthing.
If any of you have a good used early vanigon head and
you would like to sell it, let me know how much you
want for it. I will have to call him to get alittle
more information from him as far as exact year model, 
which head needed to be replaced, if that makes any
difference and exactally when he will be able to
purchase it. The only thing is it must be in good
unworn shape. This vanigon was one of his daily
drivers. Thanks for any help that you can give. I will
post more information when I get it. Thanks!!!

Regards,
David Kelly
