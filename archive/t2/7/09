Subject: Re:Care by original owners

Some owners were anal about having the proper maintenance done.  I still
have in the garage a working engine (when pulled, 125 lbs compression)
taken from a 77 Westy with 204,000 mi on it- I bought from the second
owner as a parter when front end rotted.  I assumed it had been rebuilt,
but found the original owner's name from postcards that fell behind the
sink cabinet (amazing what falls behind there)- and called them up. 
Nope -never rebuilt, but they religiously took it to the dealer for
valve adj., etc and sold it due to some body rot.  My guess is that
early owners used the Westy mostly for vacations/weekends for long
distance driving, not daily drivers.  All highway miles if not
overheated will likely mean less wear over a long time than short
distance driving.
     As to laissez faire owners, I alsd have a 75 bus I got from a 2nd
owner who got it at 10K and who wrecked 2 transmissions (did he ever
shift?) and sold it to me with a locked 2nd gear and only 65K mi of
commuting on the bus.  Had only 90 lbs compresion on very tight valves;
upon readjustment, they went to 125 lbs!   Amazing how neglect will
still let them run.

 Speaking of statistics...Anyone have 'em on the Vans when they actually
were new? MPG, repair records...etc. Be interesting to try and figure
out what the lifespan of various components was originally supposed to
be and how far most of us have gone beyond that figure. The engine life
interests me most...I don't think that "new" owners did much beyond what
the warranty required - normal service at the dealer? Present owners, by
necessity, are much more involved
 with their van's mechanicals...Were "new" owners? I wonder how many
"new" van engines survived their laissez faire owners?
