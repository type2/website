Subject: Re: [T2] 1700 Cylinder Head Mystery Holes

Actually Jake, it sounds like he's got the stock early 1700 heads. They had 
holes that were just behind the exhaust valve outlet for the air injection 
tubes that connected to the air pump, as part of the exhaust gas afterburning 
(i.e.,. Emission Control) system. Early mod.s had holes at all four exhaust 
ports, later mod.s had them at 1,2 and 3 only. They can easily be tapped and 
plugged.
