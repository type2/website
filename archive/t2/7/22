Back to my van...what can people surmise might have started the fire? It
seemed to be to the left as you look at the engine, and in the middle.
Maybe in front of the distributor? Or around there? There are char marks
on the seat cushion I pulled out as well (which is in excellent shape
otherwise :( ).

Also, maybe I should stay away from the magnesium block next time?


Thanks,

Andree
