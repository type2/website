Subject: Re: Further to Brake Drums, etc...

I'm starting to see a little clearer here... I had my caliper off the
spindle, disconnected from the brake line, sitting on the garage floor and
STILL it was a huge PITA to get the pistons back far enough to accommodate
the new pads.  As the caliper had free access to expel fluid from the
resevoir, it seems that I need some caliper work.

Now, someone indicated that there exists rebuild kits for calipers.  What is
everyone's preferred method: home rebuild of own calipers or purchase
rebuilt units?  Are these rebuild kits available from FLAPS - are they
rather generic - or are they VW-only and available from folks like BusDepot
and BustedBus?   And how much are they, and how long does it take?  T.P.
will note that I put a price on my time :) and will need figures before I
decide either home repair or outright purchase (and exchange).

Lastly, at the risk of beating a dead horse, how exactly would a faulty
caliper cause the "wah-wah" sound?  Could my caliper be hosed and still I
need a rotor?  The idea saddens me.

Thanks for all of your patient guidance,
