Subject: Re: [T2] What's this hole- part 2

I think what you are seeing is the oil pressure regulator spring.

I was used on early 70's Type IV blocks. On later 70's blocks this was not 
used and the hole remained plugged.

I don't think Bentley says much about it but I do this the "How to Rebuild 
Your VW" book (red with the pic of a Type IV longblock on the front) does 
explain it.
