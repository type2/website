Subject: 1700 Cylinder Head Mystery Holes

howdee volks,

i purchased a used 1800 head for my 74 westy that turned out to be a 1700 
head.  with a bit of craftiness from a gifted machinist friend it became an 
1800.  motor back together and running smoothly it was as loud as a 
helicopter.  valves were readjusted, timing set, no exhaust leaks.  the 
problem discovered was that there are two holes on the head leaking 
combustion pressure. i see short wiffs of flame during firing.  scared to 
run it anymore.  each hole is just to the outside and below the outermost 
intake manifold bolt.  the cowling on either side looks like it shows a 
place for a stud or something.  looking into the hole i believe i see the 
fins of the head along the circumference of the hole and a valve. anyone 
know how to remedy the problem of these mystery holes or what the heck they 
are?

mystified,

eric
