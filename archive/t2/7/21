Subject: Re: [T2] Debugging an Engine that's running Hot


I played around a bit on Friday and Saturday with my bus
and came up with the following.  I haven't bought a fuel
pressure gauge yet, so I haven't checked my fuel 
pressure -- hope to do that this week.  I haven't checked
my compression yet either because I got a little caught
up with the following:

I found that there is in fact NO vacuum on what should be
my vacuum retard port (which should be at the same vacuum 
level as the intake manifold) of my H30/31 Carb.  There IS 
vacuum on one of the ports above what should be the
retard port, the left of the two adjacent rear-facing
ports which are on the same horizontal level as the 
vacuum advance port.  However, I am reasonable sure that
this is the Throttle adj. port, as vacuum measured off
of this port does not uniformly decrease as the throttle
is opened, in fact, the vacuum is HIGHER sometimes when
the throttle is open, and, seems to react in a complex
manner (i.e. vacuum does not have a linear relationship 
with throttle position and reacts ) to changes in throttle.

Can anyone confirm that this sounds like the throttle
adj. port?

I hypotheize the result of having no vacuum on the retard port 
of my carb means that i have set my timing incorrectly
and that this may be making me run hot.

Am I sure?  No, but it's something to check out.  So, the next
step is to put a 34-Pict-3 back on and check that there's
vacuum on the retard port.  After that (and taking it for a
spin to check out the qualitative results), I'll be checking
the compression and fuel pressure.

Tidbit regarding my manifold exhaust:  I do, in fact, have between
10-20 in^3 of vacuum on the 3/4 intake manifold vacuum port,
although it ocillates wildly between 10 and 20, so I didn't
think it was smooth enough to attach to the retard port of my
dizzy.

It also looks like the hoses from the oil bath air cleaner to the
fan housing go through my charcoal cannister backwards.  more on
that later.

Anywho, I'll report more info as I get dirtier and more stuff gets done.

cheeers and thanks for all the responses,
