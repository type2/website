Subject: Charcoal Cannister


I didn't see anything in the archives about this, so I thought
I'd ask.

I was reading through Bentley (Fuel section, page 26 or 27, i believe)
over the weekend and it said that the hose from the fan housing to the
oil bath air cleaner (that goes through the charcoal cannister) existed
to help prevent carb icing by sending warm air from the fan housing into
the carb.  Oh, btw, this is for my '71 bus, the first year to have this
cannister (i believe).

It also says the chacoal filter should be replaced every 30k miles,
although I don't know that new ones exist.

So, that raises a few questions.

If I assume that the charcoal cannister isn't doing it's job of
removing hydrocarbons anymore, should I:

a) just run the breather hose from the fan housing straight
	to the oil bath air cleaner and assume that the filter
	will take care of any bad stuff (particulates) coming 
	from the fan housing

b) disconnect and cap both holes (i'm not inclined to do this)

c) keep running it through the charcoal cannister even though
	that might amount to (b) -- as the airflow through the
	cannister may be virtually blocked

d) seek out a manufacturer of new cannisters (please let me know if you
	know of one!)


I'm almost inclined to do (a), although I'd rather have some sort
of additional inline filter, whether catalytically active or not,
to prevent too much crud entering my oil bath air-cleaner.  If anyone
knows of a good filter for this type of use, please email me as otherwise
I'll just be tooling around at home-depot looking for something that will
work.

Cheers,
