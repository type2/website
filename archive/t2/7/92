Heh.

see the archives...http://www.type2.com/archive.html

take your pick of the three, you'll probably get thousands of hits.
Generally, Ron had a good operation.  He's had growing pains sometimes,
and just like anyone else sometimes a bad product will slip past...but it

He's been on these lists longer then I have (and in fact started the
