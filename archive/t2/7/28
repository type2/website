Subject: Oil Pressure Light

Here is the scenerio:

1600dp newly installed engine with 700 miles on it.
A couple of weeks ago I had my oil pressure light come on at low idle on a 
older engine.  I had the switch changed out and it still came on. It seemed 
to only go on after a longer drive when it was hot out.  So being that the 
engine was old already, we needed a new head anyway, we had the whole engine 
rebuilt.

We are about at the 700 mile break in point and it has run great so far.  
the other day it was 95 degrees outside and after about a 25 minute drive 
the oil light came on at idle only.  It goes out if I give it a little gas, 
and seems to dim but still flicker when the clutch pedal is pressed down??  
I wouldn't think that is related, but still found it odd that that would 
effect the brightness of the light.

So now, I know it isn't my engine that needs rebuilding...done that already, 
in which the mechanic also replaced the oil pump.  The switch was replaced 
before the engine was rebuilt....So, I do not know what to look for next.

After I called the mechanic and told him, he said he can raise the oil 
pressure, but I don't think I feel comfortable with that reply....

I assume I need to make sure the light is on next time I take it to him and 
have him test what the pressure is reading at the same time the light is 
flickering?  What should a normal oil pressure reading be?

Any other suggestions...

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
