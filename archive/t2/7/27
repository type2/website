Subject: oil pressure light w/ VDO sender ( was: RE: [T2] Engine temperatures)

Hi Russel.  I wasn't paying attention very closely to your first post, 
sorry.  If you have the VDO dual pressure sender that maintains the oil 
pressure warining light, here's the deal as best I can tell.  This switch 
turns the light on below 10 psi.  The stock sender turns it on at about 5 
psi.  My engine idles at 7 psi warm and my light comes on at idle all the 
time after warming up.  As long as your gauge says it has more than 5 psi I 
think you're OK (or whatever the spec is, I don't know it but was told 7 is 
within spec).  The light can become annoying though and I'm afraid that 
someday it will be like the boy who cried, "Wolf!"  So I scan the gauge at 
idle as part of my intersection scan routine.
