Subject: Re: [T2] Nut size on the exhaust studs

Nuts on heat exchanger studs are threaded M8X1.25 pitch.
They usually fit M13 wrench, but may also come M12,
as the copper ones with thread lock slit will. M13 is
fine for any location on the exchanger mount, as is M12.
I prefer stainless. I have also seen metric nuts with Helicoils,
 you may find these on your transaxle, this is a peculiar piece
of hardware, makes no sense to me. Let's start a "thread" ( pun 8^).

Also, old rusty M8 bolts willl actually decompose ( shrink ) to the point
you will need a M12 wrench to remove.These will be a real good indicator
you are in for a difficult removal procedure, so i usually start with the "hot wrench"
(torch) .
