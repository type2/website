I don't see this as being unusual.  The piston likes to be pushed in
evenly.  If you push one edge it tends to jam.  Sometimes mine will push
in with considerable finger pressure, sometimes it takes a bit more.

They are easily rebuilt if the seals are bad.  Cost is about $10 for the
piston seal (a rubber ring) and dust seal.  I found the piston a piece of
cake to remove and replace, but the dust seal was a bear to get seated
properly in the caliper.  Never unbolt the two halves of the caliper from
each other!  If you do, there are more seals to replace.

However, if the caliper is corroded inside, it is junk.  If the calipers
were really rare, one could have them resleeved for $$$, but for
baywindows the calipers are still available.  If you think that $90 is
bad, price the same item for a contemporary car!

Lubrication isn't absolutely needed.  I don't do it and get a few
squeaks as the pads wear in.  I'm allergic to turning the rotors, so my
wear-ins take longer as the pad conforms with the not-quite-flat rotor.

One thing that wasn't mentioned was the anti-rotation plate for the
piston.  This is a thin sheet metal plate that goes between the pad and
the piston with two tabs that keep the piston in the proper position.  The
piston has a cutaway section that ensures that one side of the pad touches
before the other, which is also a squeak-reduction measure, IIRC.  If the
plate is missing, or its tabs are squished flat, the wrong end of the pad
might be touching first.
