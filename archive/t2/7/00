Subject: Re: [T2] Transporting a bus

Sold a '49 Chevy and they sent a HD Ford F-350 with a long trailer. On this 
trailer was mine and two others.

He loaded it up and a few days later it arrived in NY state.

The truck rode around the country for a few days while he picked up and 
dropped off cars.

I'm sure it got loaded and unloaded several times.

Make sure they know it can't be loaded under it's own power.

The cost for the buyer was $600-$750 I think.
