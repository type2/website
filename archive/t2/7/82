Subject: Re: [T2] Firewall removal with engine in.  Can it be done?

Yes - you can remove the firewall with the engine in.

Remember that there are two vertical screws on each side of the engine that 
hold the firewall in in addition to the ones you can see.  I think Bentley 
shows them.

Just remember that a few feet of quality fuel line is  much cheaper than a 
new bus.

Easier too.
