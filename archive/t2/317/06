the third wire is a ground. it connects the chassis of the regulator to
the chassis of the generator. you can put it under the gen strap or use a
big terminal and put it on the strap bolt/nut.
It is sort of a "just in case" ground. the ground path from the gen to the
reg is convoluted and the regulator mounting doesnt always ground to the
chassis that well.
I would connect it back.
