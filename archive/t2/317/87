It sure sounds like it might be a good idea, if for no other reason
than piece of mind. It would be quite a bad thing to have something
really mess up an engine (even if it was in a fire already)

No machining necess. consult the Bentley for the procedure, but simply
its:

1. remove carbs & tin
2. remove exchangers
3. remove valve cover & rockers
4. remove the rods & rod tubes
5. unbolt the heads.
6. remove the heads (duh)

This is real simplified but about this simple. The installation is
reverse. And of course you must decide what to do with the head gasket
if found :). good luck.
