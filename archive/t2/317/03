Well I did promise :)

If you look at the picture you can see the shiny ring where the
cylinder mates to the head, this shiny section is not completely
circular. This shiny section is the shim we have been talking about.
This is what I have seen that made me take heed of the technical
bulletin. This particular head is the 1/2 yead. you can see that the
#1 cyl (right on picture) is very close to having a breech of the
compression chamber.

so to sum up, we are all going to do exactly what we want and tell
everyone else about it :)
