Subject: Brake Failure

Hey Volks,

I'm still getting around to posting the saga of my last X-Country bus trip
-- and this one was epic -- but I have a question for the collective.

Before leaving San Diego with my new (to me) '67, the master cylinder went
while we were bleeding the brakes/flushing the system.

I replaced the master cylinder, the one rubber line that was completely
collapsed, adjusted all four wheels, and promised my new bus that I'd do
the remaining lines when we got to the east coast ($22-26/brake hose from
a FLAPS, $7 and $12 (rear & front) from bus depot, made me want to wait).

Now, I'm not sure what brake fluid my friend had been using before we
flushed the system, but he thought it was DOT 4, so we went and used DOT
4.  It's entirely possible that it was DOT 3, but we used enough DOT 4 to
clear out all the remaining old fluid anyway, so I wasn't too worried.

Well, 500 miles later I lost a rear wheel cylinder as I was getting off
the highway in San Francisco.  Dual resevoir brake system worked wonders
and I was still able to pump up pressure/use the e-brake to stop.

I replaced both rear wheel cylinders, picked up the front cylinders "Just
in case", bled 'em and proceeded to drive 2500 miles to Dayton, OH
(stopping in Denver to replace my engine).  As I pulled in to Dayton last
saturday night, I lost all brake pressure 2 blocks from my friends house.

I looked, and it's the cylinder on same wheel that failed 2500 miles ago
in SF.  WTF?

So, the bus is in Dayton and I'm picking it up this weekend, but I'm
trying to figure out why this could have happened.  Could there still be
DOT 3 in my old crappy brake hoses that is somehow mixing with the DOT 4?
I'm pretty sure my rear brake hoses are CRAP -- they're bubbling and don't
look too stable, so I'll be replacing them when I do the wheel cylinder --
but could this be why the brand spanking new wheel cylinder went south?

I've been lucky so far with these failures not being in situations that I
needed to stop on a dime, but I'd rather not tempt fate and have this
happen again.

Your thoughts and comments are appreciated.
