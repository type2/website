Tom, sounds like you have all the good luck. The wheel
cylinder that failed (new one) most likely sat on the
shelf for a few years and the rubber was stuck in it
when moved tore the cup, you are lucky you didn't run
over someone. The brake fluid 3 or 4 dot would not
make a difference on the rubber. Good luck with the
new one's. Phil
