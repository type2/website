Subject: Shipping questions

I posted that I'm selling an 81 westy and was wondering if anyone knew the
best way to ship large items such as tranny, engine, etc.   I would like to
find some more info on ways to ship large items.  Does anyone have experience
in shipping large items like this?


Thanks,

Mike
