Subject: Gas Cap Help

Hello All,

For now its Good News/Bad News I have a full tank of gas, but can't open 
the cap...

After filling up my bus last night, I was locking the gas cap and the 
cylinder for the lock came about half way out with my key.  Now my cap is 
locked, the cylinder won't go in, and I will need to fill up sometime this 
weekend.

Any suggestions on how to remove the cap and get a new one without damaging 
the bus will be appreciated.

Thanks,

kevin
