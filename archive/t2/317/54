You should be. Trust your instincts on this one.

On mine the fitting inside the hose is tapered, so you can't feel it all 
from the outside very well. There was plenty once I took the clamp off.

That is the best plan. I just replaced these on my bus. Take a small 
pair of cutters and snip the crimped fitting from the manufacturer. Then 
the hose can be easily pulled or cut off. Replace the hose with new, and 
put a new clamp on it.

I replaced everything EXCEPT those, and then one of them sprang a leak 
on my bus. I was lucky that my bus didn't burn. Gas did spray 
everywhere! Replace them now! along with every other, including the two 
for the breather lines located above the batteries in the intake air 
towers. Ask me how I know those are there?
