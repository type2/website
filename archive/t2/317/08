Interesting, I hadn't considered that.  But wouldn't the carbon buildup be disturbed by any movement of the head vs. cylinder, including thermal expansion?  They are different metals.

There is another issue.  There needs to be a minimum deck height of something like 0.035".  In the two engines I have personally rebuilt, the deck height was only about 0.025" without the "head gasket".  So I would say that a shim should always be installed under the barrel to make up for the thickness of the head gasket unless deck height is re-evaluated.

I would love to have these, but have not noticed them at the usual sources.  Mind sharing where you found them?

Thanks,
