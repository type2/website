I installed 3 two inch gauges in the dash between the radio and the 
ashtray. Requires cutting 3 two inch holes in the dash so the change is not 
reversible. Make SURE that you putting them in the right place the first 
time of course so it is impossible to correct.

Looks FACTORY.

I have CHT, oil pressure, oil temp.

In place of the clock (which i do not have) I mounted the tach. All looks 
quite nice.

Eventually I plan to install a series of small LED's to indicate the 
mixture. I will probably do it with multiple holes drilled in the 
instrument cluster or create a small panel for between the a/c unit 
(underdash) and the dash.

www.pelicanparts.com has a free schematic for anyone wanting to build their 
own.
