Reconditioning covers these items:

1.Exchanger, test for leaks, clean, paint.

2. Test and clean air circulation blower

3. Test fuel pump

4. Test glow/spark plug

5. Lube bearings, check and adjust combustion blower points.

6. reassemble all clean, tested parts

7. Bench test. I run the heater for several hours.

I can do all or part. If you want me to do all, the cost is $160.00 without the
exchanger, $180.00 with it.
without the heat exchanger, I need all the other parts and harness. If something
is missing that you aren't aware of,
I'll let you know. I have spare parts.

If you want to clean and paint your heat exchanger, this will save on shipping
and labor. The prices include return
shipping.

I use a high temp silver or black paint.

I do not charge for extra labor time, only for part replacement with your
permission.

For your timer switch the usual charge is 65.00, but I'll sell it for 50.00 if
you decide to have me do the reconditioning.

Attached is a pic of a heater I reconditioned.
Allow 2-4 weeks for your heater once I have received it.

You can call me at 206 550-7033 or leave a message on my voice mail . We can
discuss the details of installation ,
cost total , etc. Or use the e-mail address .

I accept payment by check or money order, or Paypal.

My address is:

Thankyou,

Robert
