Hi Listees,
    Billy asked....."Now....What kind of glue to put them on?  I have
repainted my seat pedestals with the rattle can. Will anything stick
the rubber to them now?".....

    Billy the glue you want is called 1300L.  I believe it's a 3M
product now and is made for gluing down rubber like this.  It is a
contact cement, so you brush it on the back side of the mats and also
on the pedestals and let both sides dry.  A second application of glue
would be good and then let that dry too.  Then you install the mats
and they will stay stuck.
    You'll find this glue in body shop supply houses,  high end FLAPS,
and aircraft supply houses.  In fact Aircraft Spruce.Com has it listed
in their on-line catalog.  Go to
http://www.aircraftspruce.com/index.php and then do a search for
1300L.
