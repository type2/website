**************************
Along about 10 years ago, Continental (and other belt manufacturers)
standardized width sizes to conform world-wide, changing (slightly) the width:

9 > 10, 9.5 > 10, 12.5>13, etc.  The angle of the "V" of the belt was
changed as well to compensate for the new sizing.

Japanese brands and US makers Dayco, Napa and Gates have converted their
sizing as well to conform to the belt sizing standard.

Interesting note however - the upright 1600 Generator still uses 9.5x905mm.
 Continental has never changed that one (looking at a stack of new belts
right now).  All the others are 10mm for the rest of the VW line-up in the
Continental and CRP catalogs.

So 10x965 is correct for the Type 4 engine application for the alternator.
