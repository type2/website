You need to narrow down the year, because 65-66 is 6v and a 12v engine won't fit without clearancing the bell housing on the tranny -- which is 
doable.  If it has been done already or the bus is a 67, I think any engine up to 71 is almost plug & play, with minor issues.  You can also use just 
about any 12v B**tle engine.
