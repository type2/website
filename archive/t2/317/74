<<Just an idea, there is a repair manual on ebay right now, Item #
2401624967,
under the title "Eberspacher VW Gas Heater Repair VW Thing Bus"    ?????????
Kenny
'77 Westy>>

I'm in the market for this manual but I'm having a heck of a time telling what
model I have.
The manual says type 181 and my heater that came out of a '72 westy has parts
numbers like
BN4
Ausfuhrung 201415
Fabrik - Nr. 30837
Sai nr 200 B4
211 261 103

Can anyone decifer this or tell me a source? Ron Van Ness used to have some
good links in the type2 library
but they no longer work.
Thanks,
Joel ('71 in Denver and '79 for sale in baltimore)
