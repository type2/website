Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch cable tube replacement?

I had this happen to the 65 westy about 2-3  years ago when I was in Arizona. 
  I had a big end tranny boot clamp around, or two, and used those clamps to 
stick it back to the rear axle.  I meant to get it welded, but never did.  

This is the easy cheap fix.   you can spend more money and time if you like.

 Has anyone replaced their tube with steel tubing from the hardware store?
