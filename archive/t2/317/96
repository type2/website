Subject: vanagon canvas on a bay

I searched the Type2 archives and the Library (gotta love the library) and I
found nothing. Although, I do recall a thread in the past related to this..

I have heard many people complain how tight the fit is on NEW replacement pop
top canvas. I seem to recall that Vanagon canvas is slightly larger and MAY be a
better overall fit on a bay window.

Can some verify or discredit this rumour?
