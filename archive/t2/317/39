Have you tried the other online vendors to see if they have stock?

California Imports says it's in stock:
FUEL TANK SENDING UNIT - BUS 68-1/73
Code: VWC-211-919-051
Price: $59.95

Bus Boys may have one:
B.  211-919-051  Tank Gauge Sender, 1968 to Early 1973 (To Chassis #213 2138
900)  $77.65

Wolfsburgwest, RMMW,  is out of stock or so their websites say.
