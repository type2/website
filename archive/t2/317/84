Subject: Fuel injection problem solved

First off, thanks to all of the fellow listees who
were kind enough to respond to my fuel injection
problem/question.

The problem was one of my injectors (#3) was not
firing and when I switched the #3 and #4 injector
wires the problem moved to #4. The thought was a
faulty resistor since I could not get continuity
through that wire from the resistor thru to the
computer end. 
Well, after taking off the injector harness and using
the Bently as a guide, I found that all that was
wrong, was the metal connector that connects to the
injector was pushed in and not making contact with the
injector!!

Cleaned repaired and reinstalled and it is now running
just fine!!! Oh happy day!

BTW...The resistor pack from VW is 122$$ (discounted
to 98$) and from the local yard was 25$. I was on my
way to buy one when I figured I should do more test.

Thanks again to all who helped!
