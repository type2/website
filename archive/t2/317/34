Subject: Injector cleaning

Sorry, way behind on my posts these days.  Thought I'd respond anyway.

A couple of days ago, someone asked about injector cleaning vs. replacement. 
  I am (still) in the process of rebuilding my '78 2.0L.  I removed my 
injectors and took them to a place here in Houston to be cleaned.

All 4 injectors were spray-tested before and after cleaning.  When I went to 
go pick them up, I jokingly asked the guy if they really needed to be 
cleaned.  He looked shocked, then said that they were the dirtiest ones he'd 
ever seen, but that after cleaning the spray patterns looked great.

Of course, those injectors have been hard at work for the last 25 years, so 
I imagine they looked pretty dirty to a guy at a swanky BMW place.

The cost for cleaning was $25/injector.  I decided to go that route versus 
replacement because I have VW injectors and don't have to question the 
quality of the replacements.  The cost might make you want new, but mine 
have worked great for 25 years, and I'd be thrilled to even get another 10 
years out of them!

If you want the shop's name, location, number, pmail me and I'll drive by 
and get it.  My memory is not what it used to be....
