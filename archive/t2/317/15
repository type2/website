Subject: trans and clutch 79 bus 2.0

I am about to drop my nice new 2.0 into my bus but before I do this I want 
to ask if it is possible to change the the clutch and trans once the engine 
is in the car. Basically once the engine is installed can the trans or 
clutch be replaced in case of problems down the road. I really dont have the 
money to put into these right now and they were in fine operating condition. 
Maybe I will replace the clutch but not the trans.

Thanks Guys

Casey
