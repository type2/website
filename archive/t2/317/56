Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum lines unclear

Scott, that was a little confusing, but after visiting a local shop here
that specializes in camper bus's he concurred that the vacuum retard should
come from the plenum. I checked a few vehicles in his yard and they all had
different looking plenums but the retard all came from there and not the
intake side of the throttle plate. I'm not concerned with exactly where the
nipple should be as long as I know where the vacuum is supposed to come
from. I will just Tee into the line that is coming out of the Plenum (air
distributor) already.

Thanks everybody for directing me to all the excellent links, and offering
so much help.
