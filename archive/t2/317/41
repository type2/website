Most people overlook the bushing in the transmission bell housing.

Your wiring description is correct,, but if the bushing is missing or worn bad,,
the starter armature will drag on the pole pieces and slow the starter motor
which takes away from the available HP to crank the engine,,,

Look in the hole in the trans where the nose of the starter plugs into,, and see
if the hole has a bronze [brass] looking bushing, and see if it is still round
looking

Also, if you are using an old trans for 6v starter,, it will have a bushing that
is too big for the 12v starter... there is a conversion bushing to allow the use
of the 12v starter in the 6v trans bell housing.
