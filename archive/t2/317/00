Subject: 1990 Passenger Vanagon for sale Charleston, SC

I have had this bus for a few months fixing ALL the little
things............as most of you know on the list I am a VW mechanic in
Charleston SC building up a clientele to actually open a shop which
currently is in my garage at home (I have a VERY understanding wife)

Anyway.  $4200 ..........138 or so thousand miles on the clock.....I have
driven it about 2500 miles....very peppy 4 speed.  White with gray interior.
Neat as a pin.  Engine is very clean.  No rust....any minor seam rusting was
repaired and that was only a little. Power steering, power mirrors, rear
heater. Tranny was swapped sometime during its life, I can see the crayon on
the tranny case from a salvage yard.  All new tires, front and rear heater
blowers, FI parts.  A/c had o-rings replaced in the lines and was
charged...It will freeze you out of the car!  Coolant system has been
flushed and refilled with proper coolant.  Brakes have all been refreshed
and bled,  nice stereo, has a middle seat and fold down rear seat for bed.
Could easily be a weekender with a curtain kit added.  It has standard vw
rims with odd dealer installed hubcaps.  It is not a carat or wolfsburg
addition. Tune up recently.  You really could hop in it and drive it
anywhere, IMHO.  I have driven it 3 times in the last 2 months to Asheville,
and that is almost 300 miles away.  No problems, and handled the mountains
as well as any Vanagon does.

I have a carfax report I can forward to those interested.
