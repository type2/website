Here's what the original injector looks like under the hose; they are
barbed:

Once you start to push on the 7mm hose you would won't be able to get it off
without cutting it off.  The dished endings aren't as effective as another
hose clamp which is the popular upgrade.

New injectors have a metal ring that is crimped over the fuel line.
