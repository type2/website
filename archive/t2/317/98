I had posted something to that effect a while ago.

The aftermarket canvas sold by the only U.S. supplier is, in my opinion,
snugger than the original, despite their insistence that it is cut to the
original pattern.  I have one wholesale customer in Canada who does a lot of
Bus restorations, and feels that the Vanagon canvas (which is slightly
larger) is a better fit on the '74-79 Bus than the "correct" canvas is.  Of
course if you have an earlier ('68-73) bus that is not an option, as that
canvas is completely different.

However, there is (for the time being) another option as well - that being
the OEM German canvas that I just brought back from Germany. I only have a
few available of each year ('68-73 and '74-79), but they are basically
identical to the original Westfalia canvas in both fit and finish. In my
opinion these are much nicer than the aftermarket ones, and worth the
difference for the short time that I will have them. However, they are a
little more expensive ($299).  In the case of these canvases, you would not
want the Vanagon one. (Incidentally, I hope to have more of these in the
summer, although it is not definate.)

Both can be found on the busdepot.com website.
