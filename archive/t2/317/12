> There is another issue.  There needs to be a minimum deck height of
something like 0.035".  In the two engines I have personally rebuilt, the
deck height was only about 0.025" without the "head gasket".  So I would say
that a shim should always be installed under the barrel to make up for the
thickness of the head gasket unless deck height is re-evaluated.

I would say that deck height must be re-evaluated first
to determine the necessity of a shim under the barrels.
Barrel shims supplied with aftermarket gasket sets
are .010", while the head gaskets are more like .035"
Removal of the head gasket will raise CR by .1 on a 2L
.025" deck height is too close for me.
Both heads should be checked for combustion chamber
volumes when one is replaced. Rebuilt heads may have
been flycut, and this can be a significant factor in CR.
