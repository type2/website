Subject: Head Removal?

I am in the process of cleaning up a 1700 that had an engine fire. When I 
removed the dual carbs I noticed that some junk" had gone down into the 
heads. I am going to try to vacuum out as much of it as I can. But I am 
considering removing the heads and cleaning them.

If I do remove the head will I have need to do any machining? I intend to 
eventually rebuild the engine. But in the meantime I just want to see how it 
runs, so I am trying to keep my cost down.

Thanks in advance for your advice.

Phil
