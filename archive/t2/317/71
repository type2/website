Subject: Engine Tin

Does anyone have or know where I might be able to find some engine tin.
I'm looking for the left rear plate and the left heater shield plate.
Also would anyone know where I might be able to purchase a flywheel
wrench, bearing puller, clutch alignment tool, and an impact wrench at a
reasonable price.  I am about to embark on changing the clutch on my 72
bus.  Is there any bit of advise anyone can give me.  I've down loaded
the details from the type2 library.  But could always use any extra
tips.


I was wondering if anyone on this list used to live right outside
Milwaukee, Wisconsin and sold a white 1972 bus.  It would of been back
in 1997 or so.  Well if your still reading the emails, here is the
person you sold it to.  If you have a chance respond back.

Thanks Dean
