Subject: 65-67 VAN

Hi people,

I saw an old van for sale. The year is somewhere between 65 and 67.
It has the split window in front and the single bench seat in the front.
There is the rust in the typical locations.It doesn't have an engine.
Any hints on what engine might fit in this old classic?
Would a 70's engine fit in this year of van?

Your response is greatly appreciated.
