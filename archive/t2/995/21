The RA08 is on the Hankook USA website (admittedly, it's not easy to find.  You have to click on
Products, Tires, then Passenger Car, then Passenger.  Or just search by the 185R14 tire size to
pull them up):

I bought a set last summer at a tire dealer near where I work... found them using the dealer
search on the Hankook website.  Didn't have any trouble at all.  Went to the dealer, asked for a
set of RA08 tires in 185R14, waited a few days for them to come in, had them installed.  And this
is in the middle of cornfield Indiana.  I'd hope it would be just as easy in WA.
