Some are, some of us are less so.   LiveonJG has strong opinions
about things and isn't afraid of pissing people off by expressing
them .. even when those opinions are wrong. :-)

My objections to that particular setup (which I kept to myself; stayed
out of that thread) have to do with the extremely poor execution of the
installation.  The exposed fan is potentially quite dangerous, and
having the entire system hanging out in the is a disaster waiting to
happen.  And I'm not even gonna start on the wires (and tach)
hanging under the dash...
