Subject: Exhaust manifold for a 79

 Hello folks.  I need help and I am looking for a right side exhaust  manifold
at a reasonable price.  The bus is not with me now, but I also may need the
left if available (Might as well be prepared).
79 transporter
I live in Colorado (Steamboat Springs)
Thanks!!
