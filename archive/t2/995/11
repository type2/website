Subject: Bentley wanted

	Bookshops here don't stock the fabled Bentley, and quote vast 
prices for importing one.
	If anyone has a spare used copy, of an edition suitable for 
my 1600DP with disc front brakes and alternator, I'd be glad to hear 
(off-list).  Enough friends travel between NZ & the USA that we 
wouldn't have to give any bank a $15 rakeoff for the payment  ...

thanx
