I put a set of Hankook's from the Bus Depot on my buddy's '75 Westy 
right before we left for Everybus 2007, and all I can say is that the 
difference in handling was incredible. Previously it had a mis-matched 
set of passenger tires on it, and after the RA08's were put on, the 
handling in cross winds was so much better. We drive over a bridge 
every day to get to work and it can get some pretty nasty cross winds. 
  I would _highly_ recommend the RA08's for any Bus.

Hope this helps,
