For Bill and list archive,

Here are the sidewall markings on the RA08s:

Hankook RA08
8 P.R. Load Range D
2 steel + 2 polyester + 1 nylon tread plies
2 polyester sidewall plies
Max load 1874 lbs (-at-) 65 p.s.i. cold

My jack is currently holding up the engine in my wife's car so I'm unable
to get a circumference measurement for the tires.  Maybe someone else can
help with that.
