Geez Tony - no smartass remarks? Huh!
Yes, I have been concerned about that issue. The
bottom line though, is whether the column of water is
just too much for the pump to keep circulating in all
conditions. It is unlikely to damage the pump as it is
not anywhere near a positive displacement aparatus.
What likely happens is that the pump cavitates and
spins without much effect on the water column. That is
in my opinion, the drawback of my front radiator
system. If I keep the front radiator I may end up
having to add a supplemental water pump. That
complicates what is otherwise a really simple
conversion. It could be that my selection of 1.25"
pipe is the problem and that 1" pipe may actually keep
the coolant flowing all the time due to higher
velocity and less mass to the column. I'm not certain,
but I think the wasserboxers used 1" coolant pipes.
Maybe some physics-types will offer their opinions
here? -BaH

    The only caveat I have with any of this is just
 how much you're gonna
    stress/overstress the water pump...The pump was
 designed to work
    in conjunction with the normal thermosyphoning of
 the radiator and I'd
    be leery of just how much you can "push" the
 stock water pump... ?-(
