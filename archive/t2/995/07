Thank you for the tips, I checked the plugs, fond 1 loose, which didn't 
solve the problem, but seemed to make it much happier running on all 4. 
Then to follow up on the vacuum suggestion I took a gander at Richard 
Atwell's excellent hose diagrams and found a few missing components as 
well as some completely in incorrect places (it's a wonder it ran to 
begin with). After a short trip to the parts store for some hose she 
farts like a kitten.

Again my thanks,
-Andrew
