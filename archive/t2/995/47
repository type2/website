Subject: RE: [T2] Front end overhaul parts list

If it ain't broke, I wouldn't fix it.  Top to bottom movement is either
bearings or balljoints, front to back is tie rods, drag link, laying under bus
while someone turns wheel up and down movement in pivot arm is bad.
If you are unsure about bearing/balljoint, spin tire while holding trailing
arm, you will feel the vibration of a bad bearing.
When your steering damper goes, it will catch your attention pretty quick when
you hit a bump at speed.  If there is no sign of leakage, detach one end and
try and compress it by hand.  If it goes in easy, replace.If you have money to
burn, I could send you my Xmas list.JT Beaufort, SCRunning: 1. 62 404.1
