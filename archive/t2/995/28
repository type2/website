Hi Bill

I live in Australia & fitted 2 x RA-08's to the rear wheels of our 78  
camper.

Previously had Sava 185R/14 on rear & Bridgestone 185-70 14 on the  
front.

Replaced the Bridgestones (which had only done about 10,000 kms) because
the front end wandered too much & the load rating was incorrect  
(thank you to
the list!).

Moved the Sava to the front & put the new RA-08s on the back.  Now  
have almost
no side sway in the wind (& we get some really strong  winds here)  
and wander is
almost negligable with allowance for steering play.

Back end has never stepped out in any circumstances despite the odd  
time entry
speed was greater than it should have been.

Have done about 7,000 kms on them so far & very happy.  We run 42psi  
normally
all year round.

Hope this helps
