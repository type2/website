Subject: Front Wheel Bearings

Hey all,

I was wondering if anyone had a good, detailed, write-up on removing/replacing the front wheel bearings on a late bay.

I would appreciate it, as I need to tackle this very soon.

Also, if I cannot find a kit with everything I need (shopping locally), what individual parts do I need to buy?

Thanks
