Yup.

195s.

I always run my tires toward the maximum recommend inflation printed on
the sidewalls, rather than what VWoA recommends for the car.  Pressure
checked with tires cold.

>Did you take the one tire back to your local Hankook dealer?
Nope, we were on a trip and I didn't have the receipt with me.  Oh well.

>Did you make any other changes to your van at the same time (i.e.

None.  Just replaced the tires, no other handling changes.

The effect I noticed was only in cross-winds and being passed by semis.
In other conditions the car seemed to drive normally on the RA08s, except
when the RF tire came apart.  Now THAT was exciting at freeway speed...
:)

This was all on a 5K mile trip to Canada that I took last summer.  The car
made it to within 150 miles of home when it dropped a valve.  It's
been here sitting since then.  Sigh.
