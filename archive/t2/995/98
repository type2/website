Subject: OIl Cooling

Hey guys,

       I think I'd like to start driving my Bus a bit more now that I've, for the most part, finished it. I'm nervous about proper cooling, and I'd like to know what some things I can do to improve cooling, and add more oil capacity. 

I have a GEX 1800 (yeah, I know). I've had to replace ALL the valve trane components after their "rebuild", but once I got that done, it actually runs quite well. However, after driving it for a little while, it's so hot that I can't even touch the oil dipstick. I don't know if this is normal or not. Because of that, I haven't really driven it long distances to maybe anywhere other than the grocery store or something.

I have ALL the correct tin work installed, as well as the proper flaps and the springs. The oil cooler that's on there now looks a bit old, but it doesn't leak. Is there a larger capacity oil cooler that I can install? How about one that's external from the fan ducting? Is it ok to run the motor without an oil cooler in the engine tin air-flow passage? 

Are there larger capacity oil pans for our motors? And if so, will I need to change out the oil pickup?


Thanks guys!
