Bill, did you happen to take a look at Richard Atwell's page on bus tires?

http://www.ratwell.com/technical/TirePhotos.html

The page has information on things like sidewall ply construction.
For example, for the Hankook RA-08 (which I also have in 185R14), it
has:

Tread plies:  2 poly + 2 steel + 1 nylon
Sidewall plies: 2 poly

I would imagine that the 195R14s are constructed the same as the 185R14s.

The page also has a link to the Hankook RA-08 product page, which has
dimensional information like total diameter and revs/mile for both the
195R14 and 185R14.
