Devin,

Give Chris at BustedBus a parts request or email.

I am sure he has a couple around and he is located just outside of Golden.

 Hello folks.  I need help and I am looking for a right side exhaust
manifold
at a reasonable price.  The bus is not with me now, but I also may need the
left if available (Might as well be prepared).
