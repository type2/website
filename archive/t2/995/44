Hello folks.  I need help and I am looking for a
right side exhaust  manifold at a reasonable price. 
The bus is not with me now, but I also may need the
left if available (Might as well be prepared).

Thanks!!

79's do not have a right side manifold, Federal or
Calif.
They have one piece heater boxes like 72-74 except
they have flat flanges. [79 Calif uses a manifold on
the left side and 79 Fed uses a one piece heater box
on the left].
