Subject: Eating clutch cables...help ?

My '71 westy has been through three clutch cables in less than a year.

Everything looks fine, the clutch arm moves freely, the cable moves 
easily (before I put the adjusting nut on).

The clutch is really light too, yet the cables are physically snapping 
at the ends.  There does seem to be a lot of end float before take-up on 
the clutch lever (on the tranny).  Is this just a worn plate or 
something like an incorrect release bearing,  too thin perhaps ?

Any advice appreciated, as I don't want to keep carrying around multiple 
spare cables : )
