Subject: 73 beetle question - hot voltage regulator...

Sorry to try you all again with a type 1 question, but not getting a lot of
help from samba.  I have recently purchased a 73 beetle and was getting what
looked to be a short as the oil and fasten seatbelt lights would flicker
while running and at times would stay on with the key out of the ignition.
I noticed to night when this happend that moving the cables connecting to
the voltage regulator shut them off.  The regulator was very, very hot.
Does this mean it is going boots up?  It was so hot the rubber insulation
was partially melted.  Seems like a fairly inexpensive solution, but want to
make sure before I tear things apart.  Any suggestions?

Also, has anyone come up with a good way to protect the battery and the
regulator under the back seat.  Looks like one of the springs actually
touched the positive terminal at one point (maybe that is why the regulator
is in bad shape?).  Having owned a 71 bus for 12 years, I can't believe the
design.

Thanks for any input,

Brian
