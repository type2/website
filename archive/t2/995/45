 Hey All,
 
 I'm having trouble finding those black plastic clips
 that hold some of the interior panels on (side door
 and rear hatch panels).  These are the round black
 ones that push through from the exterior of the
 panel,
 not the funny shaped metal clips found behind the
 panels most VWs.
 
 Any ideas?
 
 TIA,
 
  
 
 Rick
