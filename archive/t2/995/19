Subject: Bus Tires

I have the Hankook RA-08 on my bus right now, and I am happy with them. 
  The local tire dealer (a mom & pop place) was able to find them OK.

Prior to that, I had the Bridgestone RD-603 and liked them just fine, 
too.  I also found them at a local mom & pop place (in Coalfield, TN).  
I seem to remember them saying that postal trucks use them.

I don't live in a cultural mecca.  This part of the country is often 
considered behind the times. What  gives with the difficulty for 
getting the correct tires?
