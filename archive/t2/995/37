Subject: Front end overhaul parts list

I'm trying to compile a parts/price list to overhaul my front end. I
got this bus 7 years ago. It has apx 220,000 miles on it. its  a '74
Westy. I never touched the front end aside for lubrication.When I push
inward on the passenger front wheel there is a clank. The ball joints
look good, no tears. I'm thinking its a bearing but haven't gotten in
there to confirm. I want to tear it down and rebuild more for peace of
mind than anything else. It's a safety concern. Heres what I'm looking
to replace. Please let me know whats missing:

I haven't decided on a sway bar. I might use the stock one with a new
mount kit. Where can i get the red urethane ones with those spiffy
newer style "T" clamps?

This bus is a driver, but as soon as my '62 bus resto is complete I'm
going to restore her...probably some time next summer. I planned on
doing all this then, but due to the clanking I'm going to do it now.

The steering is pretty tight, maybe 1-2 inches of play in the wheel. I
don't intend on doing the relay arm shaft or replacing the steering
box unless its still an issue after replacing the above.(maybe during
the future restoration). I also have a pair of the "HD" German boge
shocks from bus depot and a pair on hankook RA08 tires awaiting
installation.

Where can i get new torsion arm grease seals? didn't see them on bus
depot or bus-boys (those are my vendors of choice, in that order)

Does this look like a complete list of parts? Anyone know of any
better deals? I've read a few list member pages on this procedure,
great stuff. I've done a lot of front end work on buses in the past,
but nothing this comprehensive.

thanks
