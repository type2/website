For a good Type 1 list go to 
_http://lists.topica.com/lists/VintagVW/?cid=149_ (http://lists.topica.com/lists/VintagVW/?cid=149)    for directions to join 
the VintagVW group.  There are a lot of helpful  people there.  Seems like 
this is a unique problem though that may require  some good prints, a meter, and 
some time.  The vintagebus.com site has Bus  and Bug schematics in color.
