Subject: Re: [T2] parcel tray stuff

Try needlepoint mats- varying hole sizes, can be cut to fit and laced 
into place.  Our original trays (German) we laced up (as in darning a 
sock) with dental floss!  I suppose you could punch holes around a piece 
of leather or leatherette and lace that to the edges?  idea is to keep 
it flexible in case of knee impact...
