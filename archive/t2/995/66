Subject: Re: [T2] 73 bus with 83 subaru engine so far so good!

I have the "variable radiator" installed now, but it
does me no good as the "new" engine has something
strange about it and wants to run 10-15 degrees hotter
than the previous engine. I should know more about
that by next week.

I suspect you're right about finned copper, but
there's something easier already available thanks to
portable tradeshow display folks - aluminum extrusions
with all the fins you may need already attached: 
http://www.fogasystem.com/2.asp either profile 66 or
88.
All that is needed is to weld a nipple on each end.
I would be trying these things but I really like to
drive it whenever possible! -BaH

 Altho' Richard is laconic about difficulties with
 water piping, I 
 imagine he's had his share, as has our other 100 mph
 Soobaroo 
 convert.  And displaying a radiator on the front may
 tend to spoil 
 the 'hot VW' image.
    I wonder whether a radiator is really needed. 
 Finned copper piping 
 (which I merely assume to exist  -  you'd think I'm
 an economist) in 
 a loop to a heater by the driver's feet i.e a small
 radiator might 
 get rid of the heat well enough?  The mini-radiator
 would presumably 
 take the full flow, and be "turned off" by a flap
 ducting the hot air 
 from it away from the cab.  I loosely guesstimate
 that the total 
 finned metal in this layout would roughly equal
 what's in a Subaru 
 radiator.
