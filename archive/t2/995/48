Subject: Fwd: [T2] Interior Panel Clips?

There is a place here in Arlington Texas, called "The Bug Stop" that seems to have all of those hard-to-find items... And they are very nice and helpful

www.texasbugstop.com
3622 Graves Blvd
Pantego, Texas 76013
817-274-7890

There is also a place in Grand Prairie Texas, more of a mechanic than a shop, the guy that runs it is sort of a grumpy old SOB, but he's got a stash of misc parts like that too.

I'm not advertising, or endorsing them... Just another resource for you.

Hope it helps
Chris
