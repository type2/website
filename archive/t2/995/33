Subject: Thanks for Hankook tire reviews...

I want to thank those of you with experience with Hankook RA-08 195 series
tires who replied to my query about how they handled.  It sounds like all of
you are delighted with them and many said they would buy them again.  As to my
recent sidewall question, on the side of your Hankook 195 series tire, what
does it say on the tire about the sidewall plys? (i.e.; my Michelins say
"sidewall 2 Rayon plys").

Again, thanks for the replies and reviews, I'm feeling much better about the
RA-08's because of many of you out there.

Bill Bowman
