how many miles on the engine??

after a rebuild they will run very hot for the first few thousand miles as
they seat the new bearings and pistons etc.

I change oil after a rebuild at
15 minutes no driving
100 miles
300 miles
1,000 miles
3,000 miles and switch at this point from regular to synthetic

then your regular oil change schedule. if you have afilter change it when
you change the oil.

good luck, I had terrible experience with GEX, hope you got one of the
mistakes that were actually made right
