You are working with people who probably special-order tires more often
than the shops in more urban areas.

Here most of the counter people either don't know how to special-order a
tire or don't want to go to the trouble to do so.  They'll push us to buy
something that they have in stock, sometimes to the point of refusing to
get the tires we actually want whether they are available or not.
