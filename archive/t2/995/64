   Other than the obvious screws on the
door pulls and lock, there's a screw on
the window winder (under the plastic
cover). The perimeter of the door lin-
ing has a lot of clips under the vinyl.
If you feel with your fingertips, you
can feel them. Prying the lining straight
out from the door will release each one 
as you go around the perimeter. The 
metal clips WILL probably survive, but
the old rubber grommet underneath
probably won't... ;-(
