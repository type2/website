Subject: Type 1 questions?  A short.

I have both a 71 bus and recently purchased a 73 beetle.  I am having a
problem with a short in the beetle that causes my oil and fasten seatbelt
light to stay on even with the engine off and key out.  I thought it was an
aftermarket radio that was added.  I completely ripped it out after
discovering that it looked like a 2nd grader did the wiring job, but no
luck.  I have found a wiring diagram on the web, but the coloring appears to
be off.  Can someone direct me to a group for Type 1?  I have used this
group for Type 2 and had lots of luck.

It would seem to be simple as these are the two things that are on, but I
must be missing something.  Hoping someone has seen these symptoms before.

Thanks
