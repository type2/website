I like the stock jack too.  The place that people get into trouble is that
they think that the jack will take fore-and-aft loads.  As long as you
properly chock the opposite wheels the stock jack is easy to use.

Now, the bug "monkey climbing a tree" jack is another story.  That's why I
have a bus jack in my bug, too!
