If it is  the seal for the oil temp indicator, that makes a lot of sense  to
me.




hello alan  Thanks for including the needed info and name. makes  things a 
lot easier and personal. :)  It isn't a seal but a sender unit for  your dash 
lite and dave gave a good idea of what  and where it is  located.. Also when the 
fan seal was replaced did they do the o ring that is  behind that hub??  The 
oil cooler is kinda a PITA job. Some do this in the  bus and it isn't very 
easy to do that way,  but I tend to remove the engine  and just go ahead and do 
the other seals at the same time. I have seen a few oil  coolers themselves 
leak,but that is kinda rare.   later  mark  dearing
