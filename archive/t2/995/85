Going to the first site that came up on doing a google search on "finned
tubing", this site http://www.fintube.com/ has some really interesting stuff
that may work quite well. Also, you may be able to find the finned tubing in
some kind of salvage industrial heat exchanger. If it is steel, you can weld
it into rows with weldable u-bend steam pipe fittings available at any good
plumbing supply store or sweat solder copper fittings if it is copper
tubing.
