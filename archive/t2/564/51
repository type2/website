Subject: Fuel Injectors

Stock '79 2.0L WITH CALIFORNIA EMISSIONS.  This means that there is no 
resistor block for the injectors.  Are these injectors the same (i.e. 
same part number) as the '75-78  injectors that use the resistor block?

Can anybody recommend a place to purchase new ones?  I read awhile back 
that Autozone carried these for like $35.  Is this true and do these 
work well?

Thanks
Tim
