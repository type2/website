If you run a type4 engine with the heater boxes or manifolds installed but
the muffler removed you will not damage anything except your hearing.

If you run a type1 engine without the muffler or a type4 engine without
the heater boxes/manifold pipes you are very likely to damage the engine.

The reason for this is that you need to protect the exhaust valve stems
from exposure to low-temperature air while they are cooling. If you do so
expose them while they are hot then the stems are very likely to warp and
stick.  You need at least 10cm (6"?) of tubing leading away from the
exhaust ports to retain warm air around the stem.  The heater boxes
or manifolds provide this service on the type4 engine.  On a type1 engine
the muffler itself provides this protection to the two rear cylinders.

                             OOK!
