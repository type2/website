Jon,

These tires are a fairly new product, I believe. John Baird has had them for
a couple of months and is tickled with them. When I saw them on his bus last
month I asked him how he liked them and his response (and the price) was
plenty enough to sway me towards them instead of the Bridgestone Desert
Duelers I have used in the past. Plus the product info about these tires on
Continental's website even says "for the Volkswagen vans".

If you hear any more info about these tires pass it on, as I hope to replace
the dinky car tires the po put on my bus soon.
