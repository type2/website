Subject: Cooling tin parts

I'm looking for some engine compartment/tin parts. Bustedbus.com doesn't 
have stock -- where are the other good places to find bit.

For the curious, these would be for a 71 bus

211-119-515 firewall
113-119-419 Doghouse exit duct
113-119-431 Doghouse lower exit duct
113-119-533 Small pulley tin breastplate
113-119-523 Large pulley tin
