David,

Uh-oh...now ya gone and done it....
It's gonna be a loooong horespower vs torque day.


http://vettenet.org/torquehp.html

Yes, in a certain sense, horsepower accelerates a bus...because
horsepower is calculated from the rpm and torque numbers.


More torque, then your hp numbers are gonna be higher...same torque at 
higher rpm==more hp.

"Horsepower sells cars, torque wins races."....wellll...maybe...

Read the tutorial above...takes a while to sink in, but it makes sense.
And don't skipp to the bottom before ya read the top!


Cheers, dave
