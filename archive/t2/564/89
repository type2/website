Subject: Re: [T2] Brake light switch?

Don.....Those switches on the mastercylinder are your stop light switches. I 
just
replaced them on my bus last week. They get cranky after awhile and don't 
work.
One of mine was even leaking fluid through the switch.  They are cheap to 
replace.
My 2 cost 11 bucks for both at a local Bug House parts place.
