Subject: starting and warm up

Hi,

When I start my 2.L FI westy it usually starts up in a couple seconds.
But there are times when it is slower; I usually give it a bit of gas.
Is this a bad idea? Then how long is it good to let it warm up? Is it
bad if you let it warm up too long? Just curious.

Peace

Meg
