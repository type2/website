My friend ( actually, I don't have any 'friends', this is just an easier way 
of addressing a person.  They say it's lonely at the top; but it's just as 
crappo at the bottom) is planning to make a board setup to test fuel 
injectors, and he is considering using an emergency flasher unit to provide 
the pulses.

Comments??
