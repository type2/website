Subject: This ain't no bad bus

I have a 71 Weekender that I find I must part with. The mechanics are good with lots of new parts. Ugly dark grey paint job that needs to be re-done, but it runs and drives great. Extra 71 Westfalia parts bus available maybe. I've invested lots of money to get it right mechanically. Now if someone can do the body....... $1500 or trade for truck of equal value. Western NC. email me at vwbaybus(-at-)yahoo.com.
