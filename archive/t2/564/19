With all the Bosch Jetronics of the 1970s and early 80s, the way to go 
is to turn the key to the start position for just an instant. Then turn 
to the off position. Then back to start and let it crank. I was taught 
this for Volvos -- the notion is that it "charges up" the fuel ring -- 
and it works equally well with my bus (although the VW starting circuit 
requires turning the key to the off position before going back to 
start).

For all I know, this is a superstition. But it always seems to work, so 
I go on doing it.
