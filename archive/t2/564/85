Subject: Brake light switch?

My brake lights suddenly stopped working at some point after I bought the 
bus and before Tuesday.

I checked the fuses (turn signal one was bad, and found out why my 
headlights were wonky) but nothing wrong there. Applied 12v to the sockets 
directly, lights lit. Much of the wiring has been mis-replaced (my infamous 
Hippy Wired Bus) so the colors don't match anything anymore. There's no 
switch around the pedal itself, and what a joy it was putting the skid plate 
back on, but there are two switches on the master cylinder. Could one or 
both of them be the brake light switch? I pulled the plugs off and jumpered 
around to see, but no joy.

Bus sets again... At least it will start up so I can move it on street 
sweeping day! LoL
