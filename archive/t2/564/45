With all due respect, it is horsepower that accelerates a bus, not 
torque.  If your engine is producing 30hp, it will always accelerate at a 
known rate (I'll leave the calcs to the physics guys).  If it is producing 
80 lb/ft of torque, how fast will the bus accelerate?  Answer: no way of 
knowing unless you know the RPM of the engine at that point... and when you 
factor in RPM it becomes... HORSEPOWER.  :-)

I think you mean that the horizontally opposed T4 engine has relatively 
good low-end torque, which makes the engine perform better (i.e. more hp) 
at lower rpms than the peak hp would suggest.
