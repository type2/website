Subject: joe back at bustebus

Hello folks,

Joe here at bustedbus again. I took a little time off, shorter than expected
only a year and a few months, but hey it is great to be back. I have been
cleaning things up around the shop to get back up to speed. I look forward
to keeping up with the list, learning all I can and contributing from time
to time.

I have burning the midnight oil getting a resto out the door for Andrew. (A
show winning bay window, green '69 delux at vw on the greens this year in
Golden, CO) . I'll update the resto section of our site with some more
photos.

Tyler Travis is back over seeing parts orders so, we should be getting stuff
out the door faster and responding to those emails a little sooner.

We have a new toll free line 1-877-TYPE211 and now take Amex, and Discover
as well as the usual Visa and MC

Take care and we'll see you on the list.
