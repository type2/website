Hi Paul,
	VW changed the torsion bars in '72. The ends of the torsion bars are 
larger, which means your torsion bars (inner and outer) will not fit. 
Neither will the spring arm which comes down from them to the bearing 
housing. The bearing housings also changed in '72. The elbow piece going 
back to the torsion tube remains the same. I guess this would make it 
the only interchangeable part. One of the two bearings in each axle 
changed, also. The larger one stays the same. Keep in mind you'll need 
either a press or a piece of brass pipe to drive the outer bearing races 
in and out of the bearing housings. Also, you'll need a good size 
internal circlip plier.
	One word of warning. I reset the torsion bars on my bus last weekend. 
I've had a heck of a time finding a shop to reset the rear end
alignment. Make sure you have somebody around there that can do it
before you start. Out of twelve I called, eleven said that it couldn't
even be done (which is rubbish--the Bentley manual outlines the
procedure). I finally found a VW guy at Pep boys who grew up in
California who can do them.
