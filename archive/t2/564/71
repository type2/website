Subject: My bus has to go.

Greetings.

I am sorry to have to post this to the mailing list, but I have a 1971 
VW camper bus w 169k on it. It is in need of a wiring harness and has 
just sat on my property too long and my land lord said it had to go. I 
need to have a plan on what to do with it by Monday.

The engine runs great, it has good tires around, and the camping 
equipment inside is in great shape. It is not a pop top. The rocker 
panels are rusted through like usual, and the front of the bus where the 
window mounts above the dash is rusted as usual. The battery tray is 
also rusted through, so I've relocated it to the other side.

Last year the generator quit, I saw no spark so replaced the generator. 
On my first trip (about 6 miles) the generator light came back on and 
looking in the compartment a wire is burned. I could not make it work 
and it has sat since.

I really need to get the bus out of the drive and would like to offer it 
for sale for $350.00. It is a perfectly good running bus except for the 
generator problem, however it's a brand new generator. I will also give 
the old generator to the person who wishes to buy it.

I am located in Norton, OH. It's very possible to charge the battery and 
drive it for some distance, how far I am not sure before the battery 
dies because of not being charged.

Please let someone be interested :)
