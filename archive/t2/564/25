Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Booster ?

If you are looking for the sleeves that go inside the clear vaccum line at
every end - I jsut got a few of these from busdepot. Took a while though -
apparently they do not have them in stock regularly. If you need them right
now, I can ask my girlfriend to dig them out - my replacement hose is the
braided type so will not need them myself most likely.

I believe this is the part number for the 12mm hose sleeve: 211 611 833C
Grommet ($1.81 at Busdepot, #79 in the microfiche). I think these are the
plastic clamps used on the clear line: 211 611 403 A Clip ($1.77, #78 in the
microfich). If you need them right away - p-mail me and my girlfriend can
send mine to you. I have six of each.

#63 is a grommet of some sort (maybe a bracket) in the fresh air line
somewhere around the wheel arch.

I could not find #76. If my memory serves me correctly - there is the nipple
in the booster that the line connects to. Sleeve #79 is slide into the end
of the line and the while thing is clamped with #78. Same thing for all
connections, including the check valve and the manifold or balance tube
connections.

Is there anybody that has replaced these lately or know anyone that might
supply them? For clarification:
I am looking for the rubber bushings or sleeves that work with the Brake
Booster Ridgid Plastic Vacuum Lines. 12mm and 17mm.
