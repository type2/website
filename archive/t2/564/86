Subject: Fwd: [VB] Karl's 66 Deluxe - Ouch! 

Bad news gang, read Harry's report.  Two months ago
we were standing in front of Karl's place while he was giving me the rundown on this bus.  He seemed pretty stoked about it.  

Sucks, but it sounds like Karl is okay, and that's the whole deal.

Harry, hope you don't mind that I forwarded this to type2, I think volks will want to know.

Karl t-boned a car that cut in front of him. He was tossed out the driver's door and woke up 5-10 minutes later with bumps, bruises and a cut ear. 
He's standing, but the bus won't be back on the road. Guess he'll take it apart and haul the pieces down to OCTO next week.
