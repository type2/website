Subject: free 1972 bus-- Connecticut

Hi folks:

Our dog's vet has a '72 bus that has been sitting on his property for 
years. He wants to get rid of it, and will give it away free to whoever 
will take it.

It is in very rough condition, I think it is probably only useful as a 
parts bus-- he's been using it as a sort of shed for storing garbage. I 
don't know how long it has sat, but probably for years, and it appears 
to have been in some sort of accident. It would need to be flat bedded 
out.

However, the engine and transmission are there, a lot of the chrome and 
all of the glass, and he tells me he has the title. He offered it to 
me, and I certainly would have taken it if I had something of that 
approximate vintage.

It is located in Madison, Connecticut. If you are interested you may 
contact him directly. His name is M. L. Yousef and his telephone number 
is 203-245-3434.
