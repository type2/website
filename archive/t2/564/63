Your right Dave--

Horepower as nothing to do with the torque output of any engine.

However---cubic inches, and stroke have a bunch that factors in here.

Case in Point--any farm tractor--of yore.

How about a John Deere A for instance.

The tractor only is putiing out maybe 40 horse at the draw bar---but due
the 3 ft. stroke and the coffee can sized pistons--it's cranking out
mugumbo torque number's--

It's the mechanical advantage of the length of the stroke and the size
of the holes that dictates the torque figures--not HP---Not RPM.
