Ahh--

86 to 91 2.1 Wasserleaker's have 95 hp (-at-) 4800 rpm--up 16% from the
1.9's.

This is direct outa a VW Service and spec's bulletin.

RE: [T2] Horsepower Numbers 
Probably, I think a 2.0 Vanagon Wasserboxer had only about 83hp in 1990? 
... 
Is this right? 
http://www.tunacan.net/t4/reference/case.htm 
The range of HP from the 1.7 to the 2.0 is 63 to 70 in the Type2's? 
There's gotta be more to the 2.0 than that...
