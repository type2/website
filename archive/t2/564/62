this is correct. there is no such thing as "priming" the fuel system on a
fuel injected VW bus. the pump only works when the starter is turning or if
the engine is running. the fuel pressure builds very rapidly and a properly
tuned engine should fire almost immediately, or at least within two or three
revs of the starter motor.
