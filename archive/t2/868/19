Subject: Bosch SVDA distributor for sale

Hello,

You may remember me as the fellow who bought the wrong distributor for my
Vanagon a couple of weeks ago :D Thanks to the kindness of Karl, I'm set up
with the correct part, and now I'd like to get rid of the incorrect part.

The exact part that I bought is this:

http://cbperformance.com/catalog.asp?ProductID=1348

It's brand new in its VW parts box. CB Performance sells it for $99.95
before taxes and shipping - I'm willing to sell it on for $90 plus your
actual shipping costs from 94040 (California). You can pay with Paypal if
you like, and I'll wrap it up tonight and ship it first thing tomorrow :)
Happy to send pics or more info if you like.

Cheers!
Mike.
