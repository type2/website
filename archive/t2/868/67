Subject: Re: [T2] did i get the wrong starter

Sounds like it.  But first, it would help to know the following:

Year of the Bus
Manual or Automatic Trans?

Only then can a proper answer be given.

Speculation:  Sounds like you have a 76-79 Bus w/Manual Trans based on the
"091" (Bosch SR87X) of the starter number.  The "003" (SR17X) Starter is for
automatic transmission models.
