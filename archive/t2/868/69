Subject: Checking out 85 Westy on Saturday, your thoughts?

Hi list thanks for all the good advice for checking over the vehicle. 
Here's an excerpt from an email from the owner, the shop he refers to is
the one Ron Salmon vouches for.  I spoke to one of the mechanics that
remembered the owner, and he said it is in good shape and the current
owner did all required maintenance.

"Looks like I'll be able to run the van up to Lehman's on Friday
afternoon for a coolant system pressure test and a look over.
You asked about repairs done: besides the clutch/transmission, I had
some suspension work done (ball joints, tie rods, CV boots, etc) and
some other new parts put in (muffler, starter, brake hoses, rear wheel
cylinders).  I haven't had to put any major engine work into it."

The Westy has 130k with a supposed rebuild by PO at 105k, 4-speed.

I am going to check it out Saturday, I still need to know where to check
for occult rust...

Thanks alot for any help...
