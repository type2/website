Subject: ADMIN: Recent PayPal phishing emails

All,

Recently, both the VintageBus and Type2 lists have gotten a few
"phishing" emails, purportedly from PayPal.  The admins have removed
the subscriptions that were allowing these emails to make it to the
lists, and are working on ways to prevent a reoccurence.

In general, no legitimate company will send you an email that requests
you to log in and "confirm" or "validate" your account number, password,
PIN, etc.  If you're not sure, look up the company's phone number on
your own (don't use a number presented in a suspicious email) and call
the company yourself to verify the request for information.

Thanks!

Matt Roberds
