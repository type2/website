Okay,
     Finally got the email problems worked out and just got the pictures in.
I re-examined the pictures and the wire in question is NOT the positive
battery lead which is supposed to lead to the starter.

here is the first pic

This is looking down into engine hatch.  You can see the positive cable
just to the left of the other red wire which is leading into the voltage
regulator.

Sorry bout the angle.  I didn't get the connection where this wire comes
into the harness that connects into the alternator, I am going to try and
get some better pictures tomorrow.

Anyone got any ideas?
