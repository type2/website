Subject: Clutch cable broke prematurely

The last time I had the engine out (71 bus), I replaced just about all 
of the clutch components. New clutch plate, disk, throwout bearing, 
clutch pedal lever, cable, bowden tube. Even sent the bellhousing out to 
be rebuilt (i.e. disassembled, cleaned, relubed, reassembled). Used lots 
of grease when installing the cable (at least I got a lot on my hands!) 
There has been less than 5000 miles on the car since the work was done. 
A few days ago, I noticed that shifting was difficult and the clutch 
pedal free play was quite excessive. I got it home and had to tighten 
the cable wing nut 5 or so turns to get the free play right. I was a 
little apprehensive and sure enough the next day the cable snapped while 
I was driving. (Glad I had Muir in the car to remind me how to drive 
without the clutch!) Got it apart this morning and the cable had snapped 
right at the front where it goes into the clevis.

Because of all the new parts, the very last thing I expected at this 
point was clutch problems, so before I put a new cable in is there 
anything I should look for? I.e. are some cable brands inferior to 
others like many other bus parts? If so what are the good ones? Also 
should the lever on the clutch pedal (that the clevis pin goes through) 
point upward or downward when it is installed? Mine points up. Any other 
thoughts?

Sincere Thanks,
