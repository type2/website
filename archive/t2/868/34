Subject: oil temp guage

OK, guys.  My electrical problem recurred when I hooked the temp  sender back up.  Come to find out, there is a wire that was  partially left bare going into the connector.  When I pulled the  guage loose from the dash, it contacted ground and blew the fuse.   I bent the connectors around as it was blowing the fuse as soon as I  put it in.  Went through several fuses before I figured it  out.  It gets power for the light off of one fuse and to the guage  off another.  
  
  But something is not right.  When you turn on the headlights, the  guage nails to the right.  350+.  Other than that, it's  reading too high.  Unlike Chai, I don't think I'm running that  hot.  I can touch the dipstick and not burn myself and the engine  compartment is staying pretty cool. But the guage will be reading over  300.   Did the guy that put this guage in reverse the hot wire  with the sensor wire?  And the schematic (VDO website) shows  separate ground connections for the guage versus the light in the  guage.  This one has a jumper between the two and only one ground  wire.  Should I run a separate ground wire for the light?   Annoying!    Thanks....KR
