not being able to view the photos on this e-mail site I am going to
venture a guess that it may be the auto transmission accelerator link to
the transmission for the kick down etc.

the auto tranny bus has a  totally different accelerator linkage, the
cable from the pedal goes to the tranny and not the engine. there is a
solid rod from the trans to the engine.
