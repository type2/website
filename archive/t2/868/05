I believe that this is what happened however I did not have to disconnect
the battery to make it stop.  It looks like the wire just got really hot.
No other wires seem to be affected, just the one heading to the starter so I
am not so sure that its shorted out since it stopped shorting when I turned
the bus off.

I am still waiting for pictures and hopefully I can provide some later
today.
