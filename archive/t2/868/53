I think its the EGR pipe, actually.  Blame my bad descriptions. 
So, maybe it was supposed to hook up on the RH side of that picture and
I'm confused by the different models used in the series of photos. 
There's another picture showing that rod/pipe thing connected to the
throttle body on an older FI.  This picture is labeled as  "2/8/04 EGR
pipe connects directly to early throttle body."  This picture also
appears on the vacuum hose page
(http://homepage.mac.com/ratwell/.Pictures/FI/39-EGRPipe.jpg).

Does the other end of the pipe (I called it a rod before, sorry)
connect to the head or to emissions equipment?  I'm trying to figure
out how this bit figures into the whole thing.  The type2 library,
especially the Bartnik Jetronic Reference and RAtwell's vacuum hose
page, really explains everything else very well.  I guess the fact that
its not hooked up in that first picture
(http://homepage.mac.com/ratwell/.Pictures/FI/21-EGRRod.jpg) has me
confused and wondering about its purpose.
Thanks for your patience,
