Subject: FI noob - what's this for

I've noticed in the pictures of different FI systems on different
busses, there is this metal rod that comes from the driver's side and
goes either to the plenum or under it.  Not surprisingly, some of the
best detail can be found on RAtwell's site.  On the vacuum hoses page,
it can be seen in the overhead picture, but I can't tell where it
terminates.  I have looked through the fuel injection pictue album on
his site (http://homepage.mac.com/ratwell/Parts/PhotoAlbum62.html), but
the spot where I thought it terminated (on the RH side of the EGR
actuating rod picture) it isn't there.  Looks like a coverplate
instead.
My question: what does this rod-thing do, what does it connect to at
each end?  Maybe if I knew what it was, I'd see where it ties into the
documentation.
