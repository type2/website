Yikes!  Just asked Geico to quote me insurance for Coos Bay, currently 
it's at $230 fro 6 mos for Angels Camp, CA.  They want $200 more for 6 
months for Coos - $436.

Trying to quote some others online...  No one wants to insure a vehicle 
older than '81?

Jeez, I thought insurance would be cheaper in OR.  Anyone have any leads?

Thanks,

Teri
