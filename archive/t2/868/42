Subject: Inner rear wheel well, where to buy repair panel?

Doing some surgery on my bus.  See pics here:

I need to obtain or fabricate the inner part of the wheel well.  Has  
anyone an idea where one can be obtained?  You can see in some of my  
pictures what I mean.  I think that there will be enough metal left  
from the wheel arch part to fab this part, but that may be a lot of  
work, brothers.

Thanks,

Bob H.
