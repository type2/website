Teri,

Try Country Companies. We live in Oregon, and our insurance is a lot
cheaper than what you are quoting below.

CC even insures our electric car (Comutacar) that most companies won't
even touch.

The major problem with CC is they make you join to Oregon Farm Bureau,
which is an annoyingly conservative anti-envirnoment organization. When we
receive their magazine, we promptly recycle it. Ooooppps, I prolly started
a flame war. Keep in mind I am pro-agriculture (sustainable).
