He who dies with the most toy's wins--your doing a pretty good job of
keeping in the running.

<< I have someone interested in my bus, and would make a nice profit,>>

A "Nice" profit or "Spectacular" profit?

If it's spectacular grab the cash and run like hell.

Either way, decent Buses are a dime a dozen.
Make the hay while the sun is shining.
Tomorrow is another day.

No---this is ultimately your final decision.

If the other 4 cars are decent, and good dependable rides, you shouldn't
even be thinking out loud on on this subject.
If they are toilets--and the Bus is decent--this is a horse of a
different color.

I'd sell everything and go buy a new Scion XB, and a Bus in better
condition than what you have.
