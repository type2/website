EGR should go between somewhere on the intake (closer to the engine
compared to the carb), connecting on the other end somewhere on the
exhaust pipe.  Exhaust gas recovery, it pulls exhaust from the pipe,
and feeds it back into the intake...  The theory is to burn unburned
fuel in the exhaust, and reduce emmisions.

There is also Air injection on some VWs, a pump on top of the engine
(connected to the crank with a belt) pumps air into the head,
underneith
the exhaust valve.  the idea is to give unburnt fuel in the exhaust
some more oxygen, so it will burn in the pipe and not emit unburned
fuel.
