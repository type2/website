It is a piece of odd VW Bus history a lot of owners aren't aware of.

...in retrospect I have a memory of my only ride in a real Bus (I don't
count my Vanagon as a bus...nice but different animals) and it has an
endearing flavor to it.  I'm doubtful we'll see such genuine efforts to
show thoughtfulness from car makers again.

Can you imagine VW offering a Toureag lunchbox to draw in today's parents?
