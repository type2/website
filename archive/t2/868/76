 I thought the automatic starter does not rely on the bushinged mount in
the bell and thus is a "fit all" starter?

That's only the bus automatic. The one for a Type 3 is different, isn't it?
(311 part number)

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The self-supporting starter will work on all EXCEPT the bus with 228mm flywheel. That will be 76 and up with
the 091 transaxle with
the correct bellhousing.
