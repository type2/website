Subject: Re: [T2] Burned wires

As I chase this issue down I consulted the haynes manual that the PO
provided with the bus when I bought it.

On the wiring diagram there is a hand drawn line that I believe represents
the wire that burnt out on me.

heres my artistic rendition of whats in the manual

It looks like this line connects to the alternator and the battery for
some reason and the wire that burnt out may not even be a stock
configuration.  I am going to go and get some more pictures and pull the
alternator and see if I can't get the wiring harness out later today.

I'll have more pics tonight at the very least.
