Im new to this import export thing, and need some help.

Im trying to find a 1978 SMV Caravan 440 camper in Europe and have it
shipped back here.  Its the camping trailer shown in most models of
Type2s.

Here is an example:

I know that a few people have sucsessfully brought back Pucks and
Vehicles, so please allow me to pick your brain.

Thanks,

Dave.
