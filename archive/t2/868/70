Well I have determined that my alternator has an Excellent ground.

I stopped by the bus after work to take some pics and really tore into her.
Pulled the alternator out again and found out what happened.

The back cover to my alternator is missing a grommet and slowly the sharp
edge has been wearing through the heavy gauge wire that runs from the
alternator to the starter.  This is probably why it died and trying to
start it was just too much for it and it finally went.

It could have gone VERY bad though.   I discovered that the wire melted
through, and luckilly only scorched one of the fuel lines lightly.  It
appears to be fine but I will be replacing it just to be safe.  The rest
of the fuel lines have been replaced recently and are hardly even dirty
let alone stiff.

So now it looks like I get to practice my wire harness building skills.

Thanks for all the help guys I'll let you know how it turns out.  The
previous owner, while moderately skilled with a wrench left alot to be
desired on the wiring......but thats another story all together.

I'll be posting more pics to my website incase anyone wants to look at them.
