When I apprenticed years ago,, my mentor had a different "school" of thought,,

best to put the seam down,, 
cause when they start to leak, you will find the leak and replace the push rod
tube,, actually,, the owner or driver,,will spot the leak on the driveway,,,and
bring the car in for a check ...

.. The other way around,,seam up... the crankcase will breath in and out,,
dragging road dirt in,, and not leaking enough oil out to be a big deal,, so the
neglectful owner will not address the problem. 
Also....If the owner doesn't address the problem, we didn't have a car on the
hoist to repair,, :-)

This is particularly bad in a T1 as it doens't have an oil filter to remove the
road debris that gets sucked in to the crankcase .....

I dunno,, but, I would like to have an indication that the crack has developed
as soon as possible,, so, with the seam down,, you can visually inspect the seam
,, even before you see that drip on the driveway,,
