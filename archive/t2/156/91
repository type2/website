Denny,

Sorry, it is now Sunday, but yes, sometimes this method will work.

I have had good luck trying this as long as I used a bleeder cap to try 
and close the pipe going back to the mc as soon as I got the hose off 
also.  

Don't forget to lube the hose threads with brake fluid before installing!

Cheers, dave
