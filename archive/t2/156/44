Cool tools, indeed! Does anyone have experience with the Color Tune 
tester? Has anyone seen one up close?

It says there is a glass window "in the center" to allow one to view 
the action inside the head. I can't find that window on the photo.  I 
worry that it might be easy to use for a front mounted engine where 
the plugs are vertical and accessible,  but hard to use for a VW 
engine with horizontal plugs buried deep in a cramped engine 
compartment.

Any thoughts?
