and where is the current coming from to run the peltier refrigerator?  I
suspect from the alternator.  Since every joule produced by the engine
(including those to run the alternator) also produces about 3 joules of
heat, you're robbing Peter to pay Paul by using the alternator to cool the
oil!

File this in the Twilight zone under "P" for "perpetual motion machine"!
