Dave,

Did this on a 79 bug bushing when I replaced them with urethane.

Did it under the car without taking everything off.
Used a "large" screwdriver, some fancy language, and serious grunting on 
my part<grin>.  Wups, almost forgot that I got them started with a C clamp 
and just the right sized socket.....

Not sure on a bus as they are larger.
Try anything you have from a vise to a large c clamp before carting off to 
someone with a press.

Cheers, dave
