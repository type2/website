Subject: Kadron Rebuilding

I am about to embark on the rebuilding of my dual
kadron carbs on my 74 1.8. If there is anybidy who has
done this in the past who has any does and don'ts or
tips I would be most appreciative. Does anybody know 
of a manual for the kadrons, I would like to keep them
on for at least a year until I can afford to do the
engine rebuild and new carbs at the same time.
TIA
Tyler
