	Make sure that your distributor isn't 180 degrees out of whack, and that
the firing order is correct on the plug wires.  These things should be
secondary to checking the coil, plug-gap, and point gap as well.

Now, I never moved the distributor... how would it be 180 out of whack?  And
with it 180, wouldn't it start, but run poorly?  I have verified the firing
order a few times, and have replaced the other parts, setting the gap
correctly.  Is there a way to "static time" this engine?  Perhaps that would
make sure I haven't turned my distributor to the wrong place.  It's a
longshot, but a free one.
