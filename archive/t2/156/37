Subject: 68 to 71 brake light/turn signal info

Hi folks,
    A number of you informed me that the rear light on an early bay bus just
blinks as a turn signal when you have your foot on the brake AND the turn
signal switched on.  Thanks for the help.   With that info in hand I sat
down with my turn signal switch and multimeter to prove or disprove it.
Turns out you all were right.  Thanks again.
