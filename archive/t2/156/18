Because the seams are the most likely area to develop cracks first. If they 
are on top, you'll just get a bit of oil mist blowing out under crankcase 
pressure. If they are on the bottom, you can leak a quart every 100 miles. 
Less chance of lunching your motor with the most vulnerable part above gravity.
