Subject: FW: [T2] FRIDAY - Water Injection System

I have to respectfully disagree on the last...some extra heat IS generated
by the engine to drive the new cooling system, but most of this heat goes
out the tailpipe.  Some of it goes to the cooling airflow around the
cylinders, and a small part goes to the oil.  If the peltier device is
somewhat efficient, it should be able to remove more heat from the oil than
is added by the extra load required to drive it. However, a belt-driven
compressor-based system would be more efficient, since it would take the
alternator losses out of the picture.

A good analogy is trying to cool you kitchen by leaving the refrigerator
door open.  This is a closed system and won't work, cuz the fridge blows
more energy out it's radiator (into the kitchen) than it removes via the
cooling coil.  However, an air conditioner WILL cool your kitchen because
it's not a closed system...it also generates more heat than it removes, but
the waste heat goes out the window.  Our engine is a pretty open system too.

and where is the current coming from to run the peltier refrigerator?  I
suspect from the alternator.  Since every joule produced by the engine
(including those to run the alternator) also produces about 3 joules of
heat, you're robbing Peter to pay Paul by using the alternator to cool the
oil!

File this in the Twilight zone under "P" for "perpetual motion machine"!
