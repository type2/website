The clamp is loose and the distributor has raised up out of the drive. Loosen
the clamp and lift out the dist. Look down the hole and you will see the
offset in the top of the drive. Look at the bottom of the dist. You will see
the offset of the drive dog. Put the dizzy back in with the offset to match.
Hold it down [you have to push against the spring] and tighten the clamp.
Start the engine and set timing at 7.5 before.
