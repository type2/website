Subject: re: [T2] VW Adventure: My engine fell out! (long)

This happened to me, too. The kids and I were leaving karate class,
drove up the steep driveway, made the switchback, revved the engine...
The right mount broke, the engine was dragging on the ground racing
because the throttle cable was stretched tight. 

Turned off the key right away. Assessed the problem, got the jack out
and set the right end of the mustache bar back in place and secured it
with several tie wraps, then drove it (VERY gingerly!) 44 miles home.
Fixed it properly the next day.
