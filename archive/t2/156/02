Hello all     We use to use a water injection by making a hooka type jar with 
an aquaraium air stone on the bottom suction pipe and a on -off valve to 
regulate the vapor flow.do not use a plastic jar as it will suck it together. 
This worked very well ,increased HP, fuel milage and had to clean the inside 
of the compustion camber. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import
