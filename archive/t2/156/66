--This is a great post, I think it's important to recycle at this level. Everyone who rips on VW drivers about pollution, and buys a new car every two years has their head "up in there".

Thanks to Tony for helping us in the dark out.

...The CARB Email program will automatically send a list of vehicles' make, model and year to interested parties, whenever a vehicle is scheduled to be
received at a dismantler's facility. The Email message will include the dismantler's location, as well as the time when the vehicle is scheduled to arrive at the dismantler.
