Anyone stuffing their original seats may want to look into these
reproductions from WolfsburgWest instead of the foam ones from TMPI.  I
found out about them by searching the archives but no one seemed to have any
feedback about them back then.

The backrests have been unavailable for a while but they did another run of
100 and about half are left.

This is what you get.  Smells original too.
