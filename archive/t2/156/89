Subject: Starter,Solenoid,Ignition??? (First post on T2)

I've been reading the book "How To Keep Your VolksWagen Alive, a Manual of
Step By Step Procedures For The Complete Idiot" and apparently I'm beyond a
complete idiot.(<-- Be Nice) While working on the starter I noticed one of
the wires that hooks to the solenoid was broken and probably had been for
awhile. (Two weeks ago the bus would turn over fine.) According to the book,
one of the wires on the solenoid goes to the ignition switch and the other
is labeled Fuel Injection. I have a '71 Westfalia. No fuel injection there.
But I can't seem to track where the wire goes or it's purpose. I took a look
at another '71 running bus and the wire was hooked up on there too. Can
anyone help me with this? I've been trying to troubleshoot why I don't have
12volts to the ignition switch. I can turn over the starter by jumping the
posts on the solenoid. Is the second wire a return from the ignition switch?
I'm guessing that the first one is running from the solenoid to the fuse box
then to the ignition??? Any help is appreciated. Thanks ahead of time.
