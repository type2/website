Subject: Re: [T2] Couple of air circulation questions

I've been broken into thru both vents, bending the latch so the vent does 
not close completely and creating the wind noise.
I made a small wooden wedge for each side, it fits between the latch and the 
frame, below the raised part of the frame. No more noise, but I find that I 
no longer use the vents cuz it's too much trouble to fiddle w the wedges 
while driving.
Best wishes

Over the long life of these buses, entry has been many times and easily I
might add, with a coat hanger through the vent window. The subsequent damage
makes it impossible to get the correct seal of the vent window.

Result.......wind noise at speed.

The ONLY solution is to replace the entire window and seals. Then it will
fit tight like it did when new.
