Subject: MMO sale---

Hey all,

For those of you who live in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and southern
Wisconsin----and are user's and fans of MMO,here is the best sale I've
ever seen on  gallon's of Marvel---

$6.99 per gallon---- at my favorite place--Farm and Fleet---I never have
seen it at this low a price anywhere----in plastic bottles, or the
original metal gallon cans, for the nostalgia aficionados--

 They also have Rislone on sale for $3.00 for 2 quarts----

Castrol GTX 20/50 for a buck twenty nine---

I have to take a trip this weekend for sure--and load up---

For those of you who remain rock headed and refuse to adjust to a
quality oil additive--please disregard this message---

Later,

            ______________
