Hi, all,

Sorry about slight duplication (posted this to the "on duty admin" and it
somehow got posted on the list as "Tranaxle parts wanted")

Anyway, I have found some of the parts, from the nose section of the
transmission, but I need the following, or any information about
availability.

The bus is a 79 Westy.

Selector Link Shaft


Any help greatly appreciated, as we have a summer trip coming up, and want
to rebuild the transmission before then.


Thanks much,

Roger
