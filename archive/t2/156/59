Hiya All,

No earthshaking matter here, but I was wondering why VW did not install a 
relay in Type 2s for the rear window defrosting grid?  And yet they did use a 
relay for this same purpose in the Bug.  Seems to me that a relay would be 
even more advisable in a Bus.  Anybody have any insight into this one?
