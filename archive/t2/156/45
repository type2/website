Chris, this is a "yes and no"....  I managed to mushroom mu pin because I
drove it out with a punch and hammer, cleaned things up, then drove it
back in with the dog on backward.  Drove it back out, reversed the dog,
then *tried* to drive it back in and it had mushroomed.  If you get it
right the first time, or if you are driving it in with a press and not a
hammer and punch, you might have better luck :-)  New replacements for the
pin and dog are, as far as I know, not available, but every VW dist has a
pin and dog and they *should* all interchange.

Ed Richardson's point is very well made...  the ground strap between the
moving and fixed plates is vital to proper function.

Chris, oil is pumped up the chanel cut in the side of the lower shaft and
flows thru the hole to lube the shaft bearings.   Obviously, any dirt in
those bearings is not good for them or for the rest of the engine when it
gets pushed out.  If they are clean, there is no point to removing the
shaft, but if you suspect dirt, well, then they need cleaning.  As I said
in my p-mail, I recomment kerosene rather than carb cleaner.

> What kind of grease should be used on the plate if any?

I use whatever is handy.  There is probably a "proper" grease, but
axle/wheel bearing grease works fine.

I have used the same axle grease there a couple times.  I am sure this
isn't right, but it was all I had and some lube is important there.

Bosch makes a kit containing shims and spacers to remove excess verticle
play, but I have not found replacement bearings to correct axial play.

Almost certainly, but I have not looked for one.  Old distributors in
decent shape are still too easy to find.  Some day, down the road, I am
sure this will change :-(
