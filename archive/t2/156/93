Subject: Slider sun roof

Joe,
  I'm no expert but have some experience with
the sunroof. One easy thing to do is to remove
the plastic cover where the crank would be and
see if all the workings are even there. Should
have a gear with a stub sticking out through the 
cover and two cables running through the guide 
channels. If all that is there ... well that is a good
sign.
However, if someone sealed it up and took
the crank off something is probably hosed back where
the cables connect. The panel on the sun roof slider
does come off and then you can kinda see the condition
of all the workings in the back. Anyway check
those things out first. If all is missing p-mail
me and maybe you can get it to work with compression
latches..most slider parts are NLA.. lemme know.
-----------------
Come to think of it, anyone have experience with a
sunroof?  This one (1977) has the handle removed and
the seam siliconed shut - presumably because it
neither worked nor was leak free.

 A parting observation. A lot of people tend to
enclude
the whole msg. and alll off the associated tags that
are auto added to many e-mail accounts. A little
cut and paste when replying would be greatly
appreciated by us poor digest mode slobs.... 
Or maybe I am the only one that notices. ANYWAY.. just
a thought.. TIA
