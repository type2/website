Subject: RE: [T2] VW Adventure: My engine fell out! (long)

Haha... that is literally exactly what happened to me - the right mount
broke, the engine dropped down and revved because the throttle cable was
stretched taught.  It turned out that the mount had actually already been
cracked (there was a little bit of rust on the crack itself) - kinda makes
you wonder why no one ever noticed it before?  especially since the PO
claimed the engine had just been completely rebuilt about 2000 miles ago...

I'm just glad that I got lucky and had a really helpful (and fun) tow truck
driver, and found a great VW shop near my house that can do all the work
(plus a bunch of other stuff that needed doing anyway) for not too much
cash.  I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that nothing else got damaged by
the whole ordeal.  I'm just shocked that the engine can fall down like that
and not seriously damage anything else like the transmission...
