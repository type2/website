Subject: Re: [T2] Type4 distributor question:

I greatly appreciate your feedback, information and encouragement. I 
literally wrestled with the dizzy trying to get it loose from the clamp.

After loosening the clamp and removing the nut holding the clamp to the 
bolt, the dist did not want to come clear of the clamp, the left side of 
the clamp was wedged under the sheet metal. I never did get the dist to 
come free nor get the dist/clampl assy to come free either. (I know some 
day I will need to get it out) but in the hot sun with a conspicuous 
absence of enough beer I (I'm sure accidentally) got the dist to seat 
down correctly. Reset the points, timed it to the 7.5 and it started 
with very little reluctance after sitting for a couple of months.

Thanks again for the help.  I'm sure I'll be back for more help as time 
goes on since this is my first Van and T4.

Come to think of it, anyone have experience with a sunroof?  This one 
(1977) has the handle removed and the seam siliconed shut - presumably 
because it neither worked nor was leak free.
