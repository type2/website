Over the long life of these buses, entry has been many times and easily I
might add, with a coat hanger through the vent window. The subsequent damage
makes it impossible to get the correct seal of the vent window.

Result.......wind noise at speed.

The ONLY solution is to replace the entire window and seals. Then it will
fit tight like it did when new.
