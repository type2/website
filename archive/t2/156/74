Alway check your rear view mirror when slowing to a stop, especially when=
 you are driving your recently restored and freshly painted 78 westy.

I was rear-ended by a 93 BMW who apparently was not slowing as much as th=
e rest of traffic.
The body has very minor dents, other than the bent engine hatch and the m=
utilated rear bumper (also freshly painted).
The exhaust and the engine took the brunt of the crash unfortunately, the=
 muffler was destroyed, both heater boxes were bent, broke an exhaust stu=
d, and caused a transmission oil leak.

I had literally had just gotten it back from the paint shop two weeks ago=
 and the interior was just put back in.
Now I have to drive a frickin' chevy rental car.  Fortunately, I hadn't p=
lanned on going to any shows this month, but it still sucks.

I hope nobody else will have to go through this, but I'm probably not the=
 only one that something like this has happened to.
But if you have a similar story, I might feel better if I heard it.
