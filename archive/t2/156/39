Subject: RE: [T2] FRIDAY - Water Injection System

Sorry Dave, I gotta disagree on this one too.  Humid air is actually less
dense than dry air.  Water vapor behaves mostly like any other gas.  Dry air
is a mixture of mostly N2 and O2.  Humid air has N2 and O2 and H20
molecules.  H20 is about half the weight of N2 or O2.  A given volume of air
has room for only a certain number of molecules.  If some of the N2 and O2
are displaced by lighter H2O, then the resulting mixture is less dense.  I'm
not sure whether dry or humid air has more capacity to absorb heat.  A
disclaimer here:  LIQUID water will absorb lots of heat before turning into
water vapor, so a mixture of humid air and water droplets would be a pretty
good coolant.

I'll try to restrain my compulsive teaching tendencies for the rest of the
night :)

Jason,

Ummm....I must have been asleep for about 10 years or something...

What? notoriously *hot* t4 engine are we discussing here??????

Moisture laden air is able to absorb more heat or cool cause it is
"thicker"....or as the physicists among us will call heat absorbtion
factor.  More molecules of water in the air means it is denser and can do
more "work" to heat or cool.

Splashing a lot of water on the bottom of the case always helps too!


Cheers, dave
