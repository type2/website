I pulled of the front grill and checked out the flaps, foam and cable =
all looked
fine. . Each flap mechanism  has a rod they swing on. These flat edges (
like the end of a flat head screw driver)meet at the center of the grill =
area.
 The orientation of the two edges are 180 degrees
from each other. Between these two protrusions is a=20
plastic grommet (why plastic??) When
the one (driver side flap is moved) the other is also=20
supposed to move via the grommet that connects
the two rods. What was not OK was the grommet=20
between the two rods. Hopefully this makes sense
and someone can tell me where I can find the=20
broken grommet.=20
I did taped the passenger side flap closed to see if this was
in fact the source of my noise, but have not tested it yet.=20
