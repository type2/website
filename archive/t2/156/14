Subject: Re: [T2] STABILAZER LINK ??  HELP

Use grease to make it slide easier.  Place the bushing
on the stabilizer bar first.  Then grease the link. 
Bend in part of the lip of the bushing inside the link
and press the rest on.  Push it on a little extra, and
the rest of the lip will pop back out.
