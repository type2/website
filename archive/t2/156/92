Subject: Re: [T2] leak down specs ?

Jack,

I am just finishing up building a homemade one this morning and hope to 
test it on my 78 this morning as well.

If you go to google and put in 

"leak down" test

You get about 2500 articles and this one from Ken's buggy barn is among 
the first few.

There are ways to make one cheaper than $100...I have about $27 in mine so 
far.

Dr. Tim talks about this test a lot and I am ready to try it.
I can't ever remember seeing this mentioned in Bentley before though.

Interepretation is in percentages....good descriptions of it all over the 
net.  Some vary, but not much.  One site said that on his racing engine
(new), that he had maybe 1% leakage.  This is probably way high though for 
even a newly rebuilt vw engine.

Cheers, dave
