Subject: Re: [T2] Late Type 4 Crank

The late crank is not counterbalanced.  Counterbalanced cranks are for racing, really, because it doesn't really do much below 5000 rpm.  They are available, though. You should check shoptalkforums.com for sourcing...I think DPR makes one.  For a bus or aircooled vanagon, I think just balancing the crank would be sufficient, because low end power is needed more to get the heavy thing moving.
