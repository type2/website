Hey Chuck
we're on the island, living  on Lake Cowichen. If you want kayaking,
canoeing, fishing, its the place to be. If you want to get away from it all,
no problem, the road turns to gravel a mile further down the road. Okay, so
half the roads out here are gravel ; ). Give us a shout and will give you
any info we've got and a spot in the drive if need be.(might have to move a
few cars first)
