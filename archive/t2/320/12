Subject: Re Bizarre failing in 75 FI; fuel liny query

To list- you seem knowledgable on parts----My ex-Porsche mechanic that
did Nyssa's bus figures over the phone that the 75 likely had fuel
starvation -its main clue was that after it refused to make it up a hill
(push clutch in, rev it up, let it out, goes "plup-plup-plup" and has NO
poop (no acc), I let it sit to wait for my wife to bring a
chain....after ten min checked it, and it ran OK enough to get home the
next 2 miles.  He had eyeballed the tank through the gas sender hole as
their is a "factory" cutout plate in the body above it, saw no rust)-
Since I know the injectors were clogged (put in new ones) it may be
sludge getting into the opening?  Anyone know if the 75 tank had a
raised line outlet or any kind of strainer?  The tank outlet nipples
seeem directly welded to the tank bottom; no raised lipo around them. 
The gas line itself looks new.  Speaking of lines, what I wanted to ask
is that while doing the compression test, I noticed the lines were
braided, marked in white 7mm ID, and were squishable when squeezed- I
thought FI hose was reinforced and not squeezable?  I called him, and he
claimed this braided stuff IS for FI, not carbs, and has been using it
for 20 years- would you concur?
