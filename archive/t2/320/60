No, No ,No No, No!!!

No silicone or RTV on a VW engine anyplace that it can get into the
oil flow!!!!!....and pretty much no place else either.

If you think I am overboard about this, you should see the guys
over on the vintage bug list!

When I got my 78 bus, someone had used that stuff on the valve covers and 
it was horrible...squishy,oily, slimy feeling and falling apart...

Let the waterpumper guys use that stuff....

Cheers, dave
