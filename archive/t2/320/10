Wakanska, thanks for that line!  I am having the same problem...

I buy *new* line at the local vwflaps and 1 year later it leaks!!!
This line is marked "made in Germany" and looks exactlly like it always 
does.

Fired up my 68 bug last weekend(sitting for 3 months)...and it cranked up 
pretty good.BUT!  Went back to check the engine and look it over while it 
warmed up and the fuel lines that I put on last fall were already leaking.

I decided at that point to go to the local Mercedes shop as some have 
suggested and try their fuel lines...this is getting ridiculous and 
dangerous.

Anyone else having this type of problem????

Cheers, dave
