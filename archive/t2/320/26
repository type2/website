I went to the local heavy duty commercial vehicle hose maker (yes they
exists) and bought some ends, this is where the guys who run the
bulldozers and cranes etc go when one of their hoses break.  they have to
get em fixed fast and right,  place isn't cheap but they have every size
and type of hose made....sit quietly out of the way until the big guys
have thier hoses then talk to the shop guy, they gave me a break and sold
me some ends for about a $1 a foot but the stuff is rated at over 5,000
psi strength and resistant to any known vehicle fuel....8 years later they
look brand new, still feel solid and the insides (when I drop engine) are
still flexible and tough... probably ought to change em soon though.

 FWIW I went to a company called "Langsdale Holtzman"  they may or may not
be in your neck of the woods, just ask any heavy equipment operator where
they get their hoses repaired.
