Subject: re:Bizarre failing in 75 FI; fuel liny query

Mike- Mines a 75 but not FI, and I found a gauze inside the fuel tank, this 
drops out from below when I removed the nut holding the pipe that the fuel 
hose connects to underneath the tank. Its a tight spot but I did mine with 
the fuel tank out but I don't see any reason why you can't do it from 
underneath once the tank is drained. I give information on the fuel tank 
restoration I did a couple of years ago on my web site at:
