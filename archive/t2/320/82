Chris,

I'm not going to poop on your idea. I think a 911 powered bay bus would be
awesome. Dream on, I've dreamed of it as well. It is the only conversion
into a bay bus worth considering, IMO.

The cv joint conversion should be easy. Have you seen the bus with a vortec
v-6 and 911 trans? There might be some info on that site. Google search for
"vortec vw bus".
