Subject: Looking for a '78 2.0 l rebuildable engine.

Hello friends,
I'm looking for a rebuildable 2.0l engine for my 78
bus "Anya". I'm planning a road trip to Mexico this
summer and my engine while not lacking in love might
not make it mechanicly. Basically what I need is the
main engine case, and as long as their good condition,
cylinders, pistons and heads. Wait that's a good
engine... Ok maybe not all of that but if someone at
least knows where a good case is that would get me
started. Not sure what the going rate is for used
cases but let me know what you need.
  While I'm on here I'll go ahead and ask advice of
any of you who have gone through a rebuild. Should I
definatly go with all new Cylinders and heads or could
I get away with pulling them off another bus. I would
prefer to go with new of course but the prices that
I'm seeing are somewhat high. 
  Is there any good websites out there with someones
experience and a step by step guide to rebuilding?

Thanks in advace,
Giles Clement
