There is nothing in my post that is bizarre, you didn't read it very well,
or the previous posts in the thread.

This is just not true. Flux-core welders may not be anywhere near as good as
a proper MIG or TIG, but they work fine for what a hobbyist needs in many
instances. And they are fairly inexpensive, which most good MIG's, and all
TIG's, are not. You get what you pay for, in welding machines as in all
else.

I am aware that what a welding professional calls a "wire-feed welder" is
probably a MIG. What is today commonly (by nonprofessionals) called a
wire-feed welder uses only flux-core wire, no gas. This is not a MIG, there
is no Inert Gas. I didn't invent the use of the term. Whatever "wally world"
is, I don't know, but yes they are the budget machines. This is what the
original poster was asking about. Call it crummy, whatever, they work fine
for most home users who can't justify the kind of machine you are using.

You are lucky to have professional grade equipment at your disposal. Some of
us have to make do with less.
