Subject: Re: [T2] Auxiliary Heater

They are garbage. Get a gas heater. I'm using a BN-2 that was meant for a bug 
to heat my ' 78 Urban Assault Westy. Mounted it where the spare tire use to 
reside. When the overnight lows around these parts hit 10deg. a week or so 
ago, that little BN-2 kept the inside of said bus at 75deg. with no problem, 
running for about 3-5min at a time,(after initial 120sec. start up mode, each 
cycle.) every 30min or so. (I've got it wired into a T-stat for camping.) 
They are easy to install, easy to work on, and safe. Insulate the bus a 
little, and a BN-2 is all you need.
