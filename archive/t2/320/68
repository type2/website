Barry,

Your last line

Should read "baking soda" instead of vinegar so that you neutralize the 
battery acid instead of adding to it with the acid from the vinegar.

As for the battery "leak" you are just gonna have to do the Sherlock 
Holmes thing...very methodically and carefully.  Don't worry about the 
speaker buzz cause the charger puts out enough stray 60 cycle ac hum to
overide almost anything around!

Cheers, dave
