Subject: propane heaters

The recent talk about propane heaters has raised a question in my weak
mind... Has anyone had trouble getting the fuel out of the bottle at 10
or 20 degrees F? I know my BBQ won't perform at those temps, I believe
the gas condenses too much to provide the req'd pressure to leave the
bottle! This would preclude the effective use of a propane furnace of
any type here in Montana when you needed it most! 
Anyone have personal experience on this?
