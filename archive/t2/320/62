You are absolutely right about this, Dave. People put rtv on the cylinder
bases, for instance. If you are not careful, a glob gets into the cylinder
bore, into the sump, then lodges in an oil gallery somewhere and toasts the
engine. It happens.

If you want to glue the gaskets onto the head covers, which is a fine thing
to do, use 3m weatherstrip adhesive, very sparingly.
