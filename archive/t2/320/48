Re difference in horsepower between the 57 and 67 hp:  I'll add my two cents.
Rick Taylor is right in what he said.  Those who have driven both know there
is a huge difference in actual power between the 57hp and 67hp engines.  Also
remember that not all Type 4 engines have hydraulic valves; that didn't start
until 1978.
