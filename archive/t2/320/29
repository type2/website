One thing that I have found is that German rubber products aren't exactly
the finest in the world.  While the fit of things like window rubber is
certainly better if it comes from Der Fatherland, it seems that German
rubber doesn't last as long as that from the US or Japan.  This holds true
for fuel line as well, I suppose.

It seems that Japanese cars use the same metric line that VWs do, so it
should be available from those outlets.  It won't have that folksy cloth
covering (actually, another layer of rubber will be over the cloth), but
it should be more durable.
