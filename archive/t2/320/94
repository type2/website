Subject: Re: [T2] Mig Tig or Arc Wire Feed?

Jeez-Scott
Where did you come up with this Bizarre info--???
Any Mig or tig type welder uses CO2 and argon mix for steel--
Straight Argon for aluminum.

The only welding done without gas is Arc welding--

You must be thinking about the econo Wally World mig welder's with the
flux coating on the wire, so you allegedly don't have to buy a bottle--

Crummy welds--

I have a 300 amp Miller 100% duty cycle-- and I use CO2 -argon every
day--

A Tig also uses the same gases--

Later,

Wire feed welders work in a similar way to a mig, where the filler wire
is the electrode. A wire-feed machine has no shielding gas, so it uses
welding wire that has a flux core. Wire-feed machines produce fine
welds, but they have some spatter, and also some slag is produced around
the weld.
A wire-feed machine will work fine for home body-work and light
structural welding. Lots of the portable wire-feed machines can be
converted to MIG with the addition of a MIG kit, which consists of a
tank, hose and regulator, sometimes also a different welding nozzle.
Get the biggest (amp rating and duty cycle) machine you can afford.
