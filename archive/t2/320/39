Subject: Re: electric heaters-try blankets!

Warming the air of the bus before it warms you is
inefficient....electric heating blankets warm you directly.
Do a search on Google for 12 volt electric blanket, and you will get
about 400 hits- I have 2 blankets ($29) that are about 3-4 amps each and
fit over my entire bus seat -and they do fine if you sit on them and
wrap them over your lap.  Guaranteed toasty butt.  Won't warm the bus,
but it's the best you can get for the wattage.
