Subject: Horsepower

The big difference is the torque.  The horsepower, you are right is not that
big a difference.

I think Gene Berg in his many writings put it sort of like this............

It takes a certain amount of horsepower for a car to go a certain speed,
period.  If you put in a bigger motor, it still takes the same amount of
horsepower to go the same speed.
If you increase the torque, that gives you a lot more power from a
start............to get you rolling....you really feel that.  If you ever go
to vw drags, you can see that in the lesser classes, it is often not the guy
with the most hp biggest displacement motor that wins............
