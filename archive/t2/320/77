Low temperatures slow the vaporization of propane in the bottles.  Bulk
propane suppliers compensate for this by increasing the amount of propane
in the propane/butane LPG mix so it will evapoarate at lower temperatures.

Unfortunately, pre-bottled propane doesn't have that advantage.  It has to
be the same for the entire country, so folks in cold places will have to
keep their bottles warm for them to work.
