Silicone doesn't work well in contact with oil.  If you use it and don't
get it _all_ off you will get a leak next time.

I have better luck with non-hardening sealants like Hylomar.  They're
tacky, but never need to be scraped off.  Scraping causes scratches, and
scratches cause leaks.

If you _must_ use silicone, use the blue Permatex stuff.  It peels off
easier than the black/clear/red stuff.

And, of course, never put anything on the head/gasket interface.
