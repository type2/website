a '79 CA bus engine missing an EGR???  

1979 2.0 engines (CA only) don't have an EGR, they use
an oxygen sensor.  

Perhaps your engine didn't originate in Cali.. which
begs the question why would this fine state wants your
smog equipment to match a non CA spec?  Maybe your
smog guy doesn't know his stuff.
