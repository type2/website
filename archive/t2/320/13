Ray, are we talking about some other list?

There is no political bend on this list other than this:  Type 2 VW's are on-topic, everything else is not.

The things you imply ARE tolerated (rambling antiwar, antibush, antirightwingconspiracy diatribes) are in fact NOT tolerated as they do not relate to Type 2 VWs.

The things you imply ARE NOT tolerated (prayer, guns, other right wing topics) are in fact NOT tolerated as they do not relate to Type 2 VWs.

"Rik" is NOT an administrator of the type2 list, nor does he speak in any way shape or form for the administrators.

I hope this clears up any confusion.  If not, e-mail us at "type2-admin(-at-)type2.com" and we will be happy to discuss it offline.

Thanks,

-David
 type2 list administrator
