Tig is by far the best. Unlimited heat control and precision. Any good body
shop will use a tig welder on panels. With a tig you create the arc with a
tungsten electrode. (Tungsten-Inert-Gas, TIG) TIG welders are the most
expensive by a big margin.

Mig will work well, but the heat control is not as good. With a mig you are
creating an arc with the filler material, so in order to weld you are always
filling. MIG is a good compromise, since most people who don't do it for a
living can't rationalize the cost of a TIG machine, but MIG machines are
very affordable. 

An arc welder will not work for body work, you have very little control over
the heat, and the welds are just too fat. They are designed for welding
structural members, like angle iron.
