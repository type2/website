My bus sat for 4 years and we got it going as is except we needed some
starter fluid to help it along (5/6 failed start attempts) and we replaced
the fuel lines before we started.

Just because it was overhauled before doesn't mean the fuel lines were good
back then.  Do a visual inspection and check for cracks and see if the hose
is still rubbery.  Since the hose is inexpensive and so simple to replace
compared to an FI bus might as well give yourself piece of mind and replace
it.

Get rid of all the old gas and use a new fuel filter so you can see what
comes out of the tank, if anything.

You will probably foul the plugs with all the starting attempts.  Have 4 new
gapped plugs ready that you can put in just after get it running and do the
rest of the tune-up later that day.

It might be prudent to check the valve clearances before the first start
attempt.
