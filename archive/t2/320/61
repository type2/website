You should check shoptalkforums.com for sourcing...I think DPR makes one.  For a bus or aircooled vanagon, I think just balancing the crank would be sufficient, because low end power is needed more to get the heavy thing moving.

and balancing is a case of diminishing returns, the closer to 0 out of
balance the more it costs.  I had mine done to 1gram and it was only about
$150 or so it would have been double that cost to get 1/2 gram... VW I
think allows 7gram out of balance.    it was very effective and makes for
a smooth (for VW) engine.   Remember to have it balanced with all  the
"Stuff" that is attached to the crank...
