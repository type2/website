Tracy,

I doubt that this idea will install in a '96 Wrangler, but while I was in
the US Army they had an auxiliary heater kit for the Willis Jeep.  I believe
that the heater was intended for use in the arctic regions.

Not really sure if it was gas-feed, or just spliced into the engine's
coolant system.
