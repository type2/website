Chris,

In my humble opinion....

Pipe dream big time and then go price parts for a 911 engine and the same 
parts for a t4 engine.

Yeah, I pipe dream that one too, but my wallet makes my rear end hurt so 
bad that it overrides the pipe dream!

If ya have "the need for speed", then price some of Jake Raby's T4's on 
steroids.

Still dreaming, dave
