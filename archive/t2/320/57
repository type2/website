Propane freezes into a solid at MINUS 187~ degrees Celsius, and boils into 
the gaseous state
at MINUS 42~ degrees Celsius. So, it should be a gas  at the temps you 
describe.

Butane, on the other hand, boils at zero degrees Celsius, and would be a 
liquid at the temps you describe. That would be 32 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Below 32 it would be a liquid and would behave as you describe.

I suggest that you were not being supplied with pure propane for your BBQ 
tests in Montana.

The recent talk about propane heaters has raised a question in my weak
mind... Has anyone had trouble getting the fuel out of the bottle at 10
or 20 degrees F? I know my BBQ won't perform at those temps, I believe
the gas condenses too much to provide the req'd pressure to leave the
bottle! This would preclude the effective use of a propane furnace of
any type here in Montana when you needed it most!
Anyone have personal experience on this?
