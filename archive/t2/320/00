Subject: Backfiring problems

Dear List,

I have a 2000 cc type !V engine in my camper with a single progressive
Holley type carb.  I have timed the engine and checked dwell but I still get
backfiring.  It is backfiring through the carb end.  It will run fine for a
minute thin cough cough, backfire, with a puff of smoke coming through the
top of the carb (air filter).  Sometimes it will continue to run, then the
backfire again, sometimes it will stall.  This problem happens all through
the advance curve, at idle, and also at the higher RPM9s.    Anything I
should check again?  I set my valves, should I check them again?  Is my carb
fouling?  My dizzy?  All cylinders check out with healthy compression, about
140 on all cylinders.  If it is carb problems, could some of the carb gurus
give me some tips to play with the carb?  I don9t know them very well.

Thanks for your help,

Ed in NJ
