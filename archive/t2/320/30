For fuel injected busses (late '74 on), I sell the OEM Continental fuel
line, same as used by Volkswagen. Never had a problem. Not the cheapest (nor
the most expensive; that would be the one from the dealer) but it is good.
Considering the potential firey consequences of a fuel line rupture, this
obviously isn't the place to take chances, and much of what's sold at FLAPS
is not rated to handle the correct fuel pressure.  $6.95 per meter (part # N
020 281 1).
