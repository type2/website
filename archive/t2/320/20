No rust at the fuel filter?

If the injectors were sludged there is probably sludge buildup in all the
metal lines from the tank (tank to filter, pump to fuel rail, both fuel
rails).

This is an image I enhanced to show the tank pickup and return line that are
inside the bowl in the tank:

You can't get a good look at those from the sender, you need to view it from
the filler pipe hole.

VW used it at the factory but it's inadequate.

Bus-boys has a good description of the two types of fuel hose available:

My pictures of the differences between the two:

http://homepage.mac.com/ratwell/.Pictures/FuelHose/06-RegulatorHose.JPG

Both hoses are 25 years old.  The first was went from the 3/4 fuel rail to
the cold start valve.  The second was from the 1/2 rail to the pressure
regulator.  Both removed only once and not re-fitted.

Don't bother with the cloth braided variety.
