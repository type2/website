Mike,

Sounds like my problems with my 78 before I cleaned the tank out.

Pics at http://www.shockwaverider.com/78bustankjob/

Picture #12 shows what came out of my tank.  Basically when the fuel level 
was below the rim of the anti-slosh "bowl" in the tank, I could get enough 
fuel to drive for 3.5 miles and then die....wait 10 minutes and it slowly 
seeped back into the bowl area and I could drive it home.

The clue was to leave the fuel pressure gauge hooked up till it started 
dying and then watch it slowly drop to below 22-24psi...engine dies then.

Richard has better pics of what his tank looks like inside, don't know if 
the 75 would be the same or not.

Cheers, dave
