Hi Volks,

For those with carburetors on their buses, I would recommend visiting 
the local motorcycle repair shop. They usually sell clear fuel lines in 
a variety of sizes.  Clear line can be quite helpful in diagnosing fuel 
flow problems, as sometimes happens with bad pumps and/or clogged 
filters.

I haven't heard of many problems with the 72-74 fuel pumps (yet), but 
since these are virtually NLA a lot of people are switching over to 
electric pumps.

Happy trails,
