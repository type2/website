Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky Valve Covers

Guys,

I always glue mine with 3m weatherstrip(yellow) for t1 and t4 
engines...haven't had a valve cover oil leak in years.  Change gaskets 
about every 3rd or 4th oil change just for good luck....

Take your valve covers and get another tab or two welded on 
and see if it helps!....and let us know...

Cheers, dave
