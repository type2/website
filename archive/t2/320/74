The thing is, that I have a good 2.4 911 engine, and a good 901 tranny, along 
with a few oiltanks, CV's,mfi's, tri webs,911 exhausts, etc...so parts aren't 
really a problem, Figuring how to fit the motor mounts, tranny mounts, retro 
fit the CV's,  fabricating the tin, and finding room for the oil tank are the 
issue:)

Let me know guys, thanks.
