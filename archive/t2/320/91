Wire feed welders work in a similar way to a mig, where the filler wire is
the electrode. A wire-feed machine has no shielding gas, so it uses welding
wire that has a flux core. Wire-feed machines produce fine welds, but they
have some spatter, and also some slag is produced around the weld.

A wire-feed machine will work fine for home body-work and light structural
welding. Lots of the portable wire-feed machines can be converted to MIG
with the addition of a MIG kit, which consists of a tank, hose and
regulator, sometimes also a different welding nozzle.

Get the biggest (amp rating and duty cycle) machine you can afford.
