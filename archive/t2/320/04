My guess is that your problem is electrical in nature.  It's good that you
checked all those FI items but because it has trouble starting my bet is
that it's something simpler.

Do you have good ground straps between the battery and the body and between
the transmission and the body?  I had this problem once and it was a
corroded and broken ground strap. The path from the ignition switch to
solenoid to starter are grounded through the transmission case to the body
by way of a small braided strap.  The FI grounds on the engine case, under
the air plenum get similarly grounded by the transmission.

Check your negative battery cable also.
