The RPM at which the torque is delivered makes a huge difference in what
you perceive as power.

As an example, I recently test-drove a Honda CRV and Element one right
after the other.  They have the same engine, but the CRV is tuned to
deliver its 162ft-lb of torque at 3600RPM.  The Element is tuned to
deliver 161ft-lb at 4500RPM.  The Element is slightly heavier (150 lb).

The CRV was noticably "quicker" than the Element.  Since the engine spends
most of its time in the 2000-4000RPM range, putting the torque peak there
means that there is more "push" available.  You can get greater power by
putting the torque at higher RPM, but then you must really spin the engine
to get it out.
