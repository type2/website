Subject: I'm heading to Naples, Florida

Hi Folks,

I will be leaving the winter wonderland of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada on
the 20th of February for a week.  No I am not taking my bus.  It has
been in storage since the end of October (sniff, sniff).

Will be in Naples, Florida on business and was wondering if anyone knew
of must sees re vw's.  Shops, scarp yards, shows etc...

Please advise.

Craig
