	Could I ask for re-checks?  I am still trying to work out 
where to slap in the water on these plurry VW carbs.
	In the simple world of Solex etc etc on Renault etc etc, the 
vac line to the distributor originates in a little hole just outside 
the 'closed' position of the throttle butterfly, where there is 
little if any vac at idle, and none on the over-run  -  the 
conditions when zero water is needed.  Then as you open the throttle 
in hard acceleration (having slapped in a T-junction near that that 
vac nozzle for a dashboard vac guage) experiences c. 0.3 bar { = 0.3 
atm for youse oldies ;-)) which readily sucks up the water from a 
lower altitude, seeing as how 0.3 bar = c.10' of water barometer.  At 
cruise it's more like 2/3 atm, which is fine because the most water 
is needed when the most fuel is being burned.  Death to pinking! 
Embrace improved cooling!  Emit less toxins!  Use less fuel!   ...
	On the Brazilian Weber, there seems to be no corresponding 
vacuum regime readily available.  I like it so much on other criteria 
that I hesitate to replace it with the dreaded Solex PICT-3 ...

	Meanwhile our whole bus community lacks a few items of key 
advice on how to slap in that Water.
Anyhow, if people are estimating vac curves on actual carbs, I'd be 
glad of data.

thanx
