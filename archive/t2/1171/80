Subject: Re: [T2] alternate alternators

Jon -

The 55amp Bus Alternator (72-79 Bus) is exactly the same as what is
used on the 70-76 Porsche 914/4 (equipped with the 55amp alternator of
course), pulley, fan and all.  The 411/412 models used the same 55amp
alternator, pulley, fan and all.  In both cases it's a direct swap.
This is the Bosch AL75X aka Lester # 13030 in some FLAPS.

The 70amp Bus Alternator was optional on 76-79 Buses and optional on
75-76 Porsche 914s, but was never used on the 411/412.  They're most
commonly found (but not always) on 75-79 Westfalia Campmobiles,
usually (again, not always) with a factory dual battery set up.  The
pulley and fan are different from the 55amp, as is the air exhaust
elbow (as pointed out by Martin's post).  But converting the 55amp to
the 70amp is fairly easy to do, many I know have done it.  This is the
Bosch AL108x

If you like I can pmail images of both alternators from Bosch for easy
identification. In a manner of speaking, they could be considered
unique to these vehicles.

As Jon Anderson and Martin have posted earlier, the 2.0 Vanagon can be
installed, the major improvement that the alternator voltage in now
internally regulated, but certain mods will have to be made for proper
fit.

Several others have retrofitted other brand alternators (GM for
example, but there are others).
