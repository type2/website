You can test this by hooking up a vacuum gauge and making sure that you 
get vacuum *just* when you crack the throttle and then it should slowly 
taper down to no vacuum about about 50-60% throttle (I forgot the exact 
value from my testing).

You also need to get your distributor adjusted correctly for your engine.
