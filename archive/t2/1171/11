Hey John,

 

The southwind heater has a thermostat of some sort. The switch has on/off
and then you twist it, and the more you twist it, the hotter it is supposed
to get. 

 

I am not sure how well it works the temp control works, as shortly after I
installed mine, I ended up finally upgrading my bus to 12V. So I have not
hooked up the heater since. This was a few years ago. I also has a big chuck
of time with the bus off the road for a full repaint/resto job. I thought I
would have the heater in for this winter-but hasn't happened yet.

 

To fix this, I need to pull engine, figure out which parts need to be
swapped for 12V, or some have suggested a different switch.but I think I
need to do more than that. I also need to pull the engine, as I used the
original duct to blower adaptor-that only lasted a short time before it fell
apart. It was NOS, but it was also ~35-40 year old rubber when I went to
install it. It seemed fine when I installed it, but I guess the heat dried
it out, and caused it to fall apart damn fast.  I've got to figure out how
to fabricate an alternate adaptor.

Here is something to consider. When I installed an Eberspacher BN4 in my
1970 bus, I connected the on-off switch to a room thermostat rather than s
simple switch on the dash. This has worked well. When camping I can set the
thermostat to a come-on temperature and go to sleep knowing that I won't
have to get up and turn anything on if the temperature inside drops too
much.
