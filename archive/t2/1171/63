Besides the possible vacuum leak, adjustment of the idle screw should
cause some change in idle. If it does not, I would suspect a clogged
idle circuit.

Set your timing for your SVDA dizzy to 28 BTDC at full advance (hoses
disconnected and plugged), and look elsewhere if your idle is too
high. Your timing specifications are determined by your distributor.
