Put an ohm meter across the antenna plug.

If you see anything other than infinity, the coax is is shorted, and 
all needs replaced.

If it is shorted, you are effectively grounding your radio's antenna 
socket when you plug it in, and you will only get "noise".

The reason you hear a station when you get "close" to the socket is 
because you are then, not grounding the radio input, and you are 
making a connection of the shorted outer and inner coax conductors as 
a unit, via capacitive coupling.
