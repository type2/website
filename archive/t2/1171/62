Ok, while it's important to set your timing for full-advance, you really 
want to find out what the proper advance curve is for your engine and 
adjust it accordingly.  There's a reason that VW used the numbers that 
they did and you want to try and mimic those as best as possible.  To do 
that you'll most likely need to adjust the mechanical advance and the 
spring tensions so the different advances kick in at the proper RPM. 
Vacuum advance should add another 11 degrees if I remember correctly. 
Check out oldvolkshome, find your model year and get your distributor 
adjusted so that it falls within the proper specs for your engine.

Sounds like an advance issue.  I'd do the above first.

I wouldn't trust any other location other than under the spark plug 
*unless* you've simultaneously run two sensors and compared the 
results... .but that's just me ;)
