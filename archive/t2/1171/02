   we will be making a push to Missoula MT for the premier. Thursday
Feb. 23 its all part of the Big Sky Documentary Film Festival. Figure
if we get at least 10 buses, westies, vdubs at the premier it will
make one hell of an impression of what type of people us land pirates
are. So lets make it happen.

Cheers,

Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you
didnt do than by the ones you did do. So release the e-brake, drive
away from the safety net of home. Travel the Highways and Bi-ways in
your westy. Explore. Dream. Discover.
