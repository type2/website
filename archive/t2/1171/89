Subject: Buses by the Beach Bus BRR! At Pokagon State Park in Angola,

*Hasn't been much of a winter here in the Midwest, but it is time for a
great winter camp out!*

*
*

*2012 8th Annual Bus BRRR at Pokagon State Park in Angola, Indiana!***

*February 25-26th, 2012*



*This fund raising charity event is hosted by Buses By the Beach. (
www.busesbythebeach.com) Bus BRRR is definitely for the true camping
enthusiast and a great use of a VW Bus!  Temperatures can and have dipped
below zero at night.  This doesn't stop the VW Bus diehards from coming
out.  This one night camp out is held on the last Saturday in February each
year at Beautiful Pokagon State Park in Angola, Indiana.  Each site
includes an electric hook-up so you can keep warm with an electric heater*



*This year, our Bus BRRR Staff will once again be cooking up ginormous pots
of authentic and delicious New Orleans Jambalaya! So, Leave those Crockpots
at home and hit some Jambalaya for a good cause!  Your $20.00 per bus
donation
will include as much Jambalaya as you can eat, hot cider and help pay the
park for firewood for the bonfire.  Each dollar we raise is donated to our
favorite charity, the Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors.

*It is always nice to come back from the Toboggan Runs and warm up next to
the giant Bonfire after spending some time on the 35-40mph (faster than
your average bus) dual refrigerated 1,780 ft. toboggan runs.  Always lots
of great Volks, music, conversation. Hot Jambalaya, hot cider and fun!
All while supporting The Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors.  This may be
your year to win the  "Kozy as a Baked Potato" Award for the warmest
looking bus!  *

*Some helpful tips:*

*Be sure to bring warm clothing for day and night.  A 1200 watt heater
(ceramic is best!) of some sort for the cold nights.  Some of our attendees
have fashioned or purchased Mylar or something similar for insulating the
pop top canvas.  This definitely helps to keep the heat in.  We have camped
at every Bus BRRR and have been warm in the bus with an electric heater
down to -5 below.  Almanac.com is predicting late February to be "Seasonal"
or about the average of 25 degrees.  You may consider bringing some snow
pants or suit if you plan on using the toboggan run.  The park is really
beautiful under a light snowfall with buses parked here and there.
Alcohol is permitted at the park at this time of year, but obnoxious drunks
are never welcome.  Due to the Emerald Ash Borer please leave your firewood
at home.  We'll have plenty to keep the fire roaring.  If you have any
questions about Bus BRRR please email me at
