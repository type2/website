Radiator hose is generally NOT gas worthy.  It is a real bad idea for
filler
hose replacement.  You want something made of nitrile rubber
(Buna-N) for
fuel.  Some "marine" grade coolant hose is rated but
generally parts store
radiator hose is not.
 
Good ideas would include proper fuel rated hoses from
a local source
(Gates distributor, they used to have non wire reinforced in
correct
size) or McMaster or the like.  Probably Grainger as well.  I don't
recall the dimension, something just over 2" I think, perhaps 52 or 54
mm,
someone will recall, but I do know Gates had a close American
size.  At the
moment I see on McMaster only stuff with wire spiral
reinforcement which is a
real PITA but can be made to work.
 
It is pricey though, as a cheaper
solution, and again I don't know that
with gas I'm striving for cheap, it has
occurred to me that silicone hose
sold on *bay for all those boy racer turbo
installs would probably
be quite worthy of the task.  I do see 2 1/8" is
pretty easily available
and I'm thinking that is about the size, but again I
really don't recall.
 
As mentioned filler necks still available, though I do
wonder on
quality of those, I have a couple NOS ones I got in the early 90's
left, and I think some of the repops are not suppose to be all that
great. 
Perhaps Jim or somebody would know on those.

I
got one a couple years ago from a place in Australia I believe shipping c=
ost
more than the rubber thingie, (tech term) I have heard of people using =
radiator coolant hose to fix it but would take some searching the archives =
to find what exact hose fit.
