Dealt with that exact same problem last summer on my 71 Westy.  The  short 
brake servo vacuum hose that runs from the front end of the steel  tube to 
the servo was leaking.  I replaced it with a piece of brake  servo vacuum 
line I had laying around.  If you find a source for more,  I'd like to know.  
 
One other thing to suspect is the check valve (if you have one) that is  
installed right at the manifold vacuum connection.
