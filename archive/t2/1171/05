But what I don't understand is if I leave it at a bad connection - ie just
hold the connectors close to each other, I get good reception, when I fully
connect them-that is when I run into static.

Sounds like the antenna was not making a good connection. That that would
cause the noise. A bad antenna connection is as bad as no antenna at all.
This all makes sense!!
