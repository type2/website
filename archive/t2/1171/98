Hi Tom,
 
It is going to depend on what the width of the roll of the fabric
that you are buying is. The cushion over the engine compartment is going to
take the most material. There are about 3 common widths for bolts of fabric:
36",44-45" and 54." You would want to make sure that you are buying from a 54"
width bolt of fabric. That way there will not be a seam in the middle of a
cushion. The rear most cushion is approx 4' x 3' if I remember correctly. That
will take over 2 yards to cover. Both of the back and the bottom of the bench
seat will take around 2 feet each and add an extra 2 feet for the jump seat.
That is 3 yards. You are looking at 5 yards there not including the arm rest
or any extra. 6 Yards should cover everything. Make sure when you are making
the patterns that you keep the pattern on the material in mind. The grain of
the fabric and the pattern printed on it can sometimes only go one way.
 
Have
fun.
