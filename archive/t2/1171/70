Subject: Re: [T2] alternate alternators

Jon,
 
Presuming this is for the Vanagon, I'd mention that here.  The T4
bus/914ish alternators are pretty uncommon in configuration but indeed
although I don't know off the top of my head, I could well imagine that the
air cooled Vanagon one might actually be physically compatible with something
else of the early 80's VW ilk.  Perhaps not exactly in output, but if in
physical size and configuration such that one could mount it and get the
heater blower fan on is all that is needed.  Somebody might know, all those
Bosch VW alternators of the 70's-early 90's look sort of the same to me prior
to serpentine belts.

Hi Folks,
           Are the Type IV alternators
unique to our vehicles, or are they
common with any other Bosch alternator
equipped vehicles of that era?  I'm
headed to the Pick n' Pull and would like
to pick up a spare.  In my area Type
IVs are rare in the p n' p, but other
Bosch alternators are common.   Models
and makes would be great.   I'm happy
to change the fan and pulley, just need
the alternator itself.   Thanks. jon
