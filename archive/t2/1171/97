Subject: Campmobile interior fabric

Does anyone know the estimated quantity of material needed to reupholster
the inside of a 1973 Westfalia Campmobile?  I was told 7.5 yards and that
seems high to me.  The pieces would be the back cushion over the engine, the
two pieces that make up the bench/bed, the armrest for this bench, the jump
seat, bottom and back, 6 pieces in total.

 

Thanks for any help,

Tom
