Subject: Re: [T2] RE:Gas heater

Here is something to consider. When I installed an Eberspacher BN4 in my 1970 bus, I connected the on-off switch to a room thermostat rather than s simple switch on the dash. This has worked well. When camping I can set the thermostat to a come-on temperature and go to sleep knowing that I won't have to get up and turn anything on if the temperature inside drops too much.

Cheers,

John
