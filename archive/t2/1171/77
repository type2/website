I can't speak towards water injection, but in regards to the amount of 
vacuum that the port sees at overrun (decel - high rpm, low load), the 
vacuum advance port is going to see high vacuum and bump up the advance. 
  So, for example, when you're cruising on the freeway at 70 and then 
you let off the gas, the distributor will advance all the way to 41 
degrees (in the case of my 78 bus).  This is the sum of 32 degrees 
mechanical advance and 11 degrees vacuum advance.

In regards to the vacuum advance port, it will show very little vacuum 
if you go straight to wide-open-throttle.  This is the exact behavior 
you'd want because you don't want to have a ton of advance when you 
floor it.

There are plenty of people that do water injection on the megasquirt 
which will get you much more precise control over how much and when the 
water is injected :)
