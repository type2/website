Subject: Re: Timing, idling, MPG and running hot 

I didn't catch what carb. you are running, but if it is the 34PICT-3  (as 
would have been original on your 71 US spec. bus), there is no way you will  
get your idle speed down to spec with the idle speed timing that far 
advanced,  no matter how you adjust the carb.  The 34PICT-3 is designed for idle 
speed  timing to be set at 5 deg AFTER TDC (using a DVDA distributor), and, as 
 I've said on this list before (and others have disagreed), trying to set 
the  idle speed even with the correct (for an SVDA distributor) idle speed 
timing of  7.5 deg BTDC using the 34PICT-3 is problematic on at least some 
vehicles  (my two 71's for example).  With the idle speed timing too far 
advanced,  you are forced to close the idle speed/bypass screw too much, and doing 
so is  likely to cause a poor transition off idle when you hit the throttle 
to  accelerate.

I would say that, if you can get the idle speed to spec at 7.5 deg BTDC  
idle speed timing, you are doing good.  The fact that you end up with 17.5  
deg BTDC at idle in order to get the right total advance suggests to me that 
you  are not getting enough advance range from your SVDA distributor, and  
perhaps it needs some modification to the centrifugal and/or vacuum advance  
mechanisms to correct that.
