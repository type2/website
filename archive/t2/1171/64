Timing is not determined by your distributor, it's determined by what 
engine you have and then you use the proper distributor (or properly 
adjusted distributor) to match the characteristics of your engine.  You 
can stick any distributor on any engine, but that doesn't mean it'll 
have the proper advance for that engine.
