Subject: Re: [T2] Rear shock

Syd,
 
With the bottom on a stud and top on a bolt not easy.  If it were the
other way one could jack up the bottom, you could jack down the top
but it
would be a scary rig.  Do you have the back of the car jacked up
though and
your new suspension (however it is lowered) at full droop?
That might get you
just what you need.  You can compress a KYB by
hand some distance but it does
take a good amount of force, your
strap idea is actually how a lot of gas
charged shocks come for this
exact reason as you mention.  Cut strap after
installation.   If you got
one of those straps you can probably (if you are a
fat 280lb F'er like
me) get it down a bit and into a longer strap without the
press, but
it can be nigh on impossible to get em back to shipping length by
hand sometimes.
 
There is no way to temporarily "relieve" the charge or
anything like
that however.
 
John

'press',..compress the shock..then
put those 'plastic collars'..they put on
shocks to keep them ..'small' for
shipping..then when it is good..cut those
plastic 'collars'..Viola..but my
problem..is..when I lowered the other side, I
don't remember..(OLD MIND),
having to do this!!  Is there some way, on a
'Gasadjust" shock..to make this
happen?
