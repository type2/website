Can you compress the shock on the floor with your body weigh pushing 
down on it?

Buy some cheap nylon straps - not the ratchet straps but the kind that 
have a spring loaded buckle or clasp which you release by simply pushing 
the button. These are usually the cheaper cousin to ratchet straps and 
fine for light duty cargo. Probably on the same retail shelf as ratchet 
straps.

Anyhow compress, have the strap wrapped around the shock over the top of 
the top bolt attachment point and under the bottom point and have your 
helper tighten it up. The factory does this with nylon packing strap 
when they tie down stuff to pallets or bundle building materials 
together, etc. I have received shocks packed this way to save space.

If this was too far obvious forgive me, pictures are better than words 
sometimes.
