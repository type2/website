Subject: True Canadian Winter Bus Campout update

Hi volks,

Could those considering attending the True Canadian Winter Bus Campout please
let me know their intentions? I haven't heard a lot of interest in the event
thus far, except from some who would visit, rather than stay overnight. If
we're short of a handful staying the night then it may be better to
reschedule.

Now to share some personal news: it looks like the fire remediation work on
our home is very nearly complete. Everything is finished except the kitchen
and bathrooms, and those are now in progress. If all goes to plan I should get
the keys back around the middle of next week, and the family will move in the
following weekend. Thus far it looks amazing, as everything was replaced from
the studs outwards. Everywhere you look is fresh paint, smooth new drywall and
brand new flooring. We will still have a considerable amount of work to do to
recondition some of our smoke-damaged belongings, but being at home once again
will certainly make that a lot easier to bear.

PS: please let's avoid wasting any further list bandwidth on my personal
issues. I will promise a final update along with some pictures once we're
finally moved back in. I'm not saying not to talk about it, just let's keep it
to private mail for the time being...

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
