Hi Angel,

Glad to hear you finally got your engine.

An air cleaner housing is not something that would normally be sold
anywhere. It's going to be a second-hand item.

We need to know a little more about your air cleaner. You have a 1976.
Did your mechanic keep you with your fuel injection system, or did the
new engine come with carburetors that he left on (or maybe someone in
the past changed it over)?

If in doubt, maybe it would help if you could post pictures of what you have.

John
