Yeah, Jamie.  Thanks.  I don't know why BD doesn't have those.  Glad to 
know somebody does.  I need to go ahead and get one.  What about the 
rubber thingy around the fuel filler?  Those are NOS I'm sure.  And I 
need one of those worse than anything.  That's where most of my fumes 
are coming from and if I point the nozzle in the wrong way, it'll run 
out on the ground!  Let me know if you know who has them.  Thanks....KR
