Subject: Re: [T2] Timing, idling, MPG and running hot

To some large degree, timing is predicated by the carb and regulatory 
stuff. Notice how many years there was no change in the basic engine, 
bore and stroke,  however the rules regarding exhaust emissions 
changed the carbs and the timing requirements.
