Subject: type 2 exhaust system

Hi all,

 

Since I replaced my exhaust system, I have a pair of BRAND NEW heater boxes,
the 180 degree pipes and an muffler in very good condition. I painted them
all with high heat silver paint. If anyone is interested, make me and offer.
I'd rather sell them cheap to someone who needs them and doesn't have a lot
of extra cash than letting them sit around getting in my way and collecting
dust.

 

Thanks
