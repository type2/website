I strongly second that. You'll get a better rebuild if the guy who actually
does the rebuild looks you in the eye when the money changes hands.
If you're in the area, the folks at GenStar are the most knowledgeable I
have met in the biz, and I highly recommend them.

Another good thing when dealing direct, a rebuilder may be able to provide
some options, such as higher output.
