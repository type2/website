Subject: RE:Gas heater

Hey Bob,

 

What type of gas heater do you have? I have some install manuals for my gas
heater.a southwind. I am not sure, but they might be generic enough that
they work for all southwind vw heaters.I've got a PDF of it, can't remember
where I got it.  Somehow through the list.
