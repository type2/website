Timing is based on fueling which is based on timing which is based on 
fueling.  You change one and you have to change the other until you find 
a balance - John Connolly from aircooled has said this over and over on 
thesamba.

My whole point in my previous post is that you can't just drop in a 
distributor (even a beautiful SVDA from aircooled) and assume that it's 
"correct".  It needs to be adjusted for the specs that were right for 
that model year engine (assuming that the rest of the engine is in stock 
configuration), or based on the recommendation of aircooled as to how 
you should have the distributor timed.  Now, if you change your 
carb/EFI/fueling, you are deviating from a standard which makes 
adjustment more complicated.

Adjusting timing is really tricky and I don't claim to be an expert at 
it.  However, I do know that timing is specific to the engine and not 
the distributor that you've installed in that engine.  Assuming that 
your engine is still in a stock configuration with a stock induction, 
then you want to find the timing specs for that engine and adjust your 
shiny new SVDA distributor to match the specs of that engine.  This way 
you'll get the performance that VW deemed desirable for that particular 
engine.
