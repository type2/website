Subject: Timing, idling, MPG and running hot

List folks,

TIMING:  I did the usual 3,333.3 mile tune-up on Lurch this weekend, but this
time i set the timing strictly by full advance readings (as I probably should
have done all along).  Timing at idle is now about 17.5 degrees BTDC.

IDLING:  The lowest my idle will go now is about 1250 RPM.  No carburetor
adjustments help (idle adjusting screw on the side of the 34 PICT 3 all the
way in).  How do I get it down to 950 RPM?

MPG:  My mileage has been crappy all along - about 17 mpg - essentially no
improvement since I got the SVDA distributor (to replace the 009) from
Aircooled.net a few years ago.

RUNNING HOT:  It has been running hotter since I replaced the Thunderbird
header with a "stock" muffler from Bus Depot earlier this year.  It has been
running especially hot in the colder weather, probably an artifact of the VDO
CHT thermistor configuration.  The sender is attached to the #3 exhaust header
about 2" from where it mounts to the head.  I found the temps here run about
50 degrees hotter than the #3 spark plug location.

I have yet to take it for a test drive to see if there are improvement in
temps or power, and I will be curious to see how far a tank of gas takes me
now.
