Subject: sink part

Howdy all,
I am about to work on some interior projects and figured I would replace a few
broken items while I was at it.  I am looking for the filler tube/pipe for the
water tank on a 71 westy sink unit.  I have the cap but the top threads on the
pipe are busted.  I saw a diagram somewhere (of course I cannot find it now)
that indicated the part is the same 68-79 but am not sure if that is true.  I
know 69-72 will work.  If you have one in a parts bin somewhere and want to
get rid of it, please let me know.  Thanks
Erik
