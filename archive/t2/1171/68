Subject: alternate alternators

Hi Folks,
           Are the Type IV alternators unique to our vehicles, or are they
common with any other Bosch alternator equipped vehicles of that era?  I'm
headed to the Pick n' Pull and would like to pick up a spare.  In my area Type
IVs are rare in the p n' p, but other Bosch alternators are common.   Models
and makes would be great.   I'm happy to change the fan and pulley, just need
the alternator itself.   Thanks. jon
