Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Radio Static

I knew there was someone who could provide a proper disertation on how 
to troubleshoot the problem. I would believe there is something wrong 
with the antenna. The coathanger is a great idea. If that gives good 
reception. Get a new antenna, unless you like the coathanger look.
