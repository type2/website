Subject: Question on seat valuation

Hey all -

I ran across a good full set of tan seats for my 72, including frames and
mounting hardware.  My bus has two ruined front seats, a missing middle seat
and a good black rear seat so these tan replacements are looking pretty good
to me.  The bus is Chianti Red, I believe, so tan will look ok even if it's
not a direct match.

The guy wants $250 for the set and all hardware, is that reasonable?

TIA

Joe
