Hi Kevin,

There may be some ground loop problem with the antenna. Try coupling 
the antenna through a .01 microfarad 50 volt or higher capacitor. 
Should be available at Radio Shack.

Any other of you electronic wizards have an idea?

But what I don't understand is if I leave it at a bad connection - ie 
just
hold the connectors close to each other, I get good reception, when I 
fully
connect them-that is when I run into static.
