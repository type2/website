Erik -

This water tank filler did fit Westies from 1964 thru 1979 and was
obsoleted some years ago, but I believe Trevor the Skylight Guy is
reactivating the Delta Six tooling for this and may be available from
Bus Depot if not now, perhaps pretty soon.

I will have to search thru my stash, but I may have a good used one or
two.  Some of my parts stash is in deep storage, so it might take
awhile to look for.
