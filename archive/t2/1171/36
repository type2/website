LOL!
That brought back a lot of memories.

Did a lot of that stuff to my 1971 Super Beetle so as to minimize 
noise in my amateur radio installation.

I even took a can and enclosed the distributor, ran the spark plug 
wires though grounded shielding, and manufactured some Faraday 
shields for additional suppression.

WOW !
