Subject: Re: [T2] alternate alternators

Jim,
 
Jon's actual question was for a Vanagon alternator for his Vanagon, he
just didn't mention it was a Vanagon.  I was wondering then if you might for
instance know if any of the mid 80's FWD alternators will physically swap
there with pulley/fan swaps.  I have a slew of them Rabbit, US and German Mk2
Golf/Jetta but they are all buried in a cold attic.
 
John

The 55amp Bus Alternator (72-79 Bus) is exactly the same as what is
used on
the 70-76 Porsche 914/4 (equipped with the 55amp alternator of
course),
pulley, fan and all.  The 411/412 models used the same 55amp
alternator,
pulley, fan and all.  In both cases it's a direct swap.
This is the Bosch
AL75X aka Lester # 13030 in some FLAPS.
