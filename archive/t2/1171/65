Subject: Re: [T2] Timing, idling, MPG and running hot

I spent more time with Lurch and this is what I found:

The idle comes down when I plug off the manifold vacuum port that the brake
servo hose connects to.  The hose has seen better days and really needs to be
replaced.

What do I use?  I posed this question earlier with no response.

I removed the hose from the back of the servo and plugged it there and the
idle still seems to be lower, but when hooked back up to the servo, the idle
comes up.

Futzing around with the carburetor, I find a lot of slop in the throttle shaft
- so much so, that I can hear a vacuum leak when I hold it a certain way.  The
carburetor needs to be re-bushed.

So, my major problem is vacuum leaks.  I need a new servo and some carburetor
work.

I have a H30/31 PICT that I could use, but I suspect the vacuum signal may be
all wrong for my SVDA distributor.
