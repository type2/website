I like the fold out camper conversion and would be interested in interior
shots if anyone comes across them.

The one for sale does meet the most basic spec for a mutant vehicle on the
playa ->"no base vehicle showing".  There are several vehicles with space
themes and the "is it fun for everyone else" bar is getting higher. 
Air-cooled vehicles, in general, do not tolerate playa dust as well as liquid
cooled.  Too much airflow in and around the working parts.  Playa dust sticks
to anything and blocks cooling airflow like concrete.  Filtering at the
airflow required for VW engine cooling is difficult.

Perhaps something like this is more "practical" ;)
