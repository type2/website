Subject: Rear shock

Hi, I have been in the process of 'lowering', my '74 Westy, and I got the
front done...'nice',and the drivers side rear, and now at 'altogether'..for
passenger side rear, but..I can't 'compress' the shock..(Gas a Just), and
without doing that, I cannot get the shock to fit lower attachment..and
'upper'!  So, I am going to go to the nearest place that has a
'press',..compress the shock..then put those 'plastic collars'..they put on
shocks to keep them ..'small' for shipping..then when it is good..cut those
plastic 'collars'..Viola..but my problem..is..when I lowered the other side, I
don't remember..(OLD MIND), having to do this!!  Is there some way, on a
'Gasadjust" shock..to make this happen?
Cheers
Syd
