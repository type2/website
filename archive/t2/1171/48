Subject: Re: [T2] Timing, idling, MPG and running hot

I tried to reply, quoting just the material that C. Dreike posted, but I was
rejected for some reason.

Anyhow, here was what C. Dreike said:

And here was my reply:

"I agree about that amount of advance.  Full advance is 28 degrees and it gets
to full advance at about 3100 RPM.

The vacuum line is disconnected and plugged.  With it connected, the advance
(full) is closer to 40 degrees."


Then I went out to look at things again.

When I started it up, the idle was about 950 RPM and the timing was about 7.5
degrees.  That's fine.  But as it warmed up, the idle sped up and the timing
advanced accordingly.

I'm thinking I might have a vacuum leak somewhere in the vacuum line that runs
to the servo (or maybe in the servo).  To test, I removed the vacuum line
while the engine was running, and the engine just quit.

I need to figure out a way to plug that manifold port off completely and see
what that does.
