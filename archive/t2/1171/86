Subject: Re: [T2] alternate alternators

Well,

On this same line, might I ask a related question?

I am planning on installing an alternator into my 70 bus, which 
currently uses the (longer) 38 amp generator.

I'd like reliability, so I lean towards Bosch, as opposed to Chinese, etc.

Prefer to size upwards from the normal 55 ampere unit to a 70-75 
amperes alternator.

Where do I go for a source of reliability in what I install?
