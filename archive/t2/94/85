VW has them----
I got a new one a couple months ago, and the parts manager told me there
were several hundred it their warhouses all over the US.
No problem.

I went by the Flaps and had a nice conversation with the lovely Glenda.
We were talking about the thermostats for pancakes and she called up a
couple of her dealers. One said they had 100 coming in this week and the
other said they had 150 coming in... Is someone new repoping these?
