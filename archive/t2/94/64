Subject: Themostats for pancakes (available again??)

I went by the Flaps and had a nice conversation with the lovely Glenda.  We
were talking about the thermostats for pancakes and she called up a couple
of her dealers.  One said they had 100 coming in this week and the other
said they had 150 coming in...  Is someone new repoping these?
