Richard,
That's the regular late Bus window crank.  I'm pretty sure they are still
available though that thin-shank version is a little rarer than the
thick-shank version you are probably finding instead (though either one will
work).

Check the RMMW catalog, I seem to recall seeing the thin shank cranks there.
You should be able to order them via Bus Depot if they're available.
