You really should engineer a new mounting point if you don't use the stock 
ones on top of the wheel housing.  A mollybolt may not hold the 180lbs+ of 
human being that could be thrown forward against it.  VW seat belt mounting 
locations have a pretty good sized chunk of steel behind or under the sheet 
metal that you usually don't see.  

If you aren't able to fabricate one yourself that duplicates the properties 
of the originals and weld it in, hire someone that builds sandrails or stock 
car frames to do it correctly.  Safe seatbelts are NOT something you want to 
risk your family and friend's lives on in an effort to save a few $$'s!
