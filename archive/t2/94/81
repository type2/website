Oops, my mistake.  I meant to say increase.  Generally, a minor 
vacuum leak will cause an increase in idle speed (engine getting a 
larger, leaner volume of A/F but still combustable), while a major 
one will cause a decrease (mixture now too lean to fire) and 
eventually kill the motor.  If the booster is working correctly, 
it acts like a minor vacuum leak and causes an increase in idle.

I think if the diaphragm was leaking, it would be a constant 
vacuum leak since the other side is exposed to the atmosphere.

Thanks for catching my error.
