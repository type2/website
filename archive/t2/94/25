I saw that too, and I think it's a pretty neat little package.  A 
lot of functionality for the money.  The battery inside, at 40 amp-
hours might be a little small depending on what you would use it 
for.  It would only power the inverter at full load for ~20 
minutes.  Don't believe the "1200 watt surge" rating - it will 
shut down at just above 600 watts.  If you were going to buy the 
inverter, battery charger, and jumper cables anyway, then it's a 
great deal.  On the other hand, you can get a 90 amp-hour battery 
alone for under $50.  The battery will also tuck neatly away under 
the seat whereas that xPower device will probably not fit.
