Subject: Re: [T2] westy vs. campmobile question


Hey there Volks,

I might have missed some of this thread (I'm in digest mode now), but
the most accurate way (IMHO) to identify a westfalia (campmobile) is
to look at the mcode plate.

Goto http://www.type2.com/m-codes/ to explore the possibilities of
your baywindow mcode plate. Mucho thanks to Vincent.

If your bus has one of the following mcodes, it's a westy. 

P21 = Hardtop camper package
P22 = Standard pop-top package (AKA Weekender. icebox,sink - no
stove)
P27 = Deluxe pop-top package (stove, fridge, and extras)
In 78 and 79 the P21 option wasn't available.

Example. My 79 westy's mcode plate decoded here:

The vintagebus guys (and gals) are always talking about splitty
mcodes. For some reason the baylist never discusses mcodes. I guess
that the baywindow mcodes aren't that exciting 8-)

Any one know what mcode D03 is on a bay ??
