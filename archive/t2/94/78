Subject: Pop top hold downs

Hi everyone,
I'm looking for the metal brackets that attach to the original style rubber
roof hold downs. I have 'new' rubber hold downs (without the brackets) and
want to fabricate 'original' style by installing the metal to the new
rubber. I have 2, need one more. I've depleted my supply at the local
salvage yard...
Any ideas?

I have a 73 Campmobile.
