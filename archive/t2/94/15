Subject: Re: [T2] Nut Size??

John,
It's 24mm.  Same size as the oil pressure sender.  Go ahead and buy a 24mm
deep socket so you can use it for both the steering wheel and the oil
pressure sender.

I think it is the same size as on the Beetle, I seem to recall using mine to
remove the steering wheel on my Karmann Ghia when I had it.

> Shame on all of you for your dirty thoughts about the subject line!! I'm
talking about the nut that holds the steering wheel on in a bay window bus,
Anyone know off hand what size this is and more importantly, anyone know if
this is the same size as the same nut on a Super Beetle??  I'm guessing
between 24-28 mm, but I can't fing this tidbit of info in ANY of my manuals
and I don't want to buy the wrong size from the hardware store.
