Take your VOM, turn the knob to read resistance (ohms (the omega (the
upside-down U :))), remove the lenses from the tail lights and remove the
bulbs.  Touch the black lead to the outer metal shell at the base of the
bulb and the red lead to one of the contacts on the end.  Then move the
red probe to the other contact.  Both should have read a low, but not 0
reading.
If the reading goes to 0 then there is an  internal short (rare)
If the reading did not change, then the filament is dead (common)
In either case replace the bulb.

If all the filaments test good, then take a pencil eraser and go over the
contacts on the rear of the bulb, the case of the bulb, the case of the
socket and the contacts at the bottom of the socket.. Polish them until
they shine (this may take a while). Then turn the knob on the VOM to
12VDC.  Turn on the lights and touch the black probe to the outer shell of
the socket and the red probe to each of the contacts at the base of the
socket.  One should read 12V, the other should not.  Have someone step on
the brakes.  Test again.  the other contact should now give 12V.

If both now give 12V at the appropriate times and the bulbs are good,
reinsert bulbs and verify operation. If you have not found the problem by
this point, write again.  I am 99 and 44/100% sure that you will have
cured the problem, given your description of the symptoms.
