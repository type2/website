Subject: Engine rise on breaking...

Hey list,

I noticed something strange today. When I depress the break pedal on my
bus with the engine idling, the RPM goes up slightly, and then fals back
down. When I release the break it does the same thing only more noticable.
What gives? Do I have a vac leak?

Thanks,
