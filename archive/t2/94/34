Subject: Re: [T2] retractable seat belts

Actually, my three-peg belts are mounted on two pegs, with the first and 
last bolted to the same hole in a big loop. I can't speak for the safety of 
this in a full-on collision, but you'll likely be crushed to death in a 
full-on collision, anyway. We are talking about buses.

The mechanism can be mounted horizontally as well as facing up, for the 
record. On the passenger side this goes without a hitch, but on the driver's 
side mine catches in the cold (but not when it's warm).
