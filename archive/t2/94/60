Subject: ?charging problem

My lights keep going bright then dim in conjunction with the engine revs
also noticed that the bus appears to be getting a little harder to
start-cranking over 3-4 times as opposed to first time previously.Already
changed the belt and tensioned it but no difference-is the regulator on its
way out or the generator/dynamo.It's a'71 by the way-thanks for any
advice-Martin
