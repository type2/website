The one you're talking about is the one that goes in the front, under the
cab area.  That one is indeed supposed to be on every bus.

Incidentally, that item (211 703 611H, $39.95 in our catalog/website) has
now been discontinued.  We have perhaps 3 left, genuine VW and with a little
bit of surface rust from being at the bottom of the stack, and when they're
gone we probably won't see more.  So if you need one, grab one now while you
can...
