Subject: Is my 69 a Westy???

  My 69 has a (I think you guys are calling it a z-bed) cabinet and bed
assembly that is similar to the picture today of that white bus that was
posted. But instead of a pop top a have a 4' sunroof. I always assumed that
someone had installed this from another bus but after all this talk about
"California Campers" I am wondering what mine really is. How would I go
about finding out?
