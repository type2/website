Subject: Re: [T2] retractable seat belts

 I just mounted a set of belts from an 85 Vanagon in my 70 Westy and only had 
to make a few changes:
1) upper mounting bolt had to be spaced out about 3/8" so it would         
clear the windlace on the door jam. The Vanagon belt hanger is                
  wider than stock and wouldn't move freely in the stock postion. I 
 used a longer bolt with a nut between the body and hanger.
2) Disposed of Vanagon plastic cover - too bulky and wouldn't fit
3) I used a small 'L' shaped bracket from a new set of belts I bought 
previously. The retractor mechanism mounted to the top of the bracket and the 
other end was bolted thru the bracket to the stock mounting location. My 
logic is that the stock system utilized only two bolts and I trusted the 
reinforced stock ares over a new one. 
 The belts are working beautifully, I can reach my glove box or adjust the 
radio without having to unbuckle, what a concept! One of the nicest and most 
functional retrofits I've done.
  I would give the standard warning though. Be careful of the donor bus you 
take the belts from, make sure the belts aren't stretched from being in an 
accident. I got my belts from a Vanagon at a local wrecking yard thhad a dead 
engine, not crash damaged. That was my  02 worth, of course YMMV.....
