Subject: selling my panel

Hello,
I have made the decision to sell my 71 panel van, it
just isn't practicle to drive to work in it at 5:30 in
the morning in colorado. I have been using it as my
daily driver for the last two years. It is in alright
shape. Has some rust on the driver's floor, fender
arches, and rockers. It runs good and i just did a
tune up last week. I want to get $3500 for it. I feel
this van is worth it as I have seen worse late panels
go for much more around here. I only have one picture
online right now, but hope to have more soon. I am
located in Englewood, CO

BTW,
The 411 pictured on this page is also for sale, asking
$500

Thanks,
Tyler
