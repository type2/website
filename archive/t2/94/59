Well now that I am going to have the engine out for a rebuild its time =
to finally install the (early) BN4 heater I have. I have read everything =
in the library and feel good about doing this install. But...

I wonder if anybody has a parts bus with the duct still in it that =
converts the square heat ducting to a round duct:

So I can mate it with something I can get at the hardware store. I hate =
to just tape them together. Any ideas? I didn't SEE anything like this =
at the store.


I would also like to find the recirculating plastic if anybody has that:

If I can get those 2 pieces from somebody it brings up my second =
inquiry. It doesn't appear that there is a connection from the vent in =
the driver's side rear (that I will have to cut and install) to these =
plastic recirculating pieces. What connects these, or do I have to =
fabricate something? Won't I be sucking in more fresh, cold air than =
recirculated air if I don't connect the vent somehow? Any tips from =
people who have done this? I imagine I don't need the plastic pieces. I =
think a regular dryer vent will work, but how do I get it up the narrow =
fresh air area and mated to the new vent. I would love pics of other's =
arrangements.=20


Lastly I am missing the original fresh air intake hose that goes on the =
bottom of the heater. Its the hot air type foil and cardboard hose that =
connects to a metal pipe. I have neither. If I am using the recirculated =
air do I block this off? I imagine not.  I found some clear plastic hose =
stuff in the plumbing section at the hardware store that is a perfect =
fit. Since its just fresh air will this work or will the heater get so =
hot it will melt? I have never even seen a gas heater run so I don't =
know how hot the actual heater gets, but I will by the end of February!!


My heater also came with a template from the donor bus for cutting the =
firewall. I would lend this out if anybody needs it, after I am done. =
Here is a pic with the firewall piece shown:

Anybody who has done this install and would like to chat about it email =
me!!

Thanks for any input!! Pictures borrowed from the type2.com library for =
email purposes. Thanks.
