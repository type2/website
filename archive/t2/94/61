You're absolutely right, and I'm pretty sure I read somewhere that
seatbelts have a "lifespan" related to the stretching caracteristics of
their material...   I think it's something like 15-20 years....  As you
mentionned a seatbelt stretches when an accident occurs, and that
stretching helps to "pad" the shock of the impact.

So in theory, if you still have your original seatbelts on your 25-year old
bus, they might be "too old" to protect you efficiently, and it probably
would be a good idead to change them for modern ones! Safety first!

...and No I don't work for a seatbelt manufacturer.
