Yes and no, Nick.  When you press the break pedal, you *create* a vacuum
leak.  It's deliberate, and necessary for the power brakes to operate.
The leak, however, should not be sever enough to cause your RPMs to rise
and fall.  I would suggest two places to look:

First, there is a check valve in the line to the brakes that is located
near the air distribution box.  pull it off and try to  blow thru it  both
ways.  Yous should  be able to blow towards the vacuum assist, but not the
other way.  If you can, it needs replacing.

Second, you have the beginnings of a failure in your booster.  Attach a
vacuum  gauge to your engine and idle it.  Note the reading on the gauge.
remove the booster line and plug it.  Idle the engine again and see if the
reading has changed.  If it has, then you have a leak in the lines or the
booster.  Remove the line at the booster and plug it.  Check vacuum
again.  If it is OK, then start shopping for a good used or rebuilt
booster. Else look up and down the line for a broken or cracked fitting or
a break in the line.

A final check that kind of duplicates the others is that there *should* be
enough vacuum stored and held in the booster and line that you have power
brakes for 1 or two stops after the engine is turned off.  Check to see if
there is by pedal feel.  If there is not, then there is a leak
*somewhere*, probably a bad check valve, but maybe a cracked line/fiting
or dying booster.
