Subject: Re: [T2] Pop top hold downs

I have all 3 rubber hold downs with the metal and the brackets that screw to
the bus. I don't know exactly which it is you need, but you can have the
part you need for free (in honor once again of Karl von Salzen giving away
parts to me for free). Just pmail me your address and explain which part
exactly you need.


(sent to the entire list so we can kill this one)
