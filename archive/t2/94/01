Subject: Re: [T2] rear hatch window installation

Silicone spray- there is a difference, so get the good stuff, which is nice
and thick, and spray liberally. This along with the string & bone and a
friend to push on the outside should do it. The rear is propably one of the
hardest as it is so small, tight and recessed. I replaced all the seals on
my '72 Westy, only on the last one did I discover the difference between
silicon sprays. Only then was I able to put in the drivers's rear quarter
(w/vent) by myself! And to think that this is the one I was worried about!
