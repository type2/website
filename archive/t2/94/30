Subject: Re: Nut Size??

For a '71 bus it's not the same size as a beetle which uses the front axle
and steering wheel nut interchangeably.

Off the top of my head I think it's a 27.

Odd size but I remember buying a 28mm and taking it back and exchanging for
a 27. I can check the socket in my tool box when I get home.
