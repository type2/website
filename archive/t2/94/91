I think this might be the correct answer.

Added to "strengthen" the chassis, or change the harmonic resonances of 
same, when the mass coefficient values of the overall body might have been 
found to have been altered with the cutting out of the large top section so 
as to add the pop top tent design.

My 69 Riviera (stateside conversion) did not have a belly pan.

My two 70 Westys (German conversion) do have the belly pan.

I think the need for a belly pan was probably conceived or calculated as a 
good idea by the German conversion people, and maybe this thought was not 
picked up on by the stateside conversion folks.
