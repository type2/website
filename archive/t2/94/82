Hey folks,


I was contacted by this bus owner who needs to sell a bus. It sounds like a
good deal to me. I will give the list subscriber that referred it ( your
referral has to be to the purchaser) and the person who buys this bus, both
a $25.00 gift certificate towards parts from BUStedBUS. Same person? $50.00

Please contact these folks about the bus,
