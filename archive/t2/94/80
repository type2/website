I replaced my window cranks with the ones that Porsche 
uses on the 968 CS and the 964 RS, these light weight 
models do not have electric windows. These use the 
same screw and the same plastic washer to protect the 
upholstery.

The basic metal part of the crank is still our trusted 
VW part, yet the surrounding is re-designed and 
stronger, as is the knob. They look factory yet a little 
more modern, more roundish. They were about $20 each.
