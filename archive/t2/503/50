Assuming you mean this location:

m=display&sz=no

then yes, that is the factory location.  The fire extinguisher was  
included on deluxe Westies that had the stove next to the sink.

Yes, fire extinguishers can expire.  There is usually a gauge on them  
to indicate "good" or "bad".  As far as testing and recharging goes,  
call your local fire department, and they can give you all the  
information you need.
