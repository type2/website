Subject: Prototyping/Reproducing NLA Bus Parts

I will in the next month have in hand complete systems for precise 4-axis 
CNC production of parts of all kinds in a great number of materials.  As an 
example, I might make up some door strap end holders, and if I can 
anticipate a few dozens or more orders, the costs can be reasonable.

At this point the whole operation is being planned, and with that in mind, 
I am interested in which no longer available parts are most in need by the 
T-II community. Otherwise, I will be contracting design and prototyping 
services to a wide variety of markets, along with short run manufacturing 
of custom designs. Send your needs for other than Bus things by p-mail, 
please. Keep it small, like anything that will fit within a 6" box.

Regards,

Doktor Tim's Spezialwerkstatt
