Subject: Rectifier

After a little troubleshooting I have determined that the transformer in
my Westy's rectifier has gone bad.  If anyone has a good spare rectifier
sitting around I would be willing to trade some dough or parts for it.
I couldn't find anything online that would even come close to the specs
of the original part.  I can't wait to get the fridge back on city
power-my beer is getting warm.
