To add further fuel to the fire (so to speak), I'm of the opinion that a
fire extinguisher is a very good thing to carry in *any* car.  I used to
keep extinguishers in all of my aircooled VW's as a precaution, yet the time
I *had* an engine fire was in my wife's watercooled Cabriolet .. which didn't
have an extinguisher (at the time, I keep them in *all* my cars now).  It was
the one car that I never expected to have a fire.  Fortunately we were at a
stoplight next to a diner, and the people there had extinguishers.  I think
it took two to get the fire out ..

Live and learn.
