I'll probably get "moderated" (again), but...  What Duane said.

Mat, have you considered a Toyota... or perhaps a Honda? Maybe a Lexus 
or H2 would work.

When I saw the coming together of the community, I was reminded once 
again what a great crowd we hang with.  This type of outpouring of 
support is why I didn't hesitate to add my name to the AIRS list with 
the notation, "You can park in my driveway."

We're a family. And families help one another out.
