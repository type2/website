Mine has a square hole for a 1/2" torque wrench/ratchet wrench/breaker bar.

That said, you'd be way better of getting a set of large sockets--they are 
useful for

with a
hydraulic press, they can be used for installing wheel bearings.

Note that Harbor Freight has the annoying habit of putting the thing you 
just bought,
on sale at 50% off, three weeks after you order..............
