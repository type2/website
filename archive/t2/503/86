Hi Matt,

Flame suit getting warm yet?  I'm going to step up to the podium and 
refute your opinions with some of my own observations.

I do. I have three kids, and I know for a certainty that my westfakia 
will be the last thing I sell. I already gave up my motorcycles to 
support my bus. I've had a bus as an only vehicle before, and I 
wouldn't be afraid to do it again.

Over the years I've seen a nearly-new Jag catch fire, and seen more 
than one Benz written off as well. You're right that it isn't as common 
in other vehicles, but it happens. There are pluses and minuses to bus 
ownership. Fire risk is a minus.

Again I disagree. Chris has invested substantial time and effort into 
learning about bus maintenance. Many people on this list (and others) 
have helped Chris become reasonably proficient at keeping a bus on the 
road. Why throw that away? A properly maintained bus can run a LOT 
cheaper than many newer vehicles in a dollar-per-mile contest. The hard 
part is catching up on overdue maintenance neglected by the PO, or 
(alternatively) finding an affordable bus with good pedigree.

This community is capable of great things. Last year I burned a valve 
on my bus and a bunch of my bus-friends snuck into my garage behind my 
back and fixed it while I was out-of-town for a week on business. When 
I heard about Chris I was saddened by her loss, gladdened (?) by the 
fact that no-one was hurt and left feeling that I wanted to do 
something to help. Apparently I was not alone in that sentiment, and I 
think this is a credit to the list. As soon as someone posts a paypal 
address, my web-browser will be pointed at it.

Your milage may vary.

Happy trails,
