Subject: brake fluid filler to reservoir hose

Question...

The various parts places sell a brake fluid hose, p/n N 020 350 1/1M, it's 7mm.  Does this hose run between the fluid filler and the reservoir on top of the master cylinder?  If so, is some sort of modification needed to fit the hose?  It seems way to small.

thanks,
