Subject: RE: [T2] Burnt bus fund

Not to be a hearless jerk, and I admittedly don't know all the details, but 
on some level this bothers me.

If you have 2 kids, and only one vehicle:
a) I don't know that I'd own a bus
b) if my sole vehicle burned down, which is not a common problem among most 
vehicles, I think it may be a little irresponsible to turn around and 
replace it with the same vehicle.
c) to ask for donations to help this person put herself back in a position 
where she's got (if we're talking about "a bus", not a Vanagon or newer) at 
least a 24 year old vehicle as a primary means of transporting kids, is 
needlessly selfish.

This kind of reminds me of the $5/plate "spaghetti dinner" held for a guy 
who went to the beach and had $700 stolen car. Duh - do't go to the beach 
and leave $700 in the car! Sure it's only $5 - but if everyone did that you 
could go to $5 dinners every night all year.

Rant off...
