Subject: Re: [T2] Rust around the window (and how bad is surface rust)

My worry is that once the windshield is out 
I'm
gonna find rust everywhere. Is there anyway to tell
how badly rusted 
the front
may be without pulling the window (Perhaps sound
echo)?
  
If you're worried about finding rust everywhere under
the windshield, then i'd suggest not remove it. There
really is no way to tell just how bad it is until you
remove it, mine had a little hole starting just below
the windshield passengers side, when i removed the
windshield there was major surface rust all along the
bottom edge, the rust was starting to get hungry and
started munching metal..

remove, repair, use a catalist primer, 4 coats
minimal, and 4 coats finish PPG i prefer..

good luck,
