  You said,
"The jack doesn't seem to want to go up? If I pull the jack out from the bus
it
works just fine. "

   I think you should check the fluid level .(hydraulic fluid) Sounds like
there is barely enough to
lift anything. Should be a cap or small threaded screw under the handle or
on the reservoir.
