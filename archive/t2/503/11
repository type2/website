Just to let the list know, I directed Bub, from Utah to this list for 
help and information on his way back from Ct to utah in his 74 bus.  I 
met him tonight after finding out from a good friend that he had bought 
a bus in Utah to drive + ship out a bunch of musical gear to NYC for 
his son.   They took turns driving/sleeping for 63 hours.  He'll be 
leaving Ct on Sunday to drive back, and I made him aware of this list 
in case he needed assistance.  Great guy, kind heart, good guest
