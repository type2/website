Jasan,

That wire is the bane of bus owners, it's the connection from the horn
button up top ;^)

If it's broken, I presume that you ( like many of us ) have a separate
button on the dash for your horn?

> One strange thing is, there is a wire that runs from between the nut to
under the head of one of the bolts for the coupler. Any idea what it could
be for? One end of the wire has broken so it isn't doing anything anyway.
What would be wired to the coupler like this?
