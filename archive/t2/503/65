From the look of some vehicles, forever. ;-)

Only if it's waterproof primer...Some primers and some flat paints
aren't waterproof; so can only change the color of the rust while
allowing water and air to feed the tin worm...

International Urban Legend...?-(

Why do Fiats rust so fast (other than the canard that England
invented rust but sold the patent to Italy...?-)
During Italy's communist government rule, Fiat leased out produc-
tion to Eastern Bloc countries and in return got steel...The legend
has it that the steel was so sub-standard that Fiats rusted on the
assembly line...Truth? We report, you decide... ;-)

Tony in NJ (who once had a Fiat that had warp-rust...It rusted faster
                 than light...)
