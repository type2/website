Subject: Piston Questions

I just obtained a pair of new pistons, which were part of a set of four.
The box has "Kolbenschmidt AG" printed all over it, and the following
numbers:

029 198 075
92 803 960

The second number has "Volkbusrist" printed under it.

The pistons are in their original wrappings and have never been used.
There's also an open set of seals, gaskets, and the odd widget (a metal disk
with 6 holes in it?) with the following text and numbers on the package:

039 198 009
"Reinz Vollsatz"-Full Set-Pochette Complete
01-23455-06
914  2,0  2,0  LTR.100  PS  (73,5KW)  1972/

I'm hoping to get something from then to put toward the bill on my bus's
engine replacement.  Does anyone have an idea of what these may be worth?
Thank you!
