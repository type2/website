Subject: oil pressure relief socket

If you don't know there's a special tool for the oil pressure relief cap on
the engine. Some folks use a chisel since the tool is only available from
the Porsche dealer for $54 (maybe less thru Baum). Still, it's damn
expensive for something you don't use that often.

I bought a 15/16" drag link socket for $5 knowing that it wouldn't fit and
modified it to fit the cap using a grinder:

I used some modeling clay to take an impression of the cap so I could get
the radius right on the grinder. Works like a charm.
