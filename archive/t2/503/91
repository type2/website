Subject: Leisure battery and charging

Hi,

Checked the archives but couldn't see what I am after.

Got a 1977 2.0L Westy. (German Specification, even though I am from the UK)

I have a 85amp deep cycling leisure battery for my second battery.

Is the alternator going to have trouble with this and cause starting
problems with my main battery?
