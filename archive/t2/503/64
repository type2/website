This number is in the repair category and describes a 94mm piston kit for a
2L. The kit should include:

039 101 301C cylinder
022 107 111M piston
025 107 251  piston ring, upper
022 107 361D pisont ring, lower
022 107 351A oil scraper ring
022 107 411A piston pin
N 012 301 1  lock ring x 2

If complete I'd say each one was worth about $100 especially since they are
singles are folks with engine troubles and low on cash won't want to buy a
whole set.

That is a Victor Reinz gasket set for a 2L 914. It's worth about $60.

The disk with the 6 holes goes between the flywheel bolts and the flywheel.
