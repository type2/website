All of that seems to be there, but the rings look like they're already on
the piston and the piston is in the cylinder.  I don't want to pull them
apart as I don't have a ring tool for putting the piston back into the
cylinder.

There's only one "C" locking ring per cylinder, though, not 2.

Cool, thanks.

It appears that whoever bought the kit used whatever seals they needed to
install the other cylinders.  Without any experience, I wouldn't know if all
of the bits are there for the remaining cylinders.  Is it worth $60.00 half
there, or complete?

Well, if anyone needs a pair of cylinders for a job, I got the goods. :O)
