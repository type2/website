Hi John,
I had to do this on my generator a month ago. You turn the generator into a
motor using the battery as a power source. Remove the fan belt. This allows
the generator to spin freely. Before connecting the wires, start the
generator spinning in its normal direction. Once it is spinning, touch the
two wire to the battery. Oh, be sure to disconnect the regulator from the
generator first. Make the generator spin for about 15 seconds. That's it. I
think that is all there is to it.
Dave
