Subject: hydraulic jack

Hi Everyone,

I'm attempting to jack up my bus with a floor jack that I purchased a few years
ago. I'm attempting to jack the front of the bus so I can find out why the
steering is so loose.
The jack doesn't seem to want to go up? If I pull the jack out from the bus it
works just fine. I can stand on it with no problem and it lifts me up. It seems
to be that the jack has certain "points" which it needs to reach before it will
be able to lift (this is just speculation).
I've pulled the screw out to ensure nothing was blocking it but I don't know
what else to do.
I would really like to fix it as it cost quite a bit of money and most jacks
don't extend far enough to lift the bus.
Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Harry
