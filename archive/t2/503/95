Subject: Re: [T2] Burnt bus fund

No white flags necessary. We disagree on this one - so be it.
I don't like being the bad guy and this is probably a case where I should've 
silently disagreed and moved on.

I've been fortunate enough to have enough extra time and money to enjoy 
owning a bus.
That will not always be the case, that's why I call it a luxury. When my 
baby is born in this Spring, I will probably have to sell the bus and 
tighten up my finances. To me, that's the only responsible decision I can 
make.

I see lots of cases where people are consistenly making poor decisions and 
asking for help, only to perpetuate more bad decisions. That was my reaction 
when I read that. I acknowledge not knowing all the details and 
circumstances, but was compelled to point out the possibility of this being 
such a case.

If anyone wants to have a last word, I promise I won't say any more on the 
matter.
