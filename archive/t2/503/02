Subject: Fw: [T2] 3 Things I Really LOVE About Driving a Bus!

Well,
I must add my 3:
 - long distance travelling. Never been in any vehicle that leaves you so
refreshed after 12hrs driving like a VW bus!
 - Camping. Anywhere, any time, any conditions. Cool.
 - Mateship. You always have friends and heaps of friendly waves when you
travel in a bus :-).

And to think I actually considered a few jap vans before getting hooked on
VW's (shiver)
