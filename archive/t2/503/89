Subject: Re: [T2] Burnt bus fund

I'm going to say a little piece as well.
As a pretty new bus owner (Aug) I thought at first that they would
be a little more problematic so I also picked up a small older toy wagon
as my main vehicle.

Guess what.. It's Jan and The Toyota is in the shop (still) and the van
has impressed me immensely. Running good, some small things that I
have fixed myself and I have put prob 10,000 km on it already. I trust
the darn thing strangely enough. And thats with my 2 kids in it too.

Only thing is Im wanting my car fixed cause it's too darn cold at the
moment.

I can't ever see myself selling the van either.
I got a loan of a newer van (chrysler) for a week while we were
figuring out what was needed to fix the sliding door. I so missed my
van it wasn't funny... It's not a luxury, it's more a state of mind ;)
