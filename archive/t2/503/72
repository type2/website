Subject: Re: [T2] question about my rebuild

Anything's possible Mike.
When I replaced my burnt valves on my 74--and put a cross hatch and new
rings in my cylinder's--just for grins I applied a thin coat of the
trick GM sealer to the shims--just to be on the safe side--
To date no leaks of any kind--anywhere I used this miracle in a tube--

I have a couple of buddies that are GM wrenches that don't even use
gaskets on any rebuilds--they just use this stuff--

It is a great product--and I highly recommend it--

Good Luck--

I have a 2.0L engine that's just about done. I was doing some reading on
Richard Atwell's site and saw the bulletin about the shims that come
with the Victor Reinz set. I put the aluminum shims underneath the
cylinders, however, I didn't put any sealer on them... are the cylinders
going to start leaking oil there?? 
If it's a possibility that they would leak, I guess I could still pull
everything off and put sealant on the cylinders... ugh, that would be a
pain, though! 
thanks,
Mike
