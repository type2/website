On some level the above response to the selfless act of supportive friends
bothere me.
No wait...on EVERY LEVEL!

> a) I don't know that I'd own a bus
I like that she's giving the kids the fun of a fun ride. My kid's friends
beg their volvo and lexes driving parents to let them catch rides in one of
my vintage Vdubs.

Right...to be perfectly safe let's change her replacement ride to a horse
drawn carriage.

> c) to ask for donations...
SHE DIDN'T ASK....Before you rant please get your facts straight.

REMEMBER THE LAW OF RECIPROCATION!
WHAT YOU PUT OUT THERE WILL COME BACK TO YOU.
IF YOU INVEST LOVE AND CARE YOU WILL RECEIVE THAT.
IF YOU INVEST HEARTLESS CRITICISM....WELL

TO THE MOM WITH KIDS:
THE LOVE YOU'VE INVESTED IS COMING BACK TO YOU IN THE FORM OF YOUR FRIENDS
RALLYING TO HELP YOU IN YOUR TIME OF NEED...THAT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
THING!
