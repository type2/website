There is another very good tool. Not as multi-use as george's suggestion,
perhaps, but very effective.

Get a cheap (harbour freight or similar) 46mm socket and weld it to a 48"
piece of 1" x 2" rectangular tube. It will never break, and you will never
have a problem removing or torqueing the axle nut again. Weld a 36mm socket
on the other side of the tube and you have a gland nut and bug axle nut tool
also.

I first saw this tool at the racetrack, one of the formula vee racers had
one in his kit. As soon as I could find some decent cheap sockets (gedore
brand, made in brazil, sold by princess auto, about 5 bucks each) I bought
them and made up this tool for myself and it works great for removing axle
nuts and gland nuts. For re-torqueing it works also, but you don't know
exactly how tight you are making the nut.
