Subject: Re: [T2] Removing the rear axle nut

Hi Scott,

Assuming the arm is 48" long, drill a hole in the end opposite the  
sockets. Hook a "fish scale" onto the hole, and pull on it until the  
scale reads 1/4 of the desired torque.

It's primitive, but it'll get you in the neighbourhood.

Happy trails,
