Subject: Re: [T2] 3 Things I Really LOVE About Driving a Bus!

I'll go along with Richard's, and add;

i) Mood, I was often stressed out ( and, I must admit, a bit aggressive ) in
traffic, but in Tigger I can stay a LOT happier & calmer. Much more
enjoyable experience for all concerned ;^)

ii) It's addictive, my ex who named Tigger called me this week to get advice
on what to look for, and has now bought a '77 camper ;^)

iii) Camper specific, as well as being great to drive, the Oz Supro layout,
at least, is the best camper layout I've ever seen/used in a smaller camper,
WAY more usable than the Toyota hi-roof I used for a 6 week holiday in NZ,
makes it easy to pull off the road when you're too tired to drive, get to
bed quickly, get up in the morning to make breakfast & get back on the road
again, nice ;^)
