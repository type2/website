Oooh, ouch, no it was not anywhere near that bad. That's scary. Mine does
have some visible cracks though. I had already bought one from Ron at BD for
$18.95. Same part# but I dont know if its the mexican version or not. Hope
not. From that photo it looks like maybe it will be easier to get to from
the top. Did you replace yours durring the resto?

Thanks for the info!
