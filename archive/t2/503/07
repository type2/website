I know I got one for my 78 couple years ago, but derned if I can remember
where, but I suspect it is from this VW repair shop in southwest central
PA.  I have his card here somewhere, but he claims to have several
containers full of every cable VW ever made....he has had every cable I
needed, 

  if you can't find one I will tear my office apart for his card it's here
somewhere
