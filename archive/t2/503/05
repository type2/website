Subject: Update on the BBB burned bus

This is the bus that was on the way to BBB from Tulsa OK with a single mom
and her two kids.  This bus was her daily driver.  With Pete's permission, I
am passing this on.  Pete is a friend of Chris who has helped her with her
bus many times and even built the engine for her.  I asked Pete if she knew
what started the fire and she did not know what caused it but it did come
from the engine bay.

If you are one who would like to help Chris get back in a bus, Ronnie at
OldVolkshome.com in Havasu is putting together a raffle for Saturday evening
at the BBB and is putting together a "get Chris back in a bus fund".


Rick,
Yes, I was on the phone with her last night.  Her Dad was able to come out
and pick her and the kids up.  Apparently the engine caught fire and she was
able to get a lot of stuff out of the bus before it all burned up.  I guess
investing in a fire extinguisher would have been a good idea, but she didn't
have one with her.

There is nothing left of the bus.  It burned everything, including her new
CD player, 4 days old, and 1 day old set of NEW tires.  Everyone is unhurt.
Chris burned her hand on the cooler handle that got hot before she got it
out of the bus.  Bystanders told her to get away from it before it exploded.

She is wanting another bus, but I think she really wants a split bus this
time.  In the mean time, I am taking her to Muskogee tomorrow where a friend
has a Chevy something or other for her to drive for now.  It was only 500
bucks.  She is still understandably very upset from the whole ordeal.
Please thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers.  Wow, a raffle.  Very
cool.  I will keep that to myself for now.  Surprises are much more fun.
I'll let you know if anything else happens.

Pete
