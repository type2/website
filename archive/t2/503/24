Subject: Removing the rear axle nut

Hello List,
 
Can you use the  "Slammer Tool For Removing 46mm Axle Nut"  from the Bus-Boys http://www.bus-boys.com/tools.htm to torque down the nut?  I think Busdepot sells the same thing.  Will it fit onto a breaker bar?  I cant seem to find a 46mm socket anywhere.
 
Thanks for the help.
 
Asaph
