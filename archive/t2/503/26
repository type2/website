Since the tools required to torque it down are so expensive the simplest way
is to use your body weight and stand on the lever at the right point.

The best tool for the job was introduced to me by George Lyle. It's a 18"
3/4" drive sliding t-handle from Sears. Use it with a 46mm socket and a long
extension handle (such as one used with floor jacks).

Goto craftsman.com and enter 4443 into their search field.

It fits a 1/2" breaker bar. Many folks with attest that they've broken 12"
drive tools getting the axle nut off. This tool isn't good for using a
breaker bar with. It's design to be whacked with a hammer.

My local flaps had one from EMPI. Online, try CIP1 by entering ACC-C10-7190
into their search field. I paid about $8 for mine but I see the price varies
a lot.
