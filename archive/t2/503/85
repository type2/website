The point that owning a bus is a luxury?

I own a bus because someone was kind enough to give me the bus as a gift.
(It wasn't their fault that the rear seal went and screwed everything else
up 7 months later, BTW.)  It's my only vehicle because I can't afford
anything else.  (And with the engine replacement, I can't afford _anything_
else!)

It's taken years to recover from my wife's illness, over a decade.  While I
admit that having the finances to choose "a safe reliable vehicle" is a nice
thought, it's not always a possibility for everyone.

So before you condemn me to the 9th plane, understand the true nature of my
point (and wallet)!
