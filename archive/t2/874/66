Sounds like most of your bad running was timing-yes a good timing light 
is needed to check total advance as in if your dist. is sticking in its 
weights. Max advance in a stock dist. (at least in my 78) should be 
around  42 if it is working right.

my 2 cents-zero valve lash is not good for hydraulics as in my 
experience one can get looser clearance from wear in the mechanicals 
between valve and rocker adjustor, such as the adjustor head. I think 
Boston Bob uses it to break in a new engine to insure good pumping up. 
The piston  in a hydraulic lifter has a range of about 2mm and is 
unhappy if it can slap at either end, especially the upper spring clip. 
  Ideal adjustment is in the center of its travel range.  Thus the full 
2 turns originally called for.  Many use one turn on the presumption it 
will take longer before one interferes with valve closure.  A hydraulic 
works on oil pressure, and full valve closure would be a problem only if 
the piston is forced to bottom out as when a seat sinks or a valve 
stretches.  I believe most hydraulic lifter problems lead to valves not 
opening enough than the other way around.
