Do you have a plan on irradicating daisies? When I
first got Bussy he was all fancily striped but they
were faded badly. I used MEK and scotch pads and did
virtually no damage to the original factory paint
underneath. I think if I had used less aggressive
scotchpads there would have been no scratching at all
- that stuff is tough. MEK is pretty bad stuff though.
It looks like the daisies are rattle-can at best and
should not require anything that harsh. My point is
that the original paint is hard to damage. -BaH
