The last part is getting truncated by your email program.  I'm  using Yahoo and it does me the same way.   Put the cursor  inside the link then click 'Copy Link Location'.  Then open a new  window and paste that in the URL bar.  DON'T hit return.   Then go back to the email and copy the bit on the next line that got  truncated.  It won't be underlined (probably).  Go back to  your new window and move the cursor to the end of the URL line.   Then paste and return.   Works fine for me.  Cheers....KR
