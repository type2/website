Can't say I've seen anything like that on a bus before.
It looks like a type 3 fuel cap to me ('69-'73), but I'd have to see the other size to 
be sure.
Oil filler looks similar but has dipstick attached. Beetle ones also look similar but 
thread in, not bayonet style like type 3.
Never tried if type 3 cap fits kombi fill hole though, so it could fit.

Does anyone out there have a clue as to what 'late bay bus' this 'old original' oil 
cap came one?!?
