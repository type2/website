Subject: carb conversion

i would like to get the user opinions on converting from fuel
injection to progressive carbs.  i have a 1978 transporter, 2000cc.
i am interested in finding out if there are any advantages to fuel
injection over carbs.   this is my very first bus and to be honest
the fuel injection system is really intimidating.  as with carbs i
have a grasp on the ins and outs. what should i do?
