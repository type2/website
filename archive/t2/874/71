agreed, when I got my 78 the FI system was a mystery, but it is not hard,
just different and once learned you'll wonder what is so hard about it,
once adjusted it rarely needs touching and the 2L engine was designed from
the beginning as a FI engine you will pull your hair out getting twin
carbs working right and they will never be as good as the FI it came with.

my feeling, if it came with carbs keep carbs, if it came with FI then keep
the FI
