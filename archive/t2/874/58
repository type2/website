Subject: Re: [T2] rear seat belt bolt size

Billy,
I just had the same problem.  I am planning to put vanagon retractable 3 
point belts in my '60 DD.  I stopped by Lowes to pick up some nuts and 
washers for Kelly the Metwiz to weld in the pillars.  I could not figure 
out the right nut.  Finally tried 7'16 and it worked.  It's the most 
peculiar thing since the head of the bolt has a metric 8.8 on it.
