Ron, I know I responded to this once, but I think it
never got sent. If it did, disregard this. Because the
alternator is tucked in under the exhause manifold and
it's so hot in there, I suspect that without the air
ducting that the stock alternator has the golf
alternator would die quickly. The rear bearing on the
bus alternator is even a looser fit than an "ordinary"
bearing of that size.

A few years back I bought a 2L engine that had AC. The
compressor was driven by a pulley ahead of the fan.
The unit sat below and to the left, in the oil filter
/ oil cooler area. There may be room down there if you
can get a straight shot from the main pulley - I no
longer have any VW engines to refer to, but you may
try thinking about it in that respect.

You'd be pulling a lot more power off the end of the
crankshaft least supported and least able to handle
it.
You'll be sure to let us all know how you do it(!)
