Subject: Re: [T2] Engine tins for a PO's engine swap

To be honest, I don't have it in my possession yet, so I can't check. I
won't pick it up until tomorrow. Judging from the fit of the parts, it
wouldn't surprise me that it is missing. If so, I will add it to my parts
list. I guess the first thing I will need to do is pull the engine and fix
all the little stuff that may cause problems later on. Thanks to all on the
list for all the heads ups on stuff that I am not experienced enough to
notice.
