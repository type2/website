Thanks all for pointing me to the dealer directory!
What was wrong with my query is that when I went to
their website, I selected what I thought was the
appropriate fork in the road, "SUV - Light Truck" This
evening I selected "Vans" and there were the loadrange
C / 8 ply 14" tires. Guess that was dumb on my part!

Now, would someone with experience on Nokians and
maybe Coopers and / or BF Goodrich / Costco Kirkland
Brand give me a comparison of sidewall flex, please.
Thanks.
