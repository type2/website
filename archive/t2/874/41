I assume you set the timing properly at idle and replaced ignition wires, 
points (if non-Cal vehicle) etc.  So the most obvious "ignition" problem 
that might cause they symptoms you describe is improper advance.  Do you 
have the correct distributor in there, and is it advancing as it should?

The other thing that comes to mind is an over-rich fuel setup which is a 
consistent problem with the older AFM FI rigs.  The spring inside the AFM 
weakens over time leading to an over-rich mixture at all speeds and RPMs. 
This, too, will frequently result in the hesitation you describe.

Hydraulic tappets don't need breaking in.  Don't know what lash caps are, 
though they sound like something that goes over the stem of the valve and 
that the valve adjusting screws contact.  If that's correct, I might take a 
SWAG and only adjust the screws one turn in from contact instead of the 
more-commonly recommended 2 turns, but unless you've got the screws way too 
tight the valves should be working OK; compression check would help here.
