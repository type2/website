Subject: Re: Zero ohm distributor rotors

My point was (and I did have one) that the aftermarket rotors (other
than Bosch) are likely zero ohm, and therefore no effort, and only $5-7,
are involved to get one.

You can, of course, go the dremel route and INSTALL a resistor in one of
those to get it to spec ;-)
