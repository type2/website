Hi Richard,

Learn FI. All you need is a vacuum gauge, a fuel pressure gauge and  
the usual tune-up tools.

FI's advantages include a smoother powerband, better cold starts,  
better fuel economy and less pollution. The factory FI guides are  
available in the type2.com library and make the diagnostics very  
straightforward.

It is possible for carbs be tuned to better than FI in ONE of the  
above attributes, but they will not be better in ALL of the above.

Happy trails,
