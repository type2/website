Subject: Dipstick Test, Fanshroud, and Engine Temps

Crawled all over the archives looking for the definitive procedure for
performing the "dipstick test" to try and get a "feel" for if and how hot my
bus is running.

I drove it into work today (about 31 miles mostly highway 60-70mph)  Went
back and did some feeling around in back when I got to work.

The fan shroud was warm.  Not uncomfortably warm but pretty warm.  I would
say hot shower warm.

Grabbing the dipstick where it enters the block was about the same.  Pulling
the dipstick out and touching the "wet" end was too hot to hold onto.

Now a fellow airhead here at work says the fanshroud should be "cool" to the
touch (personally I don't see how it could be colder than the ambient air at
best but he seemed to think that it was supposed to be that way)

I am new to aircooled engines and given that my bus has "almost" left me
stranded a few times already I am a little nervous about it.  I hate that
feeling of "am I going to make it?"

Engine Specs.
its an 1800cc block but I think that it is ultimately a 1925 CC displacement
engine (POs doing mentioned something about putting 102 porsche pistons in
it??) with a 2ltr EFI setup.  It may run warm to begin with.
It has good power, starts quick, runs strong with a hiccup here and there
but not under power that I have noticed.  I haven't checked the plugs yet to
see if its running rich or lean because I wasn't sure that there was a
problem yet.
The EGR filter has holes in it.  The throttle switch is disconnected and I
haven't checked the timing yet.  I was going to mess with that when I
convert to pertronix.
