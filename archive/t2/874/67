Subject: Re: [T2] Engine tins for a PO's engine swap

Hi Ron,

While thinking about some other engine swaps I remembered something  
that hasn't been mentioned in regards to your engine... How is it  
held in place???

If it's only bolted to the transmission you are putting undue stress  
on the two bolts that hold the tranny subframe to the bus. There  
should be a "mustache bar" across the back of the engine bay  
supporting the engine from the frame of the bus.

Happy trails,
