Subject: No start after running

Hi List,



My bus is not being nice to me lately here is the situation. I parked my
bus last week on a trip from town and she sat and sat until yesterday
when I needed to drive back to town. I turned the key over but instead
of a nice fire-up, she cranked and cranked for about 10 seconds until
she started up. I got into town and did what I needed to do and when I
turned the key over it just cranked and cranked but no start. I walked
to a friends house and had dinner and watched the game, went back about
five hours later and after cranking for ten seconds or so she started
again.



Diagnosis for a 1600dp stock:



*	Checked timing statically because I can not get it to start to
use the strobe, approximately 7.5 ATDC
*	Pulled plugs and regapped them all to .028

	*	Plug #2 was fouled black but the others were just fine,
#2's gap was also .035

*	I can smell fuel and the filter fills up so I assume fuel is
getting to the carb
*	Put a new cap & rotor on



Tonight I plan to verify spark at each plug but besides that, I am at a
loss. The bus was fine a week ago and now it does not want to go for me.




Any ideas?


Thank you,
