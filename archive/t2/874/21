Also,  while you're fiddling with the tin, get rid of that fan shroud and
get the  proper one for the engine.  The aftermarket "36HP" round top
shrouds  lack the proper air vanes and can make the engine run  hot.




Hey Ron  George left off also getting rid of the cheap degree pulley  and the 
generator crap. . he is right about that aftermarket fan housing besides  it 
not having any therosat flaps or heat outlets. I have seen hundreds of those  
cheap degree pulleys crack and I am not putting them on any more of my  
engines  later  mark Dearing
