Okay, the big multi-connector plug is connected to the
top front side of the airflow meter...
No black smoke was mentioned and no kicking back /
backfiring was mentioned. You have all your clamps off
your fuel lines and a new fuel filter. Your initial
timing is at 7.5 BTDC. The air filter passageway is
open - no rags left behind in there. I know your EGR
port on the plenum is blocked off well cuz you
wouldn't get this far.

Are the lifters making a lot of noise? If not, is
there sort of a muffled water-pumping "gush-gush-gush"
noise coming from the engine (very subtle)? I can't
describe that sound much better than that, but if the
lifters are tight and valves aren't closing, that
could be it. On the other hand, if the lifters have
not yet pumped up, there will be a definite lack of
power. 

I am not familiar with the caps you speak of. My
procedure was to set each valve as per proper rotation
(both valves fully open): Set for slack, tighten to no
slack, tighten another turn (some say 2 turns.) My
machinist told me to make sure everything is together
right then block the throttle to 2000 rpm and run it
for thirty minutes no load. It scared the crap outa me
the first time, but it took care of the lifters - they
all pumped up and settled right in. (New lifters)

I used to disassemble the lifters and pump them up in
a pan of oil, but his system has worked for me several
times now.

Hope this helps. -BaH
