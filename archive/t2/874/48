Subject: type 4 2L oil pressure relief

Hi All,
Just doing a service on the kombi ('77 2L dual carb) and decided to look into a low 
oil pressure problem. Just some history, this motor had a full (stock) re-build ~30k 
miles ago, and got all new bearings, cam followers, oil pump etc.
The oil pressure has been low since the re-build, but I never worried too much 
about it as it's been running fine. As with all these problems they never get better, 
and now the oil light will flicker on at idle (700rpm) once the oil temp reaches 210F. 
I run a multi weight 15W50 oil, the same I've always used, and in all my VW's.

I pulled the oil pressure relief out to see if that could be the sorce of the problem, 
but I found there's two oil galleries running past the piston. See the pic:

This is what I assume is going on, can anyone confirm this, or let me know what's 
really going on?
Assuming this is correct, the piston is a nice fit in the bore (can can't feel any slop 
in the bore), so I assume not much oil can leak back to the sump, but there is not 
a nice seal at the top of the piston. I assume this will only allow oil to bypass the 
filter, so will have no affect on oil flow to the bearings. The piston and spring were 
new at re-build time.
I am going to try a small spacer under the spring to see if that makes any 
difference. If not, any suggestions on what to loof for next??
Cheers,
Richard
