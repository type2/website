Subject: Wiring Harness

I have a 76 Trans and I can't find the short to circuit 12.  In reading
the wiring diagrams (and I might add that the VW wiring diagrams are
some of the most confusing to me...my 48, 50, 57, etc... Chevys were
never that confusing) it appears that circuit 12 runs just about
everything including the alternator.  I keep blowing fuses but can find
the problem.  I am considering purchasing an all new wiring harness but
would like to hear some feedback on the list first.

Suggestions?

If I do get a new wiring harness, what kind and where do you all
suggest.

BTW, my 76' has had the fuel injection already robbed and a dual weber
put on so I would think the wiring should be straight forward.

Thanks ahead of time.
