Subject: Gas tank sizes

Can anyone tell me what the differences will be with a 1973 gas tank and a
later model gas tank? I have been collecting FI parts for over a year and I
will eventually need a gas tank. I am trying to put FI on a 73 motor, so I
will need the return port on the tank. Can I switch my tank with any other
years or will some years not fit my 73? I want to make sure that the stock
filler hoses all fit like they currently do. Would it be better to have my own
tank reconditioned and a port welded in?

Does anyone have experience with this?

Thanks,
Corbett
