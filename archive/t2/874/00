That's a great deal on that bus.  If it's rust free the body would be worth more than that.  Congrats...KR

Look at how straight and virtually rust free this bus is! And in what good
shape the interior is! I ended up paying $910 sight unseen through ebay for
it. It supposedly runs great, but I take that with a grain of salt. Anyway,
it appears to be a very good starting point for a bus.
