"The volumetric efficiency (VE) is a percentage that tells us the pressure inside the cylinder versus the pressure in the manifold." 

VE is not measured, Don, it is used a tuning parameter. A 12X12 table is constructed (Manifold Absolute Pressure vs. RPM) with the values being VE in %. From an initial stab at a table you tune it using the O2 sensor feedback at different values of MAP and RPM. The cool thing is this can be done in real time driving down the road! Of course, one person driving and the other with the laptop on his lap tuning. 

Here is the full megasquirt equation and explanation:
