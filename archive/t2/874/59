quoth busahaulic:
My
machinist told me to make sure everything is together
right then block the throttle to 2000 rpm and run it
for thirty minutes no load. It scared the crap outa me
the first time, but it took care of the lifters - they
all pumped up and settled right in. (New lifters)

That's what the 3/4" sliding handle with the 19mm six sided socket (for 
tire removal) is for- lays perfectly overt the gas pedal and lets you 
set it to any rpm.o it all ther time to warm up the never rebuilt engine 
until the temp reaches 195 and lifters niecely pump up.
