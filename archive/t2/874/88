Subject: Re: [T2] Gas tank sizes

Hi Corbett,

There are other options to swapping tanks. I have been running an  
FI'd 2L engine with a 1973 gas tank for two years now. I put a T in  
its single outlet and have had no issues with it. Fuel rail pressure  
is not any different than when the return line runs directly to a  
bucket on the ground.

A couple years ago Jamie Rivers fabricated a dual-outlet plug that  
fits into the original screw-on 68-74 outlet, that approach has  
worked well for him when he went FI with his 74 westy.


Happy trails,

Can anyone tell me what the differences will be with a 1973 gas tank

later model gas tank? I have been collecting FI parts for over a year  
and I
will eventually need a gas tank. I am trying to put FI on a 73 motor,  
so I
will need the return port on the tank. Can I switch my tank with any  
other
years or will some years not fit my 73? I want to make sure that the  
stock
filler hoses all fit like they currently do. Would it be better to  
have my own
tank reconditioned and a port welded in?

Does anyone have experience with this?
