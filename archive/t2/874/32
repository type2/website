I've heard of Nokians before - something equally
enthusiastic as your comments. I have been unable to
locate any in bus sizes. What are you running?

I currently run BF Goodrich LT195/75/R14's for summer,
swap out the backs for some Coopers in the winter.

I like the flex of both these tires as opposed to,
say, Michelins with zero sidewall flex.  How do the
Nokians compare in this respect? Are they a really
soft tread compound - making for the stickiness - and
if so, how's the wear?

More! More! Tell me more! -BaH
