From Dave C. Bolen:

Anyone ever realize that *tires* and tire rims are measured worldwide in inches???
 
 hmmmm....what was that all about?
 
 So, the rest of the world buys tires labeled in inches even though 
 they use metric for everything else....
 
 Not that I am complaining, but it is interesting.

And I am still looking for metric jack stands.......
