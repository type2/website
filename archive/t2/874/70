i would  like to get the user opinions on converting from fuel
injection to  progressive carbs.  i have a 1978 transporter, 2000cc.
i am interested  in finding out if there are any advantages to fuel
injection over  carbs.   this is my very first bus and to be honest
the fuel  injection system is really intimidating.  as with carbs i
have a grasp  on the ins and outs. what should i do?

this group if you start having problems an or how to maintain the FI.
