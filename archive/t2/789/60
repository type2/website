Subject: Re: [T2] heater box - good idea was used!

This gets my vote for the trick of the month.
One of those rare gems I wade through email for.
Simple and elegant. Very Kevorkian.

One of my heater boxes was rusted and I didn't want to buy another
nor try and fix it.  I don't drive the bus in the winter so I wasn't too
concerned
about the heat aspect. Actually I didn't have the blower hooked up at all
up until this point.

So rather than buying one I wanted a solid option.
I switched the headers coming out of the motor (left for right)
and that pointed the headers to the back of the bus.
Welded two tiny bottle mufflers on with a tail pipe
and there it is :)
I don't have to buy an expensive yet fast rusting muffler
again.
It's quiet (remarkably), alot lighter and against all expectations
I have a little more power off the go. And that makes a difference
in an automatic bus :)
