Hello Jamie  that is not a good sign that is the part of the case that breaks 
that holds the oil pick-up tube bolt . very weak point of the type 4 case  
overtighten of the screen bolt is the normal cause.  This is a reason I tell 
everybody not to remove that screen too often . Was the pick-up tube still in 
place?  usually causes the screen to leak oil and the bolt will also leak oil as 
it has a copper sealing washer under it. I have fixed these using a timesert 
before with very good luck. I am wondering if the oil pressure had dropped 
causing the lifters to go bad.  Be sure to check all the beraings while you are in 
there   later and have fun  Mark Dearing
