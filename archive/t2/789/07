Gerald,

You did read the CHT writeup I did on Richards site?  Especially the part 
about the gauge must be level?....and how far off it was and gets?  
Richard also explains about *why* it is off and offers alternatives.

Alternatives...

http://www.autospeed.com/shop/category_579/browse.html
see "High Range Adjustable Temperature Switch with LCD"
Notice that it reads up to 1200C

You might also pull the gauges you have and calibrate them in the oven and 
boiling water.

Remember that a mechanical oil pressure gauge will *not* work well over 
about 5 feet.

What is the fuel pressure gauge for?  If you just need a quick look while 
driving, just run a standard one inside via the access hatch and have 
someone drive while you watch.  Bentley specs the fuel pressure at vacuum 
on and vacuum off.


Cheers, dave
