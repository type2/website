hi all.

 i was at the Toccoa show, and this guy tells me he
just sent a 63 SUBHATCH WESTY TO THE CRUSHER!!! it was
a complete bus, and in restoreable condition. he told
me he did it because he isnt a bus person! he sent it
yesterday (saturday). its at a yard on route 17 i
think south of Toccoa. the town its near starts with
an M, but i cant remember the name. all i know is its
close to Toccoa, it might still be alive, and ITS A 63
WESTY!! he said the camper kit was 100% complete! he
said the yard he sent it to is right on 17, and you
cant miss it!!

SOMEONE DO YOUR BIT TO SAVE THAT SPLIT!!!!!
