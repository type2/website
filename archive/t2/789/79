Subject: Sage Green Curtains for Sale

Hello List,

Well I have a complete set of sage green westie
curtains for sale. This is the curtains only- no rods
or tie-backs. I would like to get $150.00 for the set
plus shipping. I give them a 9/10 on their condition
due to a little fading on one curtain. If anyone is
interested, Let me know. If I get no response, I will
post them on The samba.

Thanks!

Regards,
David kelly
