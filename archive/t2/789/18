Subject: Re: [T2] Finally available- locking gas caps for early bay 

I'm just glad somebody, anybody, is selling these. Yeah, the price is steep.
BTW, it's now costing me about $56 Canadian to fill my bus's tank, at $1.33 
a litre(3.8 litres= 1 US gallon). Gas took an unbelievable jump after New 
Orleans happened.

I spent over $100 on gas on the weekend going camping. How long till 
somebody decides siphoning gas is worth it at that price?
I also don't like the idea that anyone can get access to my gas tank, if 
they felt like dumping sugar or something like that in it.
With the impossibility of finding a locking cap till now, I had considered 
putting a cam lock on the gas door, but that wasn't my first choice.

> Chinese repops ... (-at-) $105


Incredible!  If they're coming from China I'd be shocked if they cost more
than $10 to make.  Sounds like someone's trying to recoup their entire
tooling cost on the first 10 units sold.

Good thing you found one a bit cheaper on Ebay. I'd imagine you'd have to
live or work in a pretty scary section of town for the risk factor to
justify paying $105 to lock your gas cap. (Then again, with the price of gas
these days...)
