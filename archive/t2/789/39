Along the same train of thought. Where is low oil pressure in the Type IV going to come from? Could the pickup suck air and cause low pressure? I know the bearings can be worn but how worn would leave an engine with a minimum of pressure. Jamie's engine sounds like the engine that was in my Westy. Otherwise fine it had low oil pressure at hot idle - enough to keep the light off but just barely.
