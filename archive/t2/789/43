Dave,

Thanks for the suggestion... I think those are better suited to cracking a
nut... my problem is that the nut is inside the H/E.

It has also been suggested by others to simply cut the bolt (Dremel cutoff
tool or such)... while this is a good idea, I'm concerned that there will
then be a rusty nut and part of a bolt rattling around in the H/E.

For now, it's loose and I had enough play to rotate the tin to get the new
thermostat in... which is working - yippy.  I've got the tin back in place
with one bolt a bit loose.  I might wrap some wire around it to snug it up a
bit.  Yes a Rub Goldberg... but for now it will work.

Again, thanks and do keep your ideas coming.

Wayne,

Could you use one of these on it?

/SubCatID/9975.0/file.htm

or, a dremel tool cutter to literally cut the nut off of the bolt without 
damaging the bolt?

Cheers, dave
