Subject: Re: [T2] Changing out the Wiper Motor in a '79 with AC

Pete,

I just had my windshield out this weekend, and I took out the metal top of the
dashboard too.
It's not really that hard to take the top of the dash out (screws up top, nuts
on studs beneath.

Once it's out, the wiper motor and assembly are right there, easy to work on.
Do you need a new windshield seal?  Now's the time.
