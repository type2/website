True, I like to use my mig welder gas. usually CO2 ..  some folks I know run a
exhaust hose from a running car to ensure the mixture in the tank isn't within
the explosive limits..

If you squint and hold you your teeth tight..and shoulders up,,,kinda cringe..
it won't hurt as much...  I watch lots of people that are risking their life
protect them selves this way !
