Subject: Compression check results.

I thought it might be good news, but with an engine
leaking this much oil there is not much good news. The
engine was cold.  1.7L

Cyl1-110
cyl2-120
cyl3-115
cyl4-0
Now my big oil leak was coming from around the exhasut
valve on cyl4. Or at least out of the exhaust port in
the head.  Could this result in 0 compression?
