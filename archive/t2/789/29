Pete,

I have a '77 camper with underdash air-conditioning. I picked up a
great suggestion from the list a year or so ago that really works.

You don't have to remove the windshield or blowers. The trick is to
remove the front parking lights. They are held in by two rivets, which can be 
easily drilled out, and replaced later with sheet metal screws. This gives you 
access to the underdash area. Working through these holes, you can remove the 
dash by locating and removing the six nuts that hold the front of the dash on. 
Then remove the screws on top, along the windshield. (I think that RAtwell has 
some pictures of this area with the top off.)

While not painless, it is easier than removing the airconditioner, which I have 
also done.
