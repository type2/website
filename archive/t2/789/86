Subject: Regulator or Alternator?

I fixed the wire on my alt (it was a tiny one that came out of the main
cable to the starter from the +B post). Put it all back together. Man, that
was WAY easier with the tin and exhaust off!

Battery was flat so I push started it. Fired right up no problem. Park it
again and hit it with my voltmeter. 11.27v. Steady. Even when I rev the
engine I get 11.25-11.31.

So which is causing the problem?
