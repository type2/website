In some ways the std engine already has this built in. Other than the
engine getting hot enough to really break down the oil, it seems to me
that the most common failure of engines in the overheated dept is in
the heads. Whether it's a dropped valve seat, broken valve, etc the
"weak point" if you will is in the head. The measuring stick is the
valve adjustments. This is a absolute number (roughly) that can be
measured and trends recorded. While not a reading that can be just
looked at while driving, it can be used over long term trends. My
experience with my valves are if they are moving, then something is
amiss, and the engine seems to run hotter. just food for thought I
guess. Sorry hydraulic lifter guys ;(
