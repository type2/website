Hi Josh,

Don't panic yet. It's quite possible that even if the PO didn't know  
it was worth saving, the wrecker will.

I narrowly missed a vanagon westy this summer that instead was given  
to a wrecker for $30. That wrecker wasted no time at all removing the  
vehicle from the downtown yard and stashing it in their long-term  
storage facility outside of town.

Sure sounds like a great opportunity for somebody...

Happy trails,
