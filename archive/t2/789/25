Subject: TV commercial w/splitties

Just saw a commercial on CNN Headline News from
Ameriprise Financial. Had an old, ratty, red split
window  bus with a bunch of 60's hippy guys trying to
push start it, then fades to today with a nicely
restored split window and a bunch of middle-aged men
playing like old hippies (hey, that's me!).

Just wondering if any listee rented their bus for this commercial?
