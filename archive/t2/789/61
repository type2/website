I'm not going to offer much help, but "0" on #4 is
hard to pass up. Do all the things you are supposed to
do before taking the head off to have it rebuilt, like
adjusting the valves and re-testing #4, squirting some
oil into #4 and re-testing, I don't think they will
help but you never know, anyway good luck with fixing
the head on #3&4 side. What area are you in I might be
able to help, I'm in Easley, SC. Phil
