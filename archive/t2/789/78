Duke,

Sounds more like the classic fuel stoppage symptoms to me.

Check fuel filter(and replace).

If you have a fuel pressure tester, hook it up for a ride around the block 
and have someone watch it from the back seat while you reproduce the 
problem....if the fuel pressure doesn't change, then something else is 
wrong.

More info or history of the problem?...how long, when did it start, what 
year bus?  Does it do it thru the rpm range or just at certain rpms?

Flywheel and clutch plate(if oily) will generally produce no jerks....just
engine rpm that doesn't match the speed you are going.

Got some wires that might be shorting out someplace?...like the 
wire from the distributor to the ECU, or the wire from your points
to the distributor?

Cheers, dave

 Started her up to do a lap around the neighborhood.  Came up to speed fine
 in first, shifted to second, and Whoa Nelly!  The lurching is back.
 Starting to think this falls under the "Slips and Jerks" category.
 
 Clutch plate?  Flywheel maybe?
