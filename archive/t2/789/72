Nick,

Yep, advanc in technology(if you want to call it that).  You can now buy 
split intake manifold boots for an upright engine.

Didn't see the whitney version...apologies if it is the same.



Saw them several months ago at the local vwflaps.

Your local home supply store also has an equivalent in the 
plumbing section....for repairing leaky pipes...not sure if the rubber 
supplied in those will handle gasoline , but think it was neoprene.



Cheers, dave
