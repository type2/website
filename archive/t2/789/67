Bus content. the '70 Westy sits butt high in the garage with the rear 
bearing housings off.  rear brake overhaul, shoes delaminating, springs 
missing, etc., etc. . .  Going to finally replace the "diagonal arm"/ 
"swing arm" bushings in an attempt to get my rear camber better.  Might 
as well reset the torsion bars while I'm in there.  replacing 1 side 
rear bearings.  ordered a bunch of parts from BusDepot, Bus-Boys, and 
the local VWFLAPS: springs, brake hoses, cyls, the bushings (1 pr in 
urethane--do the beetle IRS diagonal arm bushings fit? about to find 
out. . .) .  might have to work this weekend doing some stream 
sampling.  at any rate, when I get to that part--is there anyone in the 
Atlanta area who could help me bleed the brakes?  I don't seem to know 
anyone around here who is willing to come by and help.  glad I'm moving 
to Asheville next month where a lot of those nice FMBC folks live. 
although I will miss my garage this winter!
