Subject: Which starter to use in a 1977 Bus with a 1600cc engine

Hello Y'all, I have a 1977 bus with a 1600cc engine. Should I use a
SR15N starter to match the flywheel on the 1600cc, or a SR87X to match
the transmission? Anyone know what, if any, the physical differences
between these two starters are? Thanks again, Timo
