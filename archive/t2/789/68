Subject: brake/brake pedal solved.

Not totally sure what the problem was with the brake/pedal.  But the booster 
was not full of fluid, so we removed a master cylinder and booster from a 
donor bus and replaced it all and it now works.
Thanks for all the replies to the problem.  I've ordered a new master 
cylinder to go with the booster so there will be a spare, since I have 4 
buses.
Thanks again
Gail
