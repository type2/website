Take the reading from the left carb where the distributor picks up  
it's vacuum retard signal.

I'm not sure how the reading is going to differ at that location as  
I've never measured it there.

This depends on your distributor. If it's stock at you have vacuum  
retard hooked up you should see 9-10" of manifold vacuum at 5 ATDC  
and no ported vacuum signal. If you have the engine timed to 7.5 BTDC  
with another distributor you should see 15" of manifold vacuum or  
more. That would indicate an engine that is breathing correctly.
