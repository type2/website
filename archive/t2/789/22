Subject: MSD or equivalent cdi ignition sustem set up??????

Hi guys, I'm new to the list.   Subscribing to the  list was something 
that I wanted to do for a while, but to be honest with you what speeded 
up my decission was a desperate act.
 
I own a 1975 bus 1800cc FI equiped with a Petronix igniter
 
I fantasized for a long time with those Msd or equivalent type of 
ignition systems.
I researched a little bit about them end finally I bought a Mallory VIA 
at a decent price from an internet company. I also bought a coil and a 
tach adapter.
 
I know that for cdi systems I must use a non resistance rotor an 
special wounded wires to prevent interference.
 But my biggest DOUBT is regarding the tach adapter.
The one I got is a Mallory 29074 unit.  The problem is that when I 
opened the box the data sheet clearly stated that this unit can only work 
with points.
 Now:  What is the right set up for my vehicle since i wanted to keep 
the petronix igniter?????
I also got the wrong coil ( mallory 29216) which is for electronic 
ignition but not for cdi systems.
Can I use the MSD blaster 2 coil with a mallory hyfire?  should I 
install a ballast resistor?
 
If somebody can guide me through this subject it would be greatelly 
appreciated.
Thank you all in advance
