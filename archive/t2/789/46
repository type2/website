Subject: brake/brake pedal problem?

I'm having brake/pedal problems with my '72 bus.  I had really bad rear 
brakes and the brake pedal was not returning like normal.  It would slowly 
come back up.  So, last week, I ordered and replaced the rear brakes and 
also had the drums turned.  Well, the brake pedal still does not return like 
it should, and seems to be getting slower.  But, when the engine is turned 
off, it pops right back up to the normal position and when stepping on it 
with the engine off it feels ok and returns normally.  Any ideas would be 
appreciated.  I have checked the fluid level and it is fine no leaks.
Thanks in advance,
Gail
