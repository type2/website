That piece looks to be the part of the right half case stud that holds up
the oil sump.  You cannot overtighten the oil sump plate or that will occur.
I can pretty much guarantee you that your right case half will look like

I would imagine that that piece may have found itself in the wrong place
somewhere in the engine, but
you prolly won't know until you split the case.

Don't even ask how I learned about all this.<grin>
