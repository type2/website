Subject: Instruments for testing an engine in the shop?

I'm still not comfortable with how hot the Rivi "feels". I'm going today
to:

Hit a speed shop and buy:

A) Direct mount mech oil pressure guage 
B) Fuel pressure guage 
C) IR trigger thermometer

Short runs in town and sitting at idle seem OK. But I ran to get some food
the other night while I had a trailer full of dad's stuff hooked to the
truck and after the 10 miles each way with a short shutdown to go in and
get the food the engine "smelled" hot and the engine bay door felt hot
(but, the muffler IS right under it). I was too tired to trust trying the
touch test on the dipstick. After spending 6 hours loading furniture alone
I was literally about to fall over.

The CHT hit 400+ on that drive. BUT!!! I don't trust the CHT. It NEVER
goes under 150 and when I got back in the Rivi last night to run to a
(closer this time) burger joint the CHT was sitting at 350 when I got in.
It dropped to 150 when I tapped on it.

So, I'm going to get the instruments I need to get accurate MECHANICAL
readings rather than relying on the information transmitted to an
electrical guage through 15+ feet of wire.

Any other suggestions for shop meters for testing engine health?
