Subject: '72 Vacuum readings

This is a '72 dual PDSITs. It does not have the carburetor 'crossover pipe' 
that the '73 & '74 has, so I cannot take the manifold vacuum reading from 
the middle of the pipe that run between the carbs.

The left and right carb manifolds supply the brake booster with vacuum [so 
to speak]. At idle, what manifold vacuum should I be reading off the balance 
pipe at bus-boy's    item  F. 021-129-637D Elbow-Manifold Balance Pipe 
Bus/PU 1700 Right Side 1972 Only

in this diagram http://www.bus-boys.com/carb1.html

And a second question, again at idle, what vacuum readings should I expect 
to see at the left carb for advance [throttle vacuum] and retard [manifold 
vacuum].

Thanks
