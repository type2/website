If you've rebuilt other, bigger engines, I don't know
why you'd be worried 'bout a little old air-cooled
4-banger.

I rebuilt my 1600 beetle engine a few years ago and it
ran fine. Still is. Minimal "specialty" tools, just
nice metric sockets and a torque wrench. Biggest
problem I had was getting the motor back in the car!.
