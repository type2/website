Subject: engine failure

I have a couple questions,,
If a couple lifters collapsed.. what would the engine drive like?
74 Westfalia Camper with a 2 liter hyd engine

I was heading home this weekend from a terrific camping event at Warsaw Caves in
Ontario..  Da' Caves 2005  when I ran into catastrophic engine failure...

I wasn't far from home when it happened.. and for no apperant reason.... it
started to make a terrible racket...and  loose power , no smoke,, full oil
pressure, nothing out of the ordinary other than a very noisy engine...

Travelling at 100kmhr for about 2hrs,, fairly flat terrain,, very light
headwind.. CHT normal.. 400 degF  much less load in the camper than I usually
have... and booom!

It was as loud as all the hyd, lifters had collapsed.. or a valve head or seat
had dislodged.

The engine rev'ed up but didn't want to put out power....
I did a compression test..  145psi.....

I pulled the engine...
I pulled the heads off,, removed the valves,, and they are in perfect shape!
I pulled the hyd lifters and found 2 where not pumped up now.. 2 days later... I
dunno if that makes a difference..
No signs of damage on the lifters.. cam lobes,, or anything I could see into the
case.
I pulled the cylinders and noticed a nick in a piston skirt...
when I pulled the cylinders... I found a part floating around inside....

can you tell me where it comes from... and any ideas why it broke... etc....
here is a picture,,, http://www.globalserve.net/~jrivers/pictures/MVC-368F.JPG
I havn't split the block yet.. I do know where the piece belongs and will update
this with more pictures and info.. I just wanted to see if you can shed more
light on the topic...
