Subject: Jerome Jamboree

In 2 hours I will be on my way to Jerome, headed south on 89A through Oak
Creek Canyon. Intending to stay tonight in Cottonwood Az. Friday morning I'll
be going up the north side of Mingus Mountain. Is anyone else taking this
route? Maybe we could meet in the morning and go up the switchbacks together.

This is the first road trip with my 80 Vanagon so I'm being cautious, Safety
in numbers and all that.
