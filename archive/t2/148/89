Think Yamabond 4. Non drying, available at local Yamaha shops. Used to seal
japanese motorcycle cases and when was the last time you saw one of those
leak! fwiw the local Porsche guys used to buy it from us, I use it on my
cases and also on my pushrod tube openings. No oil leaks and no crush issues
