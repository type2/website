Subject: Re:  Broken grease fitting at center pen bushing 79 2.0

Went to lube the front beam and found the center pen fitting is broken off.
This is serious+ACE- don't want to make a mistake and have to pull the bushing
to replace it.  Any ideas on how to remove/replace a grease fitting that's
been broken.
