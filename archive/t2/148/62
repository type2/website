Subject: Too tall for your Westy??

Hello,

After about a year worth of camping in our new westy, one thing that didn't 
exist in the z-bed that does in the westy is the lack of room for my feet to 
really stretch out. Granted, I am 6 foot 2, but I would be willing to guess 
I am not the only tall guy with a westy out there that would love an extra 5 
inches of space either on the bottom bed or the top.

When sleeping up top im always afraid I will kick my feet through the 
canvas, or I end up pushing my pillow over the edge. If it were just me 
sleeping in there it would be fine, but with my more attractive half next to 
me I don't have the room I need.

Solution :

Supplies are simple. I went to home depot and grabbed some scrap wood over 
by where they do cuts and had em make me a piece 45 x 12 inches.
Cost : 21 cents
Next, I went to JoAnn fabric and got some foam, about an inch and a half 
thick at 45 X 24 (they wouldn't cut it down the middle for me)

hint : a automatic knife cuts perfectly through that foam. sadly, I don't 
have one at home and this is why my foam isn't quite perfect.

Fabric - you can cover it in whatever you want really. I found a yellow 
westy at the yard and pulled some of the original fabric off of it to use 
for my extension.

So I cut the foam to fit the wood, stapled it on the back and went to check 
out how it was going to work.

I can't wait for the next camping trip when I can really stretch out my legs 
and not worry about kicking the hatch door open or punching a hole through 
my canvas top.
