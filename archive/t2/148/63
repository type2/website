Subject: hiccup & stalling

I would guess a vacuum hose cracked or loose or off.
If you can get it started have someone feather
the gas to keep it running and listen at the
engine for a hiss.
  If it is a stuck flap on the air meter box
you can tap it with a screwdriver handle which may
unstick it. Had a Jetta that I had to do that to on
occasion <it's gone now>... :-)
If the flap is busted off in there.. ure hosed. Had
that happen on a fuel infected bug and it
sucked the flap right into the stack after a
backfire/hiccup (no damage done but was hard to find
the damn thing). 
  On my 74 dual carbed there is a metal crossover
pipe (vac line) which has rubber elbows at each end.
when they come off or crack it does pretty much what
you are describing.. donno if your 79 has that
"feature" or not. Pipe runs across the back along the
firewall
then down on both sides almost to the tin.. way in the
back.
---------------------------------------------------
My case of the hiccups has turned into something more
serious. The bus started this morning no problem.
I pulled it out into the street to take a look at it
and had it in reverse for a couple feet and then it
just died.I am having a lot of trouble starting the
bus now.When I can get it to start it doesn't idle
smoothly and wants to die out.
I had it running for a couple minutes but had to keep
giving it gas. But then it died.
