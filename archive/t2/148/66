Just put a spanner or deep socket on it, unscrew it and replace with a =
new one+ACEAIQAh-
If its broken off inside of the hex section then you need something to =
wedge in the central hole to unscrew it. A broken end may have enough =
roughness to put a centre punch on and then to hit the punch so as to =
create the rotary unscrewing motion.
If you need to do any drilling to create a nick onto which you can put =
the centre punch it would then be necessary to remove the steering idler =
pin in order to clean out the swarf, so avoid that if possible.

Went to lube the front beam and found the centre pen fitting is broken =

been broken.
