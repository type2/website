No one replied to this one but over the weekend I checked out the junkyard
and my own 78 and determined that there is indeed a unique pedal for 76-79.
The pin is longer, the both the hinge and pedal are different.

My pedal is all rusted out and I'm looking for a replacement.  The part
number I've seen is 211 721 507A but I can't see the number on my rusty
pedal.

BusDepot (beep beep) lists this part as being for 68-79 but at California
Imports I see:

ACCELERATOR PEDAL METAL BUS 68-75
Code: VWC-211-721-507-A

ACCELERATOR PEDAL METAL BUS 76-79 GENUINE VW
Code: C27-211-721-507-B

Who's got the right pedal for a 78?
