Subject: Carb question

I retract my previous question, there are two ports that are not on the
old carb.
One comes up out of the base at an angle, and the other comes out of the
back of the carb right next to the connection for the dizzy vac line.
Does anyone know what the purpose of these are, and if I need to plug
them or not?

Picture of the two ports:

Thanks,
