OK guys, saw this on E Bay.  I have seen quite a few westies in my day, b=
ut I have never seen 1 like this.  The conversion is strange, at least to=
 me.  Granted I have only been heavy into busses for the past 10 or 12 ye=
ars.  Is this an early deluxe?  I know later deluxes were different than =
the standard westies.  That whole side cabinet behind the driver, and the=
 small seat next to the z bed.  Never seen 1.  Anyone?
