Have a little faith in yourself.  Turns out that a wife makes a great
helper.  Dropping the engine is the easy part, just follow the
Bentley intructions.  Make sure you have whatever tools (and parts)
that are required to do your repair before you get started though. =20
For me, it seemed that installation was a little more time consuming,
but I was being careful to the point of my wife calling me anal.  If
it's been awhile since your engine has been removed, it's a great time
to clean/replace the engine bearer bracket bolts.  Oh, check that
fuel line too.

I'd suggest pulling the engine Friday evening, that way you have time
to scrounge parts on Saturday if you come up short or break something
during the removal/repair. =20

I'd love to help but it looks like I'll be replacing the timing belt
on my wife's Rav4 this weekend.  Trade ya...
