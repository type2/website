Bob,

Basically, it is just a big washer that goes on your flywheel
large bolt.

The outside diameter is a little smaller than the seal...but not much.

Start the seal, put the washer on your flyweel bolt and tighten it till it 
bottoms out...you'll know cause it will be hard to turn...not too much 
though!

You may be able to find a *large* fender washer  locally(Lowe's or 
other)...and you may need a 
couple of them or a spacer...haven't looked in a long time and am at work 
right now.

Look over your current stuff and take measurements.

Cheers, dave
