Hello All   Personally when I do a clutch job I'll only do it once which 
means using new F&S clutch kit , replacing the rear main seal, surfacing the 
flywheel ( I can't think of the number of times people will say it looks just 
fine HA! You can't just look it and tell. Also on the type 2-4 motors I 
replace the oil plugs .But to each his own, also don't forget the pilot 
bearing.  Later and have fun   Mark Dearing Salem Import Service  Salem Va
