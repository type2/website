Subject: Front Window Curtains

I just received a front window sun shield from "Heatshield".
It is an item I became aware of from another bus owner.
Made by a company called Canvas Works (1-800-777-6405).
Each shield is custom cut to fit the specified vehicle model - year - style.

WOW !
What a great product for keeping the sun off your dash, and out of your 
vehicle when it is parked in the hot Texas sun.

Just as great ............ This thing fits so well, supports itself with 
such a proper custom cut, that it will be more than the best thing I can 
think of to serve as an interior style front curtain while camping.

I understand it is available for side and rear windows as well.
I will call today.

$25.00 plus shipping, and I am very satisfied !
