Have you checked for a disconnected vacuum line?

My case of the hiccups has turned into something more serious.
The bus started this morning no problem.
I pulled it out into the street to take a look at it and had it in reverse
for a couple feet and then it just died.
I am having a lot of trouble starting the bus now.
When I can get it to start it doesn't idle smoothly and wants to die out.
I had it running for a couple minutes but had to keep giving it gas.
But then it died.
I think I am going to take it to a vw mechanic if I can get it to run long
enough.
Can anyone recommend a good vw mechanic in the south bay area (I live in
Palo Alto/Menlo Park area) who works on later models (I have a 79).
Thanks everyone,
Kyle
