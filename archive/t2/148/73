I believe what you are refering to as RoadCow's air conditioner is
really the radiator for the engine.

There happens to be an ongoing installation of AC in one of the popular
VW based magazines. They are actually doing comparisons between old
compressors vs new, figuring out set-ups and such. It would be
worthwhile to check it out. I believe the magazine name has "Trends" in
the title, but I'm not gonna name names or anything.

If I recall somewhat correctly, you are MUCH, as in A LOT better off
with a newer compressor unit. They use a fraction of the horsepower the
old ones use, so you can be cool, and drive up a hill...at the same
time!!! Also, make friends with an HVAC guy, chances are he can save you
alot of money on your hosing, and offer some tech tips.

Also, the "Road Cow" has a ceiling mounted AC unit where a roof rack
once lived. I believe the Road Cow has a few other mods though, and this
may affect the performance of the unit.


Good luck, and remember, you're already cooler than other drivers
because you're in a bus!
