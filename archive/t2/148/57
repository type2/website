    Hello all,
        So the engine needs to be dropped.  As most already know by now,
I am trying to round up just a couple of people to help me drop my
engine.  At this point, Mark Dearing said that he would be able to
assist me at his shop on the weekend of May 11/12.  I have opted to wait
for this because he has a shop.  A shop that has a pile of old parts.
This could come in handy as I don't know what other problems I will run
into while removing the engine.  A lift is also nice  :) .  Ian Janes as
offered to come at that time also to help out  (Thanks Ian).  So, as far
as I can tell there are enough people.  Looks like this will end up
being a "Fix the bus day" and a "Children get together day."  Not sure
though.  Doc Ric, here is your chance to go through a type IV drop.  As
stated before, I have the seals, but only one set.  Besides maybe having
a second set, are there any other parts that I need or that someone
thinks will be handy to have?  Today the engine has not leaked much.  I
am thinking that this is due to it not really getting that hot.  Only 5
minute ride to work on back road.  So, I am contemplating takeing my
time and still going to Circle yer Wagons to see if I can not come
across any deals.  Plus I would get to meet some of the people from the
list again.  Maybe that time I will remember everyones names and faces.
I would like to thanks all those that offered their advice and
services(Snoopy/Jason Laster/Mark Dearing/Ian/Ric/Chris
Mills/Andy/William Ray/Jim Polera/Rob Henley/the other Rob/Steve
Dolan/and everyone else). Also a thanks to the informative article by
Mike Benthin. I will be sure to take lots of pictures and notes.  To all
those going to Circle yer Wagons.....are we continuing the traditional
channel 2?
