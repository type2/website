Dave,
I'd considered doing a rebuild myself, with the Al 
case.  I've seen them as cheap as $285.  It's still on 
my list of "possibles".

How high on the 'Difficulty Scale' is replacing the 
case?  I understand the process of gutting my engine 
and placing said guts in new case, but how hard is it 
really?
