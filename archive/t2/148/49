Well, THAT was a learning experience!

OK, I didn't get a lot of photos--my mind was on other things, like 
keeping the bus going and monitoring the cat. Hopefully, this will help 
clear up the Art Lynch (TX) & Art Long (OK) confusion (ha-ha).

I got back yesterday and have been getting settled back in. Slogging 
through e-mail.

First, I must say a huuuuge THANK YOU to EVERYONE who assisted and 
supported me, Wendelin, and Luna the Wonder Cat (after the lunatic who 
"went retrograde" 75 miles and waited a whole day in Bakersfield, TX, to 
rescue her) on our sojourn east. Mere words cannot express, etc., etc. 
And particularly H. Steve "Don't Call Me 'Mr.'" Dolan for always being 
the hero of the day (and keeping the cat).

Wendelin is in good safe hands in Atlanta with Chris Huff's mechanics -- 
they will do us right, or they'll have to deal with HER! :-) Rrrrowr, 
rrrrowr! Pffft, pffft!

When Kelly gets Steve's bus done, Steve's going to fly to Atlanta, drive 
Wendelin to Kelly's, and take his bus home. Get crackin', Kelly! :-) 
We'll all meet again at High Country (and after seeing Ric's place, I 
can't wait). Snoopy, can you wait a couple of months for your heater 
boxes? They're in the front seat of my bus....

Nikki
