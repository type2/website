Mike,

I have the same filter and so far, the only place I have found them is on
the net at  "Donsco". They're a VW parts house in Cal. Good folks and a lot
of parts, decent prices. I typically buy from "list" vendors first but
sometimes you gotta go somewhere else. Do a web search and I'm sure you'll
find them.

Dave

replacement air filter for the Holley/weber progressive carb that is on my
2.0.  The filter unit sits right on top of the carb between two chrome
plates (one on top and one on the bottom).  It is about 5x8 inches rectangle
with a paper/metal mesh in a rubber housing.  I took the old filter to FLAPS
and they looked at me as if I was smoking something.  Maybe I was, but you
have to be able to get replacements somewhere.....
