I've found that it works great for normal caravan operations.  The makers
claim 2 miles, but I think that 1/2 mile is more realistic.  CB doesn't do
much better unless you have a real "trucker's special"

some manufacturers scrimp on battery capacity, using AAA batteries in
order to make their units smaller.  If you get a unit that uses AA
batteries you will have longer life.  My $10 Unidens get about 15 hours
out of a set of batteries.

The crap is the problem.  Truckers used to be pretty good resources, but
these days they don't do much for us.

Yes, particularly if you can find a 23-channel unit!

Usage is increasing.  It's just a matter of getting units in everyone's
hands, and at the current $10 prices this is getting pretty easy.
