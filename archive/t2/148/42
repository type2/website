Brian,

Starting at the spindles check the tie rods, specifically the ball joints
just yard back and forth up and down, also check the boots for cracking or
splits. These attach to the swing lever which itself seldom goes bad. But
the pivot it swings on does. This pin pivots on bushings and needs regular
replacing (to be defined) then the drag link attaches this to the pitman arm
and steering box. Steering boxes can be adjusted. You can work the play from
the center to the outside with a few turns on the screw. Also while your at
it check the condition of the steering coupler.

Tie rods, swing lever rebuild kit and steering couplers are inexpensive and
can be changed with a few tricks in avoiding cash spent on fancy tools.
Steering gear boxes are pricey when rebuilt but good used ones can be had.
Let me know what if any parts you need and I can give you a quote. We got
parts!

Hello everyone,

My '71 has very loose steering.  I have about 45 degrees of free play.

Will adjusting the steering box fix this or is this a sign that more serious
work on the steering box is needed?

Thanks,
Brian
