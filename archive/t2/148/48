Kyle,

Check the easy stuff first. Check that all your vacuum lines are plugged in.
Point gap is a huge culprit. Get yourself a set of feeler gauges and a flat
blade screw driver. Set the gap to .4-.5mm.  A timing light is a necc. bus
owner tool. Check your timing 5 degrees after TDC if Cali bus, if not Cali.
then 7.5 degrees before TDC. Another guy is the cylinder head temp sensor
front left on cylinder head. This doesn't sound like it but make sure its
not loose.

My case of the hiccups has turned into something more serious.
The bus started this morning no problem.
I pulled it out into the street to take a look at it and had it in reverse
for a couple feet and then it just died.
I am having a lot of trouble starting the bus now.
When I can get it to start it doesn't idle smoothly and wants to die out.
I had it running for a couple minutes but had to keep giving it gas.
But then it died.
I think I am going to take it to a vw mechanic if I can get it to run long
enough.
Can anyone recommend a good vw mechanic in the south bay area (I live in
Palo Alto/Menlo Park area) who works on later models (I have a 79).
Thanks everyone,
Kyle
