Subject: Re: [T2] Main Engine Seal

Some months back I had a devil of a time with main seal troubles. I had a
couple seals shred shortly after install and another just not function
well. I was using the typical silicone seal from a local vw flaps. I sort
of chalked it up to the horrific end play on the tired ancient cobbled
engine and sprung for a new longblock. Now I wonder if the seals were part
of the problem. was very frustrating.
