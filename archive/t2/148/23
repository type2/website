Bob,

That is generally what I use also...I did have a vwflaps ask me if I
wanted the "good" ones and then they handed me the red ones.


Maybe some other problem?  

This is on a fresh engine?  Sealing surface ok?
Seated all the way to the bottom of the case?

Do you have one of those "fancy" installation tools..they really do work 
better than the other way...ask me how I know!

Lubed before flywheel installed?

You probably did all of this, but I have to ask...

Cheers, dave
