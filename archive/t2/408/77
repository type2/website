Subject: It's running hot and I don't know why?

Yesterday, I finished putting the engine back in my 75 bus after fixing 
what I had hoped would lower the operating temp of my bus. I had a 
leaking cylinder to head seal on number 4. this engine only has 1347 
miles on it since rebuild. After repairing the compression leak it went 
from 60 psi on 4 to 125 psi like the other cylinders. After resetting 
the hydraulic valves, (engine is out of a 78), checking timing, point 
gap and dwell and compression test I went for a test drive. Runs so much 
smoother now. After about 7 miles at aprox. 55 mph the disappointment 
set in. the oil temp went past 180f. and the oil pressure began to 
slowly decrease from 40 psi (-at-) 180f to 30 psi (-at-) 190f  to about 20 psi (-at-) 
200f , just like before. Using Castrol 30 wt. and temp sensor in the 
sump plate below the dip stick, not the oil pickup.

In the last year I have replaced all vacuum hoses, repeatedly checked 
the timing, plugged vacuum lines and ports, checked spark plugs (usually 
slightly dark) checked fuel flow and more. Obviously I am missing 
something!

When I returned from the test drive, I pulled each vacuum line in turn 
and plugged the port. No change in rpm or vacuum gauge reading! I feel 
like I'm not seeing the forest for the trees so I took a break and 
decided to ask the list for some coaching before I explode. I can use 
any insight you may be willing to give.
Thanks for letting me ramble
Tom
