Pull a plug when it won't start and see if it's wet with gas.  That'll give
you a clue.

You can take the cold start valve out of the equation by pulling off its
electrical plug and trying to start the engine again, holding the throttle
wide open to give the engine plenty of air.

If you're smelling gas it probably *is* flooding, now you need to determine
why.  I don't see mention on new injectors so there's always a chance one or
more of them are stuck open, or leaking badly.
