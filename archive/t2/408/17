 I found 2 wires I didn't mark, they are the efi white wires, both come out of
 the harness about 15cm away from the computer , and they have markings #40 , and
 #12  on the wire?
 What are they for,, I can't find them in the bentley diagram

They just hang loose. They go nowhere. I remember vaguely that high altitude buses had a switch for altitude
compensation and those two wires went to it, but I have never seen one.....
