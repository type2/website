Subject: 73 AUTOMATIC TRANS

I am selling an automatic transmission that I used for about 8 months 
following the restoration of my 73 Bus. I recently acquired a 4spd and 
like the control better than the Auto.  I have everything that is 
needed to convert your 4 spd to an Aoutomatic. The 2 different length 
axles, cables, starter etc. This is the vacuum operated transmission 
that was used in the buses before they started using the ones from the 
Jetta's. Weighs quite a bit. probably would have to ship via truck, or 
pick up in Ledyard CT. midway between Boston and NYC.
I would like to get $100 plust any shipping cost.
