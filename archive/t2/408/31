Brian,
    I can recommend Bob Donalds of Boston Engine.  I know he does both
water cooled and aircooled engines and has a better than just good
reputation.  I bought a 1600 DP from him the end of last year and it's
running just fine.  Doing business with him was more like getting an
education and making a new friend than just a business transaction.
Before I decided to get my engine from him I called on the phone 2
different times to ask questions and never felt rushed or pressured.
Then when I went to his place to pick the engine up he spent a couple
of hours showing us his shop and explaining things to us.  Distance is
not a problem as he said that he can ship engines.
    Look through his web site at www.bostonengine.com  and then make
sure to call him.  The phone number is on the website.  I have no
interest in the business, but am one happy customer.
