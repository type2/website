Subject: Backfire and throttle switch

Hi good people, I'm a long time lurker, years. Without knowing it, many of you
have helped me with some of my mechanicing headaches, but I finally need to
post. My 76 westy has been sick for about a year. The problem is backfire at
initial take off. I've been through the archives on this one, little help
there. The ignition system is new with the dwell right on 50 deg. Timing is
right at 7.5 BTDC. When I step on the throttle, it catches (sticks, even
though I've cleaned it well) and seems to bog down until it backfires and then
runs fine at higher RPMs. I've tested for vaccum leaks with no success.
Compression and fuel pressures are fine.All the vaccum hoses are tight and the
throttle body is sealed well. There's a whistling sound out of the throttle
body, which goes away at full throttle.  I'm at a loss but for the throttle
switch. Build date is 01/76. I've tried Bus Depot, Bus Boys and Busted Bus for
a switch,  no luck.

Thanks!
George
