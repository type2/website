Does anyone know of a pic of this bus plate?  I am running a doghouse oil
cooler on my single cab and the fan is right at the back of the shroud.  I
don't understand how a dished backing plate or anything else on the back
would make the GR17X fit. Does it allow the gen to sit farther back some
how?   The GR17X is too "long".  The GR15X is what I took off and have found
a friend in town with one that will part with it  :)  I am just trying to
understand what y'all are talking about.

Thanks for the help..
