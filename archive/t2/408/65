Tim,
Forward Air will ship that trans anywhere in the continental US for
$48.00--

Just shipped an automatic transaxle to Ca. from IL.--$48.00--

And even though the name of the place is Forward Air--they ship by
truck--go figure

Hope this helps your sale--

Later,

Terry

I am selling an automatic transmission that I used for about 8 months
following the restoration of my 73 Bus. I recently acquired a 4spd and
like the control better than the Auto. I have everything that is needed
to convert your 4 spd to an Aoutomatic. The 2 different length axles,
cables, starter etc. This is the vacuum operated transmission that was
used in the buses before they started using the ones from the Jetta's.
Weighs quite a bit. probably would have to ship via truck, or pick up in
Ledyard CT. midway between Boston and NYC. I would like to get $100
plust any shipping cost.
