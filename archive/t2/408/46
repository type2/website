Subject: Re: [T2] Backfire and throttle switch

Did you test your vacuum levels with a gauge?  Also, have you checked
that your timing is advancing when the throttle is cracked open (tests
vacuum advance)?  Have you checked your total advance (tests centrifugal
advance)?  Do you have any air leaks in your exhaust system?

As far as the throttle switch, do you not have one, or you don't know if
it's working correctly?  You can easily test it with an ohm-meter. 
Also, since this is a pre-feb 76, I'm guessing that this has the switch
mounted underneath the throttle body?  I might have mine sitting around
collecting dust if yours really doesn't work.  Why do you think the
throttle switch is bad?  I believe there are testing procedures in the
bentley manual.

Also, have you checked that your EGR valve is working.  If I remember
correctly, this has the solenoid actuated egr, right?

lastly, have you played with the flapper spring in the AFM?
