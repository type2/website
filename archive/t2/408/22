Subject: [T2]VW (or equal) Parts List

I recently purchased a 1982 Vanagon Westfalia air cooled with a (supposedly)
2L engine. I suspect that I am the umphteenth owner since POs have had their
way with her :-( . I would like to restore her to her original glory, but in
spite of all of the publications I can find, there doesn't seem to be an
illustrated parts list with VW numbers for the engine and body. A dealer 70
miles round trip has been helpful, but I can't run there for every question
I have. Can the list recommend a publication or web site which can be of
help? I have the applicable Bentley.
Best regards, Harold
