Thanks very much for all you help!

I can say , every one of you hit on something that I had already double
checked and was SURE it was not.. but I came to the list to see if there
was a differing opinion that would set me in a different light!

I had confirmed everything 3 times before I got fed up,, cleaned up, had
some dinner, and asked the list.

As all of you confirmed that I was on the right track... I still had to
confirm 2 things,, that I had re-assembled the engine correctly,,and that
I had set the valves properly

I pulled Both heads, and the cylinders off,, without pulling the engine
again.... which BTW isn't that bad since I had all new fasteners

I found NOTHING wrong with the assembly of the engine,, so I put it back
together again.

Before, It would start, run fine for 5 seconds, then shut off. everytime
you hit the key.

Now It will start,, then stall,  start then stumble,, start then run.

I chased it for Vacuum leaks,, and found a couple small ones,, but still
the same thing!

Then,, I read the Library!
http://type2.com/library/library.htm#f
Tons of good stuff!

I got sidetracked on this article
http://type2.com/library/fuel.htm#8

But it *IS* still bothering me that I can't make that engine run PERFECTLY
Everything is fine....
I checked and rechecked the wiring, proved it with a voltmeter
, all the components, proved them as per Bentley..

THEN...... then,,, I decided to listen to a voice, someone I have heard
repeat on the Type2 list about setting the valves.

This engine came to me to repair a dropped valve seat,,
I took it apart,, took the head off,, time was spent sourcing a
replacement head,,  pulled the other head, CC'd and matched them, then
re-installed tehm on the engine  <very low miles on rebuild, other small
things were done but left out to keep this simple>

I am at the point that I KNOW it is the hydralic lifters at fault... or me
for not setting them correctly,, or me for not bleeding all the lifters,
and doing that right from the start!
I wasted a lot of time trying to do "just the heads"

I read http://www.bostonengine.com/articles/hydraulicll.htm

It describes my symptoms perfectly!
Quote"The symptoms
          of the lifter problems I am talking about in this article are
low idle when cold, hard or
          not starting hot, poor performance when the engine warms up and
the power
          (vacuum) assist brakes may not work as well at times because of
the low intake
          manifold vacuum. These symptoms can be caused by improper
hydraulic valve
          setup. "  unquote

Tomorrow I will pull the lifters and *hopefully* prove that is the problem.

Thanks again,, and if your still listening, stay tooooned!
