I assume you have the triangle style flange heater boxes common to US 75-78
busses?

There is a much simple design replacement muffler called an extractor. There
is less piping, it tucks neatly out of sight, it will clear a hitch you may
want to install later, it works with EGR and it has a single tip that exists
to the right side like the stock setup. If you have a CAT you're out of luck
but 5 out of 6 ain't bad.

Here are the part numbers:

- 352000 at Bus Depot
- S-42 at www.sandsheaders.com
- #60 at www.oldvolks.com in the exhaust section
- VWC-071-251-053-PS at www.cip1.com
- 210-25006 /BP at www.bus-boys.com

I've also seen a nice Italian made one from ANSA on eBay now and then. The
local vwflaps may have one also but don't pay too much for one. If it looks
really dusty then you know they've had it for a while and bargain with them.

There are US made and Mexican made models. The mexican ones aren't well
painted. If the price is irresistible then prep it for painting (remove all
old wash, wash outside with lightly soaps water and get fingerprints
nowhere!). Purchase a high tem paint like VHT then follow the Berg
instructions for curing it. You want to paint in light coats and not get it
too thick. I think 1 can will do. Black would look classic.

You need to cure it in the parking space not while driving as it will flake
off or get too hot and not bond properly.

BTW, don't worry about the smoke that will come out of the muffler after
installation. It's normal and will burn out quickly.
