Subject: 71 passenger bus in Calaveras County, CA

Came across this bus in Valley Springs and snapped some pics.  The
upholstery is pretty shot, but the body is very straight, just a few
minor dings, and the engine looks untampered with.  No oil on the ground
at all that I could see, but didn't look under far enuf to see
underneath.

She vibes nice!

Her name is Baby Blue, owner is Ron.  Says a VW mechanic in Modesto
rebuilt the engine 26k ago or so, new brakes 10k ago, new accelerator
cable, voltage regulator and battery recently.

Now you know all I do.
