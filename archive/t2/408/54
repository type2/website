Probably sometime along the line the 38A stock generator was swapped for a
30A bug generator.  The round tin to which the generator attaches is
subtly different, slightly dished for the 38A generator, slightly bulged
for the 30A generator.  The fan hub is also different.

You have three ways you can go:

1. swap the rebuilt generator for a bug generator
2. Get the proper tin pieces and fan hub for the bus generator.
3. swap the rebuilt generator for an alternator, get the alternator
pedistal, and install that. using your existing tin.
