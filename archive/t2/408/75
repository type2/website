Subject: Re:liquid repair for loose ball joints?

While on the subject fo liquid thread replacement, does anyone know if
they still sell that worn ball joint tightener that was squirted into
the gap between ball and socket and set to a self lubricating layer that
reduced play to zero?  Back in the 70's it was called Liqui-Seal or
such?
