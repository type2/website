Hi Richard

Good eye,, I noticed that also,, 

I know the dist is not installed correctly,, but there is enough room to adjust
it to set the initial timing to 8 deg,,, and it is set to 7.5 deg presently

although there isn't any more turning space! ... it is almost right up against
the cold start injector.

Just for fun,, I turned the dist 90 deg ,, and changed the wires in the cap to
correspond,, and it runs just the same,,,  full throttle OK... idle is very
poor..... I am still thinking lifters are not set right

I might take the time to pull the dist drive and put it in correctly,, but that
isn't the problem.
The timing and dwell are ROCK solid

Thanks for your help!

Jamie Rivers
