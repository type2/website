Jamie,

Surely some of the other folks that have had this problem will chime up, 
but it sounds like the classic temperature sender loose/broken problem.

Seems like when I got mine running, I connected the temp sensor
again, but didn't get it stabbed together inside the plastic connector 
correctly.  It was there, but the two connectors were just rubbing 
together rather than *connected*.

Cheers, dave
