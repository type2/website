tom,

at what rpm did you you have 20psi? the oil temperature is nothing to worry
about at 200 degrees, but 20 psi is really low on a new engine if you are
one the highway, say at 3600 rpm. a new engine should hold 45 psi at any oil
temperature at highway speeds.

does this engine have a rebuilt bottom end? new oil pump? did you inspect
the condition of the oil pressure relief valve when you rebuilt the motor?

another reply talked about checking timing and thermostat flaps operation, i
heartily agree.
