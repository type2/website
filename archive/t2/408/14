Subject: Re: [T2] Generator for 71 Single Cab 1600

> I recently purchased a Bosch Remanufactured Generator GR17X for a 1600 and
 went to install in the 71 Single cab.  Come to find out it is the wrong one.
 It is just a touch longer.  Anyone know what it goes to?  Or even better a
 way to make it work  :)

Sounds like you have a bug mounting plate for the bug 30A generator. The bus plate is dished for the longer
38A bus generator. It is the correct one for a 71....
