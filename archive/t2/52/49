The advantage to having the pump in the tank is that you eliminate vapor
lock.  The entire fuel system is under pressure, so gas bubbles cannot
form.

The pump-in-tank does have a filter.  It usually takes the form of a
screen around the inlet, much the same as our VWs.  Yes, you have to pull
the pump to clean the filter.

Plastic fuel tanks are nothing new.  Off-road racing motorcycles have been
using them since the '70s.  They don't crack or rust, and if protected
from the sun they seem to last forever.
