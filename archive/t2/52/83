Subject: Cleaning engine tin


---------<snip>
 I just sandblasted my tin and intake runners and I'd
like to clean the sand off before I paint them.  What
is the best product to use to clean it off?  
</snip>

 When I painted my tin I stuck them in a old gas
Bar-B-Q that I have and baked them on high for an hour
or so then wire wheeled the residue off, light
sanding. wiped them down with acetone ... painted them
with a rattle can... Krylon acrylic. 
  4 years ago... still look good.
