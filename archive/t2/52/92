Subject: heater box-exhaust header options

Hello,

      I have a 73 bus with a type 4 engine.  My heater boxes are totally 
shot.  They are completely bare of the surrounding heater box metal and 
function only as exhaust headers. My main heater tube has also rusted away 
and I have no flapper boxes, etc.  I heat with a BN4 gas heater which meets 
my needs for a spring and summer camper.  I had some concerns about this set 
up.  Would the exposed exhaust headers overheat the cylinder heads?  Is 
there some kind of header system available to replace the heater boxes with 
tube-like header pipes instead of the finned heater box headers? I seem to 
recall seeing something like this advertised in one of the VW magazines. 
Another option would be to fab and weld heater boxes around what I currently
have and I was wondering if anyone had ever tried this. New heater boxes are 
out of the question because of their expense.  My main concern is to have a 
functioning , cool running exhaust system. Any advice would be appreciated.
Thanks,  James.
