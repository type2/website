Subject: BUS FOR SALE!

Unfortunately, I must offer DILLIGAD for sale...

*snif*

The specs: 1974 Westfalia camper (white)
87k original miles.
This beauty was stored indoors for ten years...it's spent the last few years 
outside, but the cancer is just starting and still reversable - this is a 
good candidate for restoration.
No pop-top, but a solid roof with roof rack.
Engine is dead, due to my ineptitude at re-builds...BUT this offer includes 
three (3) engines, which I'm sure in the hands of a capable mechanic could be 
combined into one working engine.
BRAND new tires - less than 200 miles on them.
BRAND new clutch - less than 1000 miles on it.
Four extra wheels.

Also included: spare glass all around (from a parts bus I had) windshield, 
back window, side windows etc.

Pics will be posted soon - watch this space for details.

No reasonable offer will be refused...reply to snave515(-at-)aol.com

I really REALLY wish I didn't have to sell her, but circumstances require it. 
Please help me find her a good home.
