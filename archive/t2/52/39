Subject: Re: [T2] "Westphalia" stickers on eBay :-)

You know, I hate it that they spell Westfalia with an F.  I want to protest
to the German People, about this, and many other peculiarities of their
language.  It wasn't always this way, you know.  There was the Treaty of
Westphalia in 1648, spelled correctly, with a PH.  Where did things go
wrong?

Seriously, though, it does bug me and I can't explain why.  All I know is
that it ought to be ph and it isn't.  And don't tell me it's not a Greek
word, 'cause I don't care.

Regards,

Grant
