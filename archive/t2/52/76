Darin,

Those are not "push rod retaining wires", they are "pushrod *TUBE*
retaining wires"!

The wire should sit on the end of the pushrod tube and press the tube
toward the block, so it can't pop out.  Not that they ever do, even if the
wire is missing, but if they ever did... all the oil goes away fast!

No!!!  As I said, they sit on the end of the tube.  To install them, fit
them into the notches on the rocker supports and down into the tube.  Then
take a needle nose pliers and pull the center back until the wire drops
onto the end of the tube.  a dental mirror is very handy to check that
this has happened.  If this isn't clear, let me know and I will try to
explain further.  It's easy to demonstrate, but hard to explain.
