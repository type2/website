       I'm starting this reply for the 3rd time, as I find this rather hard 
to explain.  You want about a 5 inch piece of donor pillar.  The piece is 
then cut length wise on two sides.  You want to make the donor piece small 
enough to slide into the end of the windshield pillar where you plan on butt 
welding it.  Your sorta using the windshield pillar as a sleeve for the donor 
pillar to slide into.  This is know as sectioning.  Once the donor piece is 
welded back up and slides into the windshield pillar nicely.  You then want 
to put in a couple of screws to hold it in place while you slip the section 
in to the other half of windshield pillar.       Once everything is lined up 
and screwed down you can then start spot welding your pillars.  After the 
spot welds, you can then do the butt weld.  I hope this helps you out.
                                                                        
Peace,
