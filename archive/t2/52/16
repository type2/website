Subject: Happy Friday - Getaway Bus...


Apropos of Joe at Busted Bus' challenge to name the movie in which a character named Lewis drives a
baywindow getaway car -

I noticed ANOTHER (different movie) baywindow getaway car last night while watching the film "Bottle
Rocket"...Looked to be a a nice, clean 68 or 69... In the film, the bus is never actually used as a
getaway car since it's locked and nobody seems to have the keys...
