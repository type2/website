Hi Ron, Volks

I don't  think that "Mudpie" is too good at spelling.

A while back someone on the Bus_Life list saw that he had "Volkswagon"
stickers for sale. They sent him an email asking if he had any for a
Chrisler or Shevy. 

The graphic he is showing on the page you listed distinctly shows evidence
of photoshop tampering.

Happy trails,
