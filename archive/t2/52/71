Subject: Fw: [T2] 74 vs 78 campstool height-why different?


From Mike Benthin:

 Darn, I have the yellow can laying about, but lost the lid and handle....but
years ago I ground the top ribs off a 5 gallon spackle bucket on four sides and
it slides perfectly into the wooden seat/can holder!  That itself can be lined
with a 4 gallon "Purrrrfect" cat litter bucket available at PETSMART.
