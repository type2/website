James, good luck finding 76 to 79 collapsible bars. It took me almost 5 years to
find a set for my daughters 77.

68 to 73 bars are 56 1/4'' long.
74/75 bars are 57 1/4'' long.
76 to 79 half moons are 57 1/4'' wide. Yes, you can use 74/75 bars but 1) they
are just as tough to find and 2) you will nowhere to store them.....
