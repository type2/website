Oh absolutely --- did not think it was the just the name...

If it was there would be a huge demand for early 80's 4 cylinder Chryslers 
bearing the same name.

Nope, haven't noticed a demand yet... (Don't see them very often around 
here anymore too...)

Maybe a Shelby Westfalia?

Hmmm. Probably would spontaneously combust b/c as a concept they are so 
different. Internal conflict and stresses at an atomic level!
