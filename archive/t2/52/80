Mike,

I've done a fair bit of sand blasting on pieces of my bus, too.  I use =
acetone and a clean rag to clean up; wipe off what you can, rinse off =
corners you can't really get to with a rag.  I learned the hard way (on =
a rim) that anything with water in it will start turning rust-brown in =
literally minutes.  Fortunately where I live the humidity is usually =
very low, so long exposure to the air isn't bad; if you're in a humid =
area, my advice is clean it with acetone (I understand that's what body =
shops use to prep surfaces for painting), and put at least a primer coat =
on as soon as feasible.  I usually use compressed air to dry the acetone =
out of awkward corners. =20

Good luck!
