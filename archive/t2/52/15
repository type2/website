Subject: Re: [T2] Heating with water - seeking what-if-ideas

Hi Folks,

I figured I’d put in my 2 cents here as well.  I have a 79 Westy, and here’s 
my plan for increased heat in these cold Colorado mountain winters -- your 
mileage may vary:
1. Make sure the stock heating system is working well -- all hoses, 
connections, and heat exchangers are as they were when your Bus left the 
factory.
2. Make sure the poptop seal is working -- drafts at 60mph are pretty cold.
3. Put a large square of foam in the poptop opening -- 3/8” fiberglass does 
not insulate well enough against the cold.
4. Make sure your Bus is relatively airtight at all other sealing points.

If all of that is good and you still don’t have enough heat, try the 
following:
1. Run a duct from inside the Bus to the booster fan to get slightly warmer 
recirculated air.
2. Add an external oil cooler and plumb it to a spot under the rear Westy 
seat.  Put a duct in the same place as the BA6 does to draw air from the 
engine compartment.  Put a switched fan on the cooler to blow air across the 
cooler and heat into the passenger compartment.  Engineer a duct flap that 
allows a choice between air into the cabin or air to the outside.

Good luck, and stay warm!
