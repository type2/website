Subject: Love my busses and give them a new home!

1972 Westfalia (Sally) - 2nd owner.  150 compression all around on
rebuilt porsche 1700 engine, interior original and immaculate, gently
used and cared for.  Sink, icebox, pull out bed, upper cot AND child's
cot, full curtains in good shape.  New Weber 34 ICTs (dual carb) a few
years ago, new engine foam seal, slider door seal, freshly tuned 'cept
for carb balancing.  Smog exempt.  Sierra Yellow.  New poptop canvas and
front window trim/scrapers and other goodies available also.  Nose ding,
but rust-free CA bus!  I love her, but have upgraded to a '79 and no
more room in the driveway!  See a  pic of Sally at Burningman 2000:
