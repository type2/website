Daniel
what you've most likely have is a vacuum leak, in your case, as you say its
on the right under the generator, a likely suspect is the boot that connects
the dp manifold.
What your looking for is to spray contact cleaner and have the rpms drop.
You want to spray it at a likely joint. ie if you spray it where the
manifold connects to the head and the rpm drops, then your air leak is at
that joint. The repair is to take it apart and replace the offending
gasket.More to the point, clean the two mateing surfaces, check for trueness
of the parts, reassemble with new gaskets and sealer.In your case, if its
the intake manifold half, be prepared to drop the engine. I'm sure someone
has done it in situ, but with a 71, the aggrevation just aint worth it.
