The difference between a '70 and '71 Westy will be
night and day. My '71 Bus stops on a dime, even with a
full load of stuff. My buddy's '70 bus, even after a
complete brake job, still doesn't stop anywhere near
as well. 

The main difference is pedal pressure. In order to get
the '70 to stop anywhere near as well as the '71, you
have to stand on the brake pedal, as there's no
booster on a '70, either. 

Wheels on a '70 are different - wide 5 pattern. I'm
sure there are other small differences, but I'm not
entirely sure what they are off the top of my head.
