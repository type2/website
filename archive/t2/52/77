You almost answered this question yourself: "push rod retaining wire".... put
the word 'tube' between 'rod' and 'retaining'.
They hold the pushrod TUBES in place

If they are touching any pushrods....they are installed wrong.

NO! They hook on each end into the rocker arm support. Then each bend goes into
the head at the top of each tube.
Got a 68-79 Bentley? Go to section 5, page 32, fig. 10 - 4. Kinda sucks but that
is about all there is...... If you back up a page, you will see it in the
exploded pic as # 32. The bottom right pic shows the correct position of the
rocker arm supports. I have taken quite a few engines apart and they were upside
down. They really mangled the wire trying to get it to stay in.....
