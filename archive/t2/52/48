IMPHO, use nothing courser than 80 grit paper to strip anything------

Use 60 grit, and you had better buy stock in the primer company your
going to be using, as you will be doing allot of filling using that
60---big gouges in the metal.

80---prime
180---prime
320---paint

You can DA, or orbital sand the flat panels, until you get to the
320----then get a 12" or 14" paper file, or block, and sand the primer
down flat, and then paint.
