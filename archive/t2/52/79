Subject: bleh! gas

Well pulled the engine on the 66 tonight to repair the no start condition
and found what I thought I could catch a glimpse. Sure enough, bolted to the
tranny was a ford relay, that'll hit the trash tommorow and we'll use Toms
wireing diagram to set things right. 'Course the thing I hate worse about a
new to me bus is how some people leave such a short fuel line to the tank,
so theres no slack to reach up and clamp the line off. Sure enough, clamp
comes off so I'm back under there frantically trying to jam a pencil in a
line I can't see while takeing a gas shower. Man, What ever addatives are in
the gas now, have to be worse than the lead they took out. With in a minute
my arm was burning. Finished pulling the engine went in the house and SO
demanded jumpsuit head to the basement.
<sigh> if only people wouldnt be so cheap with the fuel line. OK, rant over.
