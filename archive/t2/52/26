Happy Friday Gang!
The date is set for the 2002, Second Annual Buses 'n Boats Bash just north of Cincinnati, Ohio.  The weekend will be May 17, 18, 19 at Morgans Fort Ancient Canoe Livery and Riverside Campground.  Event will feature an 8 mile canoe trip and Live Music in the campground.  Mark your calendars, Midwesterners, we had alot of fun last year.  Here's the event web page  http://www.geocities.com/buses_n_boats
You can P-mail for any information.  I am also looking for another 1 or 2 bands to play on Saturday afternoon.  If you have one that plays good, VW-Friendly music, drop me a line.



Peace, John Baker
