I found that the pump usually has two or three settings so you don't have to 
hold it. If I put it on the fastest one, gas will spew out sometime during 
the filling. So I set it to a slower pump rate and I never spill a drop. I 
usually use the slowest setting, it gives you more time to wash the windows 
and check the tires.
