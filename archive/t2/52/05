Subject: Stoppin Power?

Hello All,

Was wondering if someone could relate the differnce in stopping power
between a 70 and 71 Westy?  Is it a night and day difference?

The reason I am asking is that I have the opportunity to purchase a 70
Westy (which doesn't run of course ;) but am concerned that I am too
spoiled since driving my 71 with the discs up front...

Besides the discs and the dual ports are there any other real differences
in the two years?

As always thanks and have a great weekend!

- Brian
