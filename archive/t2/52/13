Subject: child's cot storage?

hello list.

this might be a stupid question but here goes...

where is the child's cot supposed to be stored for a '76 Westy?

i just installed the z-bed & icebox portion of that interior
into my '72. (still waiting to install sink & rear cabinets)

but for the life of me i can't figure out where the child's cot is
supposed to be stored for this setup!?!?!?!?!?!

TIA & happy friday.
