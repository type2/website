In all honesty, the people here in Denver drive quite fast.  We have 
been out here since March from California and let me tell you, 
California was nothing.  I have also never seen so many people run red 
lights.  I have seen everything from a beat up Celica to a school bus 
and FedEx truck run red lights out here with no regard.

Look out,
