The difference is the 73-74 model years.  During those years the center 
surface of the fan was machined flat so that the air pump drive assembly 
could be bolted on top of it.  This also required the use of regular 
(non-recessed-head) bolts of slightly longer length.

Now for the speculative part - I am pretty sure I've seen recessed 
allen-head bolts holding the fan on in 1972 model year busses.  Not sure 
about 75-later, but it wouldn't suprise me if a) the CV joint bolts were 
exactly the same spec, and b) VW decided to use those after 1974 to attach 
the fan to reduce the number of different fasteners required to build a bus.
