I agree with John in that the oil tends to drip onto the heat exchangers,
rather than oil actually leaking from the exchangers. That drip usually
provides us VW drivers with a characteristic odor of 'VW'! Check the push
rod tubes, and check the headcover gaskets for oozing leaks.
As far as the white smoke....I'm not exactly sure. I ran across white smoke
when I first got my Fastback. The first time I started it up after sitting
in PO's yard for 6 years, it blew tons of white smoke. I just figured that
the rings were frozen. Check your oil for metal flakes. I hope you don't
find any!
Good luck!
