Jamey,

Trust me, you *can* do it!  One of my methods was to take the connections 
off of the metal part of the heater tubes that go forward to the front of 
the bus and actually push my shopvac hose down them as far as I could.

Strange noises emanated from the shop vac and what I found when I opened 
it up and looked was big wads of mouse nests made from stuffing from the 
seats.

At that point I decided that a Major overhaul was in the works and pulled 
(very carefully) the big tube running to the front and actually got it 
where I could look down it...vacuumed it and blew compressed air in it 
untill it was clean.

Lots of stuff trapped at the front of that tube also...things dropped down 
the vents and such.

If you pull the plastic tubes that connect the heat exchangers to the 
metal "y" feed and can feel plenty of hot air coming out of them, then you 
have a delivery problem!

I have enough air flow to the defrost vents at idle to actually defrost 
the window.

Hope that helped!

Cheers, dave

 See, when I'm idling in the driveway before work, I can feel a slight push
 of air from the vent. At the top of the RPMs, I feel almost nothing, though
 the vents are eventually warm. My plan is to see if there is some blockage
 somewhere along the line with poking and prodding with the vacuum cleaner
