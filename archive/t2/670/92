Don,

The heat exchangers that were stock on your bus ('72-'74) were the best 
arrangement in any bus. So when you get that system restored you're 
going to have a fine set-up.

Basically, it's three pieces: exchangers bolt directly to the heads, 
and muffler to the exchangers. Buying all of this new is going to set 
you back about $600. Used, if you can find them, about $150.

There's no way around this except to invest in good socks and 
long-johns.

Mark
