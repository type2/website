I applaud your sensibilities in making it look stock. The Type 3 Karmann
Ghias came with fog lights and use a relay with a 211 part number that
ties into the headlight wiring under the hood. When I was researching this
hard to find relay (211 953 207 for the 12v version) I discovered that
Busses in Europe could get fog lights as an M code. In the T34 the fog
lights are wired so that they will work with no headlights or low beams
but not with high beams. I think it was probably done that way so as not
to overwork the circuit. The fog light switch for a T34 is a simple rocker
switch mounted under the dash near the column where it isn't seen but is
easily accessable. One time I wanted my fog lights to work but didn't have
a working relay so I plugged in a regular headlight switch in its place.
It worked but of course I had to go under the hood to turn them on and
off.

>     I have seen many Busses with what look like factory fog lamps. I know we discussed this before and it was mentioned that no Bus ever came with factory fog lamps. However, it was learned that it was a dealer installed option. I was wondering if anyone had a set of these fog lamps on their Bus? When I removed my front bumper to paint it white, I learned that it has two holes in the bottom of the bumper which was apparently supposed to be the mounting point for the push-bar that some Busses came with, or the fog lamps that were installed aftermarket by the dealer.

I have an otherwise perfect dash, but the previous owner drilled two holes in the dash next to the emergency light switch and figured I would go ahead and use them.
