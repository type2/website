Eric,

Do you already have an inverter?  If not, what sort of stuff are you hoping to
run?  A lot of people buy more expensive inverters than they need.  If you're
thinking of low-power stuff like shavers, NiMH battery chargers, laptop
computers, etc., one option is to buy a low-wattage inverter that plugs into a
cigarette lighter socket.  These inverters cost only $20-50 depending on
wattage.  If one wanted to, one could take one of these, cut the plug off,
mount it, and hard-wire it.  I sometimes run my computer and cell phone
charger off a portable 140-watt inverter that I bought new for $20.  I don't
have an aux battery, but my inverter has an audible low-power alarm and will
shut down to keep me from depleting my main battery.

I suppose my point is that you can make this project as cheap and simple, or
as complex and expensive, as you choose.  It all depends on how you desire the
result to look and operate.  My bias is always in favor of maximum simplicity,
but you may have a higher goal in mind!

Cheers,

- Miles
