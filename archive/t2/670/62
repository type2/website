Subject: Re:Anyone on the List towing in VA today?

That would have been me with a Blue ford tow ride & black trailer. Actually
the bus was mostly dirty white and was Steve Dolan's Hard Top Westy . I took
it to Mark Dearing at Salem imports. It shoulda been there months ago but I
dropped the ball on a lot of stuff this summer. I'm attempting to get all my
crap back in line and get back down to keeping up with the lists as well as
other things that have been neglected a bit. Later
