Subject: How many 34PICT-3 designs are there?

At least two! I have two BOCAR 34PICT-3's made in Mexico that are 
different in several ways(different styles of jets, different number of 
vacuum ports,...). Maybe one was a Calif version? What I am curious 
about here is that one has an adjustment for the automatic choke vacuum 
diaphragm while the other does not. Here are pictures of both types:

I've gone through the archives, library, and all of my other information 
sources and cannot find a procedure for adjusting the choke vacuum 
diaphragm. Does anyone know what the procedure is?

Sincere Thanks,
Bill Moon
