Subject: Factory / Dealer Fog Lamps

Hey guys,

    I have seen many Busses with what look like factory fog lamps. I know we discussed this before and it was mentioned that no Bus ever came with factory fog lamps. However, it was learned that it was a dealer installed option. I was wondering if anyone had a set of these fog lamps on their Bus? When I removed my front bumper to paint it white, I learned that it has two holes in the bottom of the bumper which was apparently supposed to be the mounting point for the push-bar that some Busses came with, or the fog lamps that were installed aftermarket by the dealer. 

I would like to install a set of these as well and would like to see any pictures of what these dealer installed fog lamps look like. I have an otherwise perfect dash, but the previous owner drilled two holes in the dash next to the emergency light switch and figured I would go ahead and use them.

Also, I like for stuff to LOOK stock, and I was wondering if anyone knows of a fog lamp switch that is similar in style to that of the factory knobs used in the mid 70s busses.


Thanks! (and sorry for all the questions)
