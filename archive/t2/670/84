It's not that difficult.  My stock, unmodified heat system blows air 
out the windshield defroster vents hot enough for me to have difficulty 
holding my hands over them, with a good rush of air coming out starting 
at about 2000 RPM.

The only thing I'm going to do to my heat system is de-stink it by 
replacing the paper tube with a nice, fresh aluminum duct wrapped in 
insulation and by cleaning the accordian tubes.

Hm... is this a symptom of missing the little mini-flaps at the bottom 
of the fan shroud?
