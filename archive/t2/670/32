Subject: snubber bushing

Karl Said:
That bushing is just the travel stop. In real life, 
about the only time the arm hits it 
is when you jack up the bus. Like it is when the pic 
was taken.
 
I ask:
What if the arm is hitting it when the bus is parked?  It's like my bus is being jacked up- but, there is NO jack under it!  With 2 guys in the front bouncing up and down, the arms do pivot though at rest it still sits up into the bushing..what is this??  It seems the torsion bar is somehow pushing everything upward.  Help!
