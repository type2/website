while it may be a blown fuse.. it also could be the relay gave it up.
The relay and the in line fuse are close together... You can pull
the blower motor and bench test it to make sure it is still good.
The relay should "click" when the lever is put in the heat position.
Unfortunatly the fan ckt only works with the engine running so you my
have problems hearing it.. hold it tween your fingers and see if you
feel
it operate.. or check it with a meter if you have one.
