Subject: Re: Re: [T2] Should I use this new harness???

Wow, yeah... mine looks like that too. Only difference is everything has a layer of white and blue paint on it. The PO stripped the car, but didn't mask anything off.. heh.. so the entire interior (which is basically non existant) consists of massive blue and white overspray, so all the wires look exactly the same.

I know that... for the Bus it's probably a BETTER idea to repair it if I can.. but I think in my case (and probably yours too) it's just too far gone.

I'm just glad that I already have the kit because I want to get this thing running again, and soon.
What's really nice is that the kit basically has the hookups for everything.....

It has a hookup for the tachometer on the distributor, it even has wiring for an electric fuel pump (which I am using, a BugPac Purolator 4-psi fuel pump). 

It literally has everything. The good thing is that my voltage regulator to alternator wiring seems to be "ok..." it's a bit worn out, but seems to be complete. 

The only two things that I can conceive of right now that are an issue is:

1 - Where to mount it, and how???
2 - Extending the harness to the engine compartment.

#2 is going to be the biggest issue from what I can tell because I'll have to cut into the wiring of the harness that I already have. What I think I'm going to do is cut the harness, and make a center wiring harness section. In order to prevent the wiring from chafing or anything, I think what I'll do is actually use wire connectors to connect the individual pieces.

I'm going to do a real good job with this and take my time... this kit was expensive (I think I paid like $250 bucks for it) and I don't want to ruin it.

If my Bus was numbers matching and relatively complete, I would definitely repair the old harness, but since I got it basically as a stripped (but painted)  hull, I don't have a problem with using aftermarket stuff.


I'll let you know... I plan to take pictures of it as well....
