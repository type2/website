Arrggghhh!!!! 

Mine's hosed too, and I never thought I'd care because I'm in Southern
California. But I'm moving to Denver around the 1st of Feb!
NOOOOoooooooooo..........

I took a look around to see what I needed. Obviously heat exchangers
since I'm running Type 4 car HEs that don't line up with the
connectors and ports. And the hoses from the blower are missing too.

But on top of that, the flaps are rusted to powder and the cables are
all broken. It's going to be a nightmare trying to get it going.
Sigh...
