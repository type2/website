Subject: Westy Z-bed extension

72 Westy.
Say I was to remove the pass. side closet and "extend" the Z-bed all the way to the edge of the pass side interior, as it is on later years.  Would the pass. side Z-bed bracket for those later years work for this on the pass. side of the 72?
I have seen others out there do it and just wondered if there's anything else I need to know/do/modify.   ideas?
