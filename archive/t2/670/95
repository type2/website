Subject: Wanted: Air Cooled engine helper in Bay Area...

So I pulled a "leaking oil" air cooled engine out of an 81 "Type 4" engine
Westy. (see my earlier post and photo).

I don't have a lot of money to professionally rebuild the engine, but would
like to tear it apart and stop the leak(s). Perhaps I'll have the heads
redone if necessary. The engine appears to have been rebuilt at least once
before and one side has bad compression.

I'm looking for an experienced air cooled person, someone who is willing to
spend a couple of evenings or a weekend day sharing their knowledge to help
get the engine apart then back together ready to go back into the van. I
can pay a nominal amount, ($20/hour or so + beer). Alternatively I can
offer to trade my time for yours and help you with another project. I also
have a lot of water cooled parts and even Subaru parts that could be
traded. I have access to a workshop in Richmond (East Bay) and have lots
of basic tools (at least enough to get the engine out of the van and onto a
bench).

If you can help, or know anyone who can, please pmail me. Hopefully we can
work something out.

Paul
