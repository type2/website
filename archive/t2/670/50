Subject: Re: AC Outlet/Aux Battery

If I understand what you are asking... you will need a invertor
to get ac out of your battery.. you will have to have a relay in the
ckt that switchs the invertor output out of the ckt when you plug in to
shore power....
  Is that what you were thinking?

Quick question for y'all,
I'd like to run  my AC outlet off of my Aux battery (77 Westy) while 
camping
without access to shore power. What do I need to accomplish this?
Thanks as always,
Eric
