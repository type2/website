Many sure do.

My friend with the 72 bus had the fuel lines replaced even before I knew
he'd purchased the bus. A couple of days later when he brought it to work it
was leaking fuel right from the starter area all over the parking lot. This
was the same shop that had serviced the bus for the last 15 years!

When I was living in Canada the local VW shops we awesome. I never had to
return to have them take care of an oversight. All the ones here in VW land
seem sloppy.
