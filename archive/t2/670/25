The sticker looks like SR15N, which should (theoretically) be "correct" for your 
Bus.  I don't think the problem you had was "wrong starter", I think it was just 
"bad starter".  The fact that it went bad and looks as new as it does may say
something about the quality, but since I don't have any experinece with the 15N
I can't really comment.

.. I thought *I* had a wiring disaster hiding under the dash.  Good greif...
