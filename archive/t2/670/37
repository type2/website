Subject: Fwd from Vanagon List: 4 stock alloy rims for Vanagon

Hi Volks,

These are NOT MINE. But since they fit our buses, I thought I'd pass 
the info along.

Happy trails,

I'm in PA and will be upgrading to 15" steel rims, does anyone need a
set of Vanagon alloys? $300 rims only, or $500 with like new tires 
mounted.
