Unfortunately, I know. 

Here's what my exhaust looked like when I started:

You can't really see it in that pic, but the left HE risers had been
cracked and welded a couple of times, plus at the muffler flange, the
right one had been cut into:

Money always being an issue, I got the cheapest replacements I could
find. They turned out being the ones for the Type 4 car. Narrower and
the blower connectors were in a different place. I didn't care because
it doesn't often get cold enough to worry about it here.

I have a muffler on my bus that will match the correct HE's, so that's
not an issue. But the HEs are. (sniff)
