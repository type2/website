When I removed the parking brake cable from the passenger side several years ago, I bent the heck
out of most of it.  I straightened it out with a pair of vice grips, but it always scraped on the
drum after that.  I figured since I was taking everything apart, this would be a good time to
replace this one (and hopefully just clean the other one).

Thanks to all for the suggestions on removing the EZ Out.  I was able to knock it out backwards
with a punch, so I'm over that hurdle.

Two things I learned about rear backing plates:

The adjuster screw holder is spot welded to the backing plate (although they will come apart,
eventually).

And on the back of the adjuster screw holder, there's an pin that protrudes into the wheel bearing
housing.  The backing plate will be loose after removing the three capscrews, but you need to go
behind the wheel bearing housing and hit this pin a few times with a punch to truly remove the
backing plate.

The next goal is to remove the parking brake cable from the driver's side backing plate without
destroying it.  Any ideas?  Bentley mentions removing some clip to pull it out, but there isn't
one that I can find.  On the passenger side, I remember just pulling and twisting on the metal
cable housing until it broke free, but it seemed to me that this would damage the hole to the
point where the replacement cable won't fit back in or stay connected.
