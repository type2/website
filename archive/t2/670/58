Are you sure that the oil is not coming from the push
rod tube seals directly above the heat exchanger and
dripping down?  That is a much more likely place to
find an oil leak. If so, no big deal. In a later bay
you can switch out new push rob tube seals without
even pulling the engine. The seals are about .50-.75
cent each, and you'll need 16 of them!
