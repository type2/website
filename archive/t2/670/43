I have a whole box of those carbs, and I don't think any two are 
alike.  There are many subtle differences in the throttle plates, linkages, 
carb bodies, chokes, etc..

I've never seen an adjustable automatic choke vacuum diaphragm like the one 
in the picture.  Not a stock feature as far as I know.
