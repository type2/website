Hi Folks,

I had a 914 many years ago, and it had a foglight switch similar to the one 
described:
(http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/pix/603293.jpg)
Unfortunately the knob and bezel were more similar to the Beetle stuff than 
the Bus stuff.  If you could get the right lens, I'm sure a rear defogger 
switch would work well and handle the load from the lights.

In addition, Karl is right that you want your fog lights OFF when your high 
beams are ON -- high beams make it more difficult to see thru the fog.  If 
you want extra lighting in clear weather, you want driving lights that are 
mounted on TOP of the bumper.  Driving lights have a clear lens for a long & 
narrow beam; fog lights have a fluted clear or yellow lens for a shorter, 
wide beam.

If you REALLY want to tax your charging system, run both fog and driving 
lights, switch them all separately, and switch them all on when it's super 
dark outside.  The bonus with that is you'll also be able to read a map by 
the little red ALT light on the dash....  <grin>

Good Luck!
