Subject: Lotta Questions - Brakes, etc...

Hey guys,

    My Bus and I need a lot of help....

    He is a 1973 Type-2 Transporter with an 1800cc motor (not original, GEX,
with hydraulic lifters, mechanical advance, and electric fuel pump).

I have a lot of questions and I hope you guys don't mind.

1) Brakes I just took my wheels off because I intend to paint them white to
match the bumper (it's painted white now, not shown in picture) and the roof.
When I took the wheel off, I noticed a few things. Can anyone tell me if this
caliper looks bad? It seems to have major surface rust on it. It has new pads,
and I know the calipers work fine. Should I replace these? Do they make
aluminum replacement calipers? I've never seen calipers that look this bad.
You can see in the picture that the brake lines are BRAND NEW.

2) I saw this + clip and the two little rods, and they were loose. When I
removed the wheel, I was able to easily slide out both of these rods. Is there
supposed to be something that holds them in place? There doesn't seem to be
anything. I'm actually quite surprised that they had stayed in there
anyway...

3) Suspension - I took some pictures of the front suspension and saw a few
things. Does anything look BAD in these pictures? Is there anything that I can
rebuild?

In that last picture, you'll see that bushing seems to be split in several
places. How difficult is it to remove that?

4) Paint / Rust - The paint job on this car is.. OK. It looks REALLY good, but
it was a pretty cheap paint job. I noticed that in the corners, the paint is
starting to rust. This is the sill panel directly under the door in the wheel
well.

What can I do to prevent this from getting any worse? Do I have to get the
entire car repainted? I saw something on Two Guys Garage that's supposed to
prevent a car from rusting further (some sort of device that prevents rust
electronically: http://www.counteractrust.com/)
Also, if you look under the body of my car, it seems that the car is really
really nasty. The entire underbody of the car seems to be rusted, but when I
take a close look, it's just really nasty undercoating. The inside of the bus
is totally rust free except the roof panel where headliner had apparently been
glued to. Is there anything I can do to this undercoating? Should I just leave
it? Can I paint over it? Just looking for ideas:

5) And my last and final question... I think I asked this before, but no one
knew the answer.. maybe that's changed! :) I decided to redo my engine
compartment because apparently the PO had removed the spring and one of teh
air flap. When I removed the alternator and everything, the wiring was
apparently soo brittle that it just fell apart in my hand. It appears as
though it's been butchered and hacked to pieces at every point from the master
fuse block all the way to the engine compartment. Does anyone know where I can
get the ENTIRE wiring harness for my VW Bus? Everything from the engine
compartment to the inside? The gauge wiring seems to be "ok". But I'd really
like to get all the other stuff replaced. Or.. if there's a complete kit, I
would buy that too....


Oh, and my fuel lines are ok, I replaced them a while ago.


Thanks!!!!!!
