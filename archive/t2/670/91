A reminder to those who know about it, and first notice to those who 
don't: there is a comprehensive discussion of heat in air cooled buses 
that covers (a) optimizing the stock system (b) improving on the stock 
system, and (c) insulating the bus. The site is:

http://www.shagadelic.org/VW/info/gmbulley-soundproof/heatdum.html

There has been much discussion on the list about the particular 
insulation techniques discussed on this and related pages. But whether 
you insulate, or use Bulley's materials, the discussion of the heating 
system is Introduction to Warmth 101.

At least one listee has suggested running an electric heater to warm up 
the inside of the bus for about 1/2 hour before departing, when 
possible. That's probably a good idea. The heat from the exchangers is 
almost instanteous when you start a bus, when the system is functioning 
properly, but there's a lot of space to heat up.
