Subject: Re: [T2] Factory / Dealer Fog Lamps

 To be completely honest, I almost never drive the Bus, and my reasoning for installing the fog lamps are more or less to have a "well optioned" VW Bus. I am redoing all the wiring in my Bus and figured I might as well do this at the same time.  My front bumper has those two holes in it.. the holes that are used for the factory push-bar pieces.. (like you see on the old 70s Cadillacs).
 
 I swapped it upside down so that the holes are facing the underside of the bumper. I plan to mount the fog lamps from those holes. I probably won't use them that often. But I do want it to all look relatively factory and OEM though.
 
 Do you guys have any pictures of what the factory fog lamps looked like? Were they round or rectangular during the 73 model year?
 
 
 Thanks!!
