Subject: Arresting Rust

Hi List,

I've got my 69' Bus running after it has been sitting
for 12 years.  I've got rust on the body and need to
prep it before having it painted.
Most of the stuff is minor, but I do need some
pointers.  Can someone recommend a product to
neutralize or stop the rust ?  I also have rust around
the windshield under the rubber molding, should the
windshield be popped out to stop the rust ?  If so are
there any articles around on removing windows from a
bus ?

thx,

rudy
