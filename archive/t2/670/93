Subject: Boston Bob Long Blocks,

All,

So I am thinking of a way to spend some christmas bonus money, 
completely contrary to what my other half is telling me I am looking at 
a 2.0 for my '73. From my travels I have heard good things about Boston 
Bob longblocks but wanted to get some list opinions from people who own 
them.

Thoughts ? Opinions ?

Steve
