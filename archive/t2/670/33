Well, crap.

I cleaned up the rat's nest, put some wires back where they SHOULD be,
instead of wedged into the fuse holders, etc. Bently shows lots once
you learn how to read a schematic... heh Plus, I used the pretty 72
schematic to help me translate. ;-)

Anyway, had a problem with the headlights not coming on. Turned out
there was no power wire to that fuse. Oops. Now the right turn signal
is on the same circuit as the right brake light. Ack. It was too dark
to mess with that. Tomorrow after work I'll look at it.

My brakes finally died though. Pedal travels half way then becomes
solid. The leaky rear cylinder finally blew I think. Guess no driving
for me until I can get that wheel off. At least it runs nice. LoL! I
can get it off the street. Yay! No more street sweeper tickets!!!

Man, I can't wait until I get to Denver. I'm not moving unless I can
find a house to rent with at least 3 bedrooms, den, and a garage with
a driveway!!!! (Wife found a 4bd online with den and basement for $800
month, so I know I can swing what I want.)
