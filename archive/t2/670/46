Off the top of my head I'd check/replace "all of the above". 

The seals you should go ahead and replace while the engine's out,
IMHO. Pushrod tube leaks will be easily visible from underneath the
engine, and can be changed while the engine is installed, so if you
don't see leaks now, you can wait. But do the oil cooler and crank
seals while the engine's out for sure.
