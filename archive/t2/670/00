Is there a reason to worry about a backing plate? I mean, as long as
it is straight enough to keep road debris out of the drum, is there
something else to worry about?

When my bus rolled his fat arse off the jackstands, he landed on the
backing plate. It looked like a taco! I jacked the bus back up, used
sturdier wheel chocks (!) and used a couple pairs of vice grips to
straighten the backing plate.
