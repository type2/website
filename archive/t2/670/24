Subject: battery light and brake light flickering.. solved?

Well after looking for the worst case.. sound familure?
I had tried a number of things to figure out why the battery light and
brake warning light was flickering on.. wont bore you with the
details..
On the way home from work it was doing its disco thing and I put the
brakes on..  this time the brakes felt a bit more solid than they have.
Boom the lights no longer flicker.. so it would seem that something
was hung in the brakes.. thought they worked fine the pedal was a bit
soft... at any rate the damn lights quit taunting me. we'll see if it
lasts.. if not at least I know where to start
