I pulled the hub and found dimples on the crank shaft on both sides of the 
key that positions the hub. Looks like someone used a punch to remove the 
key from the crank and missed twice. there is raised metal about 1/100 of an 
inch but I'll bet that's enough to pue the outside edge of the fan off 
kilter enough to scrape the housing. tried to scrape the metal off with a 
knife blade but I hardly got a sliver off. Getting too cold outside so I'll 
try again later. Maybe some emery cloth after I pack the seal with paper 
towel or something. Any Ideas on how to remove the pimple of steel?

This one uses regular bolts to hold the fan on the hub. I know the earlier 
ones used some kind of allen head bolt. I think my 75 uses the allen head 
bolts. May have been weaker.

The Bentley for the 80 Vanagon says to torque them to 14 ft. lbs.
