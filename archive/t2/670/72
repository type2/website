Huh?  You want high beams on in the fog so that the
light glares back at you?!?!?

You want fog beams to be mounted below the bumper so
the light is along the ground in front of you. Fog
lights have a flat horizontal beam because of this.

US lighting restricts the AMOUNT of lights you can
have on in front, not wattage. You are allowed 4
lights not counting parking lights. Either low beams
and fog lights or high beams and driving lights.

 The reason the fogs work with low beams only (as it
 is explained to me) is because of US lighting
 restrictions which dictate how much wattage a person
 can have burning at one time on a car. As the high
 beams are higher wattage, my source said the total
 output of the lighting was too high (high beams +
 driving lights). 
 
 If my source is wrong please correct me!
 
 My '97 VW Cabrio is the same way... I plan to bypass
 that feature and have the information to do it with
 simple jumper wires. No cut fix.
