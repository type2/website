Probably not, but if the general feeling is that it's toast anyway, it
couldn't hurt to try to nurse it as close to home as possible that way.

You checked it? Tried to rotate it and it wouldn't, at all? Waited for it
to cool and tried again?

Actually, no. In warmer climes it is common to replace rusted, expensive,
heater boxes with cheaper "J-tubes" and plug those fan shroud outlets.

The heater boxes are there to scavenge heat from the exhaust for passenger
comfort. They aren't really necessary as an exhaust cooling system. In
fact, blocking the fan shroud outlets that lead to the heater boxes allows
ADDITIONAL air to pass over the cylinders and through the oil cooler.

Though why someone living that far north would intentionally break the
cabin heating system I really don't know. <grin>
