heh. Actually I meant on the way there through New Mexico. ;-) I got
hit with one in Texas when I was driving to North Carolina 14 years
ago (man, that makes me feel old!) I was doing 65 and the speed limit
dropped from 55 to 35 with no warning. By the time I passed the cop I
was still doing 45. $160 ticket. Grrr...

The other side of my concern is taking the hills and mountains. My
leadfoot will mean a quick death for my engine if I don't restrain
myself. ;-)
