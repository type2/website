Hi Folks,
    Well  we had some real winter weather here on Long Island, NY
today with the high in the low 20s and a dusting of snow.  The weather
reminded me that it's time to post my original poem about winter and
VW buses.  For those of you who have seen the poem in years past and
those of you seeing it for the first time, enjoy.

Winter in a VW Bus

Not a month before Christmas
and all cross the land,
bus owners are driving
with ice scrapers in hand.

They're scraping without
and they're scraping within,
to see where they're going
and where they've just been.

With a little warm air
that passes for heat,
we lose feeling in our fingers
our ears and our feet

So we put on our hats
our gloves and more sox,
endure the cold weather
in our german icebox.

Winter is long
and it's cold and it's dark,
but these buses we drive
have a place in our heart

Without a complaint
or hardly a care,
we wait for warm weather
summer to bear.
