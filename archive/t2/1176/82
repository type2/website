Subject: Body Work in Northern Colorado

Hey Type2ers-

   I know there are a number of you in Northern Colorado, and Fort 
Collins in particular.  I'm looking to get the body work done on my 77 
Transporter while I do the engine work myself (I've attempted doing the 
body work myself, but it's become clear that it's a lot harder than 
following along to YouTube videos :)  Can someone recommend a body shop 
around here that will actually touch a restoration (the body shops I've 
called either don't do restos or are backlogged to high heaven)?

   My van is pretty stripped down on the exterior, so there's not much 
in the way of prep (by comparison to a rolling resto).  There will be 
some body work to do (a dent in the back driver side corner and some 
rust in front of the back wheels), but like I said, I've been trying to 
do this myself and not cut any corners.  If I can't find someone, I'll 
probably end up doing it myself and taking another few years to finish, 
which I would *really* like to avoid.

Cheers,
Paul
