Subject: Good Multi- Gas detector?

I would love to have something like this;

http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/3/HouseHome/SafetySecurity/CarbonMonoxideDetectors/PRDOVR~0460308P/Multi-Gas+Detector.jsp?locale=en

but obviously not one that has to be plugged in. Has anyone got any recommendations?
