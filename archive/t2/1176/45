Well, the fan only turns on when the lever is pulled down all the way, 
not when the heater control is most of the way on - it needs to be 
all-of-the-way-on.

As far as the electric fan's effectiveness, well, it does add a bit more 
airflow, but most of the airflow is coming from the engine cooling fan 
and varies significantly with RPM, but the electric fan does help.
