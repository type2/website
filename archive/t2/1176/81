No worries Bob, I'm that person, and unfortunately it couldn't be worse as I not only live in Canada, but I'm on the West Coast on Vancouver Island. As far as far can be. :-\

I'm sorry about jumping into the middle of this, but I have a solid front
beam sitting in my driveway in Abington, MA. If the person who needs it will
contact me and does not live outside the US, we can make arangements.....
