Subject: Re: [T2] Front beam rust out. :-(

Courtney,
Kinda gnarly. I would go with either replacement or weld in some new 
metal. Of course the beam removal is a bit of a job. I've done it on 
my 64 once upon a time. Gotta lift the old buses high enough to remove 
the steering shaft. Easier on the new ones.
