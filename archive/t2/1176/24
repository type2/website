Hi Scott,

 

I use something like this -

a barrier strip. Then I get a jumper strip -

Bring power to one end, then jumper that whole side. Then the other side is
hot. I've got two in my bus. One is hot all the time, and one is only hot
when the engine is running. Here is a link to a pic I just posted of it. If
you need more pics, let me know.
