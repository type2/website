Is the electrical connection for the fan still there? If so you would just
need to connect the new fan to it. The fan connects to the heating system via
flexible pipes that connect to metal pipes that you should be able to see
sticking through holes in the tinware on either side of the engine. They may
have been blocked off when the fan was removed.

Note that the fan is only effective at idle and it only runs when the dash
heater control is most of the way on.

You don't need a thermostat for the heater.
