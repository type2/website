I'll try one and if it doesn't go then switch to the torch. Thanks for 
the pre-emptive suggestion so I'm not standing there frustrated 
wondering what my alternatives are. Hammer with a 6 ft cheater bar, 
dynamite, sending them off to a military firing range, diesel locomotive 
rolling over the trailing arm with a custom made punch die sitting on 
top of the arm.... LOL!
