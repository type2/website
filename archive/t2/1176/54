Martin,

German Supply sells those little seals John Anderson mentions.

Scott sells them for both the right and left and the new ones thankfully
are not asbestos. I would strongly suggest using these over alternative
sealants

Also the asbestos collets on the flexible heater tubes can be replaced with
silicone collars from Airheadparts or other vendors.

Also, I think someone may have mentioned that the thermostat isn't
necessary for the heating system? I may be wrong since the thread has been
snipped by my mail server. If so, without a functional thermostat you won't
get much noticeable heat. I won't go into why a thermostat is needed
overall, since it is a topic that has been discussed enough.

My 2 cents...good luck on your project!
