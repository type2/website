Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking oil from the oil cooler

Steve, first I doubt that it is leaking from the cooler itself.  Could be,
particularly if you are in a climate prone to corrosion, but better than
90/100 it is leaking from the seals between the cooler and block, or not even
at all from the area, like valve cover leaks, pushrod tubes, oil filter, etc. 
More deceptive are leaks more adjacent high up including the pressure sender,
and dizzy shaft O-ring, can even be the front seal but that will toss blown
oil all over.  But if he feels oil is truely up on and from the cooler itself,
still probably the seals 8-)  The issue being this, the T4 cooler isn't really
cheap ($100-150), the seals are dirt cheap ($1.60 total) however labor is the
same either way, so...  If you can't do the work yourself I don't know what to
say to do.  Perhaps have the cooler at hand from a place with a good return
policy, known good used at hand, etc. hope for the best.  I would rec the real
VW guy, though I'd want him to
 be a real T4 guy if possible as well.  As outdated as it is, you might hit
AIRS and see if someone around you would come and lend a hand at doing the
repair at home for a 6 pack or two.
 
Unfortunately BTW there are more ominous
possibilities here as well, like the fact that some of the block oil gallery
plugs around the area like to leak as well as a sign of imminent and engine
wrecking failure.  Although I would consider it a "crutch" on real engine
assembly, on an already assembled engine I would always peen an 8-10 point
pattern around all accessible gallery plugs with a center punch while you are
doing this.  On a build I would pull em all and tap em, but in this case I'd
do what I could do, and a lot of builders have just peened them for many,
many, many years.
 
As to pulling the engine, not totally needed.  One can
fight to remove the tin, fan, cooling shroud in the car, it is a bear, I've
done it once in my life when I was very young and foolish.  But you can jack
the back end up high, pull the bellhousing support bolts, engine carrier bar,
loosen the front mount to the body a bit, and tip the whole engine/tranny down
as a unit, then pull the rear tins, fan, shroud, access the cooler.  This is a
doable home thing with a good set of hand tools, a solid work surface, a set
of ramps, a good large floor jack, and a chunk of 2x12.  Get known good
quality cooler seals, and I'd have a new engine compartment seal at hand
unless yours is under 4-5 years old as this is the time to do it.
 
As to
driving it as is, if I truely thought the cooler was leaking, I probably
wouldn't, but I so much doubt that it is, that I probably would.  But it isn't
my engine, and if it bursts it is very, very hard to shut one down quickly
enough to prevent catastrophic bearing damage.  It is amazing how fast one can
pump the sump dry with a real oil leak.  I once inadvertently screwed a sender
unit I was replacing on a Mitsubishi 2.6 into the wrong hole in the block,
doing it blind well up on the back of the engine.  Although 1/8 NPT,
the actual fluid drilling in the block, all of about 3/32" in diameter.  The
250k mile engine pumped out 5 qts of oil in about 15 seconds I'd wager, and we
shut it down in time, only because we were looking to find the problem
(sender) with the oil pressure and knew we had just replaced it.
 
YMMV.

I have a '74 bus that the mechanic (who once
owned a bus) says is leaking oil from the oil cooler.  Its not a major leak
but needs to be fixed. They say they'll have to pull the engine to fix it and
recommend that I take it to an actual VW guy about an hour away.  My question
is ... is it safe to drive it?  She won't lose a lot of oil if it continues to
leak as it is.
