Subject: Re: [T2] Front beam rust out. :-(

Courtney, I'd go with replace it.  That is pretty bad, even by rusted out WV
rust belt standards.  As mentioned even 1 person can do the swap in a VERY
long weekend with a couple of good floor jacks, the actual in and out isn't so
bad itself (sometimes needs a couple of big honking pry bars, sometimes not)
it is more all the ancillary crap that is a PITA to me, brakes, shifter, etc. 
If you do weld patches in I think you are going to have to have them formed to
go around onto the flat flange a bit for good strength and that won't be easy
to form.  About the only thing I'd consider would actually be to sandwich over
with a piece cut out of another solid beam, and at that point...
 
If you do
go with repair, obviously check the other side, and more importantly the pivot
mount, very, VERY, carefully.

don't know what to do. I don't want to
kid myself that it's weldable, but I
did look at the VW beam repair guide from
the factory, and they do show this
as the typical rust out area. They
recommend 2mm metal be welded in. The rest
of the beam is solid, but I'm
pretty bummed. Would appreciate more experienced
people than me looking at
it.
