Yes - you are perfectly right. My first VW Cabrio convertible top took 
two and a half weeks. I think I could do the next one in a day.... My 
first Beetle valve adjustment took a week. I'd adjust them, drive it, 
and recheck and finally I learned how to do it right. I could do that 
same valve adjustment now in under 30 mins I think (been a long time). 
GRIN!

Anyhow - give that oil cooler seal R&R a try. You can do it.
