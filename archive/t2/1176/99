Subject: looking for battery hold-down solution

I'm working with someone that had a rusted out battery compartment so he 
had his body-shop do some fiberglass work in there to reinforce the 
rusted out area.  Problem is now that there are no more battery 
hold-down brackets.  Does anyone have a relatively simple solution to 
deal with this so that the battery doesn't go flying around?

Thanks!
Mike
