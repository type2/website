Subject: Front beam rust out. :-(

I'm sad to say that while digging around with my screwdriver while changing
out front brake components I've discovered just how rusty my front beam is on
the drivers side. I am going to post a picture to flickr for opinions, but I'm
thinking it's a goner. :-( WAY too much work for me to replace it, so now I
don't know what to do. I don't want to kid myself that it's weldable, but I
did look at the VW beam repair guide from the factory, and they do show this
as the typical rust out area. They recommend 2mm metal be welded in. The rest
of the beam is solid, but I'm pretty bummed. Would appreciate more experienced
people than me looking at it.
