Subject: Leaking oil from the oil cooler

I have a '74 bus that the mechanic (who once owned a bus) says is leaking oil from the oil cooler.  Its not a major leak but needs to be fixed. They say they'll have to pull the engine to fix it and recommend that I take it to an actual VW guy about an hour away.  My question is ... is it safe to drive it?  She won't lose a lot of oil if it continues to leak as it is.

Thanks,

Steve
