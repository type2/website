Subject: What kind of parts washing gloves do you wear?

Mine quit tonight. They were a decade old maybe and I have no idea where 
they came from.

Any suggestions for gloves that last? Do you use single use medical 
style latex gloves or ???

Thanks. I forgot how filthy dirty washing greasy parts can get. Trailing 
arms, rotors, and spindles are all grease free now. Wiped out a set of 
garage clothes in the process after a rotor slipped and splashed me with 
kerosene. I'm going to look for a better cleaning agent tomorrow.
