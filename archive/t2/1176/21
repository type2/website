Subject: Good way to provide multiple lines to 12v switched under dash

On my 74 Bus, I keep adding more and more things up front which
require 12v switched power.
I was wondering if anybody has a good way of managing this. At this
point I'm tapping into whichever 12v switched spade is nearest my new
gauge or ipod whatsit.
Not always a great way, as I now have too many things strung off of my
dash instruments backlight circuit.

Could I tap a fused line into #11 or #12 from the fusebox onto some
kind of 12v switched panel attached to the bulkhead with many
available screw leads?

Thanks,
Scott B
