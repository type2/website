Subject: Looking for local source (near California) of ignition wire

Does anyone know where I can find some ignition wire holders in the 
vicinity of California (or west-coast even)?  I'm looking to get 1- or 
2- wire holders that snap onto the cooling tin.  German supply has them, 
but the shipping from Canada is a bit much :(

thanks!
Mike
