FWIW - Mine boosted the airflow slightly but only at idle. Anything much 
above idle and the flappers in the fan were closed by the engine air 
pressure... When the engine was idling I think the design was for the 
booster fan air pressure to close the little aluminium flappers in the 
bottom of the fan shroud. On a Type IV motor that is. Whatever is making 
more air pressure at that time closes the flappers of the other fan 
(engine or booster fan) and "wins". That keeps some air always moving 
forward. Flapper check valves as it were.

All that said I think the booster fan output was pitiful on my van. 
Maybe my heat control flappers were leaking - I don't know. I'm 
considering running two bildge fans in the same location, or two factory 
booster fans with one fan per only one side, or - or - or a leaf 
blower... Okay - the leaf blower is a joke...

How all this will tie into the Corvair engine in my bus is not yet fully 
planned out... ;) The Corvair used a booster fan too. Everything was 
different though. I have considered boxing an oil cooler into the main 
trunk line so that once the oil warms up it heats up the oil cooler like 
a heater core in a water cooled vehicle and the air passing through it 
would help heat the interior. The VW heater controls would regulate this 
simulatanously just fine since the stock heater controls would regulate 
how much air is leaving the engine cooling system and is passed up front 
(through that oil cooler).

Haven't had an aircooled engine on the road in such a long time I can't 
remember if the oil ever got hot enough for this plan to be useful. And 
the Corvair I haven't run yet so that may be totally different.
