Chris, BTW the words on ball joint removal from back in the day in the
type2.com tech section (heat dull red, whump with large hammer) are still as
golden now as they were then.  Just as mentioned in that article, I've had a
30k press (and a real good ole American one) break stuff trying to press them
out, until we had that list discussion way back when.  Just like Steve Denis
related my response to it was NFW, until I tried it.  You will probably get em
out with that 60k press, but there is a much easier way.  I do use the press,
I use it to support my dully glowing torsion arm while I hammer.
 
YMMV.
