My understanding of the operation of the system is different....I've actually
heard the little aluminum flaps at the bottom of the main fan housing slam
shut when I engage the electric heater fan when the engine is idling.   That
forces the electric fan air up front and not into the engine cooling air
stream.   When engine revolutions increase, the pressure from the engine
cooling fan overrides the electric fan and forces the flaps back open.
 
The
electric fan itself actually has 2 little flaps at the outlets that close when
the fan is not running.  I think that the pressure from the main fan and the
pressure from the engine fan at high RPMs work together to move the air to the
front thus actually giving more airflow at high RPMs when the electric fan is
running and are supposed to be balanced to the extent that neither one sends
air to the other at all operating speeds.
 
the bottom line is:  there are
actually 4 little flaps, 2 at the bottom of the main engine fan housing and 2
at the electric fan up top in the engine compartment to keep air from
backflowing through the electric fan when the electric fan is not running.
________________________________
That's what those two little aluminum flaps
at the bottom port and
starboard of the fan housing are for. At higher (off
idle) RPMs the flaps
close, preventing the pressure of the cooling fan
overcoming that of the
electric fan and blowing air backwards through the
electric fan into the
engine compartment; essentially a check valve, directing
all airflow into
the cooling system.
