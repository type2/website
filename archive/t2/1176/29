Hey Chris,

 

Great advice, but I would put a huge asterisk on the 'me' in the statement
"It would take me about 2-3 hours I expect to tear it down and put it
together with a little cleaning up along the way."

 

If never done before, you could easily double this time, plus try to plan
for all the unexpected that happens when you work on something this old. I
think in the 12+ years that I have been a vw person, I have only had about 2
or 3 repairs go as planned.  I think every other repair-once I began, I
would see something else, that asked for attention, or required attention at
the same time. Sometimes odd 25 cent parts that you didn't plan on needing,
need to be replaced. And you can't get them locally anymore-so you need to
find the part, find someone who has it, then order it, and wait a few days
to a week for some dang 25 cent part..been there done that more times than I
care to remember. 

 

I think doing it yourself is the right way to go, but I don't want you to
get your hopes up-as far as doing the whole job in 2-3 hours, and then get
frustrated after 5 hours. Plan for it to take a whole day. Then if you
finish early, you get to drive around  in your  bus. ;)
