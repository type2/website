Subject: re:What kind of parts washing gloves do you wear?

Hi Chris,

 

I use latex a lot of the time when working on my bus, sometimes I use
heavier duty nitrile gloves. They seem to stand up to harsher chemicals
better. I get these at H*me Dep*t or the like. They are pretty
cheap.Alternatively sometimes I get gloves at my FLAPS. They sell one I
think called "Diamond Grip" which I thought was goofy, and a sales gimmick,
but they do work really well. These are still no too expensive, but more
than latex.
