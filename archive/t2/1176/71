Subject: Re: [T2] Front beam rust out. :-(

I find the only real PITA when the heavy work comes is getting it shimmed in
there snug like the manual says. Sometimes you get lucky and it is tight
enough as it comes, sometimes you better have some shim stock at hand, as the
shims (if they were present) are often corroded badly.   Far more annoying to
me as I mentioned, all of the little (and not so little) crap that you have to
remove/install to get TO the heavy work.  
 
Oddly I've parted some
horrendously rusted buses with some very nice beams, and seen some relatively
nicer buses with some real rusted out beams, so don't overlook local sources
if there are still any lying around.  Ron used to have new bare as well of
course, don't know if he still does.  Rust can come from the inside or outside
on these BTW, a lot of them get overzealously lubed and grease plugs drainaige
or holds dirt that holds water.  I had a buddy who used to swear to putting a
zerk or two in the support tower there where Coutney's is rusted and filling
the whole thing, but I never figured it would help long term.  I have been
known to drill a 3/16" hole in a couple of locations and flood the interior of
those with my all time favorite, Rustoleum cold galvanizing applied with one
of those little red "straws" until it runs out the bottom.  Who knows...

I did mine in as John says a very long weekend alone with
a good replacement I got from Busted Bus, think the shipping was dern near as
much as the beam itself.
I took the opportunity to get new ball joints at the
same time, the only thing that gave me some hassles was the torsion bars but
with some inventive german words they went in.  wasn't hard so much as awkward
and heavy.
