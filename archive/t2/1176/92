Beware of latex gloves an allergic reaction can come from even a few uses 
and can be severe.  long term use almost assures a reaction in a large 
percentage of people.

I use vinyl for regular dirty stuff, changing bearings etc. for fine work 
I have some non sterile nytrile surgical gloves.

vinyl is cheap
nytrile is no

YMMV
