I stripped one off a 73 transporter in long island once. It fairly  
straightforward to get one. The hard part was backing the bus out of  
the victims driveway by pushing a floor Jack along on boards you can't  
really see under the bus. Tony W.A.S.T.E. Ended up with it... I wonder  
if it fit into his '78?
