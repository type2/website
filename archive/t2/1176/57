No shit, who would have thought somebody finally was repopping them,
and perhaps well worth it for $8 a side...
 
BUT
 
http://www.germansupply.com/home/customer/product.php?productid=16389
 
$29-34
(depending on side) for the a real German ones, damn REALLY???
But also note
that neither of the $8 repops or $30 German ones show in stock...
 
Which
leads back to a nicely applied $2 bead of silicone left to cure.  To be a bit
more specific on that BTW, you clean up the cover plates carefully and lay the
bead on the periphery of the plate where the asbestos seal used to live, tool
it a bit if you care, doesn't matter, let it cure, then install with or
without a smidge of additional silicone added on top of your bead, though not
enough to gum up the flap.

tubes can be replaced with silicone collars from Airheadparts or other
vendors.

FWIW the silicone collets off a Vanagon are
a bit nicer than those appear, and are often a bit cheaper if you can find
them at a show or a pick and pull.
