Subject: [T2] Front beam rust out. :-(

Try to find a rust free beam and just replace it.  I've replaced beams in many
a bus, by myself. I just use two floor jacks.   It's really not that
hard.(everyone told me it was).  The trick is to lower the bus over the beam.
Keeping everything as low as possible. The front end of your bus will almost
be on the ground.  Then just a couple of pumps of the jack and your beam will
move up right into place.  When you find a beam, I'd be glad to walk you
through it.
