Subject: RE: [T2] Front beam rust out. :-(

I'm sorry about jumping into the middle of this, but I have a solid front
beam sitting in my driveway in Abington, MA. If the person who needs it will
contact me and does not live outside the US, we can make arangements.....

My front beam didn't have shims - is is this common? Am trying to figure 
out if the beam was original or replaced or rebuilt somewhere along the 
way and no shims added when it was reinstalled... I saw the procedure 
last night in the bentley manual for the first time so I'll be checking 
this during reinstall.
