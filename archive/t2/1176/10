er - I think there are a fair number of west coast vendors out there... 
cip1, airhead, wcm, wolfburg west, etc etc etc etc etc.... in fact I'd 
think it would be harder to find a non-west coast supplier than to find 
one anywhere else...  Ronnie (oldvolks/bustoration) probably even 
qualifies as west coast (arizona) as does aircooled.net (utah)
