This is exactly correct, both sets of flaps are one way valves OUT of their
respective blowers to keep air from blowing back IN to their respective
blowers.  The ones on the engine fan shroud are there so that at idle high
flow (and relatively higher pressure) from the electric fan is stopped from
getting wasted blowing back INTO the engine fan shroud.  Similarly when/if
engine cooling pressure overcomes flow of the electric fan the ones up at the
electric fan stop it blowing back through the electric fan.   Note that those
are quite a way up from the engine fan and of course if your flex tubes are in
bad shape or blown off, engine cooling is blowing into the engine compartment
unimpeded and being wasted.  Of course this is all quite dynamic as you are
shifting the car and rpms are changing.

I also say if above because oddly on
my '77 Westy, which is still as about intact, complete, and bone stock mint as
one can find, I do find that despite what one thinks and lore long suggests,
that the little electric fan is more gutsy than one might think, and that at
everything except for flat out above about probably 2500-3000rpm engine speed,
turning on the electric will make a noticeable difference (improvement) in
flow at the front.  Indeed it becomes progressively more trivial to "barely
noticeable" at revs, but cruising at high constant revs you do feel it when
you sit there flipping the lever on and off the stop/electric switch position
of its run.

Getting operation of flaps down at the engine shroud to be good
gets harder and harder, because without intact OEM asbestos seals on the
cover/clamp it is easy for them to not work, particularly when well
intentioned folks go gumming them up with silicone.  They seal is molded are
somewhat complex in contour and flat gasket material doesn't work.  I've had
best luck laying a large (5/16" or so) bead of silicone on the covers in
position, letting it fully cure overnight into a slightly compressible gasket,
then applying (or not) just a skim of silicone to the surface of the "gasket"
on installation.

My understanding of the operation of the system is
different....I've actually
heard the little aluminum flaps at the bottom of
the main fan housing slam
shut when I engage the electric heater fan when the
engine is idling.   That
forces the electric fan air up front and not into the
engine cooling air
stream.   When engine revolutions increase, the pressure
from the engine
cooling fan overrides the electric fan and forces the flaps
back open.
