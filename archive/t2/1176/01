You can get leaking there, but as Mike alludes to it is at crankcase
pressure.  Which can be significant if you have a lot of blowby (which it you
do on a low mile rebuild, you have other issues) and/or a poor breather
system.  If you have a stock functioning draft tube type system, that is
usually not so much an issue.  I'd be sure that little phht, phht, phht is
coming from the base not the head side of said cylinder.  I agree nothing to
be lost from retorque, but I'd watch compression, valve adjustment, and temp
if you can on that cylinder carefully, and be thinking you got an issue
coming.  A lot of people don't use those paper gaskets, instead using a bead
of silicone on build, or even nothing.  Usually as they get miles they seep
some dried gummy oil crust, not pressurized gas.

I'd think you could just retorque the nuts and
see how it works out as the gases escaping at the bottom of the cylinder
shouldn't even be that hot (relative to the cylinder temps).  What's odd is
where all that pressure is coming from.  I never have really paid attention to
crankcase pressure, but there really shouldn't be that much pressure that it's
able to blow by an even reasonably loose seal - that's gotta be some
significant pressure (I would think).  Again, I thinking out loud here...
