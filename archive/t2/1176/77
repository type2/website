Subject: Re: [T2] Front beam rust out. :-(

My front beam didn't have shims - is is this common? Am trying to figure 
out if the beam was original or replaced or rebuilt somewhere along the 
way and no shims added when it was reinstalled... I saw the procedure 
last night in the bentley manual for the first time so I'll be checking 
this during reinstall.

Sorry if I detoured discussion.
