Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking oil from the oil cooler

It's tough to gauge how fast the oil is going to leak out. A friend was 
warned way back in the 90s that his van had a serious rear crank seal 
leak. He drove it anyhow and within about 30 miles he fried the engine. 
The trip was optional and he junked the van b/c of it (rest of it was 
fixable but getting ugly). I got a bunch of parts from it anyhow.

It's not a hard fix. Get yourself a Bentley manual and John Muir's 
"Idiot manual" (How to Keep Your VW Alive) and you can do this yourself. 
The required tools are basic, you need a safe place with a concrete 
floor to work i.e. nobody is going to steal your tools b/c you needed to 
run to the bathroom for a break, and patience. If you rely on this van 
for daily transportation then you might as well hire it out but I'd be 
really picky about who did the work like John Anderson suggested. It 
would take me about 2-3 hours I expect to tear it down and put it 
together with a little cleaning up along the way.

Best of all you have this list to talk you through it.

If you have leaking gallery plugs then I'd suggest 
drilling/tapping/plugging them. Get it done right the first time so the 
fix doesn't let you down unexpectedly in some random place. You don't 
want to face random failures of quickie fixes. It gets tiring and 
expensive quick.
