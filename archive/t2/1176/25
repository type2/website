Subject: Hubcap?

So

Where is the hubcap/baton that had been making its way around the world as
part of "The Great Bus Tour?"

Traveling with it was a box (it used to be a little suitcase) of accouterments
(mementos) that people added along the way.  Included with that was a mixtape
(CD players weren't that numerous back in the day) that somehow kept
disappearing.  I remember making more copies and sending them to whomever was
in possession of the hubcap to replace the stolen/missing tape.

Here is a link to the playlist.
