Subject: Re: Good way to provide multiple lines to 12v switched under

I was wondering if anybody has a good way of managing this. At this
point I'm tapping into whichever 12v switched spade is nearest my new
gauge or ipod whatsit.

Could I tap a fused line into #11 or #12 from the fusebox onto some
kind of 12v switched panel attached to the bulkhead with many
available screw leads?

HI Scott B,
           Best way is a sub panel with individual fuses.  Individual fuses
allow easy trouble shooting of individual circuits.  Well worth the extra
money.  Ideally you switch power to the sub panel via a relay hooked to
"always on" 12v power.  Using a relay takes the load off whatever circuit you
are getting the "switch signal" from.  If you are using switched power for
audio devices, they will sound better if you have a direct, high amp,
connection to the battery. This is rather than via the skinny OEM wires
carrying all kinds of other currents. Do the "Big 3" upgrade if you care about
audio.  Very easy on a bus.

Lots of sources for suitable power relay; List vendors, Junkyard, RatShack,
DigiKey, FLAPS. Don't forget to fuse that line near the battery too.

The Blue Seas panels with blade fuses are my pref. (ST Blade fuse blocks) Make
life easy.  Something like the 5026 will get you 12 circuits and a negative
bus, with a removable cover that you can write the circuit descriptions onto. 
Great help for both you, and next owner, when trouble shooting.
