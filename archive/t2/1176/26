Subject: Re: [T2] Hubcap?

This came up on the list back in late September of 2009, with no results
other than someone knew someone who knew someone who had it out west. There
was a Samba thread created as well, which is still up but has no current
info. I had a chance to pass the hubcap on back in the late 90s, although I
can't find the pics...Hopefully someone can track it down and help it get
back on the road!
