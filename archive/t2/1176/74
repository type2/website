Subject: Re: [T2] Front beam rust out. :-(

Courtney I've been lucky, 4/4 were either snug, or large and needed shimmed. 
I have a feeling the replacement ones were probably jigged for ever so big to
fit anything, but I've had one rusted one I replaced that was DAMN tight
without shims.  It was incredibly hard to remove (used my portapower to jack
it off) and if it had been solid (it was being replaced cause the pivot rusted
off while I was driving) I doubt I could have got it on another bus...  Oddly
on it the towers were fine, but the pivot mount was toast and separated while
I was making a turn, and the bus was only about 13 years old at the time, I
was only 19 or so, scary.  The replacement needed shimmed so it was a tight
beam not a big bus.
 
If it did come tight, it will probably be minute and I
bet patient application of a 40-60 grit flap disc on an angle grinder would
permit installation.

How many people I wonder have run into the beam that is
too small for their frame, like the article in the library talks about?? That
would be a major depresser to have a beam shipped out to me, and it's too
small???
