I did mine in as John says a very long weekend alone with a good 
replacement I got from Busted Bus, think the shipping was dern near as 
much as the beam itself.
  I took the opportunity to get new ball joints at the same time, the only 
thing that gave me some hassles was the torsion bars but with some 
inventive german words they went in.  wasn't hard so much as awkward and 
heavy.

Good luck
