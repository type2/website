Actually, as Karl explained a while back (with which I agree), those 
flaps on the bottom of the engine fan shroud are to keep the air moving 
through the heat exchangers instead of back into the engine compartment 
when the engine is not running.  I don't know if you've ever tried 
running the heater fan with the engine off, but the amount of airflow is 
not very strong.  I highly doubt that the electric blower fan closes 
those flaps while the engine is running as there is still a significant 
amount of airflow coming from the cooling fan, even at idle.
