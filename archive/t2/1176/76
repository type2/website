Subject: Re: [T2] Front beam rust out. :-(

I just pulled my front beam over the weekend. It is not impossible, not 
even difficult (technical), but it does take some time.

You need a level concrete floor, big jack stands, and a trolley jack.

Might be worth acquiring a good donor beam, prep it with paint, brakes, 
new wheel bearings, new brake lines and then driving the bus somewhere 
with a lift. Have them lift the bus, remove the old beam, install the 
new beam and you now have spare parts. Clean them up, paint them and put 
them on your shelf for next time. Recycle the beam or sell/give it to 
someone who can fix the old beam.

I can provide more details if you want to do the work yourself.

My beam simply needed all new grease cups, brake lines, and paint. The 
bus is a former New Mexico van. While it's out I'm going to put in new 
patch panels for the outer seat belt mounts (mine are crusty and no 
longer strong) and the typical rocker panel end behind the front wheels. 
The rest just needs a good cleaning and brush painting to prevent rust. 
Used a pressure washer to remove the crusty, muddy grease and mud all 
over the beam.
