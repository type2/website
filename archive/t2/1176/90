I too use mostly disposable blue nitrile, they will resist heavier kerosene
type solvents (mineral spirits, stuff in your parts washer) very well.  They
still disintegrate pretty quick in gasoline (err, umm, of course no one ever
uses that for solvent out in the backyard) or in other lite solvents like
acetone or lacquer thinner.  They also don't hold up well for Fume Free Easy
Off which is one of my favorite all around cleaners.  Up here in AK I recently
picked up some disposable green colored nitrile ones that cost a bit more
(about $15/box) but are heavier and last about 3-4 times longer in the lite
solvents.  Good paint/hardware places will have quite a selection usually. 
Latex will not hold up to solvent use for any time at all, some of the clear
urethane? gloves do well, some don't (melt.)
 
I do have a pair of super heavy
duty old black fabric dipped nitrile things that are impervious to most
anything, but I misplaced on of them about 5 years back which makes the "pair"
a bit worthless.

I use the blue Nitrile gloves
you can get just about anywhere, like Harbor Freight etc. or any flaps. They
are chemical proof for the most part, although I'm sure some chemicals can
dissolve even those. :-)
