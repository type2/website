Chris,

Rough roads and heavy loads equal broken packs, loaded westy doen't
help, but not your efforts to remove, nor have you done any damage to the
bearings.  Pretty common problem, and ideally should be replaced.  Try to
source one somewhere intact and used, but may be tougher to find one intact
than you think.

Do you mean the indents for the seal retainers?  They come
all over the place, I recall the factory new SA beam Dolan wrote about in his
swap writeup (oh yeah, was there for that) had them 90 off of OEM German,
don't worry about them.

So did I mess up the arm bearings
beating the upper arms off?
Did I break the two leaves beating the upper
trailing arms off with the mallet?
Anyone got a set to sell for a fair price?
Does it matter how the bearing races are oriented?
