maybe stupid answer but I have owned over the last 50yrs or so just about 
everyi air cooled vehicle that VW ever made and changed far more than my 
share of engines.,

in all those years I don't think I ever saw one without the two studs in 
the bottom of the engine... so if they look like they will fit that is 
what I would use.

if they don't measure to fit, ???? is that really a VW tranny??

good luck
