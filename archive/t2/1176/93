While I can't give you any direct reviews, here are a couple of places I 
would call:

Cooper Auto Body in Laporte (.5 mile west of Taft Hill on 54G).  They do 
mostly collision work, but they could at least give you some suggestions 
of folks to talk to.

Bill at The Motorway, LTD.  He is a British car resto shop, but is not 
averse to working on German stuff...Bill is a very nice guy who loves to 
talk cars, and he has some sweet rides in his shop.

Good luck, and feel free to PM me if need be.
