Subject: Westy Vanagon help needed - Glastonbury, CT

A little off of some of these lists but a friend is looking for assistance.

An old friend has been living off the grid in his 92 Vanagon Westy 
Diesel.  The engine is going, as these power-plants sometimes do.  He 
has a working power train from a parts bus, but needs a place with tools 
and a lift to do the swap.   Funds are short so this is basically a 
"Karma job" but he's a good guy.  He is confident he can do the work, 
but lacks the right place to get it done.

If anyone has a yard and tools around Glastonbury / Hartford, let me 
know and I'll get in touch with him.  Please forward to other lists 
which might help.

Thanks,

BEN
