When I did mine on my '71 1600 DP I got a K&N type
crankcase breather filter with the right size spout
and connected it to the big fitting on the oil filler
with a short hose. I couldn't find any oil proof hose
the right size without buying a bunch of it so I just
used heater hose. I figure I'll have to change it
every year or two until I can find some oil proof
hose.
