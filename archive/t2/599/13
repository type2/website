If that's an original Westy luggage rack, don't panic --
there's still an ordinary metal Bus roof underneath,
which isn't especially prone to leaking.  The holes are
needed to avoid collecting a puddle of water in the recess
which would serve to bathe your luggage as well as provide
surprising showers to adjacent traffic when cornering or
braking after rainy weather.

Airhowlingly yours,
