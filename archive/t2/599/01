Karl rocks!!! 

Note: When you get your new scale, dab some paint on the fan housing
corresponding to the important marks on the scale... Example one at
zero and one at 7.5 or whatever you need it to be. That way if the
scale shreads or disappears or whatever, you'll have a backup to get
things in the ballpark until a new one arrives.

I've done this to mine, and if I ever have to drop the engine I'll get
some number stamps and do a more permanent mark.
