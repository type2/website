Subject: Bus Depot Front Door Seals

I purchased outer door seals for a 71 Bus from Bus Depot. I trial fitted the
seal and the fit doesn't look right.  The problem is that the groove on the
rubber fits over the edge of the metal until it gets near the upper rear
corner, then has to jump over the edge.

Here are two pictures of the upper rear corner of the drivers side door, one
from the inside and one from outside:

They did offer to have me send the seals back so they can take a look but I
wanted to check with the list first. Has anyone had experiences with this type
of seal? Does it work ok as shown in the pictures?

Thanks,
