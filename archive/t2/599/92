Subject: How to find out about bus gatherings?

Hey guys-

I know this should be a friday topic, but I have to move into a new apartment
friday, so I thought I might get a repreive this time.  How do you all know
about these gatherings and such?  I am in Central Jersey, and I never know
whats going on around here.  Id really love to get to meet some other bus
people!

Thanks
-ToM
