Subject: Re: [T2] brake cylinder paste

i'm not sure what the exact difference is but i have used both.  the fluid
that i used was in a spray can and was a bit on the soupy side.  on a side
note i finally picked up my special ordered 3M brake assembly paste/grease
from my local imports auto parts place.  its in a can with a brush and it
is a sort of translucent clear/white color.  i have yet to use it though.

What is the advantage of the paste over the assembly fluid???
Raybestos still  makes the fluid
