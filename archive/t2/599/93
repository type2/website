Subject: Bolts needed to attach pressure plate to 215mm flywheel

Hi Volks,

The high-riding clutch pedal in the westfakia degraded this week, with 
the engine suddenly developing a habit of outrunning the transmission 
in second and third gear. Not good, esp. with a 1000-mile vacation 
looming in 8 days.

So this afternoon I liberated a 215mm clutch disk from the spare parts 
stash of Franklin, Dad's 75 westy, and tonight Adam Narraway came over 
to help drop the engine. Between us we got the engine down in 70 
minutes, not as good as I had hoped but not too bad either. If I hadn't 
released the two top bolts on the tranny it would have been out in an 
hour; but those two bolts are a serious PITA sometimes.

As it turned out, there was a 210 mm flywheel on the engine. So we went 
back to my brothers garage and raided the stash once again for a 215mm 
flywheel. No big deal.

But then we get back home to discover that the 13mm bolts that fit the 
210mm flywheel are not going to fit into the 215mm flywheel.

AAARRRGGGGHHHH!!!!!   I have no idea where these bolts would have 
disappeared to.

There's an industrial fastener store close to my employer... Can 
someone please tell me the spec on the bolts I need?  Hardness, thread 
pitch and length. Or do I need to go to the dealer?

Happy trails,
