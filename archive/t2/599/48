Subject: Warm air fan

Hello,

I have just finished installing my warm air fan, that hangs down over top 
the engine. I still need to hook up the vacuum hoses (to the vacuum advance 
cut off) and find the wires to the temperature and transmission switch.

My question is should my fan still work at this point or does everything 
have to be hooked up. I don't want to hook everything up then find I have a 
faulty fan. My guess is that the switches probably activate the fan (thus 
the name switch).

Also are the switches part of the big white plug attached to the fan?

Thanks in advance, Phil.
