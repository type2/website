Subject: '74 Start No Run

My '74 played an interesting game with me today. I died without 
warning once at a busy intersection. Messed with everything I could 
think of and finally discovered it was something faulty in the 
ignition switch/relay.

As soon as I release the key from the start position the circuit is 
opened and the engine dies. If I hold the key in the start position 
it will run fine.

Questions: Is the problem most likely the ignition switch or a relay 
I have not located that I hear clicking? How difficult it is to 
remove the ignition switch if that is the problem? Anyone know what 
the relay looks like?

Thanks for the help.

Herb
