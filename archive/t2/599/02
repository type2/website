Root Head had the right Idea, I can get you close to
the marks on the housing. From the center of the top
screw hole for the plastic scale, following the curve,
measure 2&1/2 inches to the left and mark it, this is
"0"TDC, 3/8 of a inch further left is 7.5 BTDC. with
this you should be able to use a timing light to set
the timing by those marks and the notch on the timing
pulley. Phil
