1974, 1700cc  motor, carburetod by a single  Holley,  in running shape,
with no charging system (the topic of earlier posts.)  It's very dirty,
however, and most of the tin is rusted. I don't have the tools to do a
compression test.  I will likely solve that issue shortly.  Can one be
performed while the engine is not in the vehicle?  From what I
understand, the engine has to be turned over?  Brakes are nothing
special, and the suspension isn't anything to write home about either.

correct.

I think I may be just dropping the engine and possibly transmission, and
do exactly that.

Honestly, I got the bus for free from a friend who wanted some
carburetor work done on his car.  I could care less what I get from it. 
The money will likely just go to bills and life.
