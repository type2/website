Peter,

No takers on this question, so I'll step up.

I recommend sticking with good quality conti-tech cloth covered 5mm fuel
hose and OE style crimped-on hose clips. Most good vendors have the 5mm hose
for sale, but no-one else that I am aware of sells the OE style crimp hose
clips. Some other vendors sell meyle-brand hose which is black, made in
turkey and not as good (imo) as the conti-tech grey hose. Here is what we
sell for this job:

The fuel hose is perfect, made in germany and exactly like the hose your bus
was equipped with from the factory, right down to the grey color. The crimp
style hose clips are excellent also, they fit perfectly and give a nice
tight seal without any damage to the hose. They look nice too :-)

Using braided steel lines is a good idea on paper, but it is difficult to
install these lines, in fact it is far more difficult to get a really
professional job with the braided lines than with the cloth covered rubber
lines. You need some special tools to cut the lines, as well as aluminum
wrenches to tighten the AN end fittings without damaging them. Then you have
to figure out the interface between the AN fittings and the tank, filter and
pump: do-able but certainly not easy. I am guessing you will need a bunch of
compression fittings for this, which sort of defeats the purpose of the AN
style hoses. It is all very do-able, but I repeat that it will be more
difficult to get a perfect job with this type of line, to say nothing of the
cost, which will be very high relative to OE hose.
