Jamie,

I have to admit that I did not look at your prototype pics. I have one
concern with the way your hitch is mounted. The OEM hitches used the
threads in the bottom of the frame rails (the bumper support mounts) and
the mounts in the sides of the frame rails (where your hitch is mounted)
were used in addition to the bottom mounts for high capacity hitches (75
instead of 50 kg tongue weight and more than 1200 kg towing capacity).
It may be worth contemplating to weld an additional angle iron to your
hitch that would allow you to utilizes the bottom mounts. In addition to
the extra mounting points the angle pieces would prevent the hitch from
pivoting around the side bolts. With your current design the bolts in
the sides of the frame rails have to carry all the weight and keep the
hitch from pivoting - lots of stress there. I had a couple of these
welded nuts brake loose on my hitch, but the design of the stock hitch
helped to prevent a major disaster. Had this happened with your design,
I would have screwed up one framerail end, my muffler, and the trailer
at the least ...

I got the hitch back from the welder yesterday.  It looks great.  The
hardest part of the installation was threading the M 10 (1.5)
bolts into the 33 years of crud in the threads if the holes in the
frame. It fit perfect.  I also relocated my oil filter to a
higher spot.  Here's the pictures.  BOTC (tent trailer in tow) here I
come!
