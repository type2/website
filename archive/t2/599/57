within 10% of what I said, give or take.   where do you live. the type of
driving you do has a bigger effect on a bus than most vehicles merely
because of it's weight and flat frontal area.

I have to admit my numbers are lower than most but I live in the center of
a major city, seems like all I do is stop and start...I probably hit more
traffic lights in a week than most drivers on this list catch in a year.
throw in an automatic tranny and a heavier than average bus and well I
consider 17-18 good mileage
