Subject: Spyware (OT) WAS: Experiment, water inj

THIS IS OFF TOPIC, PLEASE REPLY TO ME ONLY

I should have been a bit more clear. Phil found this really
interesting website on water injection, and was kind enough to share.

http://www.rallycars.com/Cars/WaterInjection.html

When I went to the site, it tried to install some spyware. This isn't
Phil's fault, but being a tech I get a little torqued when I find
sites that do that crap. Hence my snap e-mail.

If you want to view the information, go ahead and go to the site, but
when a box pops asking to install something, click NO.

Here's a screen grab of the box that comes up:

Just click NO and you're fine. I hope I didn't panic anybody, or get
anybody mad at Phil...
