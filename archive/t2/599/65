Subject: Simple canvas patching solution?

Somewhere between replacing the whole pop-top canvas or putting a bunch 
of duct tape on the rip.

This old 84 Westy has a horizontal rip in the canvas on one side. 
Probably due to being caught up in the raise-lower struts at one time. 
The rip is about 16'' long.

I could duct tape it over. But that's too weenie. I could buy a whole 
new canvas, but the rest of the canvas is in good shape and that's too 
expensive anyway. I could use contact cement and some fabric? Or if I 
found some old seaman, learn how to patch sails with needle and thread. 
Possibly too ambitious.

So . . . suggestions sought and appreciated!
