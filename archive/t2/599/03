Subject: Junk Yards- NE Florida/SE Georgia

Hey Everyone,

I am looking for the front headliner section (wood) of from a Westy Baywindow
and the front kick panels.  I am willing to use them as a template to make a
set or, if possible, find a nice set to use in my bus.

I'm in NE Florida and heard about a junk yard near Bruinswick Georgia... Does
anyone know where I might find a junked Westy in this area?

Thanks,

Tom
