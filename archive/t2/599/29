Subject: Hole burnt in head

Hello everyone.  I just finished a 3000km trip in my VW.  For the most part
everything went great but near the end trip I lost power while going up a
hill. I stopped and looked and after about half an hour I found a hole in
the cylinder head.  It is about 1 cm from the spark plug on the number 3
cylinder.  About a week before my trip I could hear a little leak but could
not pin point it.  Now the hole is big enough to fit a pencil in, easier to
find :-).  I already have the tin off and tonight I'm going to swap the head
with another one I have.  I'm just wondering if any one has an idea of what
might have been the cause of this.  I don't want to burn another head.  I'll
post a pic once I get the head out.
