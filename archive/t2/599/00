80 PSI Add oil 125, this tell you that you have
problems with the rings or piston on that cylinder.
you could pull the engine and just do that side of the
engine, or take all the P/L off and put a new set of
rings on them and go for another 50-100K. Also while
the engine is out rebuild the hyd lifters.  Phil
