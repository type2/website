Subject: Hitch prototype is now a hitch!

I got the hitch back from the welder yesterday.  It looks great.  The hardest part of the installation was threading the M 10 (1.5)
bolts into the 33 years of crud in the threads if the holes in the frame. It fit perfect.  I also relocated my oil filter to a
higher spot.  Here's the pictures.  BOTC (tent trailer in tow) here I come!
