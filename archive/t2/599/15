"Does anyone have a picture of the proper place to tap in a vacuum port to a
set of solex carbs that does not have this port, so that a vacuum advance
distributor can be run? Carbs like these:

I was under the impression that the ports were already there for a sigle
port vacum advance distributor, as shown in the pics (plugged with rubber
stoppers in the pic). I plan to buy a set of these myself, and I have the
009 dizzy, so vacum isn't an issue immediatley, but I would like to know I
can switch to vacum if I want to.
