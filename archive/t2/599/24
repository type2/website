Subject: RE: [T2] vacuum port on carb

I will let the list know how they perform if my friend decides to pick up a
set. We are still deciding between the 34mm solex and the 40mm kadrons with
the port added. The 40's would be nice to have, but the cost may be to much.

Does the list have a preference on carb size? I know 34 is close to stock, is
going with a 40mm carb worth the extra $$?

"Well I do KNOW that mine have a vacuum port. Now what I cannot say is
how that vacuum signal will perform on a type 4 engine. Now that I
think about it, both carbs have a vacuum connection. The passenger
side one has a different signal style than the other. If you pick up
the set, please report to the list on how they perform."
