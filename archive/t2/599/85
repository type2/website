Subject: Too Much Steering Wheel Play

Hey Guys,

My steering is really loose!  I had a friend slowly turn the wheel while I
watched the steering box, drag link, etc...

The Steering wheel seems to turn 3-4 inches either way before the steering box
engages.

The Bentley mentions removing the drag link and drop arm to adjust.  Is this
really nessesary?  Or has anyone adjusted the screw with these in place?

And, does this sound like a Worm and roller steering issue?

Thanks,

Tom
