Subject: Re: [T2] intake leaks?

Colby,

There is much advice on this in the archives, but there are also a lot 
of arguments about the best procedure. The first thing you're going to 
have to do is to tell us (1) the year of your bus and (2) whether it is 
fuel injected or carburated. From your question, I assume that you have 
fuel injection. But it will save us some time to know that for certain.

(3) It will also help to know whether you are willing to spring $25 or 
so for a vacuum gauge.
