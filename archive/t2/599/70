Subject: Re: [T2] Simple canvas patching solution?

1) Good luck getting a 16" long iron-on patch!

2) Iron-on patches aren't permanent. They're meant to get you through a 
couple more wearings and washings of your favorite jeans. To last, they 
have to be stitched.

3) See my instructions in a prior message.
