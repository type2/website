Subject: Luggage rack holes

I finally climbed up on top of our new-to-us 84 Westy to see how the 
luggage rack "works." I found five 1/2'' diameter holes in the recess, 
one in each corner and one center-front. This can't be right -- 
rainwater will pool in the luggage rack recess and drain right above the 
headliner above the front seats I reckon. Or am I mistaken? -- are those 
deliberate drain holes with secret outlets somewhere?
