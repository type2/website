Now I am a big fan of dual, dual throat carbs, after I used to run the 34
FRD Dellorto single throats on my 1835 (as we discussed last October when
they had the new FRD setup for T4 on ebay), then I switched to the dual
Dellorto DRLA 36's (one throat per cylinder), big difference in
seat-of-the-pants-power, 3x the venturi cross sectional area and thats just
with 30mm main venturis (x4) compared to the 27mm (x2) from the FRD's.
DRLA's are comparable in design and performance to Weber IDF's but I have
heard some prefer used Dells over new IDFs.  Yes they have a vacuum port (my
driver's side carb has one), John at aircooled.net says for his new SVDA
distributors you need to tap 2 cylinders worth of vacuum but I haven't
measured it myself and I don't yet have myself an SVDA, I am using a 205 E.

If you think you like playing with carbs, if you think you would appreciate
the power, get some used DRLA's, they hold up well, they have bulletproof
ball bearing throttle shafts, the carbs are easy to rebuild and tune, and
they kick ass!  A good set will cost $300-400 including linkage off of
thesamba, or you can get the carbs raw off ebay and buy the
linkage/manifolds from CB performance.

Single throats will get you down the road reliably, but having run both I
appreciate the extra wide-open power of the dual throats.  By the way, I
have a good set of FRD 34 "Baby Dells" and manifolds for sale for a DP Type
1, lots of extra jets, new CB hex linkage, and partial rebuild kits, bolt
them on and go, will bring them to HCBF if anyone is interested!  Would be
awesome on a 1600 DP and sufficient on a 1776/1835, see above.

happy carburating!
