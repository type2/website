Sounds like you're on your way! Congrats! 

No real suggestions other than just replace anything that has to be
replaced with the engine out so you don't have to take it out again
anytime soon... Double check and/or replace your motor and tranny
mounts too. Those make a world of difference in how the bus feels when
the engine is running.

I agree about the lack of predators. The list is more about helping
each other, not taking advantage of each other. If this was a Porsche
list... ;-)
