Subject: rear wheel play? 

Afternoon

While replacing the CV"s on my 74 bus last week, I noticed play in both
rear wheels - when spun, they don't have any rumble or noise. When rocked
side-to-side (hands at 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock), no play whatsoever. 

BUT, with hands at 12 and 6, there is noticeable play on both sides, both
wheels feel the same. 

Do I need to worry about this? I'm leaving on a trip soon. Wheel bearing
failure imminent??
