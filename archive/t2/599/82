Marcus, are you saying that there were 2 different OEM hitches available?
I'm having trouble imagining how those bottom holes could be utilized as
any metal extending to them would make the bumper brackets no longer fit.
And if they could fit I would assume that new longer bolts would be
required for those bottom holes. Perhaps this beafier hitch was only
available in later years? Here are some pictures I took for Jamie of my
OEM hitch on my '71: http://la.znet.com/~maryaedson/VWhitch/

This email has been rejected twice because of too much quoted material so
I guess I'll need to put in a bunch of blank lines to pass muster.
