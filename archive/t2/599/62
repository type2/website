That doesn't look right. I did my driver's side last Fall (p-side on
shelf awaiting inspiration) and it had a firm corner for the spot you
photographed. I'm presuming that you're putting the driver's side seal
on the driver's side door. Perhaps the seals have changed since last
year. Barring that, you may need to verify that the seal in hand is the
correct year/side for your application.
