Subject: Pulley

There's a couple of different issues going on here.

First, as the bolt starts to work loose, oil will begin to leak. When the
bolt falls out completely, oil will pour out of the bolt hole. This oil
would likely end up on the exhaust, being a possible source of the smoke.
How much oil was still in the engine when you stopped?

Second, the pulley will not necessarily come off as soon as the bolt comes
out. The woodruff key will continue to drive the pulley as long as the
pulley remains on the crankshaft. So the pulley itself may not have come off
until near the time you stopped. Mine did not come off at all. Luckily I
spotted it before I lost much oil.

So the amount of engine damage sustained will depend on whether the primary
problem was oil starvation or cooling air starvation. If you ran it out of
oil, the situation will be more serious than not having cooling air if you
were in a very cold environment.

it's the smoke in the mirrors that worries me about this scenario.

which idiot light came on, by the way? the "GEN" light should have come on
as soon as the pulley/fan stopped turning.

if you had the OIL light come on after 3 miles of no fan, i am afraid that
chances are good the engine has been severely overheated. this would also
imply the GEN light was not working properly.
