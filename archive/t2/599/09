In general got to watch for items getting into the cooling area. Just
inherited a free Type 4 core that burnt up because someone dropped a spark
plug that lodged between cylinders 3 and 4, causing the cylinders to receive
insufficient cooling air between them.

I don't know of any adjustment. When mine did this, the wire connector had
come off the cold start valve. You've either got a problem with the cold
start valve, thermal time switch, or temp sensor. Until you can trouble
shoot it, I was able to just squirt a shot of carb cleaner into the air
distribution plenum to compensate before starting.

that for hydraulic valve lifters...all you need do is adjust them for zero
clearance and then 2 more turns clockwise and then lock them down with the
nut. Is this right? Tighten them? sounds odd to me. I have not driven it
since adjustment...just moved the van to another spot. Sounded noisy and
then quieted down some. I don;t think it is as quiet as it was after the
rebuild. Anyone have any experience with this?

Most recommend this be changed to only 1 more turn clockwise to allow more
valve
contact with the seat to avoid burnt valves.

Do a completed auctions search on ebay. 700 pounds is surely less than
$1500. Bay window westies in good shape do a minimum of $3500, often much
more.
