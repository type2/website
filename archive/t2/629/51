Subject: What kind of ignition coil do I need?

Hi - 
 
I have an 81 Vanagon that was originally CA emissions.  Following the advice of the Bus Depot, I've replaced the exhaust system with the 49 state exhaust and run a new oxygen sensor into the crossover pipe.
 
I think the ignition coil is bad.  Do I have to stick with a CA one, or can I switch to a 49 state one (which the store right down the street has and I can get today...)
 
Thanks for any help.
 
Marc
