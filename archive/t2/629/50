There are dual solex carb rigs for sale about $350-ish for your bus.
They'll be better than your Weber, hands down.

If you want to go back to stock, I have a nearly complete PDSIT kit
with air cleaner and manifolds and most of the linkage, but the carbs
need rebuilt. I'm still running mine on my 73 and am mostly happy with
them. The electric chokes are nice on chilly mornings, and the short
intakes warm up pretty quick as opposed to the loooong runners in a
single carb setup.
