=D

Total cost:

Fabric - $1yd clearance at WalMart (bought all they had of this stuff,
about 7 yards)
Wood - $6 full sheet
Glue - $3 big tube

Plus reusable tools and such.

Comment about this fabric. It appears to be a good solid upholstery
fabric, but it's oddly susceptible to snags and runs. Really wierd.
It's like a herculon, but wimpier.

Sure looks nice though. heh
