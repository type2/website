Subject: Bus sighting

I saw a movie last night.  "The Year that Trembled" is about kids 
growing up in Ohio (think Kent State) during the late sixties/early 
seventies.

It starred a splittie of unknown vintage (maybe some aficionado on the 
vintage bus list would know), but I also saw a Karmann Ghia convertible 
in the background, too.

What's the perfect automobile?
Nothing more than you really need.
What it takes to get you where you want to go.
Volkswagen Type 2.
