Check out the engine numbers. This will clear things
up. It is stamped in the fan housing. But since the
fan housing can be swapped with another engine they
also stamped the number in the case. You can find it
on top of the engine near de fan housing. on the part
where the two case halves are joined together. It is a
place usually covered in a thick layer of oil and
dust.

The letters in front of the engine nr tell what type
it is. The number can give an I dea of the period it
was built in:

GE = 2000cc engine with FI

31-dec-1977 = GE 019 988
31-dec-1978 = GE 039 331
31-dec-1978 = GE 049 407

De 1800 engines have a number that starts with 'AP',
'AW' or 'ED' depending on the export market en exhaust
gas regulations.

The older the tranny is the harder it is. From about
1973 they started to use a number that is date
related. It is stamped on the lower edge of the tranny
on the passenger side of the bus. For example:

  CP 05 09 8

'CP' is the code for a 4-speed manual tranny for a
2000cc engine.

'05 09 8' is the production dat:

5th of september 1978 (the other way around as the USA
system of dating :-)
