If I had to buy another one I would get one with a dial.  this makes it
easier to measure advance for pulleys with no degrees, and for other cars
besides VWs (such as my old BMWs).  I got mine used (Sunco I think) from a
listee for $30.  the desired one is similar to the craftsman with advance,
retails for $70.
