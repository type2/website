Subject: weber progressive

hey,

ive got a 72 bus w/pancake engine, i believe its 1700.  anyway, its got a 
weber progressive carb on it.  im discouraged because i took it in to the 
doctor and after 400 dollars it runs worse than it has.  symptoms are: wont 
idle steady, stalls out all the time if there is any nip to the air and wont 
accelerate like it use to.  my question is "is there anything i can do to 
this setup to get it drivable during the winter months".  if not, which is 
what ive heard elsewhere,  what carb set up is the best for it?  are the 
dual kadrons from low bugget a good investment?  will this get me on the 
road on real cold days?

any ideas would be great,
thanx,
patrick
