Subject: Horn Wire

Hi Volks- I am having a bear of a time attaching the horn ground wire to
the spade coupler above the steering box. I tried sliding the inside
cover plate up the steering column but it won't budge after the screws
are removed. Anyone have any tips, tricks, or magic that I can use to
get the wire attached so my horn works. TIA TBear

Don't take life to seriously- you'll never live though it....
