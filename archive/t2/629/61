More likely so that the information could be added to a database sold to
others who hawk automotive parts.  The computer has fields for the info,
it won't accept the transaction unless the fields are filled, so the sales
drone insists that you fill them in!

Just tell him  that the tires are for a '57 Borgward!  :)
