...... magic that I can use to
get the wire attached so my horn works. TIA TBear

If you find the magic and get it attached, and the horn still doesn't work, 
you can consider using a marine horn that runs from a cannister of 
compressed gas....available for 5-6 dollars at most hardware stores 
anywhere near a recreational body of water. They come in several sizes, all 
hand-held and very portable. I seldom (never?) use a horn, but it is a 
requirement to keep the bus street legal. I keep it in the space below the 
driver seat.
