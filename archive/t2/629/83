Sounds like you're way too lean, or you've got vacuum leaks. Or both!

Grab a spray bottle of water, carb cleaner, or if you're brave an
unlit propane torch, and spray around all the intake boots, vacuum
lines, etc and see if there's a change in the idle. If there is,
you've found a leak.

If after all that you've not found anything, try backing the mixture
screw out 1/2 turn at a time until the engine idles without having the
choke closed. Then adjust per the manuals out there...
