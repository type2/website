Subject: speaking of backups...

A third bus and potential dual redundant set of back up parts has 
wandered into my life. What are my issues stripping/keeping a 76 as the 
backup for my 78 project? It seems a mid-year 76 change of some 
significance has wandered in and out of my mind the last little while.

Once again, thanks for the help in advance,

jack
