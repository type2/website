Robert
I specifically like the Caframo 9200 heater,, I am sure there are others with
the same features...

I was looking for :
small
quiet
low profile
many heat settings ...it helps when your circuit only holds 1000 watts and you
try to plug in a 1500 watt heater
cheap.

I like this one, but it wasn't the smallest,,or the cheapest... I know this
company makes a good product ,, so I spent the extra few dollars and I love it!
The 600/900/1500 Watts setting comes in very handy if you are on a power circuit
that is somewhat overloaded... you can select the 600 setting and not trip the
breaker.
Sometimes we camp with too many on one circuit at a time,, this feature makes
the difference.
