Subject: Re: [T2] space heater-get squirrel cage fan!

Look for a heater with a squirrel cage fan (quietest and most even air
pushed, as flat blade fans must run faster (noisy) and have a center
dead spot) so you get too much draft with the heat. See the links below.
It should also have the ability to blow the air UP at you or you get
roasted feet when it is in front of the seatbed in your bus. It should
be safe if tipped and have no glowing coils visible to ignite something
that may fall into it, not just against it (ie, ceramic).  I like the
folding Kozy_World I got 4 of at Camping World years ago (nice small
foot print), but I don't see it on their web site. There are other
examples, opined at Epinions.com
Example- the Lakewood heaters- easy to lube the motor, quietest
