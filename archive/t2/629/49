Hola Roberto!,

More than likely, as Karl has already mentioned, your hose is probably OK.  
The part to be replaced is the rubber sleeve which fits onto the upper 
reservoir.  It seals the hose to the reservoir.  When I pulled  mine apart I could 
hardly tell that a sleeve had been there.  It had deteriorated that much.

As it turned out, I did have to replace my hose.  It was ready to go.  It had 
cracks appearing at a couple of the bend points.  This hose is difficult to 
find a replacement for.  It is not available (as far as I know) in the 
aftermarket.  I wound up going to a hydraulics shop and buying a piece of acid 
resistant hosing.  The counterman said it would be perfect for use with brake fluid 
(a very corrosive substance).  You might consider that if you do wind up 
replacing that hose.  

The nice part of buying a new hose (for me) was that the new hose was just a 
bit smaller diameter than the old one and I did not have to use the sleeve to 
make a good seal to the plastic reservoir.

Good luck.  And, by the way, your English is a lot better than my Spanish!
