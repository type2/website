Subject: Re: [T2] Brake house question

Roberto said: 
 I am helping a friend to fix his 1970 Westfalia, by now he has a problem
with a house that come out of the brake fluid reservoir, just behind the
driver4s kick panel.
The leaking is were the house and the reservoir meets, I presume is due to
the aging proces of the house, the question is if I need a special kind of
house to replace it, I mean brake fluid resistance house or something like
that, or just a piece of plastic house.

I doubt very much that it is the plastic hose [not house :) , you live in a house].
The plastic hose is very strong and long lasting.

However, the 69-70 upper reservoir is a piece of crap.....  The material is wafer thin and 
falls apart with age. 71 and newer upper reservoirs are made of better material. But they are 
square and mounted behind the drivers seat. You will need to move it to the kick panel area.

You will also need a new rubber sleeve to go between the reservoir and tube. Part # 211 611 833C.
