 I've been having alternator and battery problems off
and on since february, 77 Westfalia, recently rebuilt motor.
 
 I'm on my 3rd alternator and 3rd battery, each time
the same symptom of either an alternator light or a
battery that is boiling / out gassing....so far I've
been lucky and no acid spills or fires.
 
 This can't be just an alternator, would it really be
possible to get two bad alternators in a row ?  I'm
getting bosch rebuilt alternator, I've had them tested
each time and they were all bad, putting out >
12volts.  The 1st and current times of failure there
was no alternator light, just a boiling battery.  The
2nd time there was an alternator light and just a dead
battery.
 
 Is it possible that my bus is running so hot that it
is destroying the internal regulator ?  Is there
another component to check ?

Unless you have a 80+ Vanagon, you do NOT have an internal regulator!

Your voltage regulator IS the problem.  It is mounted on the gas tank panel, right side.
