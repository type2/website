Subject: identifying engines and trannys and cleaning and testing out of

Hi,
I just picked up 2 engines and 2 trannys.  I was told that one engine is a 
from a 78 and the other is an 1800, but I'm not so sure about that.  I also 
picked up 2 trannys, but I'm not sure what year they are from.  How can I 
positively identify them?  I want to test the engines out of the bus.  Does 
it matter what year the bellhousing I use is from?
Also, I pulled the valve covers off to have a look since the engines had 
been sitting uncovered for a while.  it seemed like the oil had taken on the 
consistency of butter at room temp and was stuck to everything real thick, 
but I could wipe it off pretty easy and it looked clean underneath.  Is 
there any easy way to clean this up?  Can I just clean the easily accesible 
stuff and then add something to the oil to clean it and then change the oil, 
and then change it frequently for a while, or do I need to dissassemble 
everything.
Thanks,
Kyle
