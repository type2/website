Subject: RE: [T2] Ignition barrell sticking

FWIW, i don't think the instructions referenced in the link are for 68-69
bays either.

i have 211 905 889 ignition housing. i believe, but have been unable to
officially verify, that this part number applies to 68-69 bays. the lock
cylinder (13l 100) that came out of it was verified by a locksmith to be
from an early bay. (thanks Steve!)

to remove the cylinder from this housing, there is a hole right on the back
to insert something to depress the spring. its in plain view, so no
contortionism is required.

also, just for the info from what i have been able to tell the housing part
# 211 905 887D is for
71-74 1/2.

good luck,
