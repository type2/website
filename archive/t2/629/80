Subject: Cheapo gas analyzers

A friend of mine bought a gas analyzer from eBay and brought it over to try
on my bus before he tries it on his car.

It turned out to be a Hawk model from JC Whitney back in the 70s. I believe
it "works" on the same priciple as the Heathkit testers that are on eBay:
there is a wheatstone bridge inside and the reference resistor is replaced
by a thermo electric cell that consists of two termistors than measures the
electrical conductivity of the exhaust. The state of unbalance is recorded
on the dial which is calibrated in %CO and AFR.

Anyway, I'd heard how inaccurate these testers are and managed to stave off
an expensive and worthless purchase last year but I thought I'd report what
I actually saw on this unit.

We warmed up the car (consistent exhust temp), calibrated the unit and sure
enough after following the instructions I could barely get the needle to
budge as I leaned out the engine or made it richer. I could hear the changes
from the engine but couldn't witness any repsonse from the meter. It was
reading 4-5% while the engine is at 2-2.5%. I pulled the vacuum hoses off
and made the engine stumble and the needle still didn't do anything.

Avoid the urge to get one of these items because they are only a novelty.
It's amazing to me that the Heathkit testers sell for over $100 sometimes.
