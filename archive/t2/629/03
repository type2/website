I have an older Craftsman timing light and I like it (not as nice as  
this one; mine's plastic, this one appears to have metal housing).   
That is to say, it does precisely what a timing light should do,  
nothing more, nothing less.  Simple tools that do the job are the best  
tools, IMO :-)

If you're working on a VW, you really don't need one of those "fancy"  
timing lights.  Actually, even if you're not working on a VW, you don't  
really need the fancy one, either.

Sears seems to be a good place to get basic automotive tools.  I was  
stunned a while back when I went by the local Kragen (just about the  
only FLAPS you can find in San Francisco) and discovered that they  
didn't carry any timing lights that cost less than $80!  "BZZT!"
