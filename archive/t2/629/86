 So has anyone else experienced this ? I got my new Gas Adjust shocks 
this week and I went out today and pulled the old fronts off, now the 
front one have a metal insert in the top bushing and NO insert in the 
bottom bushing as there is a metal sleeve on the bolt attached to the 
 bus. Upon pulling out the new KYBs I find a metal insert in BOTH 
bushings ... so the top bolt will fit nicely but the bottom wont go on 
without removing this metal insert.

I believe you will find that the metal sleeve on the bolt is your old metal bushing
from your old shock. You need to remove that old sleeve......
