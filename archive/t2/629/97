Subject: re pulling drag link end with magical puller tool

I got my new Bugpack tie rod end puller and the wretched drag link end popped
out in seconds! I replaced the torn boot with a new urethane tie rod end boot,
and greased it. This tool is very strong!  Expensive though...but a necessity
for us Vdub owners.
