Subject: Re: [T2] Timing light suggestions?

Hello Guys   I use mine everyday and  on a lot of what we work on we have to 
have one that advances and reads rpm  . Being in a shop requires us to use the 
best  I have a fancy one from Snap-on and wouldnt trade it for the world..  
Now I know on a regular vw motor it's not  needed to show RPM but try timing a 
914  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
