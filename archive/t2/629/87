Hiya Ted,

I'm not sure what year you have but this works (I've done it a couple of 
times now) on my 70 Bus.  Loosen the bolts holding on the floor plate and take 
them out.  Loosen the the turn signal switch.  Make sure your ignition is not 
locking the steering.  

Now grab the steering column outer tube and twist in a counter clockwise 
direction about 45 degrees.  If you cannot rotate the steering column tube, it is 
likely binding on the rubber steering column support grommet.  Try shooting a 
little Simple Green (or some other really slick stuff) down the outside of the 
tube as it enters the steering column support bracket.  If you can manage to 
turn the steering column  this will rotate the spade connector to a point at 
which you will be able to make the connection.  

Still not easy to get to the spade connector but at least it's do-able.
