Subject: Brake house question

Hello Volks

I am helping a friend to fix his 1970 Westfalia, by now he has a problem
with a house that come out of the brake fluid reservoir, just behind the
driver4s kick panel.
The leaking is were the house and the reservoir meets, I presume is due to
the aging proces of the house, the question is if I need a special kind of
house to replace it, I mean brake fluid resistance house or something like
that, or just a piece of plastic house.

One more time thanks in advance to the list.

P/D Today my back yard looks likes a happy man4s back yard, a 1977
Westfalia, a 1970 Westfalia, a 1965 Beetle deluxe and a 1958 Karmann Ghia
(project), nothing but german toys.
