Growing up attending auctions regularly with my Grandpa, this story
was also a hoot: http://www.type2.com/~keen/charlie/dodge

Sounds like the shrill voiced auctioneer needed some of that new WD-40 throat spray... 

I've got a cheap inductive light bought at a FLAPS. Been working good since the mid-90's. Admittedly I don't use it more than a couple times a year. I'd like to have a light with adjustable advance... 

See ya!
