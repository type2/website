George,

Thanks for your reply.

I will be taking the bus in for repairs.  The rebuilder ordered a 
remachined slider gear and will be putting it in.  He usually deals 
with buggies and rails, and of course, those are a lot easier to work 
with as far as working on the tranny.  He had hoped that I would bring 
the tranny in and deal with the R&R myself, but I don't want to chance 
putting in another bad tranny.  It was a major ordeal for me to do 
that.
