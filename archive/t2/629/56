Subject: Ignition barrell sticking 

All,

71 Westy: Sometimes when I turn off the ignition and remove the key the barrel
sticks  (Buzzer sounds) and doesn't release (pop out) I have to put the key
back in and work it.

Anyone ever had this happen and is there a fix? I'm thinking it's not an easy
fix.....

Thanks,
