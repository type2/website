Subject: 1972 Turn Signal...

Good Day everyone,

 

I am an electrical newbie and can't find any info on this.

 

I have a 1972 Wesfalia and the turn signal broke (the device on the steering
colum).  I have purchased an aftermarket turn signal, which came with a
wiring diagram and new harness.  My problem is I'm not sure what the
original wires are on the harness.  Left, Right, Dimmer.

 

Anyone have a diagram specific to the 1972 turn signal harness?

 

Thank-you in advance!

 

Nick

1972 Westy
