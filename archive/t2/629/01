Subject: Timing light suggestions?

I'm looking to buy a timing light and would like product suggestions. 
An indication of price range vs. (useless?) features would also help.

Quick search of type2 shows a picture of a inductive one, which I
expect is the modern common denominator and necessary without having
to spelunk the tin.

Growing up attending auctions regularly with my Grandpa, this story
was also a hoot:

Thanks in advance,
