Latest update.
Bill had major stroke early Sat. morning (between 2 and 7 as far as we can
figure) and hemorrhaging in the brain. The prognosis for a life is nil. We
(Ely Becca and I) have taken him off all support which is what he would have
wanted. His new phone number is 505-521-5336. Ely and Becca here with me.
Very sad to see our tree falling. He's heavily dosed on morphine, can't
speak anyway and not sure what he can hear. Paralyzed throughout. Your love
and worry are most appreciated. Will be in contact again when I can. It's
been  3 weeks of hell with a few more coming. Thank you...Janet

Melissa...Let me know when truck is coming in. I may need you to store my
stuff for several days.
