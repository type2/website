Well, not really a big surprise but you guys were on the money, that 
thing was practically welded on there, it seriously looked like it was 
designed as a part of the bus, I had to smack it a bunch of times with 
my mallet and then wiggle like crazy with my vice grips for it to come 
off ! But, in the end she came off. Everything else went perfectly 
according to plan after that. Took her for a spin, what a difference ! 
Wow is all I can say. Tomorrow I will put on my Whiteline swaybars and 
see how she feels after that.

Thanks again for the help.

Steve
