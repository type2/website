As I implied before, the secret is to make sure the transhaft is 
PARALLEL to the rolling jack with engine on it.  For an early Van, 
jacking up the rear and dropping the engine to parallel the ground 
works. For the later van, I get the rear high enough for the engine to 
clear the apron and jack up the front also to be parallel. Best is to 
lower both tranny and engine and separate later or mate before install.

about any
  kind of jack. I used a motorcycle jack and had no problems. The reverse is
  not true, because the motorcycle jack doesn't have any tilt to it, just
  holds the motor parallel to the ground, so it requires either a trans type
  of jack with tilt-ability or a lot of heft .....
