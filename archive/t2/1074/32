Subject: Re: [T2] Lifting an engine with pulleys

The last time I was faced with this, I bolted my engine stand to the engine
then tied an 8 foot long 2X4 to it with baling wire, used the 2X4 for leverage
to tilt the stand up onto its wheels. Had to think a bit, but the rest was
easy!

I have a really big rafter in my
garage and
I was wondering if I can make a pulley system to
lift my engine off of the
floor jack on to my engine
stand.  More importantly, where can I attach some
rope
to the engine?  I noticed that there's a hole in the
case near the
breather and another near the engine/tranny
mating surface - can those holes
support the weight of a
built up engine (without exhaust)?  Are they there for
lifting purposes?
