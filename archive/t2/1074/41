Subject: Solo engine removal idea

I have been wondering about a similar thing, but using an A frame
mounted to the bus itself to crane the engine. I have a roof rack that
consists of a pair of beams that go across the roof, mounted at the
rain gutters. I can move these so they are four or so feet apart, and
would have the a frame rest under the front beam and over the rear,
hinged so the apex of the A hangs out far enough from the back of the
bus so it would be a place to mount a come along that would clear the
rear hatch. A friend thinks I'll fail at the rain gutters, but they
are solid, and they are where the roof rack was mounted in the first
place. I could give this idea a meaningful test with a trip to the
lumber yard for a couple of long enough 2x4's and chin myself up from
them, I weigh around 220 and iirc that is in the neighborhood of what
the engine scales out at. A really big rafter in a garage is something
I wouldn't even think twice about for something like this. If I had a
garage...

This is a great list, and hopefully my first post to it isn't beyond
the pale stupid...

Thanks,

Adam
