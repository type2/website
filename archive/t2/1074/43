Subject: "Sprint" air cleaner - need filter - Weber progressive

I took a suggestion from several years ago from this list and put a 
"Sprint"  air cleaner  (round, black plastic) on my weber progressive 
and cobbed together a preheating duct.  Good news?  It works great;  
really eliminates the perpetual carb icing problem.  Bad news?  I got it 
originally  from Pierce Manifolds and they don't seem to carry it 
anymore.   Anyone know where I might find one?  Or have info on a 
readily available substitute?

Thanks.
