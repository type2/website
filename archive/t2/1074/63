Lots of dirt coming out of your tank? You can remove it and have a 
radiator "boil it out". Cheap here.

Yeah, check it out and then if you don't need the vehicle for a while you can 
pull the engine and rebuild slowly. Nice not having a deadline. Just don't 
forget to take lots of pictures because if you go too slowly how to put it 
back together might not be obvious. Lots of little paper or plastic bags 
marked with the names of the contents would be good too. 

Also a great time to paint the engine compartment and do other maintenance.
