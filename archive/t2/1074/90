Folks,

I just looked for a type 4 replacement thermostat and taking  
Richard's advice searched for the FI beetle variety (p/n 043 ...). I  
found this: https://www2.cip1.com/ProductDetails.asp? 
ProductCode=VWC-043-119-159

This thing does not have bellows, but rather a spring (check out the  
picure on their website). Seems like it is less likely to failure,  
but will it work as a type 4 upgrade just like the bellows type 1 does?

Marcus
