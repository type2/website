Subject: Side Tent Identification

Volks,

It must be summer camping and bus driving time because I'm sending a lot
of messages to the list!

I'm considering the purchase of a side tent for my buses - mostly because the
price is right and I'd love to have one.  I haven't seen it in person yet,
but this is the picture I was sent of it:

The brand is Herzog and it's German made.  

Does anyone know anything about this type of tent?  My initial thought is that
it doesn't look particularly weather proof (more of a shade/bug-free tent) and
according to the owner, he doesn't think there's a rain fly that goes on it, but
maybe I'm missing something.  

Any info or experiences would be helpful.

Thanks again...
   Tom
