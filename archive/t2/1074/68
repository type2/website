Subject: Engine drone noise news.

I noticed the other day that the non-walk thru partition is rather resonant.
Should have noticed this long ago. (DOH!) Tonight I installed 
instrumentation
to measure resonant frequency and damping. As part of the experiment I also
installed a stiffener across the top of the partition using a 45" long
aluminum angle 2-1/2 x 1-1/2 x .25 inches. It was bolted on using 4 of the 5
threaded inserts. Not sure if all partitions have this, as I have a delivery
bus. The bar is not long enough to go all the way across, needs about 
another
8 inches. The back side of the spare tire well is covered with Damplifier 
Pro
and the side panels are covered in "brown bread" dampener. My spare tire is
not installed in the well at this time. Instrumentation consists of a 
Crossbow
accellerometer and an aged Tek O'scope.

Results without the stiffener:
Center of the top of the partition, 40-41 hz, damps out in about .4 seconds.
Center of the spare tire well, no spare tire. 285 hz, damps out in about .05
seconds.
Side panels: various frequencies from 100-750 hz. damps out in about .1 sec.

With the stiffener installed:
Center of the top of the partition, 47hz, damps out in about .27 seconds.
spare tire well and side panels, no apreciable change.

There is a definite decrease in the overall noise that I hear when thumping
this panel with the stiffener installed.

I will install the spare tire tomorrow and see what that does. Right now I'm
guessing that this panel is the main source of the droning noise. If I can
raise the resonant frequency, maybe the drone will wait until 65 or 70mph to
become so annoying rather than 60.

PS. Sorry if this is the second post. Wasn't sure if it went thru the first 
time.
