Sounds like what I used to have with my weber progressive. In my case it
was the old favourite of long, cold manifolds condensing the fuel out on
the way to the cylinders. I fixed it by making up a contraption with an
air filter off a Mazda to feed warm air into the carb. I'm sure I've
described it before if you look for my earlier posts. Others have done
similar fixes.
