Subject: 1978 Bus Dash Removal

Hello Everyone,

It's been a while but we are starting to get some long over due work done on
"Melissa".

Anyhow, we would like to replace the dash (the current one is very rusty due
to bad window seal and typical under the window rust). We have found a real
nice donor at a scrap yard - but I have a couple questions for the experts
here :)

1st: Does anyone know of a nice online guide for dash removal? I've been
looking around but can't seem to find anything

2nd: I'm not sure the year of the donor - our bus is a '78 and the donor
(based on the turning signal placement) is of the same era but I'm not sure
if it's the same exact year. Will this matter? I'm not aware of any
differences but one never knows.

Thanks in advance for any wisdom or advice - it's greatly appreciated.

Jeff & Patty
'78 "Melissa"
