Subject: Friendly Bus sightings in Sacramento!

Hi Volks:

I've had a few friendly bus sightings near my house and work this week 
and wonder if any of them are on this list:
78 Westy formerly sage green newly painted nice blue - Davis
Sage Green 78 Westy with Yakima or Thule Racks, either very clean or 
newly painted, Tahoe Park 65th and in Curtis Park/ Land Park areas.  
Same van, always waves and toots.
Nice blue and white repainted 70's Transporter 14th Ave, every morning 
on my commute.
Rust colored early 60's Late 50's Splittie Dual Cab with OEM Canvas bed 
cover and frame- Oak Park East Sac.

Just saying hi back!

BEN
