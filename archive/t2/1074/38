AT LEAST find a RUSTY bus with no driveline. 

That passenger door is WAY better than the one on my keeper bus. Got a dent to 
fix and a little rust at the bottom. Wish I had a better one. 

Are '68 through '79 doors the same?

Just bugs me to watch good parts like that wasted. At least the Jalopnik forum 
had alot of folks unhappy about the crushing.
