Subject: Re: ramps for engine removal

Seriously? I'd have thought the weight of engine and trans together
would make it really unwieldy; I assumed I'd take the engine out, swap
transmissions, and replace the engine. Making a set of ramps still
sounds good if it improves access to anything. I can get under the bus
easily but there is not much room to swing a wrench under there as
is...
