I did a search on McMaster and could only find a 1/2-13 to 8mm-1.25. Try

Yes a very odd one, the only reason I know it exists at all is that I  
had two others that I installed ;)  I just got finished splitting the  
case and will just be taking it in to the shop to have it repaired.  
Sucks, but there seemed to be no good solution that was not a  
temporary fix.  We shall see.
