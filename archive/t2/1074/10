As previously mentioned:

	The gauges don't look too flash as I compressed the pic to a 
truly skinny 36K.  They're (from L) inlet manifold vacuum, oil P, cyl 
head T (analogue, the sort of thing you get from aircraftspruce).

	This position on top of the dash in front of the steering 
wheel minimises deviation of sight from normal driving line-of-sight 
& focus distance.
	General list to starb'd is due to my being in the S. 
Hemisphere  -  and in a RH-drive camper.
	Tilts (yaw & pitch) should be carefully adjusted wrt 
reflections in windscreen, before you finally lash down the panel 
with a scrap of bicycle innertube going down thru the screen heater 
vents (which are not seriously obstructed thereby).
	The 'sunshade' on top is worthwhile (a scrap of Corflute) to 
minimise stray light to & from the gauges.

	check
	and that means you can save the money entailed in 
thermocouple wire all the way; just change to ornery wire in a 
relatively stable-T place near the rear.
