Subject: Re: [T2] Lifting an engine with pulleys

Hi Mike,

I have such a beam in my garage; last time I assembled an engine I used 
a "come-along" to lift it off the bench and when it was time to get it 
off the table I just lifted it up, pulled the table out from under it 
and then slowly lowered it to the floor.

That was a complete 1.7 fully assembled with FI and exhaust. The holes 
can indeed support the weight.


Happy Trails,
