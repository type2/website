Subject: Lifting an engine with pulleys

I have a really big rafter in my garage and I was wondering if I can make a pulley system to lift my engine off of the floor jack on to my engine stand.  More importantly, where can I attach some rope to the engine?  I noticed that there's a hole in the case near the breather and another near the engine/tranny mating surface - can those holes support the weight of a built up engine (without exhaust)?  Are they there for lifting purposes?

Thanks!
Mike
