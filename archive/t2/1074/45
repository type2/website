The lift table is flat on top; the motorcycle jack has a rear part that 
sticks up and limits how far under you can push it, annoying when we 
dropped the trans with the engine.

I use an ATV/Motorcycle jack to remove the engine and the engine
balances on there just fine on its own.  It's nice to have help to
remove the engine but I can get my type IV motor out alone at need
using it.  I've also heard that a hydraulic lifting table is the way
to go; I imagine it's practically identical to using the atv jack.
