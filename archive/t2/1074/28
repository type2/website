Subject: Brake Booster Rebuilder?  Brake Proportioning Valve Reports?

Anyone got a good lead on one?  I'm reassembling my crew cab this weekend
and there's a huge vacuum leak coming from the booster.  Now that I have a
good vacuum connection on the motor, it'd be nice to have assist too.

Booster is off a '73 bus and I'm in the LA area.

I'm installing rear disc brakes soon and I want to install a brake
proportioning valve.  Anybody have some experience with these?  I have a
stock 70s Bus one now, but I think adjustable might be better.


Thanks,
