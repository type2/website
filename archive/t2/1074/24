Subject: Re: [T2] Side Tent Identification

I can't really tell from the photo, but it could be a tent we sold at  
one time.  Herzog usually has good tents,

I would pass on it if it doesn't have poles that run from the front  
to back of the tent.  This makes the tent much more stable.   
Otherwise, it would be difficult to drive away, as it would fall down  
without lots of guy lines holding it up.

I also can't see any roof vents.  The better tents have vents at the  
top on the front and back.  These tents can get very hot and humid  
without the vents.
