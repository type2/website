Subject: Oil tank problems with my '78 bus

Hi,

It seems I am filling fuel filters these days from the bottom of my fuel tank.

It would please me if some where to make suggestions.

Currently, I am testing commpression for an overall service attempt for this problem.

If the compression test reveals a rebuild, then, no I am not putting major work into the vehicle this year.

I would likely pull the engine and attack a rebuild.

Cheers,

Alan
