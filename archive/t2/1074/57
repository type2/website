Subject: Re: [T2] What is this host coming from the brake servo?

Picks up clean, dry air from inside the pillar. When my bus had its conversion work done (brand new) they ran a screw through that hose directly behind the front tire. Driving in rainy weather the servo got a pretty good load of water, then we had a deep freeze. I broke the diaphragm first time I hit the brakes!
