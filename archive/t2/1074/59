for a manual tranny it is more difficult, an automatic tranny bus does
not have the drive shaft that has to go into the clutch.

so an auto tranny does not need anywhere near as much room and doesn't
even have to be perfectly level when going in. the bottom engine bolts
are the longest thing to clear in the install,  of course getting the
three torque converter bolts onto the converter AFTER the engine is
installed makes up for the easier engine install.

so for an auto tranny bus it is I think much easier to put the tranny
and engine in seperately,   besides the lack of distance needed to get
the engine in, the tranny is maybe as heavy or more so than the engine
so you are handling a lot more weight than with a manual.

just one of the minor differences in handling the auto tranny bus.
