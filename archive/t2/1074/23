Subject: FREE Early 70's Westy wardrobe cabinet

I'm cleaning out my shed at home and have the large wardrobe cabinet from an
early 1970's Westy (light wood color) in decent shape. It's free to anyone
who can take it off my hands within the next week or so (the sooner the
better). Otherwise it will probably get tossed. Located in Perkiomenville,
PA. Email me ASAP if interested.
