Subject: Tire sizes

My brother offered me 4 new 15" tires for my Westy. He asked me to give him
the sizes to make sure they were going to be compatible. II was shocked to
find 14" tires on the Westy and 15" on my super beetle. What is the original
size tires for the Westy and the Super?

After reading about what a great place Ithaca is to visit, I looked it up on
line. It does look like a great place to visit!! I'll have to put it on my
list of places to visit on my way out to Quincy Ill.  Thanks for the tip!!
