Subject: re: Solo engine removal

Well, the thing of it is, I will be doing a transmission swap (already
have the spare hopefully good gbox to swap) in the street with at best
the help of my wife. She's pretty sturdy, that's not the diff. It's
doing it in the street with equipment that has to be fairly minimal
due to no garage or other storage that requires a novel approach.

I already have a large floor jack I can gingerly roll the engine out
from under the bus with. It's a '70, and I believe that calls for me
to remove a panel from behind the engine as well as the bumper and
then roll the engine out clear of the bodywork. Being that I have no
workbench, I was going to put the engine in the back while changing
gearboxes, and that was where I got the idea of the crane, to help get
the engine up in the luggage area.

To make for a gentler pull up on the rain gutters at the forward end,
I could clamp the beam at the front end of the A frame at the very
front of the roof and use longer pieces for the A frame. The longer
the arm the less the lever effect... the wife's a lot lighter than I
so she could dangle from it to test it. How much would a 1600 dp
weigh, anyway? Is this move doable by hand by two slightly fit humans,
and the crane just a solution looking for a problem?

Thanks for the replies. I am new in case there's anyone who hadn't guessed...
