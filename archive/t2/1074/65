Primarily because the new seals won't go on without either removing the piece
I asked about or cutting the seal. Other than that, no REAL reason. I just
thought that since I'm restoring the bus, and am replacing all the rubber,
felt and trim on the windows, I'd take the doors off - also, the leading edge
of the passenger door needs work and it makes sense to remove the door.

Anybody else have any guidance?
