Subject: Looking for Odd size Case Saver

Hi,
	I'm hoping someone may either have this laying around, or know of a  
source.  I'm looking for a case saver for my 1776 case.  The catch is  
I am looking for one that is a 1/2"-20 x 8mm-1.25.  I know it exists  
because I have two in my current case, but unfortunately I'm having a  
bugger of a time finding anyone that carries it.
