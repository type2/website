Subject: What is this host coming from the brake servo?

http://calivw78.com/v/parts/unknown/090526_1486_01.jpg.html

It seems like a vacuum line?  And it's very very loose.  The hose comes
from what I believe is the brake servo, and then procedes around the edge
of the front, driver side wheel well, where I then loose track of the
hose.

Here is the pic of where the hose follows the edge of the wheel well.

Any thoughts?
