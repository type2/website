Subject: Purple Bus Siting in Trumansburg, NY

Our trip up to Watkins Glen and Ithaca, NY last weekend was a great 
success with no bus problems and generally smooth sailing.

We saw one type 2 - a late bay pop top with a shiny purple coat of
paint.  Looked very solid and loved. 

We exchanged waves as we passed each other going in opposite directions
and continued on for more backroads, wine touring and exploring.

Cheers,
   Tom

p.s. thanks for all the tips for Ithaca...it was great!  Still trying
to get the valve cover retaining spring out...will report as appropriate.
