Subject: Re: ramps for engine removal

I,m the one who made ramps for his 71 bus (I use storebought ramps for 
the 78 camper; I like the plastic ones with the waffle bottom as they do 
not indent your driveway or road).  The early bus does not really need a 
ramp; it just makes it easier to get to the nuts behind the fan housing 
and when lowering the engine back to level lets it roll without hanging 
up on the bearing or mounting holes.  I did not wire up the tranny if 
lowering just the engine, I let it rest on a building block with a board 
on top.  If you are removing the trans, it is far easier to install it 
with engine alrealy mounted.

  Thanks to everyone for the replies to my engine pull question, I
  believe I'll make a pair of ramps instead of a roof rack crane, for
  one thing! I reeeaaly miss having a garage...
