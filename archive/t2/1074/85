Subject: FS: Magnetic Window Screens

Hi guys, I may have met some of you at the Limbo and Full-Moon events.  
I recently added Bay window screens to the list of magnetic window  
screens and wanted to reach out to some of the larger groups. At the  
moment the only pictures I have is from a van parked on the street in  
front of my building. I'll have some better picture next week. I've  
sold over 50 sets of these for the vanagon without any issues or  
returns.

The details:

For sale: high quality magnetic window screens that fit the front  
doors on a Bay window bus.

These are sewn in the USA by me on a twin needle industrial machine  
using #69 UV thread, high quality mosquito screen, and 3/4" roll  
magnet and work great for summer camping. You just slap them on the  
outside and roll the windows down. If it rains you can either roll the  
window up without removing or just pull them inside.

They cost 50.00 for a front set (drivers and passenger window)  
Shipping is FREE East of the Mississippi. West of the Mississippi  
please contact for quote. I am shipping these from my apt in Jersey  
City.

For more info please email me OFF LIST Joefederici(-at-)earthlink.net I  
will be at Natural Bus next weekend and can bring them
