Subject: Re: [T2] Engine compartment

I pressure washed mine, wiped down the engine compartment with mineral 
spirits, and then a quick wipedown with lacquer thinnner. Then I went back 
and wire brushed the battery trays (mine were badly pitted as a result of the 
rust) with my 4.5 inch DeWalt angle grinder and wire brush. Wear goggles and 
dust mask! Vacuum out the worst of the debris each time you stop. I coated 
the trays with aluminum impregnated body filler (TOUGH stuff when dry). Then 
I went back and painted those rusty areas around the trays with rust 
converter (the cheap $5 stuff from the FLAPS). Then I went back and top 
coated it with some brush on rustoleum paint. The rattle can paint delivers 
coats of paint that is just too thin. 

Then I went throughout the engine compartment and sanded the panels a little 
with perhaps 120 grit sand paper. Wiped it all down again. Mineral spirits 
(to get the big dirt) and then a quick lacquer thinner wipe down.  And then 
primered it with a cheap Campbell-Hausfield spray gun. Resanded it with 
wet/dry sand paper again (220?). This time I wiped it down with a wet rag. 
Dry. Reprimer. Did this until I thought I had a good amount of primer (2-3 
times total). Then top coated it with the same paint that I put on the 
outside of the van. Acrylic enamel - cheap. 

Van has about 7 years on this paint and the engine bay still looks very good. 
Battery trays are a little faded. Will repaint when I do the exterior but the 
rust has not come back at all. 

Note that I changed the van color from brown to Tornado Red.
