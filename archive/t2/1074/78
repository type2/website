I saw this when it was at Bonneville, and even took some pictures, but now I
wish I had taken a better look at how he fit inside of it because I am getting
a bit tired of sitting like a knuckle dragger to see and shift in my '77
Westy.



Anybody have a tip on getting myB "behind" about 2" closer to the floor of my
bus?



I was thinking about looking at a set of mid-90's Jeep Wrangler seats, I think
they may be thinner on the bottom.



Thanks, have a nice Friday,



James



Seeing as it is Friday, I will add a link to my B'ville photos on flickr, I
don't think you will see any VW's, I wouldn't drive mine on the salt

might see some other cool things
