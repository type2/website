Subject: Flywheel Seal Installation and Carb Jet Question

Hello all,

finally, my engine is getting back together, but I have some issues/questions
and I hope you guys can help me. Firstly, I had an oil leak on the flywheel
seal and on the tranny shaft seal. This bugs me, since just a year ago, I
changed both of them. Is there a special trick to install them? I checked the
flywheel for score marks and even polished the sealing surface. I did not use
any sealant on the outside, but looking at the oil tracks, it wasn't leaking
on the outside. Prior to installing the seal, I checked the endplay and before
installing the flywheel, I lubed the seal using some special blue flywheel
seal lube from my VW dealer. I did the same for the tranny shaft seal. Any
ideas?
While the engine was out on the stand, I cleaned and disassembled both carbs
('78 2liter manual transmission with standard solexes) and overhauled them
(put in new bushings for the throttle shaft, adjusted the throttle and starter
plate play, ...). I have an old Solex/Pierburg manual that states that the
main jet should be a 132.5 and the auxiliary air jet a 150. Is this correct?
Do I understand this correctly, that a larger main jet and/or a smaller
auxiliary air jet will result in a richer mixture and vice versa,
respectively? What kind of jets do you use for a standard engine?

Any help is greatly appreciated!
Cheers,
Timo
