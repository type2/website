Subject: Removing front cab doors - '72 Westy?

Good morning,

 

I need to replace all the rubber on both my front cab doors, and have a
question on removing the doors themselves. The upper and lower hinges are
held with large Phillips, but I don't know how to remove the middle limiting
strap. From the construction, it seems I have to remove the pin holding the
flat strap to the small hinge on the frame. Is this correct? If so, are
there any tricks to it before I get knee-deep into it?

 

Thanks,

Thom
