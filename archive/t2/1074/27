20090517  I-15 L.A to Las Vegas
Record heat in Las Vegas (103F) convinced me to get a hotel room.
I drank over 1.5L of sparkling water on the way from L.A. without
any urge to urinate during or after the 4:30 drive.  Fortunately,
I brought Emergen-C along and irrigated myself back to normal.  
5am, down-loaded podcasts to listen on NV hwy 318.  Continental
b'fast & on the road by 6am.

20090518 I-15 US93 Las Vegas to Twin Falls, ID
Hwy 93 is a good 2-lane road w/shoulders and passing lanes. (NV318
has a stretch of 120 mi betw fuel stops.)  Desolate, but fuel is 
available on a regular basis.  One road crew was putting down oil
& another cutting a rumble strip down the center.  Both had single
lane traffic 4 mi with a pilot car to lead us.  NV highway patrol
seen on 318 south of Lund and pulling one over between Salmon and
Jackpot, NV.  After 11hrs of driving, I got another hotel in Twin
Falls, ID for A/C, bathing and season finale of 24 on tv.
More record heat here in Twin Falls, ID topping the Hg at 93F.
Going to Craters of the Moon Natl Park first thing in the morning.

20090519 US93 Twin Falls to COTM Natl. Mon.
White air-cooled Vanagon siting this morning, with pilot waving back.  
More US93 north to Craters of the Moon Natl Monument.  Entrance
fee $8 and camp for $10.  Camping includes picnic table, bbq stand
(no gnd fires), flush toilets.  Winds 10-20mph today w/gusts to 40.
No mosquitos.  Lots to see from a 2 mi driving loop w/hiking trails
extending from the roadway.  A hotspot beneath the earth's crust
set the stage for this.  16M years ago the hotspot was below the
OR/ID border.  The crust moved over it and thru the 'Magic Valley'.
The hotspot is currently beneath Yellowstone, which was active
600K years ago.  The hotspot heft 'scars' in the crust which created
cinder cones, lava tubes, caves and cascades 1K years ago.  Awesome.
Blue Dragon Lava includes crystallized minerals which have an
iridescent blue-violet hue.  Most of the stones resmble foam and
weigh far less than you expect.  I'm grateful not to drive more than
5 mi today due to the strong winds.  Green '78 Westy in camp with
greenbusadventures.com on the rear window.  No pilot seen nearby.
AM band DXing tonight - received signal from NB.  

20050520 US93 COTM Natl. Mon. to Missoula, MT
US93 from Vegas to Twin Falls has few radio signals, occasional 
Bible or C&W format broadcasts.  Twin Falls, ID area FM station has 
a morning show almost reminiscent of Frosty, Heidi & Frank.  (FHF was 
cancelled on February 20 in L.A. to be replaced by a top-40 format)
Bob&Tom Show 5-11am.   bobandtom.com  Heading North on US93 again.
the Salmon R. & Bitterroot R. are high and fast flowing.  The
Continental divide is nearly crossed near US93 & 43 jcn with snow
on either side of US93.  Landed at my host's home in Missoula, MT
at 4:pm.  Noone home yet, so I refuel and checkoff my shopping list.

20090521 Missoula, MT
My bus tires were made in 02 & 03.  My Missoulian friend took a
look at the fronts and declared not to drive another 1200 mi on
them.  Small 2mm cracks propogating from the letters and likewise
checking on some areas of the front sidewalls.  Went to 2 FLATS
and bought 4 LT tires (-at-) Les Schwab.  Bought some 1/2" #4 screws/
washers to reattach the westy wood panel headliner.  It's my MT
host's 15-year anniversary today, so we dine at the Lolo Steak
House.  150-year-old log constuction and many game mounts inside.
Fantastic meal & service.

20090522 Missoula, MT
Prepping to join decades old annual family campout this weekend near
Seeley Lake, MT.  Actually, I am crashing their party as a guest of 
my Missoulian hosts.  Bought some Kokanee beers which I have not
tasted since the '96 Inuvik Run with Jorge & Ivette.  Cheers.  Going
off grid for a few days.  
Vets, thank you for you sacrifice & service.
Have a nice Memorial Day holiday.
