Subject: sluggish, 

Hi folks - 1st post.

I have a '72 westy 1700 pancake with a Weber progressive. I have sluggish,
jumpy acceleration - complete with sporadic little backfires - in the lower
end of each gear, as soon as I shift up. Once she realizes we've changed
gears, and responds the acceleration is good and smooth through the mid and
top end of the gear windout.

The distributor is decent, good points, gapped to .016. New plugs (Champion,
but they were free) gapped to about .026. This engine is an unknown, I
bought it as a project, but it seems to run strong. Starts very quickly
every time. Idles low and doesn't die. New fuel line & filter Any kindly
pointers? Thanks!
