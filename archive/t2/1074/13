Subject: Re: Gauages: Non-Dakota and Good Quality Alternatives? 

I went with an analog CHT gauge from  www.aircraftspruce.com.  The micro 1000 is CJC (cold junction compensated) like the dakota 
digital.  I checked it against a fluke meter with thermocouple.  The micro 1000 monitors cyl. 3, the fluke's T/C is on cyl. 4.  They 
read within a few degrees of each other.  Here are the details...

10-01443 15 CHT EXTENSION LEAD 11.85 

10-00823 CHT PROBE 14MM M-1000 14.95 

10-01425 2" CHT PYROMETER GAUGE 52.95 


the extension lead needs to be 18'. I'm quite pleased with the gauge. I went with it mostly because I wanted an analog gauge. I'm very 
happy with it, no regrets. the probe and extension seem well made. It's also idiot proof. You couldn't hook it up backwards if you 
tried.
