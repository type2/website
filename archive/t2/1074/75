Subject: Re: [T2] Flywheel Seal Installation and Carb Jet Question

Timo,

I can't help you with the oil seal question, but for the jetting of the Solex carbs, I think 132.5 is about perfect for the main jet.  With the main jet, larger is richer for everything from just above idle to redline.  I have run the full range commonly available, from 127.5 to 137.5 and liked 132.5 the best.  You would probably get better economy with 130 mains but I liked to err on  the side of caution - don't want to run too lean and risk detonation.  137.5 worked great but I think it just wastes gas.  In 1972 the 1700cc engine here in the States came with 137.5 mains.  By 1974 with the onset of emission concerns they decreased the jet size all the way to 127.5.

The air correction jet (auxiliary air) I believe only affects the mixture at high rpm.  You are correct that smaller air-correction jets give a richer mixture, backwards from the main jet.  I have not found these jets to make a noticeable difference, but I think I have 155's in my carbs - midway between the 1972 size (170?) and 1974 size (140).  If you pull a lot of hills at full throttle and high rpm, I would not go too high on the air correction jets.

I hope the specs I quoted are accurate, it has been quite a few years since I looked them up.
