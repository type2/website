Sae kinds of problems at my house. Bought early Vanagon seats for an upgrade 
but they make the situation worse. 

I'm thinking MR-2, Porsche 914, Fiero seats. 

That said I'm mostly a stock guy. Want the vintage look and utility. Not 
against upgrades when they don't take away from the style and utility. Better 
front buckets, better camper package that looks the part, better driveline. 

See? Told you I was a stock guy. Change everything and say I'm a stock guy... 
VBG!
