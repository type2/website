Subject: Re: [T2] re: Solo engine removal

I've done this job with a '70. Not hard. Just used a pair of scissors jacks 
per suggestions of John Muir's "How to keep Your VW Alive for the Compleat 
Idiot" book. Really just a balancing act. 

Today I have a floorjack from Sears. Works much faster. The ATV jack 
referenced several times by others is even better. 

Once it is out grab a friend and lift it into the cargo area for storage. Just 
a couple hundred pounds. 

When I do heavy work like this with my wife who isn't a pro weight lifter we 
roll the jack to where I want to unload the engine, put a 4x4 stick of wood 
under each side of the engine. If you need to go higher just lift one side 
and have your sweetie put a block of wood under that side. Lift other side 
and put another block of wood under that side. Repeat again and again. 
Minimum stress on your back and the engine can be lifted to the height of the 
bus floor. Don't let it fall of course. 

Version #2 would be a piece of wood or boards so you can slide or "walk" the 
engine into the bus interior. Towel over the door sill to protect against 
scratches. Walking the engine just means sliding one side forward and then 
sliding the other side forward. Repeat a dozen or two times. 

Hope this is helpful.
