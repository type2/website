Subject: Re: [T2] re: Solo engine removal

Done it with a 71 in parking lots- easier without the transmission 
hanger and fixed apron as found in the later busses.  Drive or jack bus 
onto about 6" ramps (I nailed together stepped pieces of 2x6's) so rear 
sticks up and use a large board around 2x2' with the scissor jacks 
immobilized on the board.  put 3 broomsticks under the board and these 
can roll on the street.  Once engine hanger is removed (with jacks in 
place) let it down far enough so it is LEVEL with the street.  If you 
must remove the engine first, this makes it easier to get at the upper 
mounting nuts by reaching behind the fan housing. Yank out the engine 
and the board will roll on the broomstick pieces; if you hang up then 
level the engine to the street by cranking the scissor jacks a bit. 
When I did it I cranked both jacks at once!  If you remove the engine 
and trans at once, remove the cv joints and use a longer board (2x3') 
and place an extra jack or custom block under the tranny.  For install, 
I used a large sledge to tweak the board sideways and forwards by 
tapping on it laying on my side to align the transhaft to the throwout 
bearing.
