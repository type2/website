Subject: Pushrod tube leak

     I've got a (presumably) 2.0 liter engine, GE engine code, with dual 
carbs.  It runs good, so I don't want to mess with it (If it ain't 
broke...).  Unfortunately, I have a leaky pushrod tube that I would love to 
clear up.  Do they make adjustable pushrod tubes for the bus, like they do 
for bugs, that you can install without removing the head?  This is not 
laziness, simply a preference to not mess with it due to a lack of 
experience and desire to change anything since it works fine like it is 
(other than the obvious leak).  I looked at bus depot, and I didn't see any 
adjustable pushrod tubes.  So, does anybody have some, do they work, and are 
they hard to install?  Should I replace all the tubes, or just the one that 
leaks?

Thanks,
