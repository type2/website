Subject: RE: Pushrod tube removal

I have used a plastic plier that was originally designed to remove spark plug boots (I think).  It's red plastic with a rounded/serrated "mouth" (like a channel-lock plier).  I would also think that a small strap wrench would work if you could work the strap around the pushrod tube and if the tube was not oil covered.
