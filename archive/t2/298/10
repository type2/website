They do have cabin and cottage rentals in this campground,  so if your too 
warm blooded for cold camping in a bus, then come and rent a cabin. You'll 
be able to sleep in cozy comfort but still mingle with all the buses.  Call 
the campground for info on cabin rentals. The campground phone # is: 
(864)576-0302.


You will NOT need to call and make reservations if your camping in your bus, 
but you can if you like:      They are not very busy at this time of year, 
so we will almost have the entire place to ourselves.



DIRECTIONS TO CAMPGROUND:   Take I-26 away from Spartanburg (towards 
Columbia, SC) and take Exit 28: HWY 221.   Take HWY 221 NORTH, approx. 200 
feet to light, and turn right on "Stillhouse Road".  Go one mile to Stop 
Sign and take left on "Ott Shoals Road"...go 1.5 miles and see campground 
signs on the left.
