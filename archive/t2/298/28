Subject: Trade Complete 78 Transporter type 2 for a 68 + Camper no

Ok everybody,  I have decided that I am definitely going subie power.

Instead of converting my transporter that is in decent shape and taking an
otherwise good type IV and making it unuseable, I have an idea.

How about I offer to trade my 78 transporter with a complete running type IV
motor for a 68 on bay camper, could be a westy, sportsmobile, I really don't
care.  I do not need a motor, since I am converting.  So all of you out
there with a camper with a blown motor and a good interior, here is a way
you can trade it for something else.

My 78 is complete, was running good when I pulled the motor to take the gas
tank out for cleaning.  I haven't gotten around to putting the motor back
in because I am planning a wedding, cutting firewood, etc.

What I am looking for is a complete camper, good tranny, but a missing or
blown motor, since I am doing a conversion.   68 bay on.  reasonable
condition for interior and no rust buckets.

Any takers?

Kindest Regards,

Mark Dominesey
