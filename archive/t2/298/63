Subject: Re: [T2] 110 V -> 12 V, 2 amp = Battery Charger?? 

Barry, re your 2 amp 110-12v dc converter- $3 is a good price for what is a
transformer and a rectifier to get DC (how filtered is the DC- will it run a
12v radio or small TV without interference?).
The converter/charger in the stock camper is 4 amp, with just a timer to
send charging current to the battery.  It has a simple voltmeter to let you
know when the batter is charged (you prerss the switch to check it).  The 2
amp unit can be used as a charger as it puts out over 13.2v, but since it is
not automatically tapered, you will also have to have a voltmeter to monitor
the battery voltage over time to see when it comes up to the ideal max of
2.2v per cell (which drops to a resting voltage, forget what-about 12.8?).
The stock unit is twice as fast as your 2 amp one.  The lower the amps, the
longer to charge the battery, particularly if it is significantly
discharged.  One-2amp units are better at keeping a battery topped up if
used a bit.  Keep your Sears 10 amp charger, as it will be better at
preventing sulphation of a significantly discharged battery.
