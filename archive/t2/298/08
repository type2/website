Subject: Re: [T2] Home made Poptop canvas

AS was mentioned, I sewed my poptop canvas from a small tent that's   
poles were long gone. The trick is to carefully take out your old     
canvas, and use a seamripper to cut the seams apart. You can then lay 
the original panels on top of your tent to get the best layout...trace
the panels onto the new tent, cut, and sew...there are several        
pictures of my set-up on my bus page, off

pretty easy project alltogether, and you get way bigger windows.
