I use a pair of slip joint pliers - the long handled type - and I do it 
very carefully. If I squeeze too hard I can feel the tube flex and I back off.

The important part of the removal is to twist the tube back and forth alot 
at a medium pace (not jerking it back and forth and not treating it like it 
was made of crystal) while gently giving it some pressure to encourage it 
to drift towards the head.

What does the pliers do to the tube? Nothing. There are a couple scratches 
but no dents or gouges. It's easy to ruin a tube as I did for an 
'experiment' with a Type I tube once.

You have to be very, very gentle though. I have never had to replace a tube 
on a Type IV. Great design IMHO.

Now if it only had 6 cylinders. Oh - that's a Corvair engine. Different 
thread.... <grin>
