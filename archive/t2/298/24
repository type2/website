Snoopy,
    That is a terrific set up. I am planning a very similar if not identical
install. I have a old pop up camper that I gutted. It has a heater like the
one you installed. I know it worked 2 years ago and it worked very well.
    One question, where is your propane tank and how big is it?
Later,
