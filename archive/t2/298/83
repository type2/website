Funny you should ask.....I just found this site tonight looking for a 
picture of a tool http://homepage.calypso.net/~ci-17825/ . Some neat stuff 
here. Nothing for sale, just scanned catalog pictures (Hazet tools,VW 
accessories, etc.) and accessory pics mostly bug though.

Hello all,
  Is there a website out there that identifies accessories from the Factory,
dealers, EMPI ect.
Thanks,
Bryan
