Volks,
 
A few of us have just created a new Yahoo Group ...  "VWVANFULLTIMERS".
 
This group is dedicated to the discussion of challenges unique to Living
or Traveling for extended periods of time in Volkswagen Vanagon,
Syncro,Westfalia or Eurovan vehicles.
 
Topics could include Medical Care, Internet Access, Camping Places,
Modifications, Packing Lists, Security, Paying Bills, Recipes ...
anything unique to living and traveling in a small mobile space. 
 
The intent is to create a COMMUNITY / FORUM to exchange information and
to provide support, encouragement and solutions to nurture this
adventure. 
 
It is NOT INTENDED as a duplication of Vanagon/Syncro/Westfalia/Eurovan
content already existing.. 
 
Our other excellent Lists & Groups like Vanagon.Com, Syncro, WetWesties,
EV-Update etc do a superb job of hosting these topics.
 
So, if you have an interest  in exploring the problems and solutions of
such an adventure, please join us.
 
Currently, we have 27 members and look forward to adding more.
