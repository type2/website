Dear David & Type 2 listees.

Not only have I seen a VW Type 4 engine windage tray,
I have one for my 1911cc VW 17/1800 Type 2 & 4
modified hybrid engine.

Mine originates from a 1971 VW 411LE fuel injected
engine, which is well illustrated in Tom Wilson's book
on "How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-Colled Engine",
published by HP Books.

Regards.
