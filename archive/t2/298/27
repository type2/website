Thanks. Since the tent was a few years old already, once I installed  
everything I sprayed it down, inside and out, with some tent-sealer   
spray form a local camping shop. The first time I took it out was     
busses on the Blue Ridge Parkway a few years ago, and it POURED down  
rain. My bed was nice and toasty, however...                          
:)                                                                    
I would leave it a little slack, as otherwise I imagine you'd end up  
stretching it, which could lead to fatigue and tearing of the         
material.
