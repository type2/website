Subject: Amp meter needed

I need something to measure current draw in my VW, to track down where my 
battery power is going.

  Like an amp meter?!?!

The multimeter (with micro amp meter) I have has a .5 amp fuse.  I know, I 
just blew it last night, so I need something stronger.

Hopefully something in Radio Shack that I can cludge together.
