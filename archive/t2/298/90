Subject: Rememer the bus Selcta?

     Remember the little flash thingy that let you customize an early bus?  
They have now put out a baywindow version.  Their select lists are a little 
off, if you select the "Camper Van" item it shows a standard, and there is 
no actual camper van option that works but hey, it's something!  Here's the
