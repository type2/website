My motorcycle battery charger puts out 1 amp so you can surely charge a 
battery - slowly.

I think the main difference are these: the power supply is going to have 
cleaner power (no hum in the radio you plug in) and no circuit to taper off 
the output when the battery is full. In short it is a smaller version of 
what is under the back seat.

I would just keep or sell them to folks that work on 12 volt items like CBs 
or mobile ham equipment. I'd love to have one for those reasons alone.
