Subject: [T2] Pushrod tube removal

Well, with all this talk about pushrod removal I though I would share
my technique. Take a std pair of Vice-Grips & adjust them so that they
are just slightly larger than the smallest section of the tube. Clamp
it over the middle of the tube. You are doing it correct if the grips
are still loose. Then push the vice toward the head. At some point
(where the tubes increase in diameter) the grips will hold. Then
gently rotate the tubes in their bore while lightly applying pressure
away from the engine case. The tubes should come out with no problem
what-so-ever. It can scratch the tube, but other than that it
shouldn't do any damage if done correctly. I like this technique b/c
it won't allow me to crush the tube if I squeeze too hard.
