Oh yes, they do exist.  All 914 2.0's had them, and maybe the 1.8's also.
They're actually not too hard to come by.  What's hard to find is the 4
rubber gaskets that go on them.  As far as I know, no one ever repro'd them
and they do periodically get damaged while mating the case halves.  Don't
use the windage tray without them!
