Subject: Holiday Special number 2

   The response was overwhelming on the 62-71 tail-light special that I feel
I need to offer another, so cheap you can't 
refuse (well maybe), so here I go

    Standard size headlights bulbs H 4, either flat or curved lens. These
are replacement headlight bulbs with H 4 60/55 Tungsten bulbs. These are
made in India (by OE manufacturer to major car companies) in collaboration
with Phoenix Japan..
  
    I have fit these bulbs in OG pre 68 headlight buckets and they fit with
out any modifications.

So here's the deal 15 dollars a PAIR plus shipping (UPS only).
