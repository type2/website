My understanding of it is that the wiring to the cigarette lighter and the 
cord you are using to connect the batteries to the cigarette lighter are 
going to restrict the current flow and the charge rate.

This is the same design as the OEM Westfalia charging system between the 
main and aux battery. Wiring limiting the charge rate.
