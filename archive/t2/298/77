The info for charging these batteries is usually printed right on the side
of the battery.  There are two voltages, one for charging after
discharge, and the other for float (constant charging)  There is a maximum
current listed as well.

For those who don't care about recharge time, It's simple to build a
circuit using a 14v DC, 1 Amp wall wart transformer and a LM317T voltage
regulator to provide a constant voltage at the float value.  The current
is limited by the wall-wart itself as their output voltage will drop as
the current goes over the rated value of the transformer.  You can plug
your battery in and just leave it on full-time.

If you want faster charging, then you are better off buying a charger made
to do the job.  It will charge at the "cycling" voltage until the current
drops, then switch to the "float" voltage.  Cool thing, that.

Conventional chargers are bad for gel-cells as they are not well
controlled and can feed too much current to the battery.
