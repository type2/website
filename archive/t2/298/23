Subject: camper cushion dimensions

this is a question for all the non technical folks out there: I'm trying to 
confirm the dimensions for the rear cushion - the one that sits on top of 
the engine compartment - on a late '70s westy. I measured it to be 35.5 x 43 
x 3", but thought I'd get the dimensions on an existing one to check.

Thanks
Mat
