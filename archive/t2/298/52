To the original poster:

If you choose not to use engine oil as a lubricant/sealer, I believe 914 folks use "Dow Corning 111 Valve Lubricant and Sealant".  The seals will be very hard to install dry.

A couple of months back Dr. Tim said not to use any kind of permanent sealant on the push rod tube o-rings as they have to move without binding due to heat expansion.
