There is a Bob Hoover article on the evils of adjustable tubes although I can't follow the logic 100%. It seems the main problem is with the way they are finished: chrome or purty anodized Aluminum.

Were the tubes painted black at the factory?

Like Jason said, changing the tube seals is a cinch. Doing your first valve adjustment can be nerve wracking at first and working under there for any length of time gets to be a strain on your neck and back without proper support but you'll be glad you did it when the oil leaks stop.  I put in Viton seals and followed the bartnik article:
