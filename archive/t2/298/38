Subject: Pushrod tube leak

--Jay,

The type4 is designed to be able to change the pushrod tubes without removing the head. My mechanic did mine, and I paid about 90bucks total, so I know he didn't remove them.

I'm sure whatever Ron is selling is the correct type for you to order.

I would suggest that if you're going to get under there, do them all with the nice viton seals that everyone's always talking about on the list.

GE engine is 2.0L

Do they make adjustable pushrod tubes for the bus, like they do 
for bugs, that you can install without removing the head?

I looked at bus depot, and I didn't see any 
adjustable pushrod tubes.

Should I replace all the tubes, or just the one that 
leaks?
