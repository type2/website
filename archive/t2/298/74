Subject: Re: [T2] Recharging Gel Cell Batteries

Hi Mike,

I have been running much the same setup on my Westfakia. Back in April 
a local junkyard had a skidload of "Johnson Controls" sealed 
forklift/golf-cart batteries for sale, and for $20CDN I couldn't see 
not picking one up to use as an auxiliary power supply.

Next I bought a 400W inverter that came with 2 sets of wires to connect 
it. It had a set of large alligator clips to connect it directly to a 
battery, or you could gowith a standard cigarette lighter lead. Each of 
these was terminated with ring connectors. I screwed BOTH sets of wires 
onto the studs on the inverter, and connected the alligator clips to 
the battery terminals. When I want to recharge the auxiliary battery I 
just plug the lighter in to the bus's electrical outlet. When I get to 
a campsite I make sure to unplug the lighter so as to leave the main 
battery strong enough to restart the bus.

Not quite as hands-free as running an isolator, but it works OK for me. 
I have an isolator, but haven't made time to install it as I'm not sure 
it would be safe with this kind of battery. Opinions?

FWIW, Another local bus-owner put one of these batteries in a 68 westy, 
and after a subsequent regulator problem it inflated like a balloon. So 
you can understand wanting to be careful with this.

Happy trails,
