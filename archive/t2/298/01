You should be able to buy generic freeze plugs for this.
You may have to shop for metric sizes but they should be a generic item
at FLAPS.


These plugs are NLA and I could not find any that would fit my 78 2.0l
engine.  It is really best to tap with the smallest tap that will just
barely cut threads deeper than the bore of the galley, then coat the threads
of the plug with a sealant.  Even shallow threads will keep the plug in more
solidly than the friction fit of the originals.  My original blew out and
caused a massive oil leak that put all the oil in the bell housing.  Shut
off engine immediately so no damage but a real mess.  New clutch of course
needed.  On alternative was found by a mechanic who worked on the engine
after my first bodge failed.  He found a bolt with a slight taper on the
unthreaded shank that was 5 thou bigger than the galley hole.  Tapped it in
gently and sealed the end with epoxy.  It has held but I really think the
best solution is to thread and tap.  Just don't go to big or you will be
through the rather thin wall of the galley wall and into the oil passage.  I
would also use a very thick grease on the tap to keep any shavings out of
the cases.  Good Luck
