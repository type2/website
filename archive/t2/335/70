Yep--Chris is correct on this one--
There is a weld through seam sealer that comes in an aerosol can--
Spray it on all the butt welded joints and weld--
It'll keep the welded area from rusting at the seams.
It's zinc rich and prevents corrosion.

The rockers that I have repaired (just a few) required working from the
inside out. 
I'd try to clean and paint each layer as you go along. I think they've
got a spray on welders paint.
