Subject: Re: [T2] yet another FART...Glossy Side Up or Down?

> Yea, this one again. Could somebody out there give me a definitive answer to the age old question: Does the
engine seal go in glossy side up (facing the top of the engine) or down? And whichever way it's supposed to
be, could I also get a reasonable explanation as to why?

Shiny side DOWN.  The coarse side is a reasonable facsimile of a sponge. You do not want the seal to absorb
water when the tires throw it up. The gloss side shuns water.
