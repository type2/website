The fact remains that it is the A/F under load that is important to the health of the engine, not the spec at idle.  Just because a spec for 2500rpm at 1/2 throttle isn't in Bentley doesn't mean that it isn't important.  You can bet that VW has specifications for A/F under load even if they don't share them with us.

Spoken like a true modern-day mechanic.  Scott is an intelligent person trying to learn something about his bus and optimize it's performance.  You don't have to help him, but at least stop hammering him for it.

No guesswork involved with a dyno - it's factual data under conditions that matter(tm).  Your engine isn't going to overheat and throw a rod at idle, even if your A/F is way, way off.

Agreed.
