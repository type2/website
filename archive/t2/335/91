Subject: yet another FART...Glossy Side Up or Down?

Yea, this one again. Could somebody out there give me a definitive answer to 
the age old question: Does the engine seal go in glossy side up (facing the 
top of the engine) or down? And whichever way it's supposed to be, could I 
also get a reasonable explanation as to why?
Exasperated Again,
