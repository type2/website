Subject: Re: [T2] My bus is tired

I use my '70 as a daily driver and I put about 2500 miles a month on her. So
don't let others tell you your bus is too old, instead make sure she is well
cared for and you'll be fine.
I just had to replace the fuel pump. She would do fine in town, but try to
run 60 and she could act like she was out of gas (tired maybe?).
