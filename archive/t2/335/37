Many good tips have come from this list.  To check drag from brakes or
bearings, see how she rolls on a slight hill.  Since your compression is
good, I'd be inclined to retest the timing. It may be OK at idle but the
advance may not working properly.  It could also be that your fuel pump is
struggling. There are lots of little things that can be at fault, and you'll
need to check them off one at a time.  But I'm sure the old girl has plenty
of life left in her once you find the problem.
