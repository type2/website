the railroads years ago and some still today had special engines for
hazardous locations that they called "fireless cookers" or a lot of other
things, they looked like steam engines but rather than a boiler it was a
huge "tank" most often they used steam from a stationary source like a
powerplant that was remote from the hazardous location, sometimes they
used compressed air but that tended to be less efficient.

they could run around the plant for an hour or so before they had to
recharge and couldn't go very fast.  most often they had a battery for
lights.

now to relate it to VWs' I found one of these not too long ago when I was
exploring East Tennesse in my Bus.
