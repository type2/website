Hi Billy,

Susan didn't tell the list which engine she had in today's message. But 
she had previously emailed the list on Sunday regarding the steering on 
her bus, and in her message then she mentioned it was a 68.

My understanding of the term "doghouse" is that it refers to the large 
cooling shroud fitted on top of the engine to house the fan at the back 
of the generator/alternator on type 1 engines. This is a common usage 
with the many type1 engine users I know, most of whom have buses 
without the 71's oil cooler. If this practice varies by region, it's 
news to me.

BTW, I've had a 72, 73 and 74 type4 engined westy and ALL of them have 
had paper hoses from the blower to the heater boxes. I've seen plastic 
hoses on FI buses but never on a carbureted bus. YMMV.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
