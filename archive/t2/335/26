Subject: My bus is tired

With my lack of technical knowledge I don't know how it say it better: 
 my bus is tired.  I have been told by several people, most who know 
less about busses than I do, and a few who profess to know more, that my 
'78 Bus is just "too old" to be my daily driver, let alone take it on 
trips like Everybus (which unfortunately we have to skip this year, boo 
hoo.)  I respect the age of my bus, but  it used to be able to have a 
fair amount of acceleration to pull out into traffic and could hit 75 on 
the highway if necessary.  Now it can barely go 50, had no acceleration 
and basically feels as if it is stuggling under a heavy weight. It has 
had a recent tune-up; all the fuel lines have been replaced (healthy 
fear of fires); I replaced the fuel filter and the air filter.  A 
cracked vacuum line was replaced, which helped only a tiny bit.  The 
timing is ok.  The compression is 120 all around.  I am  getting 
depressed because  I strive to take good care of my bus and am under the 
impression that lots of you guys are able to use your busses for daily 
transport, not just shows and stuff.  I will be heartbroken if I have to 
take it off the road; I know in my gut that I will not have to , I guess 
I just need a little emotional support.  Thanks in advance, Beth in NJ
