	My brother started a preventitive maintenance program
on his family's fleet: a Vanagon, a Classic Beetle and
a pair of FWD water pumpers. He changes CV boots every 4 
years, for all 4 vehicles. He reasons that no CV or boot
in his experience failed before 4 years, and as long as
the boots and grease are in good shape, the joints
themselves last for a long, long time. He's been
doing this for more than the last 4 years :) and
hasn't had a CV failure yet.

	Its true that FWD outer CVs get more time at large
angles than RWD joints, but FWD inners don't get that 
much more work than RWD joints.
