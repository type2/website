3-M has an adhesive remover that works good---
Or Goo Off ( might be goof off ) at any Home Depot, Menard's, Ace is the
place works well too--all without damaging the surrounding paint.

Soak well with product--remove with plastc putty knife-
Later,

hi all - what is the best removal method for dried door seal glue? i am
replacing the seal on the rear hatch and have been picking at it with a
sharp plastic tool, but am wondering if there is a miracle in a can.
THANKS     - steve
