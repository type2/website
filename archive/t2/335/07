pre-71 upright engines have a cooling shroud which, if viewed from the 
top, is rectangular, with the "XXXX" being the oil cooler:

	FIF
==========================
XXXX
==========================
	RIR

"doghouse" refers to the 1971 fanhouse, which removes the oil cooler 
to an isolated outcropping attached to the back of the fan housing:

=====
XXXX|	FIF
==========================

==========================
	RIR


The oil cooler being "in the doghouse".  This results in separate cooling 
air going to the oil-cooler than the 3/4 head.  Unfortunately, the 
oil-cooler outlet still blows over the #3 head, but this still ends up 
being better for cooling.

I don't mean this to sound like a "Well, MINE has...", but:

my 1971 carbureted bus has paper/??? hoses with a plastic, accordian-like 
housing *around* it, between the paper hoses and the heater boxes.  
Then again, my bus is pre-blower, so things might have changed then...
