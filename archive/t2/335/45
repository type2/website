Subject: more with heater thread

finally, well its been ten years, i wired up the heater boxes. i got full
blast from the fan but only got heat and warm defrost when i cleaned out a
mice den in the duct work. now that i care about the heat levers on the
dash i wonder about something that struck me as odd: on my dash ('75) there
are two red levers; one differentiates between heat and defrost, the other
is a minumum/maximum heat switch. that second lever actuates the blower
motor over the engine only on maximum full-blast.  so, heat creeps through,
and the fan only comes on with full steam ahead, is that right?   - steve
