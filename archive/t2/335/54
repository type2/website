The original registration expired, however not enough people signed up 
to dole out all the cash that is involved in the settlement so it has 
been extended to the 5th. The judge will have to okay everybody who 
signs up before the 5th, but it is at least a chance still if you have 
not signed up. Sorry for the confusion.
