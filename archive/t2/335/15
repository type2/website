Subject: heater and fresh air levers and dash?'s

which heater and fresh air levers is everyone talking about here.  i have a
72 and am missing my blue rubber pieces on the right levers but have seen
the later model ones at the junk yard that are one big plastic piece.  if
that is the kind you need i saw a bunch on the vans at the wilmington, ca
ecology junk yard a couple of weeks ago.

 if anybody has a couple of the blue rubber ones, i sure need a set and can
go buy those plastic ones to trade you if that's what you need.

i really liked the way the later models dash had labels for the heat and
defrost on the dash, is this a direct swap onto my 72?
