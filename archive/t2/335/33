It's always good to have the encouragement.   I recently had to pull 
my 78 off the road for a problem with the oil pump.  After I showed 
my Fiancee some of the resources on this list, she was more agreeable 
to my keeping and working on it.

Every book I've bought, every bit of work I've done on this bus has 
come from the folks on the list!

Hang in there Beth!

These vehicle are way too special to give up on and will go for ever 
and ever if well maintained!   My little town, Davis, CA is full of 
Splits and Bays and I've already met some neighbors who want to help 
with the upcoming overhaul!

PS Buy both the Muir and Bentley books and tools suggested on this 
list, and you can't go wrong.   And Ron's parts from the Bus Depot 
always fit!

(GO Westy is cool too!)
