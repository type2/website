Subject: The Bus Guild

Tony,
    I clicked on the link from your message to the type2 list, as I
recieve it in Digest form, and the Bus Guild page comes up.  In fact
it's on my screen right now.  But not to fret, do a google search for
Bus Guild and get the address that way, that's what I did for my
original post.
