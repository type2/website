Subject: Re: [T2] My bus is tired

It does sound like something simple.  Often the simplest problems are the 
hardest to find.  It sounds like you're the one who is tired, but use this 
resource(the list) to repair the problem and get back up to freeway speeds.  
I used my '70 as a daily driver for years, and only recently pulled her from 
the road to do some major repairs.  Your '78 is a young'n compared to many 
other 'daily drivers' out there.  Don't give up!
