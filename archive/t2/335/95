That's just the price is costs to make a high pressure pump that will last 
20-30 years. Let's see, $250 is about half a monthly new van payment. Check 
with Campbell-Nelson in Lynwood for used VW parts. Check for fuel 
tank/filter restriction. Too many times this is what stresses out the 
pumps. These Bosch pumps should be very quiet, just a low hum. Anything 
more is indication of stress or wear with death getting close.
