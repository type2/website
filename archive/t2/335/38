Beth, without being able to physically troubleshoot your eng. I'd still like 
to hazard a guess. Using Occams Razor, and the working knowledge I have from 
playing with Bosch and other FI systems for the past 20 so-odd years, the 
symptoms you describe could easily be attributed to a bad cylinder head temp. 
sensor, located on the top of the head for #3 cylinder in your engine 
compartment. Grab a Bentley or Hynes manual and check this sensor for spec. 
If that doesn't turn the trick, use the same manual/manuals to go through the 
complete FI troubleshooting procedure. It is a lot easier than you might at 
first think!
