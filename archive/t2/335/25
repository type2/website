Subject: Re:Intake Air Dist - Fat Hose Rpl Help

Just wanted to say thanks to all who stepped up to provide good advice for 
my vacuum leak problem on 1979 Westy "Hans".  Replaced the four short intake 
manifold hoses last Saturday by loosening the manifold tube bolts.  All four 
removed hoses had numerous tiny cracks in what apparently was at one time 
rubber.  Now, with all non-essential systems disconnected from the intake 
air dist and new manifold hoses on, I'm up to 11-12 inches vacuum.  Still a 
ways to go to get to 17-19 inches vacuum and running out of things to 
isolate out.  Just picked up some carb cleaner and will use this to spray 
around the thottle body and cold start valve gasket area to see if idle 
picks up.  S-duct also looked good after close visual check.  Checked 
compression on the engine to make myself feel better and got 118-135-135-141 
for 1-2-3-4.

Thanks again,

Bob Forrester
