Subject: What IS this?

Hello, volks!
  I bought something on eBay, and I am not sure that I got what I thought I
got. Can anyone give me their opinions on this item, what it is, what year
it's for, or if it's even VW? I haven't opened the bag, but I cannot see any
indication that this part was made by VW or for a VW.
