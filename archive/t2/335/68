Subject: Re: [T2] Fw: Spark Plug

If you use plugs that are shorter than required carbon will build up on the 
threads in the head that are exposed. Also the spark will be shrouded by 
the head. Use the right plug.

If you use the longer plug in a shorter head then you will have carbon 
buildup on the threads and risk ripping the threads out of the head when 
you try to remove the plug.
