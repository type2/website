Greg,

I don't know if she identified her engine type/bus year, but there's no paper hoses and there is a blower motor on the Type 4's.

Also, "doghouse" might be a poor choice. Doesn't this refer to a specific oil-cooler arrangement only from 71 on? Therefore one year only on north american buses?

Just trying to make it helpful for a possible newbie.

Later,

Billy
