I'm told that a typical rebuilder bores out the grooves to a larger 
standard size and then reassemble the joints with larger diameter balls. 
Now whether anything is heat treated as well as the factory or not I do not 
know. I'm not too worried as they are easy to swap unlike an internal 
engine or tranny part.

My question is how long will the boots last?
