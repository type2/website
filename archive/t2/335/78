Subject: 1700 engine

Hello,

I have a 1700 engine that i am gonnna drop out of my old van.
question is, can i use the intake manifolds off of this engine for an 1800
engine?
I noticed that the 1700 engine has some small intake tubing running into each
side of the heads.if the 1800 engine doesn't have these tubes can you use the
manifolds
on each engine?

Thanks,
darren
