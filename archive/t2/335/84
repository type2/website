Subject: Can anyone order VW dealer parts without a large markup?

Hi All:
Does anyone know of a VW dealer that can order OEM VW parts without a
large markup? I contacted two dealers in the South Florida area and got
two price estimates, $2000 and $2200. I am sure that I can better
somewhere else.

Any suggestions?

Regards,
