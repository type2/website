Subject: Free money to fix your bus!

Did I get your attention? This is not strictly bus related, so I am 
hesitant to post this to the list, but I figured everybody should get a 
chance at a refund, and you can always use the money to fix your bus!

I like to listen to CDs in my bus using the nice 12 disc changer that 
the PO installed. (Required bus content.) Many of the CDs that I play 
there I purchased quite some time ago, when the price of CDs was 
artificially inflated by the recording industry. An anti-trust lawsuit 
was filed on the part of 48 states, and a settlement is in the works. 
Basically the settlement involves the recording industry giving CDs 
away, and paying $20 to anybody that makes a claim.

In order to get your $20 for the CDs you bought at the inflated price 
you must fill out a claim form here by midnight on the 5th:

I hope you all sign up and get your $20 and use it to buy something nice 
for your bus!
