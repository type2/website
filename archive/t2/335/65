Subject: 71 Bus FS in Colorado

A friend of a friend is selling his 71 bus in Colorado Springs, CO.  I've
never seen the bus in person, but I've got some pics I can e-mail you if
you're interested.  Here's what he says about it:

1971 bus.  Starts easy and runs well.  Have both rear seats, spare tire and
hard cover.  Original am/fm 8-track radio.  Good tires.  New master
cylinder.  New accelerator cable.  $2000.  Call or email David Ezziddine
volgensmij(-at-)earthlink.net     719.684.2251  after 6pm.

I know the guy well enough to know if he says it starts easy and runs well,
it does.  He's not a mechanic so if it didn't run well he'd have never
driven it.  That's all the details I've got other than the pics I can email.
