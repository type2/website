Subject: VW tool vendor

Mike,

I noticed that one too and made a bookmark.

http://www.vwalley.com/

I contacted a fellow there, Chris Kraum, and made a plea for a good drum/hub
puller, maybe if there is more interest on this list we can convince him to
make them!

I plan on getting their case splitter for aid in rebuilding a 1500 block
that was "recently rebuilt" and seized last fall.

'67 Bug
'70 Westfalia "Rebertha" (stuck drum)
'75 BMW 2002 "Crusty" (stuck hub)
