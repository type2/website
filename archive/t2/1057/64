To be clear, there's no "burden."   It's simply a matter of time and
motivation.

ANY move needs someone to do it.  And we can't stay where we are (well, we
can, but we crashed again yesterday).   So we move.  Or not. :)

Moving to a system that gives us flexabilty is an option, moving to a
system that doesn't is also an option.   Either one requires time and
energy to make it happen.

$150 a month, since...uh....2000 or so.  Maybe 2001.

Question has been answered a few times. ;)


Anyway, we've assembled a group of volunteers in a room and are watching
them sort out what they want to do.

So far, they're planning to fully keep the lists and websites alive, on a
colocated machine or a virtual machine.
