Subject: Junkyard Pictures

Hey guys,

        I've been taking pictures of a lot of the cars I see in the local
junkyards the past few months. As I've said before... some of these vehicles
are pretty rare. I've got at least 100 pictures to marry up and add to the
page, but I figured I'd whip something up quick to show some of the vehicles I
saw this morning.

There was this awesome old Dodge Power Wagon which was a retired USAF military
vehicle.

Anyway, I'll be constantly adding pictures to this site...

By the way, if anyone knows the make / model of some of those other cars that
I took pictures of and wouldn't mind e-mailing me, I'd really appreciate it. I
knew at the time (since I saw the name / tags) but it's been a while so I
can't remember for the life of me.


You can go to it by going to http://www.PontiacPerformance.Net and clicking on
"Other Stuff" and then clicking on "Pictures from Local Junkyards".


Or, you can go directly to that page by going to http://www.JunkyardPics.com


I've got some type2s and old VW stuff too, I just haven't added them yet.



Thanks!!!

Todd
