Hi Mark,

I looked into the parts books I downloaded and found the blow up drawing of
the front end including the steering box. If the drawing is showing the
steering system in the straight ahead position, the keyway should be toward
the driver. Mine is toward the windshield. Looks like you may have nailed it.
I need to extend the drag link to turn the wheel 180 degrees. I would have
thought that this might limit my steering in one direction or the other, but
this is not the case.
Will need to investigate however, I was told at one time that only Bay drag
links are available. Could be that the installer simply did the best he could
with the link he had.

There is a reason why you call yourself VWBrain.

Best Regards,
Chris

  hey chris  they have different part numbers so I would assume they are
different. sPlits  211 415 701D  bays 211 415 701G   Splittie steering wheels
are keyed so you can't change that. drag link is the true way to adjust the
postion of the wheel.  I would say there is something not quite right if you
are at the end. maybe you need to take it all the way out as if the wheel is
upside down??  later  mark d
