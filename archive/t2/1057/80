Subject: Re: [T2] Starter connections on my 77 Westy

The main stud [term 30] of the starter should have
red white wire for double relay
red wire should have a black loom over it that goes to alt B+
LARGE red wire from B+
red wire to term 70 of the analysis system socket .. square plug upper right
side of engine bay door area

small spade terminal [50]  of the starter has a
red white wire that goes to the fuse panel S9
red black wire that comes from the ignition switch term 50


put your WR-1 relay in the engine bay near the voltage regulator...
connect terminal 30 on the relay to the battery +ve
connect terminal 86 to ground
connect terminal 87 to the starter spade terminal 50... and the wire red
black on terminal 50 needs to be lengthened and connected to terminal 85 on
the relay.

put a remote start switch in the engine bay , connect it from terminal 30 to
terminal 87 on the relay..
when you are doing a tune up.. you can start the engine using that switch...

hope that helps
Jamie

> I've searched the archives but can't find anything directly to answer my
question. My starter appears to have a LOT more wires on it, than any pics
I've seen.

 I want to install a hard start relay, but am a bit hesitant about how to
connect it up with this unknown to me connection???> Thanks,
