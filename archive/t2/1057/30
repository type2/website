I read that completely wrong. I read "mint condition totaled Beetle" and 
wondered why would they want to show off that? Then some intelligence 
tricked back into my head.

I wonder if the modern auto industry is like some of the union shops I 
have worked in on projects. Not saying unions are bad or anything like 
that but those companies are different for whatever reason - seems to be 
a huge divide between the guys out on the floor, the engineers and the 
managers.

They don't have the same team spirit that the regular shops I worked for 
have. Sure in those shops there are some unhappy people too but overall 
the atmosphere has been a little more easy going. Heck the Navy was like 
that for me - the enlisted vs the officers. A big purposeful divide.

Maybe all those divisions of VW work against them (and any other car 
maker). There are the factories and the dealers and the North American 
guys and the European guys, etc and they don't see things the same way 
or work towards the same goals aside from making a profit.

You comments and ideas are welcomed b/c as usual I have fewer answers 
than questions...
