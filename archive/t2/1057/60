Installed a woodstove in my manufactured house (read "mobile home") last
year (safely, BTW, do not want to wake up to a self-barbeque!).  For the
cost of a 50% off (out of season) woodstove, a chimney kit, a chainsaw and
some elbow grease, I can heat my home for almost no cost.  Works great,
heats the entire house and is very efficient.  After 24/7, I get about a
gallon of ash from the stove.  I can get hardwood for free during the spring
and summer (won't and don't burn pine or other softwoods), usually for the
work of getting it off of someone's property.

Also replaced all of the lights with CFL's, even the nightlights, but with
LED's.  Replaced the old inefficient AC with two high efficiency window
units.  As well as a new (used) high efficiency clothes dryer and a new
stove.  Saved something like $55.00, $45.00, and $135.00 US on my summer
electric bills this year compared to last year.

Only ten payments to go and the house is mine.  Whoo-hoo!

Anyway, while I was installing the woodstove, I toyed with the idea of
installing a very small one in our bus.  Found some plans on the 'Net for
some custom jobs, but thought that I could come up with something I liked
better on my own.  Never settled on a design, and won't now until I replace
the bus, but it was a novel idea to play with.  I figure that it would need
to be an efficient woodstove design rather than a "fireplace" or "pot belly
stove" design.
