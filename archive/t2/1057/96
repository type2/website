everheard of doing this?

No no no. He is wrong wrong wrong. The tie rods ONLY adjust toe - in or out.
He is wanting to screw up your box by taking the lazy way out.

You center the steering wheel AFTER toe is set and the steering box is set to
the center of its travel by popping off the drag link and turning it. They are
adjustable for this reason.
