Not mine, but I checked it out for the guy (I was driving my bus and he followed me into the shopping center parking lot)  Pretty solid camper with all the camping goodies and bits present.  I also happen to know that you could probably get it for about $1000 below his asking price....Here's the ad:

Again, not mine, but I did look at it in person.

PEACE!
