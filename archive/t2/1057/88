Hi folks,

FWIW I visited the Carson City Pick-N-Pull today with a friend.  We 
pulled a trans for my 87 GTI and a rear axle for his rabbit truck.

Not a lot of VW's in the yard, but a 68 westy very picked over, still 
had good-looking NLA trans mount there and icebox unit (looked ok but 
the rest of the cabinets were trashed to remove the bed)  all the 
suspension and brakes intact.  poptop hinges there but poptop gone. 

Also a '79 passenger bus, straight nose, sliding door parts and slider 
windows, trans gone, FI engine almost complete--AFM opened up, dizzy 
gone but all the rest (S boot, throttle body, egr valve, AAR, injectors 
etc intact, CSV busted)--heat exchangers toast but decent crossover pipe 
w/egr good and cat (shhh) and muffler (tailpipe broken off).  did not 
see a cali sticker so not sure what it is, also didn't look for the 
ecu.  i pulled the timing scale for my 73 project. . .

however, Adam told me he saw another bay bus being towed into the yard 
for disposal, and on our way back on 50 W we saw a late model westy 
vanagon (87-90?) on a flatbed heading to the yard--I think it was the 
dark blue/gray color--with a horrific frontal impact that most likely is 
the one from this tragic story:  *http://tinyurl.com/6k2uju.*

Sad story but if there's anything needed from the first 2 or the 2 
additional buses that will be out in the yard soon please let me know.  
I will be back there within the next 30 days to return my trans core.  
also cool stuff there is a 55 Desoto and a '67? MGB-GT fastback.
