Subject: Der Multivan: WAS  [T2] Going Down to VW HQ to Throw a Rock

Looking on the VW.de site, Der mothership still sells a "Multivan" which 
looks like a modern version of the Vanagon or Eurovan.
It is here:
http://www.volkswagen.de/vwcms_publish/vwcms/master_public/virtualmaster/de3/modelle/multivan.html

Then there is the Sharan which is like the Routan here:
http://www.volkswagen.de/vwcms_publish/vwcms/master_public/virtualmaster/de3/modelle/sharan.html

SO why are the idiots in VW USA trying to push the Sharan/Routan on the Bus market when they still MAKE a Bus?
