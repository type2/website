Subject: Adding Windshield sill drainage

It seems like a very common problem on our vehicles: windshield sill
rust. Is there an alternative solution?

I'm currently cutting up my '71 and upon removal of the windshield I
found a pool of water and a lot of rust that wasn't there 4 years ago
when I installed a new windshield and seal. I was hoping to use this
sill on my '75 which also has bad under windshield rusting, but it
looks like I might have to do some metal purchasing. Aside from using
the best possible seals (I was unable to use my German seal at the
last windshield install because the installers couldn't get it to seat
correctly - they used their "who knows where its from" seal instead)
what else can I do? Some search of the archives suggest using a
sealant, but I'd imagine if that was really necessary VW would have
done it in the factory.

What about adding additional drainage holes in the windshield sill?
Anyone here ever tried it? Any reason off the tops of your collective
heads why it would be a bad idea and I should just forget about it
now?

Thanks in advance

PS: I've got plenty of spare '71 parts available I could share with
the list. Email me on the side.
