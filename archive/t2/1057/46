Your Scout meets emission standards set forth for it when it was new.  It
doesn't meet today's standards.

The Hummer (an H1) doesn't have emissions standards, since it's a
>10,000lb GVRW truck.  (those rules have changed, which is one of the
reasons they stopped selling them...).

My '03 Mini only has to meet '03 rules.  My '60 IHC (1 ton) meets '60
rules.


The problems with the Smart's emission issues had more to do with our
flawed /diesel/ rules (which don't, or didn't, take in to account that it
burns diesel, not gasoline).


And bus content:  A '08 bus from brazil won't meet US specs for '08.
Therefore, you can't have an '08 bus in the US (actually, you can, but
you'd have to be a diplomat, or bring it in as a "show" or "race" vehicle
that isn't driven on public roads).
