Subject: Volkswagen [was many others]

The main thing I don't understand is Volkswagen of American.

We saw Volkswagen of Germany with its Multivan

modelle/multivan.html

We saw Volkswagen of Brazil with it modern Bay, the Kombi

But did you notice the pictures of family on the beach, the use flex fuel,
etc...  Everything is an embracing of their customers and their customer's
needs.  What we get in American (and apparently in Canada as well) is
marketing hype, discontinuity, and a company that is out-of-touch with it
current customers wanting to be the next yuppie (or whatever it's called now)
plaything.  Let's face it, if people want a BMW, SAAB, etc... they are going
to buy a BMW, SAAB, etc...  The very name "Volkswagen" means "people's car"
not the elite's car.  It is time for Volkswagen of America to embrace their
heritage and who they are and build on it like so many people on this list
have suggested.  Why is something so simple to so many people so hard for them
to understand.

As for the emissions and such issues as flex fuel and mpg, we here in America
have it all wrong.  Emissions testing is not a bad thing BUT pushing more air
through the exhaust to dilute what you are producing for some meter is merely
playing with numbers and not addressing the root problem.  I have seen MANY
older carbureted low tech cars pass emissions tests without playing the "smoke
and mirrors" game of new vehicles.   Furthermore, when you can get 30mpg and
higher (I've seen almost 50mpg with some) out of a 40+ year old vehicle
technology and when the same vehicle's produced today by Ford, Chevrolet,
etc... get higher mpg in other countries, there is something wrong.

I say let's stop talking about a "global economy" and allow us to start
importing some of these other vehicles so that the manufacturers can see where
the demand and desires truly are.

Viva la resistance!

Peace,
