Explain the rules to me - the gov't measures parts-per-million but not
pollution-per-mile?



Its not about total pollution, it is about how much of your exhaust is the
"bad" part.



Dumping tons of exhaustB but the ppm is in check, your just fine.



I am not sure exactly how they do it but their is an emission standard that is
constant for everything beyond a ceirtain year, around 1985 or '87, my '77
bus, '75 Volvo 164, and '76 Scout all have the same requirement, there isn't a
different requirement for every single year, at least not in Oregon..



There is two different requirements for this category, vehicles that were
manufactured with a cat have slightly stricter rules, all 3 of my vehicles
came without a cat.



The Scout is gone, just my Volvo and Bus now.



This is a totally different deal than what new imported cars have to go
through to get past the EPA.
