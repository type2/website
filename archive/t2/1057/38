Subject: Re: [T2] Meanwhile in Brazil, El Kombi!

Looking carefully at the site, the current Kombi has an in-line 
water-cooled 4.  Bet it has a lot of power.

It's funny.  I can register my 78 fine, except for paying extortion to 
the gods of bureaucracy to get it through smog every 2 years.  People 
are buying these little ""smart-car" death traps and little Honda FIT's 
but a solid steel Bus won't pass.

It's a bit beyond me.  But boy would I like a new one to plan a Westy 
kit onto.
