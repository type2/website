Subject: RE: [T2] Meanwhile in Brazil, El Kombi!

30 years later and I'm still kicking myself.

In the late 80's I worked at SCAT.  They were bringing in Brazilian 'kit'
Crew Cabs.  Brand spanking new Crew Cabs!  The complete body was all
assembled already.  The engine was built and strapped to a pallet, as was
the trans, shift rod, wheels, and hardware.  Bay window up front,
split-style in the back.  IRS, but Rhino bug trans and upright motor with
Alt.

I had a hard time working, cuz I was just drooling all over myself!  They
were so nice. . . and I was so broke!!  My son was 2, my (ex-)wife was
pregnant with my daughter and I was riding my skateboard to work!

I watched, one by one, as they got sold out from under me.  I think they
brought in a total of 7.
