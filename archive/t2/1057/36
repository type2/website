Probably because the T5 "Multivan" would probably sell for around $30K to
$40K based on the exchange rate and having it upgraded to US DOT specs.  Der
mothership giveth and taketh away......

The only way VW would be able offer something that comparable and be
affordable in the US is to build it in Mexico or maybe in a new facility in
the US - VW dropped the ball when they closed the Westmorland plant in PA.
Just what happens when the managment was and still is short-sighted.
