To get the Smart into the U.S. it took years of re-design and doubled the
price, in Canada they have a diesel Smart car with about 80 mpg.



I have said before and will many more times, our smog testing is seriously
flawed, we test on ppm, as in how much of the total volume of exhaust is bad
stuff, not on how much bad stuff do you produce.



My old Scout got 5-7 mpg and passed emmissions with flying colors, same with a
Hummer, but a Smart car or a new Brazilian Bay that gets 4 orB 5 times the
mileage can't pass.



Smart cars passed crash testing before they passed everything else.

are buying these little ""smart-car" death traps
