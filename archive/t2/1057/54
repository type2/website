The PPM rule was designed to stop cheating and give accurate results even
when massive exhaust leaks exist upstream. If it was a "pound per mile"
rule, I could drill a hole in my header and run xx% of my exhaust out
through a scooter muffler and pass easily. ;-)

I love the Smart cars. I agree the DOT and EPA rules were a bit excessive
there. But I can only imagine what horrors would be on the road now without
those agencies.
