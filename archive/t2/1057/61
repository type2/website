Subject: Starter connections on my 77 Westy

I've searched the archives but can't find anything directly to answer my question. My starter appears to have a LOT more wires on it, than any pics I've seen. There is an electrical bar connector on one terminal that holds a number of wires together in it, which I've never seen before. The Westy is a deluxe with a fridge and gas heater, Canadian model. Can anyone enlighten me on why I have such a large number of wires to the one terminal? I'm at work right now and can't take a pic of it, or provide more info as to terminal no. but I THINK it's the big red wire connector. I'm sure others know what I'm talking about. I want to install a hard start relay, but am a bit hesitant about how to connect it up with this unknown to me connection??? Despite cleaning all connections my vw still hesitates on cold mornings when I hit the starter, there is about a 1 second delay before it actually turns over. Any suggestions GREATLY appreciated.
Thanks,
Courtney
