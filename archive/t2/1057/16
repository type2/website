I was at a music festival last month in Northern CA and I was the ONLY 
Bay Westy camping.  The rest were a couple dozen Vanagons and one or two 
Eurovan conversions.  Bend members had a dual cab Splittie and a Bay but 
no campers form that era.

Several of the Vanagon guys came over to talk and a couple of them still 
had their Bay Westy's at home.

I've fixed mine up too much to stop using it now, though a Vanagon 
Diesel might be a good daily driver.
