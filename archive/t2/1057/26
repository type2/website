In the eyes of VW the new Beetle was a failure, it was supposed to appeal to
college graduates and instead it appealed more to baby-boomers, which
destroyed its whole purpose.



Studies show that in the majority of cases the first car you buy after college
determines the brand you stay with your whole life, FWIW the PT Cruiser also
was built for this purpose and failed for the same reason, the Scion is doing
much better.



Studies have also shown that the generation headed off to college or about to
graduate don't make attachments to things like cars, computers, mp3 players,
clothes, fishing poles, furniture.



They shop for the cheap here and now andB toss it out, they think people that
don't are OLD, they shop at IKEA, they think cars are fashion accessories,
most young girls like cars that are "cute."



Even if this generation liked your old VW better, they couldn't risk letting
people their own age know that.



Advertising is the result of billions of dollars of research, plus some risk,
and when it comes to cars the target is the average college graduate shopping
for their first new car.
