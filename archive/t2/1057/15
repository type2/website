Out here on the Left Coast (Ventura, Santa Barbara, Santa Monica Beach,
Venice Beach on down to San Diego), we do see a few Bay Window Type 2s at
the beach, but they're greatly out-numbered by the proliferation of Vanagons
as the "vehicle of choice" of beach-goer and surfer alike.  I guess it's
more of a "California thing".

Oh...and don't knock us Kia drivers.  I have a 2004 Spectra EX for daily
driving during the week when I don't need to use either one of my Vanagons
and because I get twice the mileage too.
