Volks,

The grand total of funds raised for the Boston Bob Memorial Fund is
$16,050.00.

Karen Donalds has asked that I convey the following;

"The Donalds family is very grateful to the VW Bus Community. The
donations collected have enabled our family to cover living expenses
until life insurance dollars are available, which is probably a couple
of months away. Without this help, I don't know what we would have
done. It is difficult to express how much this has meant to us."

Karen went on to say

"We are equally grateful to the bus community for all the stories from
so many about their interactions with Bob. How he helped, inspired and
meant so much to so many. We knew Bob as a hard working, caring,
loving, wonderful dad and husband but never really understood how much
he meant to the community. The stories about Bob have made us even
more proud of the man we loved so much. Our children and I are
forever grateful to the community for this gift as well."

Everyone, please take a moment and reflect on what this VW Bus
community was able to accomplish.

This was something very special and we were honored to be part of it.

Thank You for your help,

Larry Chase, Daryl Christensen, Jim Akiba & Maggie Dew,
