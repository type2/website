Subject: Re: [T2] minimal current through starter switch

For this application it would be better to use an opto-MOS relay.  You
still only need a few milliamps to turn the relay on, but the output
can handle a lot more current, depending on which one you get.  They
are also designed to switch inductive loads (like electromechanical
relays and motors) without any further protection.
