Subject: 72 Turn Signal

Hello List,

I have a 72 Bus and the turn signal/high beam switch is broken and  
the part is no longer available.  I just got a photo from a parts  
supplier of the 68-71 switch.  It looks the same as the 72 switch,  
does anyone know what the difference is?  Can the 68/71 switch be  
fitted to the 72 Bus?

Thank you,
John Ingram
