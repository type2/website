-------------

Our local Volkswagen Clubs mailing list is maintained by Google Groups.
See...  http://groups.google.com/group/CAVWC

People can setup profiles, you can post pages, people can decide whether they
want No Email (Read on web), Email (Each message), Abridged Email (Summary
email of activity each day), or Digest Email (All new messages send together
each day in one email).  Distribution of the management of group is available.
You do not have to have a Google email account.  It is fully searchable and
you can follow threads by sender, subject, etc... And, best of all, its Free!

It has been really very useful tool in our club.

Just a suggestion.
