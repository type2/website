Subject: Re: [T2] Gasket sealer on MC?

Jim makes a great point that I've made many times, O-rings work by a very
specific compression of the seal, and most of the time gasket sealer doesn't
help them seal (actually harms the seal) and is not a replacement...   That
being said, the thing about vacuum (brake booster) is that it is very low
pressure as things go, at max 14.7psi of atmospheric pressure if you can pull
an absolute vacuum, which your engine sure isn't coming close to.  The
o-ring is a very common part used on darn near every VW through the 90's?, but
in a pinch, up against the wall, with perfectly clean parts, and giving it a
good day to set up afterwards, I might try it.  Of course this is on brakes,
not that anything isn't important, won't effect the absolute ability to stop,
but can make it a lot harder to if if fails.  And chronic leaks on the booster
tubing/system are a great cause of engine killing sizeable vaccum leaks on a
bus, so does that 2 weeks seem really that
 bad?

Gasket sealer isn't going to function in the same manner as an O-Ring,
might
have an air leak maybe?  Not sure if I'd trust gasket sealer in this
instance.
