Subject: Won't start again ...

Hi to all,
This is a '82 Vanagon with California set up.
Interesting thing happened.  I got a van that I did not start for a couple of
years.  Today I put a new battery in there, turn on the ignition and it
started right away.  Was running for about five minutes and when I was about
to reverse out from its rut, it stalled.  No problem, I thought, and I wanted
to start it again but it would not.  Got an other battery to help it going
faster, No.
Then I pushed the gas pedal way down turned the key and it was slowly getting
happier but it still would not start.  Something like flooding.
Now, if it's flooding, how do I stop that?  Or what is it that makes this
happen?  Shell I disconnect the cold start injector?  Is there an item I need
to change to make it normal?
Thanks for any help,
Best wishes from Zoltan
