Now THAT'S the kind of answer I like, right down to the minute details. Thanks Jamie! Will be all over this after I finish writing 29 report cards out for my students!! I like your idea of the remote starter switch too, but I assume I'd have the key turned on till the idiot lights light up on the dash in order to start the van with this? Appreciate the help!

-Jamie did write -

The main stud [term 30] of the starter should have
 red white wire for double relay
 red wire should have a black loom over it that goes to alt B+
 LARGE red wire from B+
 red wire to term 70 of the analysis system socket .. square plug 
 upper right
 side of engine bay door area

 small spade terminal [50]  of the starter has a
 red white wire that goes to the fuse panel S9
 red black wire that comes from the ignition switch term 50

 
 put your WR-1 relay in the engine bay near the voltage regulator...
 connect terminal 30 on the relay to the battery +ve
 connect terminal 86 to ground
 connect terminal 87 to the starter spade terminal 50... and the 
 wire red
 black on terminal 50 needs to be lengthened and connected to 
 terminal 85 on
 the relay.
 
 put a remote start switch in the engine bay , connect it from 
 terminal 30 to
 terminal 87 on the relay..
when you are doing a tune up.. you can start the engine using 
that switch...
