Good points. Is the modern consumer more fickle? Less informed? Too many 
choices? Snap decisions made when shopping?

When I shop for anything $50 and up (certainly houses and cars) I 
research my choices to death. I don't buy  stuff that often so I 
generally have time to do the reading.

Heard a story about a woman who went from a Town Car to an Aveo to be 
more frugal. Brought the car back days later when she realized it had 
crank up windows.

Who doesn't notice things like that during the shopping?
