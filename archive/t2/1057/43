Subject: Las Vegas Area Campout

Hey All,

I'm toying with the idea of organizing a multi-day (Friday and Saturday
nights) campout in the Las Vegas, NV area next spring. 

Would there be any interest within the group for a campout around March?

I'm thinking of the Valley of Fire State Park, which is about 45 minutes
outside of Las Vegas, and about 30 minutes from Lake Mead National
Recreation Area. It is gorgeous in the spring! High temps in the low 70s,
Low temps in the 50s; with no rain to speak of (but it could happen).

Here are a couple pics from my last trip:

Anyway, if anyone is interested, let me know!
