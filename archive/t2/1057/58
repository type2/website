Wait a few more months and GM and Chrysler will be gone as we know them 
now. Then perhaps the imports will move and take up the slack in the 
markets.

Whatever the case if GM actually goes broke maybe they'll come back with 
a new game plan.

Perhaps Opel will get spunoff and actually stock Saturn with real 
Euro-imports that are efficient and clever. I could live with "Saturn by 
Opel" glued to the tailgates for a few years while they made the brand 
transition.

I really don't like the hard times we might be facing but it's one way 
(the most effective way) for people to face reality. Reality of 
consumption habits, debt habits, priorities, etc.

Meanwhile I continue to drive old vehicles both unable and unwilling to 
spend my cash on anything new again. Just not rich enough to not miss 
the $400 per month a new vehicle might represent.

As much as I would like to have a late model people hauler I'll stick 
with our dusty (but not crusty) Westfalia.
