Hi Jamie,
           The device you are looking for is called an opto-isolator. 
Essentially the ignition switch turns on an led which shines across an
insulated space and turns on a photo transistor.  Minimum isolation is usually
1500 volts.  The photo transistor can be used to turn on your relay.  Put a
reverse polarity diode across the photo transistor to deal with the voltage
spikes from the relay.  Durable, widely used, and very inexpensive.

$1:31 ea.  There are probably better and/or cheaper ones.

For a couple more dollars one could use fiber optics to couple an led at the
dash with a photo transistor in the engine bay.  Really good isolation of the
start switch.
