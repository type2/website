Hi Zoltan,

I bet it backfired as it stalled and it blew a vacuum line off, or 
cracked one of the rubber bits.  Not at all uncommon with an FI system 
that has sat and got brittle over the years.

Check ALL the hoses, even the small diameter lines. That used to happen 
on my Dad's 82 westy at least once a year.

Happy Trails,
