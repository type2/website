Subject: Re: [T2] minimal current through starter switch

Chris,
    50 ma should be enough to turn on a helper relay, or not? If it isn't for
the relay of choice, one more transistor will get it done.  I expect that
someone that can read a spec sheet can probably put the rest of the parts
around the device, or find out how.  An opto isolator is the best way to
isolate the ignition switch from the starter circuit, with minimal current
through the switch contacts and no back emf, if that is what one wants to do. 
It's pretty much what that class of device was developed to do.  That
particular opto isolator  will also need a 5v regulator for the input circuit
.  Not meant to be a finished design,  just an option for further thought. 
There are thousands of types of these devices, that was just the first one on
the Digikey list with a price and availability.   Many more with higher
current capability.  jon

ps I subscribe to the "clean both ends of all cables and do starter
maintenance every fall" club.  Never had a starter switch go bad yet.  j
