Subject: Re: [T2] Going Down to VW HQ - Better Idea!

It isn't the commercial, it's the minivan and the lousy presumption an 
older past splitty owner would slather over seeing the  Routan go 
by.....- my daughter (has a 75 bus) looked at it and bacically said it 
was another engine in the front crap minivan like all the others with a 
vw logo in front!  With that giant shifter in the dash no less it must 
be aimed at the baby boomer crowd.....

  I work at one of the largest US VW Dealers.  I would be more than happy to
forward the good ones to the people that need to get it!
