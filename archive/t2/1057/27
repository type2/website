What they missed was the fact that most people buy a _used_ car after
college.

The Scion was doing marginally better, though there are quite a few
tooling around Leisure World.  Toyota spoiled it when they redesigned the
line-leading xB, making it fatter, rounder, and less economical.  They're
going to be blown away when Nissan and Kia bring their "2-box" cars to
the US.

VW wants to use nostalgia when it suits them, but only as an
attention-getter.  They really don't want people thinking too much about
the amenities of their aircooled vehicles.

The only thing I can think of when I hear the name "Routan" is the
aircraft designer Burt Rutan.  It's ironic, since there isn't anything
innovative about the Routan.  Rutan should sue.
