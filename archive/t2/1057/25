===================

I agree.  Before I committed my vehicle "fleet" to almost all VWs it was
almost all Chevrolets.  My wife and I have always been committed (or is it
that we should be committed) to old metal.  Our motto is that "rust isn't
contagious, just habit forming".  And I think what keeps us loving our VWs
today is the memories of yesterday...our childhoods.  For example, my dad had
a VW Beetle when I was little and we went everywhere in it.  My wife's family
had Beetles and a Transporter and she was thoroughly "embarrassed" by it
growing-up but now she wouldn't trade ours for anything.  Customers keep going
to these dealers not just because of the mechanical but because of the
memories, the nostalgia, the ties to the past.  If we wanted something merely
mechanical we would just buy ANY vehicle.  Like a kid (about 11 or 12) on the
street told me the other day about my bus... "I like your vehicle because all
the rest look the same."  And he is right, there isn't much difference between
a Toyota, Honda, Chevrolet, Ford, or whatever.  You can't even expound the
"virtue" of "buy American" anymore because there many times are more American
parts and labor into a "foreign car" than a "domestic" today.

As for dealers, they are equally clueless.  Our local VW club has little
recognition and no support from the local dealer.  We have even had former
club members, who have worked there, chastised for bringing their OLD vehicles
on the premises.  But, in all fairness, when I was I driving my 57 Chevy
around the local Chevrolet dealer didn't help out much either.  There have
been glimmers of hope.  I thought Volkswagen finally was showing a little
appreciation for its heritage when the New Beetle came out (As I did when
Chevrolet repackaged its Impala and Ford did with its Mustang and Dodge did
when talking about it "Hemi".) but it never seems to last.

Let's all cross our fingers and hope the pendulum we swing again and
Volkswagen will actually listen to Max (the 1964 black Beetle you see in some
of the new commercials) and redesign that Routan with the thought of "German
engineering" and embracing the past.
