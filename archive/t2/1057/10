I remember when I was a young kid, and my parents would actually drive me to school (as apposed to me walking). Especially since at the time, I was going to a really expensive school, and... my parents were by no means poor, but everyone else was driving Ferraris and Lamborginis and the run of the mill kid's parents were driving Mercedes. My dad on the other hand is ultra-conservative, so he drove a Volvo 240. Not to be outdone, it was a 2-door Turbo coupe with a manual. But, a Volvo 240 none the less.

I guess at the time, it was important for me that other people thought my parents were "awesome" and had all the latest and greatest things. Mind you, my parents are awesome, but not because of the stuff they own or don't own. But I guess at the time, that seemed important to me.
