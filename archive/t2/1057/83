Subject: Re: [T2] Gasket sealer on MC?

Why not just get it from the VW Dealer?  VW PN 357 611 243.  Fits not only
the Bus but a TON of VW Watercooleds as well.  They might even have it on
the shelf.

Gasket sealer isn't going to function in the same manner as an O-Ring, might
have an air leak maybe?  Not sure if I'd trust gasket sealer in this
instance.
