When I say administrative overhead, I mean the part involving all the 
technicalities of running the list (server, hosting, etc).  I think list 
management/administration/oversight is still an integral and needed 
part.  While all of the current tools are nice, it is pretty obvious 
that this has become an administrative burden to keep everything 
running.  I think it is time to offload those responsibilities and/or 
downgrade to a hosted solution such that the community doesn't need to 
maintain it's own server and worry about faulty hardware.

I am a member of quite a few large and civil mailing lists hosted on 
sites such as YahooGroups.  I don't think the list software makes the 
list civil, the people on the list make it civil.  Having a bunch of 
tools to keep a subscriber history is handy, but if it comes down to a 
lack of money to manage hardware, I don't think it's an end-all reason 
to shut down the list just because we can't have those features.

However, that aside, virtual hosted sites a super cheap and web space 
can be had for free without any ads through palosverdes.com.  I would be 
curious as to what are the current costs incurred and maybe we can find 
a way to compromise and find a happy medium so there is less technical 
administrative burden and cost at the same time.

Mike
