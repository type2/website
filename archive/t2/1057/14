In this case, I'd say the factory was wrong.   They weren't planning on
these things to last this long!

There are good reasons why manufacturers stopped using molded rubber
windshield (and eventually window) seals, and started gluing the glass in.
Movement of the glass and rubber (vibration, heat/cool cycles, etc etc)
eventually chews up the paint in the sill, and we get rust.

Not to mention that rust "repair" that's typically done in these areas is
far from complete.


As for what to use....Eric and Barb recommend tar (but they live in the
PNW).  I've generally had good luck with a /good/ silicone.  There are
some urethane based sealants out there, too.  Whatever it is, it needs to
be able to adhere to the rubber, glass, and paint, but still flex enough
to deal with vibration and heating/cooling cycles.

Where would they drain to?  Inside the bus?  That's what's under the
sill... I thought we wanted the water outside! ;)
