Subject: allignment question on 71

Had my 71 Westy alignment done today and the guy told me that if I put an
adjustable tie rod on the left side (replace the non adjustable one)  - it
would make it easier to center the steering wheel (it points to the left
going straight about 2 inches now) I found this intriguing . Anyone ever
heard of doing this? 

 

Trey (next up is to adjust the play in the steering)
