Hey Rennie,

Chris' rant was good.

If I was driving by a VW dealer and saw a nice old  bug, bus or squareback 
up on a pedestal out front with a large sign that said something like:
If you like our vintage vehicles, you will Love our New Ones! Come on in for 
a test drive!
I might actually stop in for a look. What more does a good salesman need? (a 
sale of course).
