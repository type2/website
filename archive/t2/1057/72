Subject: ADMIN: New type2.com Treasurer!

We should have sent this earlier, but here goes:

Ted Finesman (tedebare) has steped down from his long held post as 
treasurer.   We've appointed Leah Wical (who came highly recommended) to 
replace him.

Leah will be handling the donations and sorting out the money and payments 
from now on, and is working on transitioning everything.
