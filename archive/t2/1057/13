Subject: Re: [T2] Adding Windshield sill drainage

Ok Ok, go ahead and drill a hole into the lowest point of the sill, maybe two
or three, braze in a short tube and run a rubber hose down and out the drain
hole you drill in the floor.

Add Henry's roofing tar to the sill before installing the seal and windshield.
A little messy, but it cleans up nicely with a little WD-40
