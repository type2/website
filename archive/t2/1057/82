Subject: Gasket sealer on MC?

Could I use gasket sealer in place of the square cut O-Ring that goes between
the MC and Booster. I've searched the forums on the samba, tried the Mercedes
dealer with the part # I got on thesamba and Mercedes here told me they can't
get it. Bus Depot shows it but I don't want to wait 2 weeks. Can't find it
listed on Wolfsburg West site. So: should gasket sealer work?
