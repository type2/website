Subject: Re: [T2] 72 Turn Signal

Actually, it's pretty simple IF you know the differences between 68-71 and
72 only wiring.  It boils down to this:

Ignore the Black w/Red Stripe, Black w/Yellow Stripe and Grey w/Black Stripe
wires coming from the replacement switch.  These are what operate the Rear
Turn and Stoplight circuits on the 68-71, which were Double Filament Single
Bulbs (1157) for each side.  On 72's the Stoplight circuits run direct from
the Stoplight Switches (rather than thru the Switch on 68-71's) to Single
Filament Bulbs (1156) and the Turn Signal Bulbs (also 1156) run on their own
separate circuits.

On a 72 Bus, simply concern yourself with the Black w/White Stripe (Left)
and Black w/Green Stripe (Right) wires to operate both the front and rear
Turn Signal Bulbs.  The existing connecting block(s) in the harness actually
make this easy for you PROVIDED someone hasn't "butchered" the harnesses
underneath the dashboard.  In addition, the other wires (Black w/Green &
White - to the Hazard Light Switch Terminal 49a) and the Headlight Dimmer
Relay Wires (Brown w/White Strip to the Relay and Brown to Chassis Ground)
are self-explanatory.

It also helps to have a Wiring Diagram ( see http://www.vintagebus.com )
whether replacing with the original, replacement or the make-do I described
above.

It just so happens that I have a NOS (New Old/Original Stock) 72 Only
Bus Turn Signal Switch For Sale (Original SWF Germany), as I was just about
throw it up on The Samba as soon as I get a photo to load with the ad
sometime next week.  Asking price is $150 including Priority Mail to
anywhere in the USA, a bit higher if going to Canada.
