Subject:  FI Confusion

David and List,

Thanks for your time.

I am having some confusion regarding L-Jetronic FI system related issues on 
the list.

I found that running lean air/fuel ratios was deadly for my 77 bus. It cost 
me $2500 and a lot of work.

Since that time I have made an effort to understand how FI works on my bus. 
I have collected literature and test equipment along with a extra 77 bus FI 
system and am assembling a mock-up of the 77 FI system.

Along the way I developed a simple theoretical math model of the 
relationship of the air and fuel manifold pressures in the open and closed 
77 system. I plan a series of tests to compare the model with the real 
world.

When I run across statements in conflict with the current version of the 
model, I am very interested.

Lately someone on the list made the statement that certain vacuum leaks 
could cause a rich air/fuel condition. I don't understand how that could 
happen. If you have an understanding of this please let me know.

If I misunderstood and no one supports that statement fine. Otherwise
I am keen to learn more.


Chuck
