I checked the law and wonder if the following quote within it applies to
our horizontal cylinders obviously build befor 98......
"The 2001 edition of NFPA 58 modified requirements to exempt horizontal
cylinders manufactured before October 1, 1998, from requiring OPDs. Also
exempt are cylinders used for industrial trucks, industrial welding and
cutting gases (these cylinders must be labeled with their use)."
