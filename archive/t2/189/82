I very much agree, Jack.  Ten seems average to me as well.  And on the
last couple adjustments, my general rule is that if I felt the points
plate move, then I moved it too far.  The last couple of adjustments are
"whispering" at it.

Under "funny stories :-)... in retrospect :-(," I also have to say that it
is a *VERY* good idea to check the attachments of your dwell meter every
so often, if not every time!  Any number of people at Everybus who
observed me setting the dwell on one of the buses I did will testify that
nothing makes me swear like setting and resetting dwell without getting it
to move from 90 degrees (I did this 4-5 times!) and then discovering the
alligator clip has come off the coil!!!!!!!!!!!!!

BTW, on tolerances, I have always found that the T1 dwell spec is looser
than the T4 dwell spec.  45-55 degrees on a T1 produces an engine that
runs pretty well.  Closer is better, but the difference between 48 and 52
is really not noticable.  The T4 spec as published is really too loose.  I
find that there is a very noticable difference between 48 and 50.  I would
say to keep trying until you get the dwell on a T4 in the 49-51 range.

AMEN!!!!  This was possibly the best idea that GM *ever* came up with.
The corvair was good, maybe even great, but the allen-wrench points were
pure genius!!!  I surely do wish that someone would come up wiht a set of
points with this adjustment mechanism that fit a bus.  Yes, you would have
to drill and plug a hole in the dist can, but it would be *worth* it!!!!
