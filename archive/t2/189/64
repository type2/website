Subject: tune-up madness

bought the '68 breadloaf a while ago but haven't put
much mileage on it because i've been fixing stuff and
passing inspections, etc. First tune up.

 For what its worth. the bus has been running
fantastically (and cool, even in 90* weather). But i
figured i put off the tuneup long enuff.

did valves. most of them were tight--as if the p.o.
had set 'em at .004. They're all .006 now.

headscratcher 1. how do you get the %#(-at-)! points
adjusted? they were tight. I adjust using a feeler for
rough guidance, then put the dist. back together and
final check with a dwell meter. I can't seem to get
closer than about 10 degrees to the recommended 50
degrees. After an hour of frustration, I left them to
the loose side. For the love of god-- Is there a
trick?

headscratcher 2. tho the bus is an early '68, my
engine appears to be a '66 to '67 single port. the
serial number starts with HO. The books say i should
time it to 7.5 btdc.  But my crank pulley only has ONE
notch, presumably 0 degrees. (did someone switch
pulley's in the bus' checkered past?)

Any guidance appreciated.

BTW, took the bus for a test run--it still runs great.
