Chuck,

Yes, you have correctly stated the purpose of the fuel pressure regulator.
It keeps the difference in pressure constant between the fuel and the intake
air. This keeps the "flow per second" constant out of the injector.
Theoretically if the pressure regulator overcompensated in this fashion it
could provide enrichment based on engine load - but to my understanding this
is not the purpose.
