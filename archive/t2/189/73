Subject: Guage Wires

Help!

I am moving forward with the installation of my guages and after a long
afternoon's work I find the the provided wires on the head temp sensor and
the pressure guage are WAY TOO SHORT!!!. I ran them by the shortest route I
could figure but they only JUST come up through the floor of the cab. I need
another 4 feet or so to reach the guages! I double and triple checked the
part numbers and they are correct for my 74 bus. These are all VDO from good
vendors and I'm using the VDO wiring kit.

The Question: Can I lengthen these wires without significantly affecting the
guage readings? Soldering the splices, using quality wire, etc? Opinions,
please! Facts even better!

Thanks in advance,
Dave
