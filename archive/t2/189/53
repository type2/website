Subject: RE:  [T2] Canadian Tire - Propane Tank - Retrofit 

Two items:

1.  I have read here that Westy propane tanks are exempt from new US
laws requiring ODP. Can anyone verify and send along the verbiage?

2.  Looking into the Canadian tire retrofit tank 

>The tank is manufactured by Wolfedale Engineering in Mississauga,
Ontario 
>(9056) 275-4948.
>Markings on the tank are:
>3.89 KG
>Model TC4BAM17 WOLFEDALE ENG. M-8903 01 01 WC5.26L
>SND 349219

I found the following reference to a guage for Westy tanks, which may be
of interest:
