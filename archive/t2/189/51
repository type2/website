Subject: Re: [T2] Painting muffler

I used Rustoleum high-temp (1200 deg F) paint on my type1 engine muffler 
and 20,000 miles later,
it's still there.  the paint on the heater boxes isn't. but that's 
largely  because of the oil dripping down
from the valve assembly when I've adjusted my valves.

make sure your muffler is very clean and give it 2-3 coats when you 
paint it, and I think you'll do ok.
