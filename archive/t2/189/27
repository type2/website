Subject: Please Help.  Automatic transmission in '79 Westy stuck in Park.

I've had my '79 Westfalia for almost a year now and yesterday she let me
down for the first time.  The automatic transmission has never been
perfectly smooth but now it is stuck in Park.  When I try to move the handle
down towards Reverse it seems to come out of Park because the idling slows a
bit and when I move back to park and take my foot off of the brake the bus
moves a few inches (my parking space is on an incline).  Does anybody have
any idea of what I should try?  I'm mechanically inclined but have very
little automotive experience.

Thanks,
Boyd
