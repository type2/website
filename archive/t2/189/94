In order to keep the difference between the pressure in the engine, and 
the pressure of the fuel constant, so that the computer knows how much 
fuel it is letting in if it opens for a specific amount of time.

The vacume would be uneffected. The engine will run a little rich at idle, 
and get worse as the engine speed goes up, since fuel pressure will not 
drop as manifold pressure drops.

Yes.

Per above, this is the idea.

No, since the differential pressure is constant, the amount of fuel 
delivered should be constant. Manifold pressure goes up, fiel pressure 
goes up.

Yep. You get it. Get the Probst book. It will explain everything you ever 
wanted to know about L Jetronic, and everything that came after.
