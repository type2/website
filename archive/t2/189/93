Subject: Brake Warning Light On

Okay, I've seen others with this problem in the archives but didn't see any 
replies... the brake warning light is coming on in my 74 westy and only 
turns off when I hit the brakes....  I thought this thing is supposed to 
work the other way around... turn on when you press the brakes and there is 
no pressure in one or both halves of the master cylinder. Well the brakes 
are working fine but this light is on all the time... any suggestions?
