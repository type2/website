Subject: Trying to locate =?iso-8859-1?q?someone=3F?=

I am trying to locate a man that hauls VW's around the country.  I
believe his name is Jim Hall and he was from Illinois.  He stopped by
my house once and we chatted and he showed me pictures of hauling
different VW's and  Roadcow when it had broken down at  one time.  Any
help in getting me his number would be appreciated, it is for a
friend.
