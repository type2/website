Subject: Re: [T2]  FI Confusion

Chuck,

Wasn't me that said it....


I can't imagine how *any* vacum lea....wups...just realized how.

THe only way that I can think of that a vacum leak might make you run 
rich is this...and it's really a reach.....

The vacuum hose to the pressure regulator would have a leak...this might 
make the pressure regulator believe that it was seeing  not much 
vacuum(like wide open throttle) and boost the pressure in the fuel ring a 
little.

Don't know if the  vacuum leak would make up for any difference in the 
fuel ring pressure added "richness" though.  They might actually balance 
out.

Cheers, dave
