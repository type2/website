Hi All,

I wonder if those with the last years of Bays ( '79, and maybe '78 ) =
could clarify something for me.

I recently stripped and cannibalised an Australian '79 DC, as it was =
totally rusted out. What I found when I was stripping it raised many =
questions, about what the hell VW was doing in later years, they cut =
corners on things like welding in Engine Hatch hinges, using fixed =
plates & "standard" bolts for the front doors, used 12 point fasteners =
on the drive shafts (rather than "proper" Allen head bolts which don't =
strip out at the drop if the hat), riveted in the front turn indicators, =
rather than screwing them in, etc.

I presume that all these things were done to reduce the build costs, and =
I was wondering, did this only happen here, or was it wider spread? =
Also, does anyone know when this downward slide started? I was sorely =
disappointed with the quality issues in front of me, because I've been =
used to the quality that you find in the 60's, and early to mid 70's =
VWs, nasty surprise, I had. ;^)

NB: Anyone have any ideas on a motor which I BELIEVE turned OK when I =
picked up the DC about 9 months ago, but now turns freely for about 1/3 =
of a turn and then stops?

BTW: In the midst of my first really unpleasant VW person experience at =
the moment, bought an engineless Type 2 a few months back, and when I =
was arranging to pick it up, the person who was minding it at the time =
asked whether I needed the 1600 transmission it had, or could he take it =
out. As I couldn't see any real need I had for it at the time, and he =
SEEMED to have a need to it, and I was a nice guy ( WAS could be the =
operative term, after this experience ), I said that he could have it if =
he needed it. My situation has now changed, and it looks like I'll need =
to be able to move it about a bit to keep councils etc off my back until =
I can get it done properly ( lost most of my type2 storage space a few =
weeks back, because a friend got moved out of the property they were =
living on :o(, which will require that I get a transmission & motor for =
it, like NOW. Therefore, I contacted him to ask whether he had used it, =
or had any immediate plans for it, as I now had a need for it, I was =
rather set aback and more than a little livid when  I got this reply;

"In answer to your question, the box is sitting around not doing too =
much. I don't know if I'm going to use it yet, it was only going to be =
an option. How about you come and grab it when you've got the car ready =
for it, unless you've got a 2 litre box you could swap for it."

Now, if I had a 2L transmission sitting around, I wouldn't be asking if =
he had used the 1600 one, so I could get it back if he hadn't, would I? =
AND, given his response, if I went and hunted up an engine that I can =
get it running with & then went back to him to get MY transmission, he's =
just as likely to say that he doesn't have it anymore, so I'm stumped =
either way. Pity, really, I've had good experiences with VW folk up to =
now, but this has shaken my faith in the VW crowd over here, find one =
pr*ck, likely to be more in the crowd, isn't there?=20

Any NICE Australian listees around who might be able to put a strapped =
type2 addict onto a 1600 engine and/or a transmission that works ( "just =
runs" would be fine ) at a reasonable price? Not expecting any miracles, =
really, but if ya don't ask, ya' won't find, will you?

All the best,
