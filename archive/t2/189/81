Subject: Questions...

Hey all, Wanda goes into the electricians tomorrow... everyone keep your
fingers crossed for me...

While she's gone, I have a few questions that hopefully someone can
answer...

1.  What are the dimensions of the full width bed?  I only need the Length
and width of the seat and seat back...

2.  I've asked this before but no one responded... I'd really appreciate the
info if anyone knows...  What is the distance from the front bumper up to
the bottom of the spare tire carrier on the front of the bus?  (Or distance
from the bottom of the windshield down?)  It's a spare tire carrier I
ordered from the Bus Depot, but the directions are to line it up with the
holes from the VW logo, however my bus had the BIG vw logo on the front, and
the holes do not line up correctly...

Thanks,
David
