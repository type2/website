Yes, except under WOT conditions.

No.

Don't know the rate of change of fuel manifold pressure vs. that of air 
manifold pressure so I can't answer that, but due to the simplicity of the 
device, my guess is "probably".

No, as I have stated before it varies with manifold pressure.  Oh, you said 
differential pressure.  I'm talking about absolute fuel pressure - thinking 
about differential pressure makes my head hurt so someone else will have to 
answer that.
