We left Reno Nevada on Sunday on our way to Niagara
Falls for the 'Busses by the Falls' get together way
up north in Canada. Overall, a pretty uneventful ride
with our only layover in Detroit for two nights with
an uncle. Crossing the border into Canada was nothing
like the nightmare many people led me to believe. No
problem except that I gave the custom guy a extra
document that he didn't ask for.
We spent three days at the 'Busses by the Falls' and
had a great time. They really know how to put on a
show.
Thanks to Jamie Rivers and all of the people who put
on such a great show! We might even drive the 
2500 miles (one way)again next year.
We are in Scranton PA for the night and plan on going
to see the Statue of Liberty tomorrow and on to
Washington DC after that.

So far the 79 Westy is running fine and we are having
a great time!! One week down and five more to go.
