Glen:  I've been rebuilding and tuning these engines for twenty years 
and I would rate this apparently simple task as one of the most 
frustrating. At one time, I thought of floating a thread on the list 
to invite people to state how many times they moved the points before 
they got dwell to within the 47 - 52 degree spec. Often, I have to do 
so ten times!

In an earlier life, I worked with a C***Y   8 cylinder with a 
distributor that had an allen screw adjuster. One simply  turned the 
allen wrench while watching the dwell  in real time.

Oh for something like this on our VWs.

No help. Just sympathy.
