Subject: '71-'72 or '73+ what do I have brake saga

I continue to wonder what I have.  Today I rebuilt the calipers.  The tip
given by George Lyle was especially helpful in getting the pistons out.  I
only had to pressurize out one piston. I had ordered a rebuild kit for
'71-'72.  It looked like it would work, so I gave it a try, it did.  The two
different versions have different part numbers, so does this mean that I
have '72 brakes since these fit?

The rebuild kit only includes the piston seals and dust covers and two
washers.  I think that both brake versions have he same diameter pistons,
but I do not know for sure.  The rebuild kit seemed to work just fine.  I
think that the main difference is the in the thickness of the pads.  I could
easily put in thicker pads, but then again, my rotor is really thin.

Maybe the only difference between the rebuild kits is in the design of the
dust cover to allow the piston greater travel

I cannot make the '72 (are they really '72) rotors that I ordered work with
these calipers, so back on the crappy old rotors go.  Now all I need is a
good set of rotors.  I ordered a set that is supposed to fit a '72, they do
not work, do I need a '73+ set of rotors?

The calipers that I rebuild looked just fine, much better than the ones that
my mechanic took off.  Those were pitted and I broke off some of the lip
that holds the dust cover when I was rebuilding them.  I have better
calipers now.  They were really nasty though.  One piston was really stuck.
But they are in good shape now.
