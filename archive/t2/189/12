I have pulled them off of other engines i recycled.  but  i think the 
spring and sleeve were probably put back on after changing engines.  
Most of the vehicles i parted out dated to the 60 to 65 time frame.  
only a couple still had their original 1200 engines. The tube through 
the shroud i believe was on all  that had the shroud left on them.
