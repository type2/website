Subject: Re: [T2] T2 -75 spare tire holder removal

I have one of the tire mounts you are describing. The bottom is bolted to the
top of the mumber, 2 holes drilled in it. The top is mounted to the nose with
2 nuts. There is a flat piece of metal with 2 studs on it that is behind the
nose. The studs pass thru 2 holes drilled in the nose. Nice mount, the tire
stays away from the nose and [if I remember right] the spare is facing out so
you can put a hubcap on it.
