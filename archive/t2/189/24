Subject: Vacuum Booster Failure?

'72 stock 7 seater.

Replaced m/c, cleaned painted booster.

Braking is hard, heavy pressure required on pedal.  Backfiring now, it did
not before.  More backfiring when braking.

Under the bus, hissing heard during braking, disconnection of vent line,
vacuum felt whenever pedal pressure is applied.  None when no pedal pressure
applied.

Looking at the pages on http://www.howstuffworks.com/power-brake.htm  it
appear that pedal pressure will vent 1/2 of the diaphragm and the pressure
difference helps to depress the m/c.  I would seem to me that application of
the pedal pressure would vent the air side, but continuous flow seems to me
to indicate a failure.

Questions:

Can anyone qualify this?

Do I need to rebuild my booster?

What else should I check?

What is the tel # for the place in Dallas that rebuilds boosters?

Thanks in advance.
