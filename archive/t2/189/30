Subject: head removal & vw tech article

Well, yesterday, I finally started down that road to fix my '79 Westy
(needs new heads).  It took at least 8 hours to drop the engine, half of
that was trying to physically remove the dern thing.  Now I see why folks
remove the tranny along with the engine... it's gonna be quite an
adventure getting that thing back in!

At this point, I've got the exhaust manifold and tin stripped off, now I'm
trying to actually get the head off.  Man!  That thing is stuck on good,
boy and how.  I'm gonna have to find a rubber mallet to help budge it.
Any other ideas on how to get this thing off?  Looks like I'll have to
remove the cylinders, too (as per the 1990 VW tech article about engine
mods to increase durability and heat xfer) so I can add the
recommended shim.

As for that VW tech bulletin, I found a copy on the web.  Point your
browser toward:

Good stuff.  Funny where I found it: a site hosted by bug enthusiasts who
put type IV engines in their cars!
