Bob,

One question...  When you replaced the master cylinder, did the new MC
come with an O-ring to seal it to the booster?  Did you install it?  What
you describe sounds very much like a leak between the MC and the booster.

A note for anyone who buys a new master cylinder:  They are *supposed* to
come with a new (as I remember) 41.5mmx2.5mm O-ring that seals the MC to
the booster.  If you buy a new MC and it does not come with one, I think
you are within bounds to complain to the vendor.  If you don't want to
deal with it, tho... VW still sells that O-ring, tho it has to be ordered.
You *must* install an O-ring or you will *not* have a seal.  I tried to
reuse one and had no luck. I remember an old thread where someone
suggested RTV, but IMHO, an O-ring is what is called for and what ought
to be there.  YMMV.
