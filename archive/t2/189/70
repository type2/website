Thanks Dave

That is a little tricky but it sure qualifies as a vacuum leak that could 
cause a air/fuel rich condition.  Breaking the vacuum line to the regulator 
would cause the fuel manifold pressure to rise to its maximum value. Its not 
likely that an open vacuum line that size would push the air manifold up to 
ambient pressure.

I will try and remember this one. Black smoke and a whistling noise? Propane 
into the intake causes engine to die? Check the fuel pressure regulator 
vacuum line.

That line is daisy chained to some other items like the dump valve and my 
cruse control. Disconnects anywhere could cause the problem.
