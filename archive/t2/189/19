Subject: higher oil pressure lately

I have had a VDO oil pressure guage in my rebuilt 1600dp motor for two
years now.. Motor has 6000 miles on it since rebuild.  Lately, oil
pressure has been climbing up to 70+ at startup, then easing back down
to 45-50 at highway speeds.  I have read in the archives that this is
"somewhat normal", but the gauge used to top off at about 55-60 before
returning to 42 at 60 mph 3500 rpm.  Temps seem about the same as
before, 190 in city, 230 tops on highway, so the change in pressure has
me raising an eyebrow.  This is the second full year, and I did not see
these changes last year when the seasons changed here in CT.  I am
planning a week long camping trip to the White Mountains of New
Hampshire in a few weeks, and am just trying to get the bus running
smooth as possible.  Am I being overly sensitive, or where should look
to try to find the culprit?  Any advice appreciated

thanks
