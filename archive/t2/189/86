Don't forget that the tabs face the caliper- and the tab locations match
the cutouts you will see in the piston "circle" as you look at it.  
Sometimes the tabs get flattened, and you can fix old backing plates by
using a punc to fully move them out.  Cleaning the caliper thoroughly
where the pads slip in helps also.
