Subject: Going nuts...upholstery


Folks,

I am going nuts trying to figure out what colors my 78 Champagne
Edition interior colors are supposed to be.  This is not a camper
which as I understand it did not have the cloth inserts.

Remember, I am the guy with no mcode plate.  :-((

They have cloth inserts.

The vinyl appears to be a "red" color and the inserts where they have not 
been exposed to the weather look to be kind of a bright "rust" color.

Can anyone give me a clue?  The insert color that I *think* is correct 
does not appear in any selection for upholstery.

I would really like to get this one right....

Cheers, dave
