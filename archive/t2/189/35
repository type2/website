The Krylon website took me to Dupli-color.  I bought the high heat 1200F for
exhaust headers.  Followed the instructions for application and drying time
and after waiting for the last coat to dry I put the muffler back on and
took it for a drive to cure the paint.

When I got back after 30 mins, the paint had bubbled on the side and peeled
on the bottom (both hot spots where the rust originally appears).  Pretty
disappointed since I think I did everything right.  Going to have to remove
it and sand it all down again and try another brand.  Arg.
