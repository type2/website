Subject: Painting exhaust systems.


I have been reading all of the possibilities for refinishing the exhaust
system on what ever.

Here is the basic problem.

The muffler is zinc plated, and regardless what you may think is going
to stick isn't.

Why?

Because paint does not adhere to a zinc coating, unless the surface is
prepped right.
And when I say right, I mean sanding the area in question with an
abrasive course enough to accept a zinc chromate self etching primer. 
Without this process the paint will never stick---period.
Now you have applied the zinc chromate, which is not heat resistant,and
then you apply some sort of paint.

The finish will still be short lived, simply because the primer won't
hold either, because it isn't heat resistant.

A professional ceramic baked on finish is the only long term coating
that is made to last.

There is no self applied coating for the exhaust system that will stand
up to the heating and cooling of an exhaust system, without falling off.

Paint away--this isn't the answer
