Subject: 2.0 L hydraulic lifters

Hello Folks,

	Ok, I say to myself. I can rebuild the motor, but could I also set
the lifters so they don't tick?  My attempts have frustrated me to no
end... yet. The literature I've read Bently, Chilton, Bob in Boston and
various other archivial downloads have seem to confused me.

	The engine has a new cam, new lifters, old pushrods except for two
and about two hours running time. I put the new lifters in after I bled
them of air by pushing down on the plunger as hard as I could using one of
the pushrods. Apparently this job is best done with a press. Anyways
they're in and I want to know which ones need the adjusting. The mushy ones
or the solid ones? Can someone tell me which technique to use?

				Thanks

				Craig
