I do not completely understand.  You bought a left side carb and it came
with no solenoids, adjusting screws? Is that the question?  If so, you can
just take the solenoids off the old carb and put them on the old.
Otherwise, buy some new ones.  I think that you can replace the idle shutoff
valves, not the idle circuit shut off valve, with G-55 pilot jets.  I am not
sure, can anyone verify that?  I do not know if you can buy the adjusting
screws.  

You are also missing what from the top?  The brass tubes are not there for
the idle circuit air intake, or idle mixture outlet tube?  Is there a float,
float valve, what is included there?  Throttle body?  What was wrong with
the old carb?
