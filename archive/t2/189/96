Subject: Guage Wires

Facts: I lengthened the wires when when I installed my guages (VDO, 1971
Westy).  As I recall, the pressure sensor and guage did not come with any
interconnecting wire, so I bought 16 AWG wire for that from the FLAPS.  The
wire provided with the head temp sensor was too short as you described.  I
spliced (soldered and insulated with heat shrink tubing) additional 16 AWG
wire to make up the difference.  Everything works fine.

Opinions:  Theoretically, lengthining the wire for the head temp sensor
could throw the reading off, but, the signal is a millivolt signal that
varies in relation to temperature.  The current involved is minute, so, 8 or
10 feet of 16 AWG wire (4.18 ohms per 1000 ft (-at-) 25 deg C, or .0418 ohms for
the additional 10 feet of wire, per the Okonite wire and cable data book) is
unlikely to make a significant difference in the temperature reading.
Anyway, what we're really interested in is comparing our present operating
temperature with some normal baseline value, so who cares if guage
calibration is a little off, as long as it's consistent.

Help!

I am moving forward with the installation of my guages and after a long
afternoon's work I find the the provided wires on the head temp sensor and
the pressure guage are WAY TOO SHORT!!!. I ran them by the shortest route I
could figure but they only JUST come up through the floor of the cab. I need
another 4 feet or so to reach the guages! I double and triple checked the
part numbers and they are correct for my 74 bus. These are all VDO from good
vendors and I'm using the VDO wiring kit.

The Question: Can I lengthen these wires without significantly affecting the
guage readings? Soldering the splices, using quality wire, etc? Opinions,
please! Facts even better!

Thanks in advance,
Dave
