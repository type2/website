Craig,

Yep!  Been watching and recording it.  Don't remember what the s/c went 
for, but seems like about 40k+.

If the announcers could just get a clue about VW's we would be in 
business!  They can tell you that a paper tag is missing from the right 
front inside fender on an "original" 67 hemi cuda, but can't tell you 
didly about the VW's they showed.

Their discussion of the one bug I have seen go thru the line was pathetic, 
except that it had every NOS accesory on it that was available.

Cheers, dave

 other was a 68 - listed as beige, but looked fridge white to me. 
 under a tarp, so hard to tell.  a few pretty bugs, but nothing really 
 jumped at me. i've seen cars i'd rather have at the phoenix bug-in, 
 and they DROVE there...........
