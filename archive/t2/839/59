Subject: problem solved, front left wheel knocking

Hi all,

A couple of months ago I had a problem with the bus I emailed to the list. I
did a brake job on my '74 Westfalia. The front right caliper was frozen, I
replaced the rotors, pads, etc. Afterwards I found that the brakes worked
fine and I didn't swerve to one side when I braked, but I kept hearing a
regular knocking from the left wheel when I stopped.

I had several replies from Arnaud and Tom and Chris M. and others. They
suggested that it could be my ball joints, suspension bushings, shocks.
Since then I got a ratchet torque wrench, popped a broken 1/2" adapter out
of an allen socket by drilling a hole in it, screwing in a screw and pulling
it out, and ordering some ALKO shocks.

My suspension bearings seem fine, no play. We just had some good weather to
work last week in St Louis, and I retorqued the calipers to spec, swapped
out the old shocks (very easy), and started the bus up.

No knocking.

Thanks guys.

John
