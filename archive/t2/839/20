Subject: cargo door

Hey, Guys (and Gals), I'm having trouble with my  Cargo door.  I've adjusted the front catch before but now it is  latching before the rear of the door settles into the closed  position.  I have to hold one hand on the back and push to get it  to seat.  I don't see any adjustment on the rear mechanism.   Anybody know how to adjust it or have I bent something.   Thanks...KR
