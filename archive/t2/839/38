Hi Mark
             Of course you'd be right.  I started it again and noticed the
pedal was sticking, the dells were hanging it up (I forgot to put the return
springs back on).  When I pulled up on the pedal before turning off. it didn't
seem to do it. Still need to clean the idle jets.  She seemed to idle find
today and only hesitated once, when cold (has it should have).  Checking that
oil leak next weekend and she sould press on to finish up.

             I should be at NB.  Found out last week that the guy who was
going to spray it for me got orders.  So I asking around about a painter.
