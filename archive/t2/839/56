Subject: RE: [T2] Land Rover Wheels

They don't LOOK like Land Rover wheels .. More Like Disco or even Range
Rover.   As I may be only person on the list with a Landrover and a Type two
I can assure you that the spare on the bus will not fit on the spare carrier
on the Landrover ..

You have to be carefull with Landrover stuff .. the standard land rover
pressed steel rims will fit pretty much anything .. But I know that the
Alloy wheels from Range Rovers will not fit (the hub is too big) .. although
I cannot think of a reason why you want alloy wheels on a Landrover (or a
Rangerover for that matter).
