Subject: Padding color improvements and part question

Work is progressing on my '72 Bus.  I have found a product that seems to do a nice job of making the padded parts behind the seats and arm rests look newer.

I am using Meltonian NU-LIFE Color Spray Black, purchased at a shoe repair shop.  It says that it is good for Vinyl, Plastic and Leather.  The hardest part is making sure that the old parts are very clean and that not too much spray is put on at any one time.

I have installed my center side panels.  The one on the sliding door does not cover the door latching mechanism.   The panel is a nice fit around the door mechanisms.  Was there ever a cover for these parts?
