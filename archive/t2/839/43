Subject: Re: [T2] Engine install followed by broken clutch cable -

Good suggestion. Unfortunately we're talking city blocks with one-way
streets, stop lights and stop signs. Not to mention the bus is
probably parked in. So while I'm only 3 blocks from my house I'd need
to travel 5 to get home - with 3 Stop Lights and 2 Stop Signs. That's
more potential stain than I'd like to put on the poor starter and
battery in such cold weather.

I will be paying attention to greasing up the new installation. The
old connection seemed completely dry.

My Clevis pin looked very similar to Dan Random's:

Although one side was much more grooved than the other.

Why is the bus clutch cable end and clevis pin link seemingly poorly
designed? Seems like a common point of failure. Anyone beefed up the
cable to clevis pin connection?
