Subject: Re: [T2] got my new hubcaps in the mail from cip1

I have a few customers who clean and wax the chrome on there vehicles  
regularly. That meaning with every wash. They are over 1 1/2 to  2 years old and 
still looking good. They have the hubcaps and the headlight  rings. They were 
made in india. Same as Tiwan maybe worse. What you save in  money you lose in 
time.
