Subject: Re: [T2] steering boxes

I'm already broke, Arnaud!  I know I need  ball joints.   If that'll get me by, I'll look into the other  things next.  Can't hurt anyhow.  I'm planning on putting  some money into the bus as soon as I get back to work.  But I have  to get the ball joints before she ends up on the side of the  road.  Thanks...KR

Check all the steering linkage starting at the steering box till the
wheel. That is pitman arm, drag link, center pin,  pivot and it's
bushing, and tie-rods.

There is some list-wisdom (or is is only my opinion) that a steering
box should not be replaced before all the other items have been
checked/replaced.

You may find that the steering is fair enough once drag link + (..) is
replaced.

Stop replacing parts when you are happy or broke
