Subject: Re: [T2] got my new hubcaps in the mail from cip1

Keep your ears open as you go down the road! If they are like the set I got 
you will soon hear ding ding clank clank ding, as each one takes its' turn 
going to some destination other than where you and your bus are going! Lost 
3 within 400 miles. What a waste of money. They weren't even on long enough 
to rust. I put my dinged up originals back on then replaced them one at a 
time as I could find better ones. Like they say, If you want nice clean 
fresh oats, they come at a price. Now if you don't mind if the cow's all 
ready used them oats, then they's a might cheaper! :~)
