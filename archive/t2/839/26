That is my understanding.  I think that the pistons are dished, not domed.

My experience too.

I've done the switch the other way and find that the power doesn't change
noticably.  I did before and after tests up my "dyno hill" and found that
the time to accelerate remained exactly the same.

OTOH, drivability is much better with the SVDA (205) distributor.  Don't
waste your money on the 009.

You lose some power, but the tradeoff is that your engine will _never_
ping or detonate.  It'll run on the cheapest gas you can find.
