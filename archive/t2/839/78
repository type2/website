Kevin,
Check all the steering linkage starting at the steering box till the
wheel. That is pitman arm, drag link, center pin,  pivot and it's
bushing, and tie-rods.

There is some list-wisdom (or is is only my opinion) that a steering
box should not be replaced before all the other items have been
checked/replaced.

You may find that the steering is fair enough once drag link + (..) is
replaced.

Stop replacing parts when you are happy or broke
