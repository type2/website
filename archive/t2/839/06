Subject: Re: [T2] I suck at welding

Not enough heat? 120V welder? What are you trying to weld? Steel to 
steel right? Looks like some of my welds with my 120V welder where I it 
doesn't make enough heat fast enough. So I dwell and I cremate the 
metal b/c the heat gets out of control. Using gas or just flux core 
or???
