Subject: Re: [T2] Engine install followed by broken clutch cable -

2 blocks? Just put it in first, run the starter, and off you go!  You 
can shift from first to second by reving it up, go to neutral, then feel 
your way into the next gear when it has slowed enough to match the 
engine rpms and you can slip it into gear.  I can drive a bus completely 
without the clutch- but once stopped (in neutral) you must turn it off, 
shift to first, and use the starter to get going.
