Subject: Re: [T2] Best camper top?

<<Different needs, different tops.>>

Wouldn't be neat to be able to walk errect the 3/4's of full length of
the interior of the Bus Chris?

 <<I prefer the one on my '78 Westfalia because it contains a full sized
bed up top giving me room for 4 adults.>> 

I'd like to see 4 adults ( not migets ) get squeezed up top---

The Riviera and the Sportsmobile offers more usable interior room when
the top is up than a Westy--- 
You lose some with the angle of the dangle pop top.

<<It also fits in my garage.>>

So will the two mentoned above

<< I've love to see a Devon up close - the one that pops to the side.
Looks neat but wonder about how well it keeps the rain out ->>

I think there is no fabric involved here Chris--
The accordian portion is fiberglass / plastic type material
