Subject: Re: [T2] k&n air filter

Thanks. I had been looking for some good test info. I'll be literally 
ripping the K&N out of my Honda which has been my airfilter for 118K 
miles so far. I was looking for something better than OEM to get MAX 
life out of this engine. Have used it since the first oil change after 
we bought it new. Hope it has not ruined my engine (ruined it's chance 
at 250K miles). Yeah I got more HP. About 1/3 more HP. <griN!> Maybe 
they expect all the ricer boyz to blow their engines up before the air 
filter does any real damage. Chris
