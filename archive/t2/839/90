OMG!   Them saying it will go for a good amount because it's cute...that was
it for me.  I mean, I can agree with that point of view...that it's cute.
But I was just amazed at the general lack of knowledge about the truck.
Same goes for the bug that was before it.  And these are top of the line
collectors?

What a bummer.  Seems maybe there were some bidders there though that had
more of a clue.

If the announcers could just get a clue about VW's we would be in 
business!

Their discussion of the one bug I have seen go thru the line was pathetic, 
except that it had every NOS accesory on it that was available.
