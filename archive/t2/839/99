Subject: RE: [T2] Vacuum source for power brakes

 >A 1 year only question I guess.
Has anyone used the balance port vacuum from the twin 40mm Solex setup
to run power brakes?  How well did it work for you?  Any reason why I
shouldn't try this?

By "balance port vacuum" I assume you mean vacuum port drilled into 
the manifolds? If this is the case then yes this can be used as both 
a balance tube between the two carbs and as a source of vacuum for 
the brakes. This is the arrangement I have for my 76 with twin weber 
34 icts and it works well.
