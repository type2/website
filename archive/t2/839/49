Subject: Wretched Running Bus

My 78 2.0l fuel injected Bus failed me this morning in a strange way.  It
started as usual but when I got out on the street, it stumbled and   bucked
so bad I could only use a bit more than idle in first gear and limp back to
the garage, and took my motorcycle to work. Supposed to rain tomorrow so the
bike is not a good Plan B.  If I gave it more throttle it stumbled, coughed,
hiccupped, half backfired (a subdued sound back fire, not a loud bang) and
bucked like a bull.  It will not rev, even under no load. 

 

My first thought was a loose vacuum hose but all seemed to be in place, and
I don't think it would have started easily if one was off.  I also checked
that all the plug wires were in place as it is clearly not running on all
four, maybe only one or two.  Tonight I will attach a timing light to each
plug wire in turn and see if I am getting spark as I push the throttle
linkage forward.   The Bus ran perfectly the last time I used it (Friday).

 

Any thoughts would be much appreciated.  I'm guessing it is simple but do
not know what to do other than check the firing with a strobe light.
