Do you mean the mechanism in the rear?  I've tried a little grease in the track.  Thanks...KR

Cleaning and lubricating the mechanism did the trick

I have to hold one hand  on the back and push to get it to seat. I don't see any adjustment on  the rear mechanism. Anybody know how to adjust it or have I bent  something. Thanks...KR
