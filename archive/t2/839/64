i'd love to have it.

i also saw the other two busses: a nice 66 deluxe that just didn't 
SPEAK to me... i dunno; nothing wrong with it. just sorta blah.

other was a 68 - listed as beige, but looked fridge white to me. 
under a tarp, so hard to tell.  a few pretty bugs, but nothing really 
jumped at me. i've seen cars i'd rather have at the phoenix bug-in, 
and they DROVE there...........
