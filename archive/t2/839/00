FWIW The solid tar panels I have found in old cars often - unless 
firmly sealed to the steel - have alot of RUST under them. When they 
were firmly and completely sealed to the steel, the steel is like new 
underneath. Some of the tar panels I have seen inside panels exposed to 
weather have many perforations in them. My question: to reduce weight? 
To allow them to dry? To ???

Thanks.
