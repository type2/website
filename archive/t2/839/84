Steering box going bad feels like stiff or crunchy spots when you turn the
wheel.

If you're not sure, fix all the known-bad pieces of the steering first and
see if your problem goes away.  Look at the drag link very seriously if
you are getting popping noises.

Thanks,  George.  I'm thinking it's just the ball joints.  As if that  isn't enough, ha.  But I'm going to check everything.   Cheers...KR
