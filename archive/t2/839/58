Subject: problem solved, front left wheel knocking

Hi all,

A couple of months ago I had a problem with the bus I emailed to the list. I
did a brake job on my '74 Westfalia. The front right caliper was frozen, I
replaced the rotors, pads, etc. Afterwards I found that the brakes worked
fine and I didn't swerve to one side when I braked, but I kept hearing a
regular knocking from the left wheel when I stopped. I had several replies
from
