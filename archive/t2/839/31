Ok, last post on this topic
Thanks to all who replied p-mail or otherwise about the braking boojum I 
encountered.  Everyone got it exactly right, the flexi hose was stopped 
up.  I replaced it this afternoon and took her out for a joyful joyride, 
plenty of whoa when (and only when I) wanted it!

I felt so good about that I went ahead and adjusted the shifter plate so 
I don't have to get to second on the down shift through reverse.  Don't 
like doing that, it makes a terrible grinding noise from the back of the 
bus!

She runs very strong, pulling hills in 4th that I have to down shift my 
little diesel Dasher on!
