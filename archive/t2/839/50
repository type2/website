Hi David,

A couple things come to mind here.

Fuel pressure could be a culprit. A pressure gauge would be needed to  
verify fuel pressure is within spec. A failed fuel pressure regulator  
could start a cold bus OK but run too rich once warmed up. A blocked  
filter or fuel line could also be at fault.

The symptoms also sound very similar to a disconnected AFM. Verify  
that the connection on the back of the AFM is good. When this plug is  
disconnected the bus will start and idle but will refuse to accelerate.

If you want to check spark, just pull the wires off the distributor.  
You won't get a jolt if you pull them from that end, and the engine  
rpms will drop noticeably if the wire was doing its job.


Happy trails,
