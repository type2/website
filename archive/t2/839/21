Subject: Re: [T2] cargo door

Mine was doing something similar a few months ago -
it just seemed to want to 'lock' before the door
was fully closed, then rattle ...

Cleaning and lubricating the mechanism did the trick 
for me.

I have to hold one hand on the back and push to get it  to seat.  I don't see any adjustment on the rear mechanism.   Anybody know how to adjust it or have I bent something.   Thanks...KR
