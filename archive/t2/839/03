Subject: Re: [T2] Best camper top?

Is there a _best_ camper top?  Does it really matter?  Nah, it doesn't 
matter. Different needs, different tops. I prefer the one on my '78 
Westfalia because it contains a full sized bed up top giving me room 
for 4 adults. It also fits in my garage. I also like that it pops up in 
the front - but that is just my preference. I like the lower profile 
b/c of sidewinds of course. Friend has a Riviera and it's nice but I 
still prefer my poptop. I've love to see a Devon up close - the one 
that pops to the side. Looks neat but wonder about how well it keeps 
the rain out - I'd guess coming from England it ought to do well. Chris
