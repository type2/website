Subject: Re: [T2] Wretched Running Bus

I had a problem similar to this after I bought my bus.  Found out fuel
pressure was at 80 psi (no wonder it ran so well on the highway, but drank
tons of fuel), I checked all the connections and sensors that Muir said to
do.  My fuel pump was sounding a bit strange in its last few days too.

What had happend was the guy I bought it from hooked up the fuel line on the
return side of the fuel rail to the vacuum side of the pressure regulator.
this in turn made the fuel pump go into shock, and die at about 80 psi after
a few minutes.  New fuel pump and re routing the fuel tank return line to
the right port of the fuel pressure regulator, and a vacuum input, has been
working great since.

I doubt that this is your problem, but you were asking for ideas.
