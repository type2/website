I need to do this on a bug this week. How do you get it in without a
removable apron?

 The long piece (the one with the split flange) goes around the back of the
 engine.  I remove the rear apron, clean out the existing bits of seal from
 the groove, and install the new seal.  Then you can thread the seal into
 the side grooves while reinstalling the apron.

 Some folks simply cut the seal in three pieces to make it easier to
 install.  Probably works just as well.
