Subject: Quarter Window Repair

Well, I am happy to report my attempt at repairing my left rear quarter window was a success. I found a pin in the hardware section at Lowes that was the exact diameter for about .85 cents. I used my angle grinder to cut it to the right length, then used my bench grinder to shave the sides of the head of the pin off so it would fit down into the window channel. I also shaved the thickness of the head down a bit. I was going to use my Dremel to cut the notch in the pin, but couldn't find a cut off wheel , so I used the angle grinder again-it's tricky to do intricate work on a one inch pin with an angle grinder, but I managed to pull it off. Bottom line, pin worked beautifully, and I have the widow put back together with the replacement seal. I'm working on putting together a page with pictures showing exactly what I did, will post the link when it's done.   Jeff
