Subject: brake booster hose

Hi,

71 VW bus

on rear of brake booster, the vacuum hose
runs back to the intake manifold.  Vacuum
to boost the brakes.

What function does the vacuum hose
on the FRONT of the vacuum booster serve?

It is running up into drivers wheelwell, and
up into the body.  Is this a breather ?  Or
what ?

Rich
