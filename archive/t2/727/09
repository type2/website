Jeremy,

Maybe no pics of the wheels yet, but a description of how it worked????

Inquiring minds want to know!

Jeremy, Unless you already have the old engine out and *all* of the parts 
cleaned and painted that come off of it and go on the new, you need to 
know it will take longer than two days....unless you don't sleep....

LOL!

Almost all of your time will be spent removing, cleaning, checking and 
painting!


Cheers, dave
