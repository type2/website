Subject: A question about 4-speeding my automatic 3-speed transmission.

Hi-

I have an 80 Vanagon with a 3-speed automatic. I like the auto a lot 
after having many, many manual VW's in the past. My left foot and right 
arm are getting lazy, I think.

Anyway, I've heard rumors that a 4-speed automatic can be installed in 
its place. I'm willing to spend the money to do this since I think it 
would take a load off of my motor (lower RPM), improve gas mileage and 
allow me a greater (laugh) top speed.

I read somewhere that the transmission from a wasserboxer can be used 
with a bellhousing change on the air cooled transaxle. I've never owned 
a wasserboxer, but I'm under the impression that these are totally 
different animals, lesser ones at that (especially the tranny).

(Any ideas about changing gear ratios on the 3-speed are appreciated, 
too.)

Enjoy the springtime in your Vee-Dubs.
Thanks- Herb.
