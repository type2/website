Subject: T2] Re: ball bearing found in Valve Cover

Hw about this as a possible solution to the bb sized ball bearing.
Someone used a wrench or screwdriver that had magnetic qualities and the bb
got put there as they adjusted the valves.
The ball bearing actually just came out of their tool box, tool bag or such.
I know some ratchet handles use a bb size bearing as the hold in place for
the detent between left and right position.
