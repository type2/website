And you say this from the experience of having actually tried the Bus Depot
system when?  :-)

The Bus Depot system that Jamie referred to is a high quality European made
OEM system. The quality of this versus the Taiwanese Empi is day and night.
(And I say this as an Empi dealer.)  After you have gone through four
Empi's, one OE system will still be running strong  They are not even in the
same class. If you look at the two side by side the difference is
immediately obvious.

Some people like the louder extractor systems with the chrome, and we do
offer them for that reason. But I have not found that they provide any
noticable improvement in real-world performance, and they sure don't last
nearly as long. The only reason to buy such a system is if you really love
that look, and are willing to pay a lot more for it (over the long run). For
everyone else, the OEM setup is a far better choice.

I should mention that the system that Jamie referred to is a European spec
system, which does not allow for an EGR filter or cat converter. (Neither
does the Empi, for that matter.)  We also sell a comparable quality OE
system that will accept the emissions control devices, although it's nearly
twice the price:
