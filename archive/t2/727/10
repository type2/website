Subject: Body shop in or around Kirkland/Seattle?  

Anybody have any recommendations for some body work? It is an insurance claim if that matters.  Not my insurance but rather Les Schwab.  I had one of their tires destroy the rear end of my bus.  The tread peeled off the tire and exploded up through the driver side battery tray.  It also rolled all the metal back around the wheel well, took out my e-brake cable, side marker light.  This all happened on I-90 in the tunnel between Mercer Island and I-5, quite scary!  
 
Thanks,
Paul
