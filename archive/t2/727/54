Subject: Brake booster hoses

Richard Jackson said..." What function does the vacuum hose on the
FRONT of the vacuum booster serve?           "It is running up into
drivers wheelwell, and
up into the body.  Is this a breather ?  Or what ? "

    Make sure that hose stays tucked in where it is supposed to be.
If not, over a period of time,  you'll wind up with water in the
bottom of the brake booster.  It will become apparent on a cold
winter's day because the water will freeze and the ice will  push on
the diaphram, causing your brakes to drag.  Trust me when I say that
you don't want to be out there laying on the ground under your bus on
a 0 degree day.

Then John C said..."Napa has reinforced brake booster hose (crossed
the number from goodyear 15/32 reinforced brake booster hose) for 1.79
a foot.The only problem is they will only order it for me if I buy 50
foot"

    John, and all,   Look for a FLAPS that also sells truck parts.
This is a size that they may normally stock  That's where I found it
when I needed some.  They had it in stock and sold it by the foot just
as a regular FLAPS sells the smaller diameter vacuum hose.
