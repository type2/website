Subject: About front axle beams

Bonjour to the list!
New member from Montreal.
I have a 77 Westy and a soon-to-be-running 67 DoubleCab.

I knew that the front axle beam on the 77 was due to be either repaired or replaced.
When at the mechanic's I had a good look and the beam seems beyond reasonnable repair: one of the shock mount "towers" is severely corroded through. Typical damage from what I've seen around.

Over the winter I had the opportunity to get a "forgotten-in-the-storage-shed" NOS axle beam sold as "68-79" for a fraction of regular cost. (The years: A now obvious glitch in specs...)
Part looks great but when I compared it to the 77's beam it is obvious the unit is not appropriate.
For example, the mounting of the swing arm bump stops is totally different. As well as the overall size of the shock mount "towers".
But when I compared it to the 67's axle beam I discovered that it seems a perfect match, dimensions and features-wise. 
Since I also need to replace THAT beam because of similar, if lighter (go figure!) corrosion, I'm at least satisfied that my Ebay acquisition is going to be usefull eventually.

So questions to the list:
1) Can someone run down a list of differences of axle beams year to year? From let's say, 64-on.
2) I've not found new 67 bus axle beams in any vendor's catalogue. Is this part still available? Did I stumble on to a rarety? Or are they merely Bug axles?
3) Have any of you successfully repaired axle beams damaged in the way I have described above?

Thanks in advance for your help

Mitch
