These are actually EGR Valves, used only on the 73 model year (I know,
I useta have one).  They went to one central EGR valve in 1974.

The EGR circuit started at the muffler, then thru the EGR filter, then
the pipe divided into two pipes - one to each valve.  The vacuum
port(s) connected to the vacuum port on one of the carburetors to
activate the valves under certain loads.
