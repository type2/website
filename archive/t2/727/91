Subject: Re: [T2] Tire balancing for 69's

Hi Brian,

Here in the rust belt there are darned few vehicles still running wide 
5's. Finding a shop to balance them in the usual manner is almost 
impossible, and when you do find a shop that can do it you pay a 
premium for the service.

However... there is an alternative. Call around for a shop that can 
balance the tires while mounted on the vehicle. This will save you the 
hassle of finding a shop that has the adapter. Up here in Toronto it's 
much easier to get wide 5's balanced that way than it is to get them 
done off the vehicle.

Happy trails,
