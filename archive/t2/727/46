Subject: AVP Heads

I had a pair of AVP heads fail within 1000 miles. When I first got them I
had wild leakdown results so I sent them back to AVP before installing them
which they returned to me saying that nothing was wrong with them. I
installed them anyway and lost compression on both heads.

Before I had them properly repaired I performed a forensic on them and was
horrified by the valve job. There have been many good reports about these
heads in the archives so either the quality has slipped of late or I
unluckily ended up with a dud.

The first measurement was of the valve seat contact area. Way too wide for
the specs:

#2 and #3 cylinders lost compression and when I checked the seat with
prussian blue I found huge gaps:

Taking another look at the seat you can see it's no where near concentric
and the valve job used only one-angle. This one aspect probably floored me
the most.

When I checked the valve rock they all had too much stem to guide clearance:

On recommendation, I sent the heads to Adrian Audirac at Headflow Masters in
Vista, CA for repair. He said, and I quote, "basically a pile of junk put
together", unquote. He said the seats weren't even the proper hardness.

Andrian rebuilds heads with all new valves, guides, seats and springs. AVP
re-used the springs: the springs were shimmed on one head but not the other
which I thought was weird. AVP reground the intake valves and Adrian said
the contact faces had been resurfaced too much.

This is what Adrian built:

He does a complete rebuild with all new parts and uses the expected 3-angle
valve job for $175. This seems like a real bargain compared to the old heads
which actually cost more and contain used parts.

I also had Adrian replace some of the studs which pulled on the AVP head
when I tried to remove the exhaust. He didn't get the stud alignment exactly
right so I can recommend his rebuild but not the stud repair. I would get
that done locally, check it with your exhaust and then send the head out for
rebuild.
