And the 4 tips point straight out the back?

WRONG thing to put on a bus. No matter how good you
think your hatch seal is, the carbon monoxide WILL
kill you.  How good will it sound when you are dead??

The CORRECT bus muffler will ALWAYS exit at the rear
corner for this reason.

 I just replaced my stock exhaust with an EMPI dual
 exhaust system. I 
 don't recommend the bus depot system. The EMPI has
 two mufflers and 
 keeps the 1-2 and 3-4 cylinders on seperate systems.
 I bought mine at a 
 VW store for $99. It looks awesome, has 4 chrome
 tips and sounds like a 
 VW should.
 
 ENjoy- Herb.
 
 
 
 Has anyone ordered this exhaust from BD recently? 
 Does it come with
 everything in the pic?  Gaskets, tail pipe, etc. 
 I'm assuming from the
 picture that is bolts directly to the exchangers -
 no need for the 'J' 
 pipe.
