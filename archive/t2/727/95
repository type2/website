Well, were home.  Today was definitley one of the longer days.  Started at 10am
with 40+ mph head winds the whooooole way.  *sigh*  In any case, look for a
trip report some time this week.  Was good to see everyone one again and thanks
to those who helped out with our issues while we were on the road.

Later,
