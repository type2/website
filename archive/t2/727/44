The VDO adaptor is still to be found at CIP - $18.95
VDO-150-752 - VDO OIL PRESSURE SENDER ADAPTER KIT M10 X 1 - TYPE 4 ENGINES
I bought one last fall.

BTW, CIP works great for me as they ship from within Canada - no 
outrageous trans-border charges and really fast.
I also buy from the list participating vendors when it makes sense.
