Subject: sources for bushings and slider window rubber.

Recently, I've read reports of a list member who have purchased
replacement shift rod supports and a another who found the rubber seal
and perhaps rebuild kit for the slider windows (Don perhaps?). I'm
looking for both items and would love a nudge in the direction of the
correct vendor(s).

Thanks in advance,

jack
