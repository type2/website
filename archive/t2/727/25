Because of the shape of the bus it leave a void behind it as it drives. Anyone who's had an oil leak has seen evidence of this. This airflow is what allows the exhaust to get in while you are driving it and why VW chose to exit the exhaust to the right or left side instead of using the beetle design of straight back.
