Subject: Dual Carb Manifold ID

I picked up a set of dual carbs from a local vw person today. They came with
manifolds - the carbs have part numbers that id them as 73 MT. The manifolds
are odd - they look very much like the bus type IV dual carb set-up - they
have some sort of vac pod ( for lack of a better description) on the outside
of the manifold
It is not like anything I have seen on any website - anybody have any ideas
what these manifolds are for ?
