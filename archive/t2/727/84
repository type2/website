Subject: Intake / Exhaust Studs?

Hey guys,

      I think I tried to post this before but I'm not sure if it made it to
the list. So.. I'll post it again if it's ok with you guys! Unfortunately, I
think one of
my intake bolt holes is stripped. Either I did it, or it was done prior to me
and it
only became apparant when I removed it a little while back.

I really get nervous when it comes to aluminum heads, and I'd really hate
to risk damaging this motor. If it all possible, does anyone know if they sell
cyl head studs? I'd like
to buy a set of studs for my exhuast manifolds
and for the intake.

On another note... I haven't taken a real good look at my exhaust manifolds
yet, but suffice it to say, I'm scared...
it looks as if the engine installer... when they installed the new motor
(prior to me owning it), reused and re-installed
the old rusted out pair that I already have. I've also got some sort of
jacked up Pace Setter dual exhaust. I've already
ordered (and plan on installing) an OEM "style" replacement muffler /
exhaust system for my Bus (which I believe exits
out the passenger rear instead of dual twin tips like my Fiero. (what the
Pace Setter does now).

Anyway, any advice for removing exhaust manifolds on this thing? I know
that when steel bolts are allowed to sit next
to aluminum casings... bad things happen after a long period of time...
(they rust / oxidize together). I guess
I just wanted to know, prior to removing them... is there anything I should
be aware of when removing old exhaust manifolds?
Are these Busses prone to busting bolts or threads on the exhaust during
removal?


Thanks! If anyone has any idea or advice for me on those issues, or more
importantly.. where I can find exhuast and intake studs...
I'd appreciate it.


Thanks!!

Todd
