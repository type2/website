Subject: Electrolytic system update (also, ordered a new engine!)

I built the electrolytic rust removal system for my wheels last night.
Used a 32-gallon Rubbermaid barrel and the perforated stainless steel I
had cut last week.  Wired cathode and anode leads to + and - terminals
made with thumb screws mounted to the barrel's handles.  The wheel/tire
combination was a tight fit and I didn't have much clearance between the
wheel and the anode plates, but the tightness alleviated any buoyancy
concerns I had.  I was prepared to mount a bar across the top to keep
the tire down, but that was not a problem.  Used water and Arm & Hammer
washing soda as the electrolyte and my cheapo 6/12V charger to provide
the juice.  The best thing about it is I already had almost everything I
needed - I'm only out $2.35 for the washing soda.  I'll post the
pictures of the system and results on my website when I have time.

On another subject, I called AVP Worldwide yesterday and ordered a
rebuilt stock 2.0 for my '76 Westy.  They said it will be ready to ship
in a week or two.  Exciting times!  Planning to do the swap in three or
four weeks, whenever my friend gets his current project out of his
garage.  I'll take lots of pictures and update my website with project
progress.

Thanks again to everybody on the list who gave this newbie advice on
engine choice - I'm sure the couple extra hundred spent on the engine
will be worth it when the thing bolts right in and I can get it done in
two days!
