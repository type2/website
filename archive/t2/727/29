Subject: fuel gauge gremlin SOLVED (I think)

74 single cab
Had many good suggestions as to what the problem was
with the fuel gauge registering 3/4 full

Apparently there is some resistance in the brown wire
that comes from the sending unit to the front of the
truck and connects to the back of the gauge.  I
disconnected the wire at the sending unit (the one in
the main harness) and at the gauge and I used a new
piece of wire and direct wired it from the sending
unit to the back of the gauge and it registers full!

What I'd really like is to get a new main wiring
harness for this truck.  This will be the 3rd wire
that I'm needing to run outside of the harness to
replace harness wires with various problems.  Thanks
to everyone for all of y'all's replies!  Greg
