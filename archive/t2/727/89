Subject: Re: [T2] Tire balancing for 69's

Brian asked:


 I was tire shopping for my new 69 today and came across a problem.  The tire 
 shop told that he can not balance the tires due to the wide 5 lug bolt 
 pattern.  It seemed that he knew what he was talking about.
 
 Any one run into this problem?

Older tire shops here in Fresno, Calif still have the adapter for wide 5's. I have no problem.
Ask around, most VW parts places know of the places that still have the adapter.
