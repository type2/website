Subject: fuel tank restoration

Hi everyone,

After the engine , the pop top, I am now restoring the fuel tank which 
needs to be replace by a "new" used one.
Do you know any  pretreatment I can use to protect the fuel tank before 
putting it back in  place.
I red somewhere  (I don't remember where) that some people where using 
some special chemical (from the airplane industry) to add an inner coat 
protection in the fuel tank.

Does any body got an idea of what it is ?

Thanks

Chris
