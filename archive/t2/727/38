From David Parisi

Have a 74 Westy and recently noticed PO removed the cooling tin in
 front of cylinder #3.  Why would someone do this?  Anyway, am looking
for a used one.

Do you still have the stock Solex carbs?
72-74 lower front right tin has a air duct bolted to it for the pre-heat air for the air filter.

is the lower front tin, but that is FI tin, not carb engine tin. Do you also need the duct and the 'toilet
bowl' looking thing?
# 43 here:  http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Microfiche/t201100.gif
is the duct, # 42 is the 'toilet bowl'.  In order for all this to work, you need the correct # 10 also.

I have all these pieces......
