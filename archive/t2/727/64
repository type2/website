Richard:

I hate to pile on AVP because I think businesses of this type can 
perform a very valuable service to our VW community.  HOWEVER, this is 
exactly the same experience that I have had with three sets of heads 
from them.  My head/valve failures looked IDENTICAL to those in you 
pictures.  Everyone told me that I was burning valves and seats because 
I was running lean, vacuum leaks, improper cooling tin etc. etc. etc.  
I knew that I wasn't and I've always wondered about the quality of the 
seats used in the AVP heads.

This last time I bought new heads with from Boston Bob with stainless 
valves.  We'll see how long these last.  I have half a mind to send one 
of my two pairs of failed AVP heads to Head Flow Masters to have in 
reserve if/when my new AMC heads fail.

As a manufacturer myself, it blows my mind that a business can sell 
substandard product and not expect quality issues to catch up with 
them.
