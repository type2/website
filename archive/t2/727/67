Three in a row? That basically confirms this is the standard way they do their valve job.

This is the catch-22 and why I recommend all heads be inspected by disassembly before running: poorly fitting seats will burn the head up on their own and it makes your tuning more difficult.

They seem very friendly wrt replacing the head but after a while you simply get tired of the testing, removing and installing heads. Whatever QC work they do before it leaves their building isn't good enough in my opinion.
