Good Evening list

Have a 74 Westy and recently noticed PO removed the cooling tin in 
front of cylinder #3.  Why would someone do this?  Anyway, am looking 
for a used one.  I am also looking for a turn signal switch assembly 
that mounts to the steering column.  I been turning left around the 
world, as the lever drops down.  TIA.

David
