Matt,

Use the one from Jamie Rivers. I have one on my 78 and it's a beauty.

Easy to install once you figure out how it works, 2 helpers with towells 
wrapped around the bumper(to not scratch the body) and you can do it in 30 
minutes.

The little "modesty panel" tin  on the bottom of the bumper will need to 
go away though.

Make sure that you have never been hit in the rear as your mounting holes 
may be tweaked a bit and you will need to enlarge the mounting holes in 
the hitch a little.

Don't forget to account for the trailer wiring either....I bought a 
special 4 bulb unit from one of the RV places that places no load on my 
flasher and has a built in fuse for lights from the trailer.
These are built for cars/buses that have seperate turn signal and brake 
light wiring(our buses).

Cheers, dave
