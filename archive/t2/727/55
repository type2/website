Subject: CHT Sensor Alternative

Hey guys!

     I just wanted to thank everyone for all the replies. My router somehow messed up on Monday night and I was unable to send any e-mails. I could RECEIVE and read them, but I couldn't send them. I finally got that fixed so I want to respond to a few of them. But I wanted to say thanks for the advice.

I had no idea that VDO allowed gauges to go out like that... I guess I assumed that they would test them before shipping them (figured that was standard procedure for all companies?!). 

THANKS!!!

Todd
