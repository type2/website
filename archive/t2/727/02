Subject: [T2] Re: ball bearing found in Valve Cover

Can someone ask this person who found a ball bearing under their valve cover 
to tell the list WHAT SIZE it is??

I mean, if  the finder cannot measure it, or cannot take a picture of it, 
can you say how big (diameter) it is in relationship to some category of 
stacked coins.  Is it as big as 2 dimes laid flat; as big as 2 pennies laid 
flat??  1 dime and 1 penny??

And someone else can do the measurement and give the list an estimate of the 
size.
