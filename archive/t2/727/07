Subject: RE: [T2]  torsion arm replacement

>>how hard  is a upper and lower torsion arm replacement?  The Bentley makes

look not terrible, but also makes other things look easy.<<

yo Ric,

the hard part for me was not getting them off, but getting them back on!

there were very tiny spot welds that lines the torsion leaves up perfectly
so they would go mate up with the arms. after we figured this out &
re-welded, things went back on pretty easily.

good luck,

p.s. - this is one of the jobs that (IMHO) is better left to a professional.
with all of the time you'll spend doing this job, you really won't save any
money. (but of course the experience was fun)
