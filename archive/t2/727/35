It looks awesome, has 4 chrome tips and

If it's the one with the double chrome tips that are about 18 inches apart,
beware when standing at the rear hatch when it's hot. I had this exhaust on a
'76 Westy, and after returning home from fireworks on the 4th my neighbors
daughter went to get her backpack out off the rear of the bus and her leg
touched one of the pipes-very nasty burn and scar. I'd never use that type of
exhaust again.   Jeff
