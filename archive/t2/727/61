Subject: Re: [T2] AVP Heads

Richard,

Serious bummer.  I am hoping my AVP engine is/was made better than
that!

Were these heads from the carbed engine that you just did?

What were your symptoms that made you look at the heads again?

Did you do a leakdown test?...and the results were...?

Or just a compression test....and the results were....?

Really would like to know...maybe I will recheck my engine...although IIRC 
it now has abou 2500 miles on it and seems to run strong and quiet(for a 
stocker).

Please let us know!

Cheers, dave
