Thanks,

I'd be worried about "trapping" the heat in the box since on the type4 they
are permanently plumbed into the same airstream as the heads. Not like the
type1 where the heater box air is a completely separate stream that can be
blocked at the source. That heat would rise into the airstream that the fan
is blowing across the cylinders. Besides, no aluminum tape handy <grin>. So
I crawled under and fixed the da** thing. All hooked up except for the
accordian tubes (which I need to buy) and cables (I need barrel nuts).

5am now and I'm heading to the house after all -- then getting on the road
immediately after the shower. If I get too wiped out to continue I'll just
pull over and sleep somewhere.
