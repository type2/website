Subject: Re: [T2] brake booster hose

speaking of which,is there anywhere to purchase brake booster hose at a
reasonable price? and how much do you need?Napa has reinforced brake booster
hose (crossed the number from goodyear 15/32 reinforced brake booster hose)
for 1.79 a foot.The only problem is they will only order it for me if I buy
50 foot.If enough people are interested Id be up for a bulk purchase and I
would be willing to sell it for the 1.79 a foot plus postage. Sorry you got
this twice Karl
