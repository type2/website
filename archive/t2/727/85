Bus Depot or German Supply. You didn't say what kind of motor you had. I'll assume Type 4:

N 014 400 4 Intake 8x35
N 014 443 12 Intake 8x38 (GD, GE engines)

N 014 427 7 Exhaust 8x53 (CB, CD engines)
N 014 684 1 Exhaust 8x9x56

What often happens is that the nut is so rusted to the stud you end up unscrewing the stud. If you are replacing the studs this isn't a problem. If you don't have a stud remover this may be helpful although two nuts sometimes are enough to remove it.

You want to soak the nuts with penetrating oil for many hours before attempting to remove them. I would also suggest a shot of freeze spray to break the iron grip of the rust on the threads.

If you just want to remove the nuts, try a little more torque in the cw direction before you try to unscrew them and use a lot of leverage in the form of a long breaker bar and give the bar a whack rather than slowly try to free the nuts.

Some nuts will be so eaten by rust, they will just round off in your tools. They often have to be cut off but given the limited access  up there you'll be cursing over each one.
