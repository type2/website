Subject: Stud repair

Some people asked me about the exhaust stud repair I had done and given the recent email I thought I would add:

I have the 8mm studs drilled out and replaced by 8x9x56mm studs. Headflow Masters charged $40 for the stud replacement. Given the cost of buying the studs yourself ($48 or more) the labor cost is a bargain assuming they line up correctly.
