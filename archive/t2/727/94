Chalk the price increase up to increased material costs (read: oil)
and an unfavorable Euro to Dollar Exchange rate.  While I can't tell
you how much they land here in the VWG Warehouse (wholesale sales
only, we don't retail), I can assure you that the profit margin is
pretty darn slim.  I just got another PO Confirmation two days ago
from a German supplier and average Euro costs went up an average of
another 15% from our last order in December 2004.  Couple that with
freight to the Left Coast and the exchange and once again prices will
go up again.  Sure the exchange rate has dipped everso slightly, but
not enough to make a difference.
