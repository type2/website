Subject: sport tuned suspension!

I just put those new Koni shocks on my 78 westy and it's like having a 
sports car ;)  Actually, they are quite nice; instead of the bus leaning 
the opposite direction of a turn, it actually turns in that directly.  I 
know, amazing concept ;)

I set all the shocks to 1.5.. full tight is 2.  I like a firm ride so I 
thought I'd start there.

Oh, and the bus doesn't nose dive during braking.. very nice!

later,
mike
