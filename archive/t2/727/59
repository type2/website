That is definitely an issue. Those tips get hot! It was worse when I
didn't have a bumper and the entire muffler was exposed to my bare
legs! ! !

I have the Empi dual muffler kit too. Durability issues aside, it was
a signifigant improvement over my busted internally stock unit. Yes
it's rusting too.

When the mufflers themselves become swiss cheese, I'm thinking about
having higher quality mufflers welded on. The pipes from the flanges
to the mufflers are good quality steel. The mufflers themselves are
crap.

I am wondering if a crossover tube between the two sides would help
torque. It did in my old Camaro when I had the exhaust redone. . .
