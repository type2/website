Subject: [T2] trailer hitch for a westy


does anyone know of a reliable manufacturer of aftermarket trailer
hitches for a 1978 westy? I looked in the archives and the library and
found very little info. there was a table on trailer weight and such,
which is good info, but now I just need to buy a hitch! any help is
appreciated.
