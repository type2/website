Subject: Rear Hatch Seal Fit?

Finally broke down and spent the $80 to replace the 35 year old rear hatch 
seal in my 70 bus.

Fits every where but upper right corner. Small part sticks out here. Is 
there an installation trick? Heat?  Too much tension at this point? I 
installed it w/o cement.

Thanks,
Phil
