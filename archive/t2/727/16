Subject: Re: [T2] brake booster hose

In order for a diaphragm to move, it has to be open to
the atmoshere on one side. The brake booster must be
open on the non-vacuum side. In a normal car, the open
side is inside the vehicle, no problem.
On a bus, it is underneath and exposed to the
elements, i.e. water. So, VW plumbed it up to the air
chamber in the door post.

 on rear of brake booster, the vacuum hose
 runs back to the intake manifold.  Vacuum
 to boost the brakes.
 
 What function does the vacuum hose
 on the FRONT of the vacuum booster serve?
 
 It is running up into drivers wheelwell, and
 up into the body.  Is this a breather ?  Or
 what ?
