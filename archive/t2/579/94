Subject: Jake Raby -- torque measurements?

Jake,

We've got a little discussion over on RAMVA ("Inside the Case") about 
stock vs aftermarket cams. We were wondering if you or anyone you are 
aware of has measured the torque of a stock 1600 w/ stock cam (properly 
timed) vs same engine using a mild cam with a little higher lift such as 
the W-100?
