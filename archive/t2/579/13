Subject: oil question

i was driving home tonight in my 76 bus and the oil light on my dashboard came on for 15 seconds then shut off i parked her and let her cool down checked the oil it was low but not to to low when i looked at the oil it was dirty from alot of driving so far and the oil on the dip stick was bubbly is that normal my second question is that the pin on the door which holds the door open has fallen out and gotten lost does anyone has a extra one so my door won't stay open it swings freely oh i would like to get a oil temp gauage what kind should i get
