Subject: I need some of these clips that I can't get anywhere

Check out the pictures I posted here:
http://home.att.net/~tgtsfkncld/acemerrill.html

The clips in the pictures hold the rubber stops on the front beam.  Bus 
Depot doesn't carry them, and that's not any fun.  Does anyone have a 
source for these dealies?  I'd like four, but really I only broke one...

Thanks,
