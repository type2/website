hiya all - bus and crew made it safely from little rock to atlantic city
beaches. while here i have been fishing and swimming on the sands of my
birth. been staying at dear old mom's for a week. before shoving off i
have two more things to do here. next week i'm heading down to virginia
beach next week to visit my cousin while he has his promotion ceremony to
commander in the navy. before that i'd like to hit old stompings in new york.

the only repair i've had to make was the hinge on the pop top. local bro
from eugene sent one. what a fantastic voyage. i don't think i burned two
quarts of oil.

what would make it complete is if there was a listee who had a driveway in
hoboken; close-in brooklyn; or on staten island near the ferry for an
overnight bus snooze. lemme know. please, please don't let me call in old
girlfriends.  - steve
