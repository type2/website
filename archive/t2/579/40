Subject: Hints from Heloise - Window Crank & Warm Air Blower Tube

Hint 1:

Your driver/passenger window crank handle's turning knob ripped out.  So, 
you are going to replace the crank handle with another (OK so far) and throw 
the broken one away (WRONG ! ! ).

Simply go to a Friendly Local Hardware Store (FLHS) and get a cabinet drawer 
knob with the machine screw that goes through the wooden drawer and screws 
into the porcelain or pewter knob.  In fact, there is such a wide variety to 
choose from that you will most likely find one that makes you happier than 
the VW standard issue.  And it will work better.  And your friends will be 
amazed and in shock and awe.

Hint 2:

Do you want to replace the bay window VW heater blower right side tube, but 
you want the same bellows type, rather than the pressed paper-over-aluminum 
foil type now available??  Well, try the tube 251 819 721.  It will fit over 
the oblong opening that feeds the right heat exchanger through the apron 
cooling tin.

OK, but I heard that before.  What's the 'hint'???

Heloise knows the part number because she is holding the Vanagon plastic 
bellows tube in her hand.  And she knows it will fit the oval riser tube 
because she measured it.  Now, the HINT is in HOW she measured it!!

She took a string about 1 foot long and tied a small knot near one end.  
Wrapped the string around the end of the bellows tube and saw where the 
string overlapped.  Then tied another knot in the other end of the string so 
that when the string was re-wrapped around the end of the Vanagon plastic 
bellows tube, the knots matched up.  (Well, the knots did not match up 
exactly, but the difference between the knots was well noted)

Then simply reach into the engine compartment (it was raining, so time was 
of the essence) and wrap the double knotted string around the oval riser 
tube part that was poking up from the right heat exchanger.  A MATCH!!  The 
knots position were the same.  The string fit under the hard plastic 
original piece, and that piece did not have to be moved.

Hint 3:

Take an umbrella with you when it is raining...

PS.  Bus Depot has these Vanagon tubes on their web site. (I get no cut from 
Bus Depot, BTW, not that I haven't asked!!)
