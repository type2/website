Subject: Re: [T2] Dvda for Svda swap anyone?

is the dvda the dual vacuum canister?  I never really understood what
svda and dvda meant.

anyways, I had a dizzy with a big vacuum canister (two ports) on my 76
and I could turn it just fine.  I would check to make sure you have all
the cables hooked up correctly.  If you can't get the timing off, maybe
you might have the cables off by 90 degrees...

Do you have any pictures you could show us?
