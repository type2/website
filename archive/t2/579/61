John, The common mistake of the hydraulic lifter is
that they are said to never need adjustment, if the
world was perfect this would be true, but it's not,
seats sink,cams wear and other horrible things can
happen, so they do require checking just to make sure
that they are still there and not wearing uneven

 Take a look at Boston Bob site here he will explain
how to adjust them.. Phil
