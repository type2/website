Subject: RE: [T2] ECU question and Anyone Use Bosch Rebuilt ECU's?

There are (or should be) several  blade connectors on the top of the case under the left side of the intake manifold. There should be 2 or 3 wires from the FI harness that go to these connectors. You can probably see them with a flashlight if you really stick your head in there (they're well hidden, I only know about them cuz I took my engine apart). Those wires can be worn, frayed, or the connectors can dirty/corroded.  
 
ECU's almost never fail. I would actually redo the entire FI trobleshoot procedure, disconnect, clean, and maybe apply di-electric grease to all FI harness connectors before replacing the ECU. Look carefully at all the FI harness wires; I found several that had frayed down to bare metal. I did continuity checks on the entire harness. BTW, I found a couple wires on my FI harness that didn't exactly match the Bently diagram numbering, but was able to figure out the differences.
 
With all that being said I'm sure the BD rebuilt ECU's are fine.

service" manual on FI I got off one of ya'lls websites, I need to check
for 12V at 88b. Then Check for grounds from Terms 5, 16, and 17 of the
ECU to the Engine case under left side intake manifold. WTF, is their a
special place I should be testing ground at? And thirdly to check
continuity at term 1 to the Neg on the coil. Done that, it's their. And
it does propperly ground/unground at the engine turns.
