I saw a couple of responses dealing with why the engine won't start, but
none dealt with the initial problem of the engine revving but nothing
happening on the drive-end of things.  I'd say with a fair amount of
certainty that the "pop" you heard was a CV joint breaking.  The engine not
re-starting after you turned it off is a completely separate.
