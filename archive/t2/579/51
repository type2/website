Subject: Starting problems

On my way back from Bonnaroo, my 1970 van quit starting after I fueled up.  
Lights turned on, but the starter did nothing.  I figured my voltage 
regulator was bad and not helping my battery charge.  I got a jump start and 
it started right up.  I got home ok, I turned off the engine.  I tried it 
and it did the same thing as before.  I disconnected the battery and brought 
it upstairs to charge.  I brought it downstairs today and nothing still.  I 
switched voltage regulators, and still nothing.  Any ideas?
Ben
