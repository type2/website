No, she walked. She said that the final 4000 feet were the hardest 
thing she's done in her life (she's 48). No possible adjustment in 
octane!

Seriously, though, it's interesting for me to contemplate our 
differences, as well as the perennial question: why do I have/drive a 
VW bus?

While we are both very goal-oriented, I tend to set goals like making a 
competent bus mechanic of myself (and driving between San Diego and 
Tucson without incident), while she picks the highest point in Africa 
(and flying to/from Tanzania at a time in world history when I won't 
fly to Seattle).

And get this: I have never been able to get her to drive Peregrine! She 
hyperventilates any time I suggest it!
