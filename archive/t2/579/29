Subject: RE: [T2] How do I clean varnished tank?

I had this issue with a 72 fasty parked with a FULL tank for 14 years.
Same deal, black goo.
I called around and around until a shop would Steam clean it. I got a
lot of the good out through the sender hole in the meantime.
NASTY NASTY NASTY job.


I suggest, keep trying to make it someone else's problem.
Cost me 50 bucks, don't regret a cent. Evil stuff.
