Subject: RE: [T2] I need some of these clips that I can't get anywhere

I can't promise, but that clip looks a LOT like the ones that hold the brake lines to their brackets...which are available at Bus Depot. Pull one off a brake line and see if it matches...

The clips in the pictures hold the rubber stops on the front beam. Bus Depot doesn't carry them, and that's not any fun. Does anyone have a source for these dealies? I'd like four, but really I only broke one...
