Subject: How do I clean varnished tank?

Sunshine, a 1969 Nuensitzer and my latest rescue, must have been parked with 
nearly a full tank of gas.  Now, 10 years later, the tank has that varnish 
smell and although there isn't any fluid in the tank, it's heavy.  So I'm 
sure I have at least an inch thick layer of this stuff in the tank.

The outside of the tank is perfect and I think it's structually good, so the 
question is how do I clean out this tank and make it usable again?  Would it 
help to pour a gallon or two of "hot" thinner in it and slosh it around by 
putting it in the bed of the pickup and going for a drive? 

I did call a radiator shop about tanking it, but he didn't seem too anxious 
once he found out how long it had set up. 

Ideas anyone? 

Thanks,
Dean
