Subject: Vanagon - engine mount bar direction arrows

Hello good people,
One thing I forgot to note upon engine removal was which way the 
direction arrows embossed in the mounting flanges on each end of the 
mount bar need to point - towards the front or rear of the van. (no 
notes in Bentley, and confusing statement in the "How to re-build..." book)

Thanks,

GG
