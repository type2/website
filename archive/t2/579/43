That's a good thing.

Everyone knows what method I prefer:

I used the POR-15 Marine Clean and their tank sealer for the tank two years ago and now recently for the inside of the intake runners and pipe that goes from the filler neck to the tank. It's a lot of work but I'm sure the sealer will outlast a mineral oil coating (what VW recommended back in 1969). I'm not saying I'll ever sell my bus but if I did, I will be keeping the fuel tank.
