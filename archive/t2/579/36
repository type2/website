Hey Steve,

<SNIP>
I mixed 4 parts water to one part molasses that my wife picked up at the 
grocery store.  Mixed it together real well in a plastic Rubbermaid style 
container with lid and added parts.  Works exceptionally well on chrome 
parts.  Even some parts you thought were lost.  Expect to wait a week or 
longer for best results.  After removal I rinsed mine in fresh water while 
scrubbing with a nylon brush.  Then air dried and sprayed down real good 
with an oil based lubricant.  Be aware that bare metal will surface rust 
real quick after removal and rinsing.  Also make sure the entire part is 
submerged in the mix.

If you are looking for info on gas tank cleaning I know others on this list
have dealt with that situation.

Hope this helps.

PS I've been using the same solution for several months now and still going
strong though I'm suspecting a slight alcohol content now.
