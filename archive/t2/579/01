Subject: Westy/Screen in pop top

Have noticed that the screen in our Westy pop top is beginning to show wear.
It appears to be shredding in several places. We have tried sewing up a couple
of torn spots but this is not a real fix as other areas of the screen are also
tearing. The canvas is in great shape otherwise.
Any list members dealt with this problem? Is there a way to replace the
screen? (Its sewn in to the canvas at the bottom)
Would appreciate any information from list members, as to a fix for this.

Thanks......
