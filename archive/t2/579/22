Subject: ECU question and Anyone Use Bosch Rebuilt ECU's? 

After rebuilding my Dual Relay (or trying to anyway, the fuel half is
working fine anyway), my injectors still aren't squirting. I used
jumpers in the harness to test 'em individually bypassing the ECU, and
they squirt just fine and dandy. Now according to the scan of the "pro
service" manual on FI I got off one of ya'lls websites, I need to check
for 12V at 88b. Then Check for grounds from Terms 5, 16, and 17 of the
ECU to the Engine case under left side intake manifold. WTF, is their a
special place I should be testing ground at? And thirdly to check
continuity at term 1 to the Neg on the coil. Done that, it's their. And
it does propperly ground/unground at the engine turns. 
 
Now assuming I DO have 12V at 88b, and 5, 16, and 17 are grounded, is
their anything else that MIGHT cause my ECU not to be working, or is it
new ECU time? Now with that in mind, has anyone tried the $99 Bosch
Rebuilt ECU's from BusDepot? Do they work good/long?
