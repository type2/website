Dean,

Don't even think twice.  Take it to the radiator shop...it almost doesn't 
matter how much it costs.

I soaked mine in paint thinner and other evil things for almost a 
month...it really didn't help.

See picture #12 here   http://www.shockwaverider.com/78bustankjob/

8 years with a full tank.

Cheers, dave
