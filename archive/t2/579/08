are you referring to the rod or the cable??

there is a guy in the UK that is parting out a 73 auto tranny that posted
on the list a couple days ago.  shipping the cable should not be too
expensive.

if you find one grab it, and remove em carefull too.

73-75 and 75+ are different so make sure to get the right one.

I could use a 75+ cable if you stumble across one
