Subject: Re: [T2] How do I clean varnished tank?

hello Dean  The best way is the radiator shops but if thats not possible use 
regular bleach put in so coarse gravels or some small chains duct tape the 
openings a shake the living hell out of it , repeat a bunch of times,  After 
cleaning get some POR gas tank sealer and reseal  later and have fun  Mark dearing
