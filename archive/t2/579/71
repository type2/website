Subject: Help needed: Painting sliding door

Hello. Paint help needed in the Washington DC/VA/MD area:  I want to paint a 
bay window sliding door.

The sliding door is off the bay, and somewhat finished/primer'd.  It needs 
the final touchup and color coats put on.

I have the paint and reducer, but no hardener.

Is there anyone in my area who could help??  Painting at your place at your 
convenience.

I can offer cash or kind...  I need to replace my sliding door, and I cannot 
find a suitable Sage Green rust free, dent free replacement, so I have to 
refinish the spare door that I have

Thank you.
