Also, make sure that the flapper door inside the AFM isn't jammed!  That 
will keep you from running for sure.

Easiest way to check that is pull off the air cleaner and stick a long 
screw driver in there.  I would turn the ignition ON, stick the screw 
driver in there and actuate the flapper door.  The fuel pump should turn 
on whenever you push the flap.  If it doesn't, you've got other problems.

later,
