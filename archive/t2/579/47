Subject: leaving tucson -- stuff for sale or trade

Hello,

Everything is progressing smoothly towards departure. 
This Saturday night I am leaving Tucson in my 1970
Westie, bound for Robbinsville, NC.  I'm realizing
I've got too much stuff even though I've been
downsizing ruthlessly. 

The following are for sale.  Local pickup only please,
on or before this Friday, June 25th.


Oil Bath Cleaner  --  I think for 1971, but no
thermostat for warm air flap.  used, but good - $10

Prolift 2 1/2 Ton Floor Jack  --  21" lift, works
well, bought at Autozone for $50  sell for $20 
(please someone take this...the weight I could do
without on the trip)

Sabot 9' Sailboat  --  fun boat...fits on the roof
great, ready to sail.   pics at
http://jonwade.smugmug.com/gallery/147584  I bought it
in April for $350...make me an offer.


The sailboat I don't anticipate selling, and if not,
I'll have fun sailing it on the east coast.  I'm open
to offers, and negotiable.  Call ANYTIME 520-312-8232.
 

Anyone else going cross country this weekend?  Once I
get to Albuquerque, it's all I-40 for me.

thanks,
Jon
