Subject: installing new rubber lines?

Hi,

I have bought the kit from Collie and Scott (www.germansupply.com) and am
trying to figure out the best and easiest way to assemble it.

Can I use a lubricant to put it together???

I suppose gas may be an idea?

I don't want to damage the new rubber when I put it on.

Cheers,

Alan
