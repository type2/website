I'll echo this.


We are a dealer for the DTM cooling system sold by Jake Raby for putting a
Type IV power plant into a vehicle originally designed for an upright
engine. According to Jake, who is one of the authorities on using Type IV
engines in conversion setups, putting a post-72 engine in a 68-71 bus is the
most difficult conversion of any you can do and he doesn't recommend it at
all.
