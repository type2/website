Subject: oil drain plugs? which is which?  (photo)

I have a 72 with 1700 pancake motor.

please look at this photo:

The drain plug on the left is from my bus.  It has a large (19mm) 
head but smaller shank than the one on the right.  I removed it from 
the crankase itself, not the area where the filter screen is.

The drain plug on the right is what I received from a famous bus 
parts vendor.  It has a 14mm head and a larger shank.

Did I get the wrong drain plug or has my crankcase drain been modified?
