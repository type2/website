Looking forward to an answer on this one.

The screens in my Sportsmobile are completely gone, and I'd like to
hear if there's a reasonable way to add screens back in.

Some cue to the material on Sportsmobile pop-ups would also be
appreciated.  I personally can't tell if it's coated canvas or some
sort of vinyl.  I've got a few surface cracks and a couple small holes
to repair also.
