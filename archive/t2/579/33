Subject: Re: [T2] Westy/Screen in pop top

Hi Volks,

Last fall I sewed a new screen into the big window in my westy pop-top. 
It took about an hour or so, and I am most assuredly NOT an expert with 
a needle. I needed a helper for the last 12" seam, since I didn't have 
a sailmaker's needle handy at the time. (A sail-maker's needle is very 
large and is curved like a capital D so that the needle can be used in 
places where you only have access to one side of the canvas. My son 
Matthew helped push the needle back through to me with a pair of pliers 
and we were done in about 20 minutes. He only stuck me twice. ;-)

If you overlap the new screen to the original you can sew screen-to 
screen, or you can sew the new screen directly to the canvas. It's not 
really that difficult, just a bit tedious. Take the time to make sure 
you have a secure and comforable perch to work from and the job will 
get done a lot easier.

Happy trails,
