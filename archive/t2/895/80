Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust manifold nut questions

My studs are, thankfully, fine.  My 1700 studs are, I guess, M8x1.25/M8x1.25.  I plan to clean them up with a die and use new nuts.

I am going to purchase new nuts and I am wondering if brass or stainless is the best, thinking about future removal, of course.

What are the nuts composed of, originally?  I think that mine were brass.  This makes sense as dissimilar materials are less inclined to gall, and if they do, brass can be easily cut off and cleaned up and will not damage the stud threads so much.  Brass can tolerate some heat as well, whereas stainless steel is a non-equilibrium alloy and tends to begin to separate at temps over 500C or so (gets kinda blue colored).

Just wondering which to buy: brass or ss.
