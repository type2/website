Subject: Re: [T2] loose sterring / front end?

Dan said," It wanders .... So my question is where to start the  
rebuild / replace of what parts in the front end?  It doesn't shimmy  
or shake, but the bus wanders around the lane.... What steps would I  
need to take to diagnosis the issues?  Recommendations please?

Hi Dan,

You may save yourself some time, trouble, and unneeded new parts by  
first having a knowledgeable alignment specialist properly align your  
bus.  It may simply have insufficient toe-in and/or camber.
