Subject: Purpose of Vanagon fuel tank plumbing?

It now looks like many of the grommets and fittings on my Vanagon
(air-cooled for proper T2 content) fuel tank system are now made only of
pure unobtanium.  What is the purpose of all these overflow bottles and
plumbing, and how essential to proper EPA functioning of the vehicle are
they?  Here in Arizona we have to pass a fairly strict smog test.  Can all
this stuff be safely removed?
