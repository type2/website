If you have a plastic distributor near where you live,
buy a sheet of corrugated plastic. Brand names are
Corex, Coroplast... It's 4mm thick and has flutes
running the length for structure. You can cut it with
a utility knife  very easily. It will remain rigid
enough to not bow out much (like an inch maybe) and as
long as you don't have a great amount of pressure
inside the bus, simple duct tape will hold it in place
quite well.
Price should be under $20 for the 4X8 sheet (I think
we pay under $10 wholesale). You could also buy a
sheet or your exact size from virtually any sign shop.

Years back I made a temporary camper for my pickup and
used translucent Corex for the top. It was secured
with silicone. It worked just fine and was good for
probably close to 10 years before I discarded the
whole thing.

BTW - If you call around to some sign shops in your
area you might be able to score a used sign that you
could stick on there - and they'd give it to you for
nothing. -BaH
