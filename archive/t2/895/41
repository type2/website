	Thanx for onpassing this good news, Chris.  It tends to 
vindicate some of our recent discussions on this list.  If you didn't 
get it off TheOnion.com, you should try to sell it to them.

>This van will sport contact-paper woodgrained sides

	This reminds me of a fellow Splittie owner  -  a good friend 
-  who swore he'd seen in 1967 a magazine advertisement for a hi-fi 
amp featuring

		Genuine simulated artificial imitation walnut grain effect.
