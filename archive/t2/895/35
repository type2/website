So, guys and gals, do you think a 10 gauge wire is a bit overkill??

And Richard, you can get a FLAPS round horn button for a couple of bucks.
It can be attached appropriately, and you can fill the bottom of the horn
button with RTV or household silicone to seal the connections.

I use the 'horn button' technique to adjust my dwell.  Wire one side of the
'horn button' to the battery positive, and the other side going to (1) the
starter solenoid and (2) the coil.  I hold the starter button in the palm of
my right hand, and I can pinch the 'horn button' with my littlest fingers
and use the rest of my right hand to tighten the screw on the points.  My
left hand is adjusting the points opening as the engine turns (damn it, or
is it the other way around??  Dyslexia rules...  I gotta go flush my toilet
to see which way is counter clockwise..)  .  With power going to the coil
simultaneously with power to the solenoid, I get a dwell reading real-time,
as I adjust the points (rotor off, of course!!  Dwell meter attached, of
course!!)

I have only 6" of wire coming out of both sides of the 'horn button', on one
I jumper a wire to the battery positive post and on the other side, I jumper
two wires, one to the solenoid wire that is fished into the engine
compartment and one to the coil.
