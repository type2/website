The engine is probably fine.

Take out the plugs, squirt oil into the plug holes and if it turns over
easily, I would say just run it. As long as it was assembled properly with
assembly lube, it should be pretty clean inside.

If you are storing an engine for a long period it is best to remove the
plugs, squirt some oil in and turn it over with a wrench, do this every few
months and the engine will be good as new inside.
