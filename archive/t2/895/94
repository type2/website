A cheapie one will work fine for a short period, like until you can find a
good one. They make good spares. But I agree, stick with Bosch or Hella.

Because of how critical the relay is in this situation, I recommend carrying
a spare.

Installing one of these is something I wanted to do before my next road
trip, but it didn't happen. I'll keep my screwdriver handy. =)
