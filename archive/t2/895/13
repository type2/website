Checker Auto, $15 clearance. :)

It's a little bit of a pain to install. Find a place for it, route the wire
all the way back to the distributor, etc. This is the second time I've
installed the same tach, I had it in the GWB as well. I mount it to the vent
screw at the corner of the windshield so I don't have to drill any holes.

It's an Equus "ProTach".
