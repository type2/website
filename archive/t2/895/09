Subject: alternator fun

Well the other day I went to check the alternator belt and it was real 
loose.  It turns out the top bracket was broken where it fastens to the 
fan shroud.  There's no telling how long the alternator was like that.  
Now when I'm checking oil when I gas up I'll check the best as well.  
When I got home today I went to ready the alternator for the new old 
bracket BustedBus was sending me and realized the bottom bracket was in 
two pieces as well.  The only thing holding it on was the bolt through 
the HE.  Luckily that's one of the non-rusty parts of the right side HE.

Anyway ... It's always an adventure and I'm learning more about these 
beasts all the time.
