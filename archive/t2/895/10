Subject: [T2] aux starter switch

hey guys,
      does anyone have a schematic of an auxilary starter switch in the
engine compartment so i can watch what is going on back there.  i am alone
in my work on my 78 2.0 FI, and i cant see anything up in the frontof the
cabin.  a parts list and schematic is really what i need.  thanks alto in
advance guys.
