Please  use a switch, not just the wire. If you have a fuel leak you run the

hey don  a switch will have a spark also and if you can't see or smell  a 
fuel leak then maybe you shouldn't be working on the bus anyway. I have had  such 
a wire in my bus for over 25 years now and have never had a problem, but  
then I do tend top change my fuel lines . It sure makes trouble shooting easy  
and a one man job  later  mark dearing
