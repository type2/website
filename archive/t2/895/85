Bob, if you are able to get a die on the exhaust studs while they are still
in the 1700 heads, then congratulations..  But don't do it ....  Just
'smarten up' the stud threads by running a 8mm nut up and down the stud
until the nut runs easily.  Use a low speed electric reversible drill with a
deep 13mm socket.
