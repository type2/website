Subject: exhaust manifold nut questions

Sorry if this is in the archives, I could not find it there.

one question and one verification

Q: what is the material, the optimum material for the exhaust manifold nuts.  I think that the ones I took off my '72 1700 were brass or maybe bronze or phosphor bronze or something like that.  It seems a good idea to use something that is significantly dissimilar and softer than the studs, in case it galls, it can be removed without destroying the stud, in theory, anyway.

V: the size of the exhaust manifold studs for the 1700 is M8 1.25M pitch, all other Type IV's M9 1.25 pitch.  Is this correct?

Thanks,

Bob H.
