Of course !   One of the few British cars left .. Park on the kerb and you
can't get out (The wood frame distorts and the door won't open) however I
prefer the pre-war three wheelers (Two wheels at the front and one at the
back) V twin aircooled .. There is a kit car called the "Lomax" that looks
similar.
