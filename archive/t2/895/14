Subject: Re: [T2] aux starter switch

Just run 12V from the battery to the red wire on the solenoid (with the
spade connector on it).  While I (stupidly) yanked such a switch in my 78, I
want to replace it when my Boston Bob rebuild gets back.  The PO used a
large SPST momentary push button from FLAPS.  It's mounting hardware was a
perfect fit for one of the emissions hoses, and fit over it as though custom
made, right above the engine.
