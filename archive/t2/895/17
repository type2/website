Maybe Karl or Richard can answer this. My 4500 self imposed limit is because
over 4k there's just not much power to be had. I'm sure an occasional
emergency blast to 5k probably won't hurt anything, but around 4k is where I
like to head to the next gear. Earlier if I'm just puttering around town,
not trying to accellerate onto the freeway.
