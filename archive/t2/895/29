I've never cared for this kind of throwaway advice.  "Don't work on your own
car because you haven't been doing it for X years like me."

Ask any mechanic/electrician: Properly terminated, secured wiring with
appropriately rated devices ARE safer than taped up hot wires tucked out of
the way.

The tone of the original question was one of a non-expert looking for some
basic, dependable, safe instruction, which has always been the flagship
product of this list.
