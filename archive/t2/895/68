You didn't indicate if you have ATE or Girling Calipers....

211615231 ATE Left
211615232 ATE Right

211615631A  Girling Left
211615232A  Girling Right

Above Fit Type 2 71-79, Vanagon 80-85 (Info Source Fiche & ETKA). BD shows
ATE (-at-) $5.12ea, Girling  (-at-) $10.53ea/left, $13.25ea/right - 2 per caliper
required.  This isn't something I believe they stock, they prolly have to
special order them.  I can count how many times on one hand I got asked for
& sold them in the 20 years I had my VW biz open, because they're usually
re-useable (I have on mine [73/77/80/84]).  The only time ya need 'em is if
they're missing and for some people sometimes they are.
