I've  never cared for this kind of throwaway advice.  "Don't work on your  own
car because you haven't been doing it for X years like me."

Ask  any mechanic/electrician: Properly terminated, secured wiring  with
appropriately rated devices ARE safer than taped up hot wires tucked  out of
the way.

The tone of the original question was one of a  non-expert looking for some
basic, dependable, safe instruction, which has  always been the flagship
product of this  list.




hello Billy  First the wire isn't a hot wire.  second most bus  owners just 
want something that is cheap and works,  and even a switch  would and can cause 
problems. Now the best way would to use a inclosed mech  jumper, preferred 
one has a lite on it showing when hot and take it on and off  when you need to. 
now if one wants to go to the expense and trouble then they  can make one the 
is a permament fixture out of a sealed switch, but personally I  will contiue 
to use a non hot wire cause it is cheap and it works.  You can  do it anyway 
you want.   later  Mark Dearing.
