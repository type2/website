Chris -

Pictures are abit fuzzy, but looks similar (you have a Hella mfr'd one) to
the Hard Start Relay setup I spoke of in an earlier post to you:

solving starter problems (Bosch WR-1 as an >example).  I have one on each of
my VWs, past & present.

Compare the relay terminals and where the wires go on your vehicle verses my
diagram on my website.  Betcha because of that terminal breakage it's
because it was just about to go and not allowing the proper amount of
current flow for the starter to activate.

The relay is essentially a relay used commonly in lighting, horn, fuel pump,
fuel injection and some other circuits on other vehicles, domestic or import
and manufactured by Bosch, Hella, Siemens, etc., as well as the cheepie Far
East ones bought at your FLAPS.  When used with a starter circuit, it's best
to use the 40amp rated relay.  The current VW number is 141 951 253 B, Bosch
0332 019 150.  Stay away from the cheepies.
