Subject: Re: [T2] Tach

Here's a pic of the one I have installed in my '69 Westfalia.  It's an older VDO tach that came
with a used dash I bought.  I mounted in where the clock normally would be.  Works great.  I think
it's basically the same one that VDO currently sells.

I'd rather it only go to 6000 RPM instead of 7000 RPM for increased resolution, but that's just a
wish.  And to have a grey face to match the other gauges as well.

I mainly use it just to check speed, as my speedometer is at least 10 MPH (or more) off at any
given speed.  I pretty much just cruise at 3200 RPM in 4th gear (1600sp), and that seems to keep
the traffic happy.
