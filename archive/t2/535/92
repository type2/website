I humbly apologize to the list, and to Matt, for inappropriately airing 
this complaint and for thinking poorly of him.  Other frustrations of 
mine spilled over into a place where they didn't belong.  Matt was very 
busy and lost track of my email with my return address - he's not 
dishonest.  Again sorry...
