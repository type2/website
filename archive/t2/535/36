I'm with Gary on this one. Leaving the heat exchangers on seems to
balance the cooling air as VW intended for the heads. I had purchased a
set of real cheap aftermarket heat exchangers years ago after running
"J" tubes for about 6 months and noticed a considerable drop in head
temp. I'd say stick with heat exchangers in the circuit, just not real
leaky ones!

John,
	Leave the heater boxes and the fresh air hoses hooked up.  The
boxes seem to act as a heat sink for the heads and they also may help
direct cooling air past the heads and cylinders?  Gary Gibson
