Subject: Re: [T2] Beware of Matthew J. Ramsey

I saw this message this morning.  I am very disheartened.  
I am very sorry about sending you the check.  I missplaced 
the box you sent the seatbelts in.  I will send you check 
and the seatbelts back to you today if you forward you 
address.

I am a very honest person.  This was a mistake than I am 
very sorry about.  I wish you would have approached me 
about this before defacing me on this list.  A personal 
email with your address would have resulted in an immediate 
delivery.  I don't know how many times I hear of people 
search for other because it slipped their mind to pay for 
something.  I kept assuming I would come across the box and 
your address.

Please forward your address and you will have your money 
and seatbelts returned immediately.

I trust those who actually know me will understand this 
mistake.  I am a very active bus person who has cultivated 
many positive friendships from being involved in bussing.

Yes my posts to the list are random and I am usually asking 
a question.  I am a full time teacher, work part time in a 
juvenile justice agency, have two young children and am a 
full time graduate student, working on my 2nd master's 
degree.  My time is very limited and I rarely have time to 
keep up with list traffic.

My address is 17471 Country Club Road, Atchison, Kansas.  
Please feel free to stop by and pay me a visit.  

Again I apologize for this situation.  Is without doubt my 
fault.  I do not wish to make this a personal issue...I 
wish it hadn't been made public as it could have been delt 
with in a much better fashion.
