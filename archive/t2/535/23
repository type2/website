Hi Nik,

I wouldn't worry about the degreaser, it's MUCH more likely that you 
dislodged a wire or vacuum line when you installed that seal.

In particular I would look for a small wire exiting the the harness 
near the AFM running across the motor to the negative side of the coil. 
If that wire is off you can crank it all day long and it will never 
fire.  A vacuum leak is also able to cause a no-start condition, so 
make sure all the vacuum lines are nice and tight.

Happy trails,
