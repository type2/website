VW rated the towing capacity at 1200 kg (with trailer brakes) and 800 kg
(without trailer brakes). From my experience it will work, but you have to
take it easy on the engine if you do not want to replace cracked heads with
every oil change.

I killed a set of DP heads by towing a 74 Westy loaded with parts on a
flatbed trailer (combined weight about 2200 kg) for 40 miles. Possible, but
not good - unlesss you do not care about your engine as in my case because I
was bringing my replacement vehicle home.

With a 2L type 4 you can easily tow up to 1800 kg without putting too much
strain on the bus (thousands of miles personal experience here).

I am contemplating a  16' fiberglass camper that will weigh roughly 1,700
pounds, and add my 400 pounds of junk.... Do you suppose a 1600 DP will tow
this weight?

Who out there is pulling campers?  I know you are there.  What does one of
those scamps weigh?  How about the pucks?
