Subject: RE: [T2] RPM Question

I don't have any numbers or a tach to compare to but your numbers sound
about right.  VW's are meant to be run to near the top of the RPM range
through each gear and then run at high RPM's while cruising.  I seem to
recall an old VW ad that said the top engine speed is also the vehicle
cruising speed.  

BTW my wife drives a new beetle and it runs around 3600 rpm at 70mph.
