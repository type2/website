>Sounds like you have a 68-70 bus..... my advice would be to get a 71 only air

controlled intake flap.

correct, 69 bus. hmmm... i better look that up. i have two or three air
cleaners lying around. just anything other looking than the one i have?
looks like a pain taking off the cable behind the intake...ugg.
