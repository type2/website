Subject: Karl Von Salzen

A while back I placed a thread on this list looking for a top roller/guide
for a slider door on a 1973 VW Bus.
I received some advise to so to a vendor or two to try...and I am thankful
for those that offered that advise.

Something else happened that I did not expect. A man from Fresno named Karl
Von Salzen went to a salvage yard, removed a PERFECT top roller assembly and
mailed it to me by first class mail. I want to stand up and recognize this
man to this list as being one of those cool guys that puts the smile on this
hobby. I have enjoyed relating this story to many friends and have enjoyed
seeing their surprise that a total stranger would go to that trouble for
another.

SO FOR THAT REASON, BY THE POWER VESTED IN ME, I PRONOUNCE TODAY, TUESDAY,
APRIL 6, 2004
*** KARL VON SALZEN DAY! **

Thanks Karl!
