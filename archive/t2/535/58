Subject: 113 905 205T dist in a 1800??

I have a vaccum advance dist # 113 905 205T (68-70 MT
bug) would this work in a 1974 1800 T4 with dual weber
ICTs? I have the dist for free, and am thinking about
trying it out. I checked the archives and found no
record of a discussion about this dist in my motor.

Also thanks  for everyone who helped out with the CDI
I got it up and running perfectly and will mount it
tomarrow.
