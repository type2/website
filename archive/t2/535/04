Tom,
I would consider biting the bullet, and locate a speedo head and replace
it.

No screwing around trying to repair a fractured worn out gear, that will
be destine to failure anyway--

This is what I have wound up doing anyway--and so far so good---

Later,

Terry

Having tried all the usual "fixes" for this problem with no lasting
results I need to find a new gear and start over. *Is* there a source
for this particular gear out there?
