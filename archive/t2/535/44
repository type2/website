sadly, nothing is free!  reports abound of people who 'jetcoated' 
(ceramic?) or in some other ways wrapped their exhaust pipes having 
the pipes disintegrate very quickly afterwards... the extra heat 
retained was basically forcing the metal to oxidize  into rust 
quicker than is normal for exhaust systems.  now, 'quicker' might 
mean different things to different people, but the general impression 
i got in the magazines and the web pages i saw was that it meant 
replacement time in 1 - 2 years, as opposed to 3 - 5.  if you are 
racing, who cares? but if you are looking for a foreverbus - and 
worse, live in salted roads country - i'd say leave the pipes be.

as for jtubes - run em with T3 cooltin. baja guys can leave  heads 
and j's  hanging in the breeze, but your bus still needs the cylinder 
tin to get air around the whole cylinder.
