As am I.  Dirty laundry like this is not appropriate for the list 
at large until all other options have been exhausted.  Please 
contact the admins if you have a gripe about a fellow listmember 
(or vendor) before posting.  And of course, make a reasonable 
effort to resolve the problem yourself first.

Thanks,
