Subject: VW Event Shirts

VW Club Show Season is coming up. I love the variety of shirts that
different clubs print up for their events. I am only able to go to about six
events a year around Indiana, Ohio and Michigan and that just doesn't cure
my desire for shirt variety, so.....

I WANT TO FIND T-SHIRT EXCHANGE BUDDIES FROM ALL OVER.
I think the next best thing to going to shows all over the world would be to
know that a fellow VW enthusiast went to that event and got a shirt and sent
it to me. So Here is the deal.
Our VW Club show is July 18th in Bluffton, Indiana.
If you send me a T shirt in size large from your club show, I will send you
one from our show in the size you tell me.
When people ask did you go to that show you can say a friend did and sent it
to you.

Anyone interested?

Peace,
