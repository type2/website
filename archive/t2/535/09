Subject: New Look for the Full Moon Bus Club

Just wanted to spread the word about our freshly designed website.

If ya get a chance stop on by for a visit  :)

http://www.fullmoonbusclub.com/

Notice:  if you have joined FMBC before or consider yourself a Moonie, you
will need to sign up again in order to post.   In other words, you need to
sign up and make your own password.

Also if anyone (Moonie or not) would like to post an event, you can.  You do
not have to be subscribed to put an event on our calendar.

So if you know of any events not listed on our calendar and you have the
info for the event, Please help us out by posting the info :)

Hope to see some of ya at EveryBus, not that far away...

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
