Subject: kick panel question???

Hi,

I've been making interior panels for buses, but mostly splitties.   I just 
got an email from a guy interested in kick panels for his '70.   I was wondering 
if the kick panels were the same from '68 through '79, or if there were 
changes.   Cause I'm set up to make kicks like the ones I pulled out of a '77.   Do 
those work for all years?

I 'll have pictures up soon (tomorrow, which is Tuesday) at

http://home.comcast.net/~sunrisebus/sunrisebuswerk.html

(shameless plug)

thanks, Clara
