Subject: Re: [T2] 1979 Westy donor to '79 Kombi sunroof

Hi Jason,

I sent a looooong message to Andy off-list about this, but I think some 
clarification on-list couldn't hurt.

There is no reason a late pop-top can't be used on a sunroof. True, you 
won't get the double bed without cutting a LOT of metal, but that 
double bed isn't a requirement for a lot of people. The fibreglassroof 
WILL fit fine over the sunroof hole, and if an upstairs bunk is 
required I would expect that a 68-72 upper cot could be rotated 180 
degrees and installed up top.

Some people never sleep upstairs, they just like to have the additional 
storage space and headroom available when camped.


Happy trails,
