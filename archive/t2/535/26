Subject: Optimal replacement distributor

Hello List. Well, my stock dizzy has finally given up the goat. I have
been debating to replace it for some time, and this weekend the points
threads stripped out. There's quite a bit of play in the shaft as well,
so I would like to replace it with another vacuum advance. I would like
your opinions on the optimal replacement distributor for this set-up;
1974 Bus, 1800cc, stock dual carbs.
I've looked at the SVDA distributor at aircooled.net. Will this give me
the best performance/cost ratio distributor? Also, anyone know of a
distributor for SVDA's in Canada.  
Thanks,
Matt
