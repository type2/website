Subject: Side Tent

Hi All.



Bus Depot use to sell a side tent for around $200.00. I no longer see
that model in their on-line catalog, only the  higher priced $300.00
model. I have sent them a mail asking if they still sell the old one.
Does anyone know where the lower priced tent may still be sold? Anyone
out there have one and can comment on whether you like it or not?



Thanks



Jeff
