Subject: EB Kid's Activities 2004

Hi Folks,
Time is getting close to Everybus, and we are almost set for the kid's
activities.  Check out

We have a MOON BOUNCE coming along with relay races, and arts and crafts
projects. I need folks to donate shoe boxes.  If you have a few to spare,
please bring them along.  We also need three to four tricycles for the First
Annual Everybus 500.  This is a race for the older kids and they will be
trophies for the winning team.  If anyone can help please let me know.
Thanks!
