We just got back from "Fools Fest" at Indian Cave state park in Nebraska.
Good turnout of busses.  Here is my little copilot and her friendly hippo in
front of our bus towing a Scamp.

As far as your question goes, our Scamp is a 13' model, but I do have many
options such as furnace, water heater, shower and airconditioner which add
some over the basic model.  My bus has a tired 2 liter and I put in a lower
gear tranny out of a '73.  I have problems on hills and with head winds.
Don't think I would like to pull with a 1600.  In fact I am trying to find
the time to put together a splitty with a TDI diesel on board.

The splitty will be a standard model with just a fold down seat and one
cabinet so it should weigh much less than the '76 westy and have a little
more power.  Hopefully this combination will get me around a little better
and help with the fuel savings.
