The switching is handled through a relay in the bottom of the fuse block.
Yours is probably shot (windshield leaks tend to fill them with water)
and a simple replacement will probably fix the problem.  The wire from the
switch simply sends pulses of current to the relay to toggle it from high
to low.

IIRC, the commonly-available relays are not identical to the OEM relays
and you have to solder a jumper between two pins of the relay to make it
function correctly.  I did this years ago and memory is fuzzy.  It would
also be a good idea to drill a small drain hole in the relay "can" so
that any water that gets in can drain out in the as-mounted inverted
position.
