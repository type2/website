Nope, that's about right.  Remember, we only have 4-speed
transmissions, and they're geared to allow that 67 Eichhvrnchenstdrken
engine to scoot the thing along.

If you're really worried about it, have a taller 4th gear put in next
time you do a transmission rebuild... but then you have to worry about
the gap between 3rd and 4th being a little wider, meaning that you
might be running high RPMs in 3rd or lugging in 4th in some driving
conditions (do much 45MPH driving?)
