Subject: Will it run cooler if.....

I recently installed a gas heater in my bus (1600 DP),
thus eliminating the need for stock heat exchangers
(which mine are leaky and smelly anyway). I am trying
to logically decide if replacing stock heat exchangers
with J-tubes and plugging the heater air outlet ports
on the fan shroud will actually make the engine run
cooler.  Logic tells me this: if the outlet ports on
the fan shroud are blocked off, then then that means
MORE COOLING AIR to the cylinders which would
logically mean cooler running temps, right!?!?  Or I
am missing something here???
