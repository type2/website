Subject: Beware of Matthew J. Ramsey

Hello folks,

I went to the effort to help this person, but he doesn't seem to be real 
or honest.  I looked thru the archives and found other times when he has 
requested something, but there was no response to the list about whether 
or not the items were received.  I am sorry to report than he has not 
delivered on his promise.  The money for the seat belts is bullsh*t - 
it's the promise to refund my shiiping charges that p*sses me off.  His 
posts are very irregular and always seem to want something.  I'm going 
thru Kansas later this year, and I WILL pay this a**hole a visit.
