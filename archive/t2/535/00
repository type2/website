Try Russ Recyclers in Monrovia in LA,
Lessee...

From the 210 going east from Pasadena, go south on Buena Vista 1 mile to
Van, go right, short block to Bateman, right and follow it around to the
left to Alpha. Russ is on the left side, several wrecking yards up. VW
parts and salvage. You can also take the 605 north towards 210, getting
off on Arrow Hwy westbound, to Buena Vista, go right (north) to Van,
making a left, and continue as above.

I bought most of my large body parts there for the resto in 95.
