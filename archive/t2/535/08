Subject: Steering wheel needed

Hi Volks- I tried to play mechanic today and fix my horn. As usual, with
my mechanical ability, I managed to pretty well chew up the plastic
around the horn button, breaking out big chunks. Anyone have a uncracked
steering wheel they want to get rid of for a '71 bus? I am going to EB
so I could take delivery there if anyone has one. Cash or trade OK.
