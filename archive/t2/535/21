Subject: Who's an expert on upright tin?

I'm trying to sort out my tin situation as well. I have a single port 1776
Mexican dual relief case engine with type 3 clone cool tins installed. Does
anyone have a picture or a breakdown of all the tin pieces that I need to
have to complete my tin installation? I have the cylinder top pieces, I have
a doghouse shroud with flaps and thermostat and the doghouse ducts, and the
cool tins. I got the 71 only front engine tin from Tom Tarka. I know about
the pushrod cover bottom tins and the pulley tin.  What else do I need on
there, particularly from the top cylinder tin on down?

<That one goes under the edge of the upper cylinder cover,
rear (pulley) side of the engine.  Based on that picture I'd
say it's for the drivers side; the angled slope on the end
goes next to the exhaust port.
