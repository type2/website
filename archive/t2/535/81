Subject: Half Empty/Full

Hi,

I have been having fun investigating and exploring my new '74 bus. It
seems that when I fill it up, the gauge only reads half full. On MG's &
Triumphs this usually indicated a bad voltage regulator. I haven't been
able to suss out if this is the same in buses. I've gone through Muir's
book, Bentley & Haynes, but have not been able to track down an answer.
Thanks in advance to any or all who have an answer.

Thanks,

Mark
