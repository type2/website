Subject: Turn Signal Desperation

Greetings all...I seem to have run into a predicament here...I have been
restoring a 1971 Westy, but have run into a major problem...It seems to relate
to the turn signals, here's what happens...All is fine when I use the left
signal, but the right makes both the rear lights flash (not just the right)
but the front end lights are working normally, in addition when I push the
brakes, while the right signal is on, the rear lights stop flashing altogether
(again it works normally when I use the left signal with brakes)...I have went
over the wiring several times and it seems normal, bought brand a new flasher
switch in hopes it was that, but no change...So is this the turn signal switch
itself? If so I have even a worse problem cause it seems no one sells
replacement switches, and I haven't been able to find one
locally...Ahhhhh...it's making me nuts!
So I would like to ask if anyone knows of a 71 bus that they may be able to
get the turn signal (plus as much of the wiring as they can) for me, one more
thing, it has to be the kind that can switch the high beams on/off as well?
Please contact me at iamurme(-at-)comcast.net if you can...Or let me know what else
the problem may be, I am about to give up here.
