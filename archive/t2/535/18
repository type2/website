Subject: Mystery Cooling tin piece..please ID photo

Hey Y'all,
I am building up a 1641 longblock.  Yesterday I picked
up a box of cooling tin from a swap meet. There was a
piece in there that the guy said I need. I DO NOT
recognize it or know where it goes.  It is part #131
119 357, RMMW catalog describes it as:  Tin, Cylinder
cover\Heat deflector 1300-1600 cc.
Can someone please explain to me exactly where this
piece is installed. Heres a link to a photo of the
piece:

Thanks all!
