Subject: RE: [T2] Half Empty/Full

Could be several things.  Sending unit is common.  So is a bad
float, though typically the unit is the issue.  Access to the
sending unit is a real treat.  Mexi busses provided an access panel
just behind the rear bench seat, forward of the top engine
compartment access.  North American models did not have this access
stock.  Lots of folks cut their own access and fabbed a patch to
cover the hole, just in case they had to get access to that unit
again.

  Stock method is to drop everything out so you could get to the
thing, but that is $$$ at a shop in labor alone.  Most shops cut
access panels when doing this work.  So if the cutting into the
steel behind your rear bench seat bothers you,.. ask the shop to let
you know if that is their intention,.. providing of course that you
have somebody else do the work.
