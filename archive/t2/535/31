Wavy washers are generally good for non-safety critical applications where
vibration isn't too high.  I prefer them to star or spring washers as they
don't gouge surfaces.  They are no good for high torque or where you want
the load to spread out over a large area.  Just about any M6 or M8 fastener
on an engine can use them.  Heads and the main case bolts need bigger, thick
washers to work properly.
