Subject: towing capacity

I am contemplating a  16' fiberglass camper that will weigh roughly 1,700
pounds, and add my 400 pounds of junk....
Do you suppose a 1600 DP will tow this weight?

Who out there is pulling campers?  I know you are there.  What does one of
those scamps weigh?  How about the pucks?
