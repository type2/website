Tim,
Lifter's, hydraulic Push rod's, and the lifter's will do the job for the
conversion--

Here's an easy rule of thumb that I have found true to form in any air
cooled engine--be it a bike--or a VW for any prolonged road trip--at
speed--

Drop a pint--quart of some sort of lubricant in the gas to keep the
valve stems and guides petrolis maximus---

I use Marvel in my 74 Westy ( converted to hydraulics ) as well as in my
Wasserleaker's--and Castrol-R in my Brit bikes to keep the upper end---
especially the phosphorus bronze guides, and stem  lubed---

It helps a bunch--

Also consider sodium filled or titanium valves--and hardened seats
---they will last much longer without failure--especially in the hotter
3 and 4 holes---

Good Luck--

Terry

 
My question is has any one else had this happen and would caused it? I
would like to "convert" the solid lifters to hydraulic while it is out.
Is this just switch lifters and rockers? 
Any guidance would be appreciatted.
