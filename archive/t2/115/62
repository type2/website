You don't really need a pump- the bottles come with a pointed nozzle to
which you can fasten a short piece of clear tubing.  I warm the capped
bottle in a pot of just boiled water, then hold it upside down and cut a
hole in the end corner with a razor knife.  Put tape over the hole.  (Or
keep your finger over it as you scrunch underf the bus).  Hold the
bottle next to the tranny as you guide the tube into the hole.  Then
lift the bottle above the hole and squeeze to get it going.  Taped hole
up? Yank the tape and gravity/air pressure will help fill without more
squeezing.  Move the nozzle/tube to the next bottle to keep filling. 
Another trick I've seen is to use a deep funnel hung next to the bus
with a tube running to the trans hole- fill the funnel and watch it go.
