Ok,
            Nipple behind throttle body where small air hose was cracked
and bent.  While I could not fix the crack immediately, I did straighten
it out and put the air hose back on.  This time making sure that it
covered the whole crack.  Put the air cleaner back in, start engine..no
progress.  Idles but still not good.  Ok, back to the starting fluid.
Spray some right around the area where the idle adjustment screw is.
Revs up.  Ok, just for the heck of it, tried opening the idle adjustment
screw some more.  Well, as I unscrew it half-turn by half-turn, the
sound of air coming from somewhere gets louder and louder. ????  Is
there possibly a seal where the throttle body connects to the air intake
distributor?  Im just shooting blanks here.  What am I missing?  Thanks
again..
