Pickle forks work well but be forewarned they can ruin the ball joint or
tie rod end. There are better more expensive tools available or you can do
what I do. After a little heat, use a decent sizer hammer and swing at the
side of the joint. There is ususall a nub or flat spot on the side of the
female portion of the joint. It takes years or practice to know just where
the sweet spot is but once you do you can open any ball joint or tie rod
end. Be careful not to just beat the thing to death. Its a careful,
calculated, zen-like,  direct blow.

>>Having a heck of a time getting the tie rod off without the proper tool,
{heat and WD 40 haven't done it!)<<

go to your FLAPS & buy (or rent) one of those 'pickle fork' tools. apply
the heat to the tie rod end, insert pickle fork & bank away with a small
sledge.
