Jim,

You don't mention so I'm going to assume a manual transmission. I just did
this on my 74 not long ago. I bought a little siphon pump at NAPA for about
ten bucks and it worked like a champ. Here's how I did it:
        1) Remove FILL plug on left side of tranny. It pays to buy the big
17mm allen wrench or             socket for this.
        2) Place oil drain pan under rear of tranny.
        3) Remove drain plug. It helps if the oil is warm when you do this.
        4) Allow oil to drain; inspect for metal chips and other scary junk.
        5) Replace drain plug.
        6) Use Siphon pump to fill tranny. The pump holds about a pint and
the tranny takes 7                 pints if I remember correctly. Your
owner's manual or the Bentley book will have the
            exact capacity.
        7) Replace fill plug.

That's about it. Trust me, after trying squeeze bottles and turkey basters,
the siphon pump is worth the money. The whole job took me maybe 30 minutes
and I didn't spill a drop.

If you have an auto matic, I can't help but maybe one of the others on the
list with auto tranny experience will.

Regards,
Dave
