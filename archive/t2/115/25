for some reason my driver's seat was broken in two places midway up that
back rest. tomas had the fellers weld those breaks back together; they
padded, and covered both front seats; and reused the original orange westy
vinyl on the flip side. he also padded the back rest with "ribs" for extra
comfort at no extra charge. 75 bucks. 6/7/93. it took an hour and a half in
the middle of the day...before siesta. good, safe neighborhood. next time
down, i'm bringing my stockpile of original orange fabric.
