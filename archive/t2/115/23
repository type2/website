Hi Juan-
   We did an around the country trip in 76 in a 71 Westy and a 10,000mi
trip in the 78 Westy in 95 with our then 9 yr old daughter.  I suggest
you do a loop starting towards the south, heading north, and then West
to Oregon or higher to come down the coast with the ocean on your right
(will thrill the passengers more). Go North from Yellowstone- The Route
(Rt 12?) from Missoula Montana towards Idaho/Oregon was very scenic; I
bicycled it once in 84 and went up to Glacier Park, and then across
Oregon to experience the lava beds at the top of the Sisters
(mountains)...to Eugene (look up Franklin Tyler on Bailey Hill Road-
lots of busses).  Rushmore and possibly Devil's tower were not worth the
trip.  Zion, Bryce Canyon, definitely were.  Even Vegas was a thrill for
our daughter (we didn't gamble, just hit the shows/theme tours like at
that Pyramid).
    Put a couple 12 volt outlet in the wall under the seatbed or the
rearfacing seat.  Invaluable for the fans available at BOAT stores with
the suction bottom (Caframo is the brand- stick to windows or the table
top. They have no cage and are safe to touch.)  Depending on your Karma
for/against technological distractions, I suggest a small 5 or 9" TV to
stay up on weather reports and for kid distraction. 9" is the smallest
size usually with electronic self tuning, a must in strange areas.  They
also come with VCR's included.  On long boring runs, our daughter used
this with a Sega videogame. In our 71, we hung the TV above the sink
using eyebolts in the TV top handle shelf and eyebolts that went through
the double wall under the poptop.  A bolt (allthread) ran through all 4
eyebolts.  To keep it from swinging, we guyed an eyebold through the
bottom to the back of the sink unit.   You can drill small 1/4" holes
into the table top to put in eyebolts or nylon cord loops to allow a
tiedown for the TV- RV stores have suction cups also for this purpose. 
On a recent trip we took a laptop with a DVD player and ran the sound
output to small selfpowered minispeakers which had a 12 volt input. (Or
use a splitter to run a few earphones.)   
    If you have an upper cot, consider a foamboard roofbed as on our 71;
would hold 2 small kids; I can send a pic.  This was stock on some Westy
European models and easily hinged from the roof under the poptop front
and went up with the poptop when you didn't want it, using the roof
lockdown grabbers to mounts on the board mimicking the roof mounts. 
Much better than the cot.
   On our 6 week trip, we stopped at a motel offering a pool about once
a week or when the weather was terrible for setting up a camp.  A
Woodall's or Good Sam campground directory is good, since we did not
plan more than a day ahead.
