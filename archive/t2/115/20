Subject: Re: [T2] hole in floor?

Look in your owners manual if you have one. Just in case you don't
here's what it is. There should be a control valve just behind one of
the body supports that runs near the rear of the front seats. Off one
side of this is a (or there should be) a duct that runs to this hole.
There is a piece of metal that fits in the hole & looks like a shop
vac attachment (the long skinny one) that blows hot air on the far
back passengers. I don't have the piece nor do i have a need for it.
