             I recomend that you have a look at just kampers web site I sent 
you details of earlier for part prices in the UK as I have no idea what South 
Africa prices are like. When I asked what the emissions were like after its 
MOT test I was told that it was only checked for excess smoke. Just a 
thought, but it might be an idea to advertise if anyone has any wants for 
South African parts then you could fill up the van and sell the items which 
would offset the cost of your import.
                                                 regards Mel
