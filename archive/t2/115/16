Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Tent Repair

I had the same kind of rip in my tent when an awning roofpole broke and
poked through the top.  I sewed it first (sewing maching zigzag stitch,
or you can hand sewing with a curved needle and loop stitches, then put
a coating of urethane clear calk (E6000 or UltraClear (Ultra, Mentor,
Ohio44060)- on both sides to seal the sewing.  These remain flexible and
are much tougher than silicone (I tested it by making a 2" square layer
onto newspaper and trying to rip it when dry- can't do it by hand,
compared to silicone!
