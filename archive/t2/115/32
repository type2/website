As far as I know all of the Vanagon on campers had 3 way refers. So if you
do not have any controls, it sounds like an ice box.

Subject: [T2] Westy fridge question...


Hoping this wonderful group could help me with this one. I'm trying to
figure out which fridge I have in my newly acquired 1980 Westy (2.0L,
air-cooled). I'm assuming it's a Dometic and there is no gas hookup on my
camper so it's go to be AC/DC. I've found literature online about the RM
182, but mine doesn't have ANY controls on it ANYWHERE (that I can find).
I'm trying to get the specs on it so I can attempt a repair. The previous
owner told me they never used it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
