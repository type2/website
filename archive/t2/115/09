Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Westy Suspension

>> suggestions on 
what parts of the front suspension I should change to make the bus feel a 
little more solid at freeway speeds.  I'm considering buying torsion arms w/ 
ball joints already installed (set of 4 from Bus Boys, I believe...), new tie 
rods w/ ends, rebuilt steering box and new steering damper.  Do I need anything 
else?  Would anyone suggest anything else? <<

well, it really depends on what needs to be replaced. a thorough inspection
of the front suspension will tell you what you need.

as far as the ball joints go, if they need to be replaced, that will
make a _huge_ difference in the way your bus handles, so IMHO, look
there first.

tie rods & ends will help your alignment & steering performance.

for the steering box, thats is a really pricey item, so check to see if it
can be adjusted before replacing. (see Bentley)

steering damper is an inexpensive part, so if yours looks old and/or
crusty, go ahead & replace.

you could also replace the stabilizer bar bushings & clamps, if needed.

also, the tires of the proper specs will help highway handling (if you
dont already have them anyway).


>> Any comments on lowering the bus? <<

yes, don't do it!!! if its handling you're after, lowering your
bus is not likely to imporve it.

not to say it can't be done of course. but IMHO it will work
best if left stock.

& most important, have fun on your journey! (& take the AIRS list with you)
