Subject: 76 thru 79 questions

Hello list,

I admit I too have been a lurker. What a great list.

What are all the differences between 76, 77, 78, and 79?

I know that in 78 hydraulic lifters were added.  And I think self adjusting 
rear brakes came in 79, plus the different exhaust?  Seems like westfalia 
interiors switched to the more durable and non-flaking adhesive simulated 
wood grain in 79 too(not sure)? But what else is different?  What year did 
front disk brakes become standard? Any front end changes?

Thanks,
Brandt

78 Westfalia (Vegas Bus)
79 Westfalia (Rusty Bus)
