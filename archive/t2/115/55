Chuck, that's exactly what I said in my original post!  four weeks is a
minimum!  The active thought here is that if you get back and you remember
your password, then you were *not* gone long enough! :-)

Indeed we can!  and *big* dreams!

I like the idea of assembling a list of regional sites by natives, BTW.
Each of us almost certainly knows sites near our homes that are fabulous,
but unknown to non-natives.  Here in DC, ferinstance, I would recommend
the Capitol Spring (center of the NE lawn of the Capitol), tho it is
probably guarded these days :-( and for those who think they have twisty
roads... I recommend Beach Drive!  :-)
