Well, Joel suggested a pickle fork, and that tool will do the job, but it
will ruin the tie rod end, or at least the boot.  More expensive, but
worth every penny are the snap-on bar pullers.  Everyone owns one snap-on
tool, and this is mine.  I *highly* recommend these!  A picture of one is
at:

They can be bought for ~$75-100 singley at auction or you can buy the set
for ~200.  I have the set and do not regret the money spent at all.

For *slightly* less, almost as good, and available locally is the
posi-lock puller. I have one of the three-jaw pullers, have used it and it
works as designed.  The advantages are that they are sold at Sears and
they are three-jaw.  This can be a plus or minus, depending on the job.
They also sell a two-jaw puller, but I have not seen it.  Pictures of this
puller are at:

I have owned and used the lose-jaw pullers that you can get pretty much
anyplace and i hate them.   I regard them as hazardous.  When you use a
puller, you are concentrating tons of force on a very limitied area and
funny things can happen.  Also very bad things.   I have not had a
constrained-jaw puller pop off and hit me yet.  I have had the loose jaw
pullers do just that and it hurt!
