I am sorry to say that I disagree.  In many states impeding traffic will
get you a ticket and in all places it is not polite.  My buses seem to
handle at about the HP/weight ratio of a semi and in the places where an
extra lane is created for slow moving traffic, I am *there*!  If I am on a
two lane road and someone comes up behind me, I pull over at the next safe
opportunity and let them by.  If there is a line of cars, I let them all
by.  If the shoulder runs out, stop and pull back into traffic after it is
clear.

One thing I really admire once you get into the mountains is the
widespread availability of pull-outs and the willingness of other drivers
to use them.  I have had experiences with RVs going slower than even a
bus, and many times they will pull out to let you by.  I like this and am
willing to return the favor.  In cases where I have been caught behind a
very slow-moving vehicle that will not pull out, I figure that is it time
for a beauty break and am not losing anything by taking one.

We are driving antiques and expecting the rest of the world to conform to
our limits isn't fair to the rest of the world and is dangerous to us.
Having an angry driver behind you does not teach him anything and it may
endanger you.
