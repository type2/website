Subject: Fuel Injection? problems

Hey, I know this isn't exactly bus related (though I need to fix this because my bus is currently under a full restoration). Here's the deal: I have a 95 Golf (see, it's still a VW) that is my only other car. I've taken it to 2 different dealers and it still won't run quite right. It's stubmling on acceleration and stalls quite often. The thing is, it only does it when it gets warm (after about 30 minutes), when it's cold it runs great. I've already changed a Dist cap/rotor, the fuel filter, the fuel pump, the MAf meter, the plugs, and the wires. As you can see I've takne it apart and put it back together more times than I'd like to count. I don't know anything about Fuel Injection or these newer cars so I gotta come up with some kind of plan fast! I'm also getting really tired of paying $60-$70 a pop for diagnostics. Is there anybody out there in bus land that can even try to lead me in the right direction? If this was a 40 horse it would have been fixed a week ago. The one good point is that it got the fire back into me to get the bus done as fast as possible so I might be able to fix it if something goes wrong (there's the bus content). Any help is greatly appreciated, you can even e-mail me off list if you have any suggestions or just call (757)490-9650 (even collect if you want). This thing has to fixed soon or it's gonna be a long walk to work when my friends get tired of taking me every day.

Thanks,
Jason
