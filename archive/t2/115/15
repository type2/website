Subject: Ah Ha! BN4 placement

Now I get it!  Thanks for all your guys' help.  I see that the BN4, with the help of the little mounting bracket, actually hangs suspended a little over the engine tin, and NOT to the far left of the engine compartment as I had envisioned. So when I cut a hole for the exhaust, will I be cutting through the engine tin, and NOT through the battery tray??
