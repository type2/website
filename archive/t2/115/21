First off, never be sorry to disagree.
Life is better because proper people disagree for proper reasons.

OK, now then, getting beyond my two line above preach .......

What  we are saying here is pretty much the same thing,
although maybe I did not express myself very well.

That slow lane over on the right side.............. ?
It is the best thing on the highway for a bus.
I stay there, and pull over to it when it is available.

Same for the pullout lane
that let's you get out from in front of traffic you are slowing down.
A truly great road feature that should be engineered into the design more 
often than it is.

Driving on the extreme far right side of the road...............
that "part" that is commonly called the "shoulder".

That part that is not meant to be driven.
Some pull on to that shoulder, but I never do............. NEVER...

It is a sure fire way to get in trouble.
