I own a lowered bus, and I own a STOCK bus too. The stock bus is the way to
go, hands down, as lowering a bus does not improve the ride, although it
does improve the handling (performance wise).

Very true, but I chose to lower my '77 for the look, and it looks great! I
noticed a significant increase in bounce, rough riding and overall
discomfort.

Lowering a bus is costly and not worth the trouble unless you are doing a
mild-custom or a show vehicle. The adjustable front beam is about $400 plus
the time or labour to install, plus a set of shocks (shortened travel), plus
turning the rear torsion leaves to match the front drop.

> it's a lot of work

Very true.

> keep it stock

For daily use and camping, use the above statement as the best advise. If
you want a van that is rough riding and bouncy, then lowering is an option.

I would keep it stock....
