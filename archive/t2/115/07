Subject: Body Shop Question, SE Pennsylvania

Hello all,

I looked through the archives and couldn't really
find anything there; so I'm wondering if anyone has any
recommendations for a professional body shop/local shadtree
welder to weld in a panel or two on my 79 Westy.  I'm in
the South Eastern Pennsylvania area.

Thanks in advance,

Matt Cuddy
