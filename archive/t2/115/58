Off the top of my head:

76/7 almost identical.  I can't think of any differences, tho there were
some, no doubt.

'78 hydraulic lifters, as you said.  Sliding middle windows. Catalytic
converter on CA only.

'79 square port heads - one year exhaust and heater boxes.  Fed and CA
have a cat.  Electronic ignition on CA models

I *think* self adjusting brakes came in '80 on the Vanagon, tho there may
have been some '79s out there with them.  I have both a bay and a vanagon
and see no reason that the vanagon backing plates and self-adjusters could
not be retrofitted.

I think this happened in '78, but am not 100% sure.

'71

Any front end changes?

Not from '73-'79.  I *know* the beams will flop straight out, having done
it.
