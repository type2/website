Hi Troy,

Bummer about your engine.  The rough idle sounds like a vacuum leak, and the 
oil light sounds like not enough oil.  First, make sure your oil is topped 
up.  Then, check all your vacuum hoses, starting from the air cleaner and 
working your way back to the engine.  The Bentley manual has a pretty good 
section on FI, and it can help you route through them.

On my 1979 engine, the 3 hoses that made the idle rough were the oil 
rebreather hose and the 2 brake booster hoses.  The oil rebreather comes 
from a box on the top center of the engine near the rear (rear is rear) and 
goes forward to the S-hose.  One of the brake booster hoses comes from a 
diaphragm mounted to the front firewall, and the other one comes from the 
left side of the engine compartment -- both hoses go to a Y fitting on the 
center of the engine near where the intake pipes go into the air 
distribution box.

Also, if you have a stock engine with the charcoal canister (black plastic 
cylinder next to battery), check the hose that goes from the engine to it.  
The air cleaner side doesn't matter as much, but the engine side is another 
spot for a leak.

Good luck with your vacuum leaks, and start saving for a rebuild -- you'll 
probably need it relatively soon...
