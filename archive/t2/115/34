Subject: Extra beds in Westies

I've gotten requests for details on the European Roofbed in early
campers; as I recall, around 97 I detailed this (when I was
TVCR50A(-at-)prodigy.com) and you should check the archives. I can send pics
of this to those emailing me.
       Another bed I designed (for the 78) is a board that spans from
the dash to contact the front seats- it was curved in front to match the
windshield and had a separate mat on it; its frame consisted of 3 1x1
oak rails that had 2 spanned from the front dash to nylon webbing loops
hanging from the seat belt mounts; the 3rd ran between these 2 just in
front of the seatback fronts.  I adapted the swivel seat to slide
rearward further and be functional with the frontbed in place.  To keep
it all in alignment, drill 1/8" or 3/32" holes through both board and
frame in 2 places and drop in holding pegs made from rounded 4 penny
nails.  The daughter used the front bed until age 9, much more comfy
than the cot.  I don't have pics, but I still have the mat we made and
the board.  Don't know where you'd store it in an early Westy; we kept
the board on top of the roofbed in the 78.  I can envision an adult
sized bed built into a 70 camper using a 3' wide plyboard 1/2" thick 
that rests and overlaps the driver frame seatback (move the seat forward
or remove it) and spans to the rear, resting on a frame built to the
front of the flat seatbed; being higher, it can overlap the rear bed. 
Properly painted, you could carry the board on the roof?
  The rails were adapted to the later bed I designed for the center of
the 78 Westy (email me for the web addy or some pics; I got shut down at
Geocities for too much actvity in one day!  For this, the swivel seat
can be turned sideways or slid to the front dash by releasing the stop
on the rail.  A frame was made that simply spans from the front doorpost
to the side of the driver seat frame; in the rear, it fastens to the
side of the sink unit and stands freely on the floor- people can sit in
the rear seatbed with this in place.  It's all held by drop in nail pegs
or rails with center end mounted pegs that slip into 1/8" holes.  The
frame stores in the space over the closet.
   Obviously the best idea would be to have an attached tent that
increases the living space.  For the current cost of a mint Westy tent,
you can get a retractable awning (Dometic) and design/sew your own tent
to fit under it- I can send pics of such a tent also- some of you have
seen it at campouts such as Everybus.
