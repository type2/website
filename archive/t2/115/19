It was standard on all the buses. It was for a heat vent that you don't
have. It comes off of the main heat tube that runs down the center of the
vehicle and would come out of a "plenum" type thing that looks like a vacum
cleaner attachment. You should have a little flap there to cover it.

I have a 79 bay, what is the purpose of the
hole in the center of the floor just in front
of the middle seat?  The PO had covered it up
with some duct tape under the mat.  If I remember
correctly it looked to be about 2", looks like
it would scoop air from the road.

Thanks,

Rob
