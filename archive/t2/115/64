Hi John,

I'm jumping into this from the middle and not sure where the discussion
started so please forgive me if I misunderstand...but:

I've got a '72 with a stock heater installation on the left side =
(opposite
of the normal battery position) of my bus. The holes for the heater =
exhaust
do not go through the tin. They go through the "floor" area directly
underneath. My heater is removed at present so if it would help, I =
would be
happy to take some digital pictures of the area (with exhaust locations =
and
such) and mail them to you. Let me know...

Regards,

John B.

Now I get it!  Thanks for all your guys' help.  I see that the BN4, =
with the
help of the little mounting bracket, actually hangs suspended a little =
over
the engine tin, and NOT to the far left of the engine compartment as I =
had
envisioned. So when I cut a hole for the exhaust, will I be cutting =
through
the engine tin, and NOT through the battery tray??=20
