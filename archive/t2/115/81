Hi Biill,

Power to the coil should be supplied from a wire controlled by the ignition
switch. If the coil is somehow supplied power from the alternator or battery
(or both) then the engine cannot be turned off by the key.

I had the opposite problem after my last engine drop, I had no power at the
coil and it would turn over but would not run. I had to hotwire my bus for a
couple of days until I had time to sort it out. Bad Idea...when I wanted to
shut it down I had to open the hatch and pull the alligator clip off the
battery. Which sounds pretty similar to what's happening in your case.

Happy trails,
