Hey there Folks,

This might be a case where *everyone* is correct.

A '77 bus would have had a 2.0L installed at the factory (USA specs),
but that doesn't mean that it still has a 2.0L in it now.

Since a 77 is 25 years old, it might have had an engine swap (or two,
or three) performed over it's life time.

Make sure to check the engine number (example,GE 050442) on the block
(on top, where the case halfs meet, near the oil breather) and *not*
on the fan housing ('cause the fan housings can be switched, as Karl
like to remind us).

So, yeah, for a USA 77 bus a 2.0L is stock, but who knows what engine
the PO (previous owner) had swapped in there.

Hope this helps,
