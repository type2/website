I think VW's "undocumented changes" are in place because communication
between the design shop, the procurement shop and the assembly line wasn't
their strong suit. If the new model year came out that was supposed to have
high-mounted turn signals in the nose and they had 600 low-mount-turn-signal
noses sitting there ready to install, and those 600 noses would fit on the
new buses, they'd ship 600 new buses with old noses.
