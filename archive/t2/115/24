I haven't been busted yet, but I've noticed a VW syndrome.  No matter =
how fast you go, other cars will pass you just because you are a VW and =
"should" be going slow.  Coming down Snoqualmie pass in my 1977 Riveria, =
I was doing about 85, the bus was shaking and dancing all over the lane =
and I was being passed by everyone.  I slowed down by North Bend to see =
about 6 of the cars pulled over by state troopers.  I can just imagine =
them trying to explain that they couldn't have been speeding...they were =
just trying to pass the slow VW bus.
