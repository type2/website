Subject: RE: [T2] Air scoop cover OEM

I have this kit. It is a plastic and fits over the vents in the back of the
bus. It allows only a minimal amount of air to enter the engine compartment.
The directions say not to use it above 50 degrees. I never got a chance to
try it out this winter since it really did not get that cold here in Va.
Plus I have not heat right now, so below 50 is a little to cold for me in
the bus. 

Anyway, the Ebay auction says that this is a NOS item and gives a part
number. Is this really something that was offered by VW? It is pretty cool,
although it is not something that you can just put on in the morning and
then take off when the sun comes out and warms things up. It has plastic
bolts with big washers on the back that hold it on. A pain to put on and
remove.

Does anybody know if this is a good thing to use on the bus in the winter or
is it bad to restrict the that much air flow?

Just saw this on Eb*rf. I remember people discussing these this winter and
they have a pic available.  The item number is Item # 1812704302.  I am only
using this because it has a pic I have no interest in this auction...
