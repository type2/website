I doubt it would ever get cold enough in VA., for a long enough time to
ever use these-----

Now if you lived in the "land of eternal cold" ( Minnesota ) where the
temps can drop to -50 for days on end--yea, they could be worth your
while---

Later

I have this kit. It is a plastic and fits over the vents in the back of
the bus. It allows only a minimal amount of air to enter the engine
compartment. The directions say not to use it above 50 degrees. I never
got a chance to try it out this winter since it really did not get that
cold here in Va. Plus I have not heat right now, so below 50 is a little
to cold for me in the bus. 
Anyway, the Ebay auction says that this is a NOS item and gives a part
number. Is this really something that was offered by VW? It is pretty
cool, although it is not something that you can just put on in the
morning and then take off when the sun comes out and warms things up. It
has plastic bolts with big washers on the back that hold it on. A pain
to put on and remove. 
Does anybody know if this is a good thing to use on the bus in the
winter or is it bad to restrict the that much air flow?

Just saw this on Eb*rf. I remember people discussing these this winter
and they have a pic available. The item number is Item # 1812704302. I
am only using this because it has a pic I have no interest in this
auction...
