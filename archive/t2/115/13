Subject: RE: [T2] Sliding Door Handle

Hal,

The lock core can be removed. There is a small screw on the inside of the
shaft. Remove the inside handle push out the handle. You will see the screw
down by the flange. Remove this and the lock cylinder will slide out. Now
what? Find a good used handle from a '68-'73 ($20.00 from us with out a
key). The handle itself has the key code, record this number then pull out
the lock cylinder  carefully not to loose any of the sliders/ tumblers/ or
springs. A lock smith can cut you a key for about $20.00 or buy a complete
used handle from us with two keys for $40.00.

Subject: [T2] Sliding Door Handle


The outer sliding door handle on my bus has a thoroughly mangled lock (I can
see springs and tumblers pointing in all the wrong directions if I look in
the key hole).  Is there a way to  install a new lock into the existing
handle or am I better off looking for a different handle with a key.  Its a
71 btw.

Hal
