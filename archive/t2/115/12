===========================>
I might add .............

REALLY learn early on to just not worry if you slow traffic down behind you 
a bit.
Go down those steep hills and mountains in low gear and let the engine keep 
you going slowly down those mountains.

It is your trip to enjoy, and no matter what you do, you will irritate some 
people no matter how fast or slow you drive.

As you climb mountains ........... pull over for others ONLY if you feel 
safe doing same.

NEVER ride the side of the road so as to allow others to pass you.
Those idiots passing you will presume you are happy to stay there forever 
and will pass you as though you are going to do just that ...... even if 
the side of the road ends.

There are some pretty bad drivers out there, and most of them are bad 
because they have never had to understand the needs of other drivers on the 
road. They just presume that have all the right to take whatever they want 
on the concrete..... and they will take it if given the chance.
