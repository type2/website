In another life, I bicycled from NJ to Toronto, across the Manitoulins
(cool flat rock formations), crossed at Soux St. Marie (sp?) and went
across on Rt 2.  Noteworthy were the Hot Spring at Saco, Rt 12 from
Missoula west, Flathead Lake (cool rounded rocks and cherry orchards
everywhere), Glacier Park (windy), and across Idaho (Snake River) and
the lava beds of the sister mountains of Oregon.
