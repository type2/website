For several years we have taken a 3000-5000 mile trip in our '71 each
summer.  No problems beyond a broken throttle cable.

If you drive your bus sensibly (keep at 60 or under, never climb hills at
wide open throttle, etc.) you should have no problem.  Folks seem to have
problems when they push their buses too hard.

Any problem you prepare for is less likely to happen, so prepare for
everything you can.  I doubt that a throttle cable for my '71 was
available in Ely, NV when mine broke, so I'm very happy I had a spare!

Plan on taking three weeks in August and see what I see with no final ultimate destination other then to arrive back at home.  I live in the San Francisco bay area and hope to see the Grand Canyon, Jelly Stone Park, & Mt. Rushmore, also would like to drive the coastal route between Canada and California.
