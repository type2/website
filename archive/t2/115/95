Very nice.  Good road.  Take your time!  Buffalo has a very nice museum.

I always wonder about warnings like this.  I've never found a pass in the
western US that I couldn't climb in my bus with no problem.  Perhaps I was
in 3rd or 2nd, but that what the gears are for!  As long as you are not
operating at maximum power (WOT) continuously you won't have any problem
if your bus is in good shape.

I've been to Hot Springs SD, and had a great time.  The Log Cabin motel is
good, and the local warm pool was worth the trip.  If the SoCal tort
lawyers ever saw that pool they would have a cow!  :)

I like them too.  Often you can find NF, state park, and BLM sites that
are comperable or better than the NPS sites and a lot less crowded.
Sometimes it seems that the NPS wants to run its parks like Disneyland!
