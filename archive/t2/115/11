as far as I can tell, he is a loon!
it helps if you speak spanish - he and his family will pretend not to know
english if they don't feel like bothering with you.
he will not let you look at the cars behind the fence. he will claim he is
out of anything you want... one time, i needed a dipstick (have a berg
sender, left the dipstick on the bench at home); he claimed they didn't
have any!!!!!!!!!   he has had a rebuilt (gex) motor on the floor for 3
years - asked him how much, he said 'it was already sold.'

he has a LOT of cool stuff, but in the 4 years my wife lived around the
corner from him, i was never able to get so much as a fuse outta him. as
far as shop skills: he has an amazing shop in the back. i've never seen him
use it.
