Hello all,
            To those that havn't replied THANK YOU.  You encouraged me
to look at the engine myself instead of going right to the shop.  Well,
I check all the air tubes (That I know of).  Now, I sprayed starter
fluid into this one aread behing the throttle body.  It seems that there
is a T connector where three small air hoses come together.  One of
those air hoses goes down behind the throttle body.  (Once again, my
apologies for the lack or correct terminology)  I took pics of the area
I am talking about.  http://www.wicals.com/troy/vw/images/airleak%20web/
I am frantic and apologize for not having time to compress the images.
When I spray down in that general direction, engine begins to rev
smoother and then goes back to a rough idle.  Any help on what I should
be looking at specifically?  Where can I order these air tubes from?
Thanks again for all the help.
