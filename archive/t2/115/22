Subject: '70 Bus Oil Cooling

Anybody that has made upgrades to the oil cooling system on their pre - 
doghouse design cooling system ..............

Could you please take a moment to p-mail me and let me know............
What you did,
Where you sourced your materials,
What were the results analysis,
What would you do different if you were to do it all over.

Just want to know so I can decide on whether or not to quit festering over 
this issue.
