unless their duplicate has never seen the light of day
outdoors or water then by default it has shrunk.  It
is also possible that the nos canvas (at least what i
have ever seen) is a different weave and has more give
than the  canvas on the repros.  but it does seem to
be a common complaint.  did he suggest a reason why
all these folks thought the canvas was too small?  did
he think they were not installing it correctly and
suggest some solutions?
