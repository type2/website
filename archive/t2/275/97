not import regulations as much as selective tarrifs. pickups where subject
to import duty, ever wonder why japanese trucks were shipped without pickup
beds? VW had a bit of a problem there. See a decent amount of them running
around the island here. Guy down the road from me has one that sits besides
his house and never moves, what a waste.
