Subject: STARTER

Hi peoples,

I've been having trouble starting my 72 van for the past couple of months.
Sometimes when i turn the ignition nothing happens, and i try again and it
tries starting
and eventually starts. On Friday i stopped the van and when i went to start it
up (nothin.)
i looked under the van at the wires to the starter and jiggled them around and
the large black wire
to the starter broke off (old connection). so i thought i should check out the
solenoid.
I went to loosen the bolt to the starter and the solenoid bolt broke right
off. now i have the starter out.
is there any way to test a starter to see if it works when it is out of the
van? and without a solenoid
attached?i just want to see if i need a new solenoid or if the starter is gone
too.

Your help is much appreciated,
Darren
