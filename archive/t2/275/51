Subject: RE: [T2] pop top canvas a little small

What are people using to replace the securing strap on top for stapling? We
use strips of top set base cut to our own thickness. I have found that a
little thinner than stock helps in gathering a little more fabric in the
vertical direction. Also when installing these we support the pop top just
bellow full open. The tension is tight when popped f the strips are stapled
good it will hold and not tare. I wonder how tight these where from the
factory and if the older material was more elastic?
