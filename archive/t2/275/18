Cassidy,

Muffler tape(from a local flaps) wrapped around the pipe before you insert 
it.

Be sure and read the instructions and let it warm slowly before running 
full blast. 

A better solution would be a "reverse" pipe knurling device  or "reverse"
muffler pipe expander.  This tool actually makes a pipe a smaller 
diameter.

The only problem is I have never seen one except the one I have and it is 
a custom made job...made from a pipe cutter with a custom machined 
"cutting" wheel.

Cheers, dave
