Canada got a lot of late bus stuff that the US didn't.  I'm not sure how
straightforward it was to bring them down, as they were never sold here
and are too new for the magic "25 year" grace.  Obviously, some folks can
do it!

Since the early wedgies were aircooled, I suspect that the early wedgie
pickups were also aircooled.  Were these imported to the Great White
North?  I doubt that Mexico got any, since they were getting the Bay buses
even when the wedge was imported to the US.  Perhaps South Africa?

The obvious way to import is to get one in Canada, load it up with
something illegal, have someone else get caught with it in Texas, and then
buy it at a sheriff's auction!  :)  Instant legal title!
