Hi, 

With regard to oil change frequency - I don't think you can do any harm by changing the oil too often. With your usage of 200 miles per month it may be better to reduce the frequency from once every 3000 miles - primarily as a lot of short runs will not get the oil hot enough to remove water absorbed into the oil and you will end up with brown froth on the oil filler cap (lots in archives about this). 
But if you change the oil too often then you will just be wasting money, once before winter and once before summer will probably suit your usage. 

Secondly your loose fitting damper into muffler; this should not be a friction only fit but should be using a clamp - exactly the same sort of clamp that holds the heat exchanger onto the muffler. 

Good luck
