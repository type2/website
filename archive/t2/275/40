Subject: BN4 fuel pump

I've managed to break the bakelite stand that supports 
the points in my early BN4 gas heater.  Does anyone have 
an old rotted fuel pump they'd be willing to part with?
Please let me know.
OR....
Has anyone successfully installed a low volume/psi 
electric fuel pump from a flaps?
if so, what psi/volume should I look for?  

thanks
