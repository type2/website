Hi Richard,

I had the same problem with my 79 Westy, and found a good solution for it.  
Over the years, the cheap foam insulation that VW used will dry and turn to 
dust, leaving no seal around your fresh air flaps.  However, you can make a 
gasket with silicone.  Here's how:

1. Remove the flaps and clean the area around them.

2. Put a large bead (1/4" or larger) of silicone on the body under where the 
flaps go.

3. Put plastic wrap or a plastic bag over the silicone and fresh air 
opening.

4. Reinstall the flaps while the silicone is still soft, and close the flaps 
over the silicone and plastic.

The flaps will compress the silicone, but the plastic will keep it from 
sticking to the flaps and sealing them forever.  Once the silicone has 
dried, re-open the flaps and cut holes in the plastic, leaving plastic 
covering the silicone.  Presto, custom fresh air gaskets!

Good luck!
