Actually, they are truck rated tires.

Quite a few truck tires do, unfortunately.  If you buy a set of Hercules
185R14 in passenger rating they have the M+S stamp.  If you buy the
same tire in load range C or D it won't have the stamp despite the fact
that it has exactly the same tread pattern.  Go figure!

That would be me.  I even prefer highway to "all terrain" treads on
off-pavement excursions as they will spin without digging a hole.  If you
don't have a lot of power you don't want an aggressive tread.

Now, if confronted with a snow tire control area I would prefer a M+S
tire, and I keep a pair of Uniroyal Laredos on spare rims for those
occasions.  I didn't like the Laredos because of uneven wear, so they only
go on for snow.
