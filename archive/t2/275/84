Subject: Re: [T2] Squirrelly fuel gauge sender repair.

Mighty long dipstick!  My gauge quit like 50,000 mi ago or more and I
have not run out of gas--Just record your odometer reading when you fill
up (and alway fill up!) and then you will know when it's time to gas
up!  Keeps a record of your mpg also. I usually fill at around 200
miles.
