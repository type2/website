Would you believe: 1/2 gallon soda bottle.  Stuff a dowel in there that
is put in a drill press and pushed against a sanding belt to taper it. 
Drill a hole down its center. Epoxy a piece of brass tube in the hole. 
Add gas line from this to carb.  Hang the bottle on the air intake grill
(make a wire handle that is duct taped around the bottle).  I think I
drilled a hole in the flat end so gas could be poured in.
