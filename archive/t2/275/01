ka-tsssst! ...glug glug glug...

Aahhhh. Home again.

Just got in from John Brown's Buses in Harpers Ferry WV. We left 
Toronto after work on Friday night at 7:30 PM and arrived at the 
Harpers Ferry KOA 560 miles later at 7:00 AM. Set up camp and slept 
until noon, then got up and enjoyed the gang.

I had no problems driving all night, I worked midnight shift for a few 
years and know what to expect. And NOTHING keeps you more awake than 
the sight of a wet and steaming fresh deer carcass in your lane. I saw 
several of these between Pittsburgh PA and Maryland.

Not gonna write the trip report yet, gonna have to sleep first. Have to 
go to work in the morning, too.

It was a good trip, and Jamie Auch hosted a great gathering. More 
details & pictures to come soon as we get the bus unpacked. (tomorrow 
or the next day).

Happy trails,
