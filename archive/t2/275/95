The introduction of an inert gas (in this case exhaust gas) displaces "air" 
and hence effectively reduces the air /fuel ratio (runs richer). This cools 
the chamber and reduces N0x at the cost of increasing the CO and HC.

Yes. You must readjust CO to compensate for lack of EGR.

Yes. You should run at 4% CO without EGR.

Yes. You should run at 4% CO without EGR.

By the way adjustment of CO is normally made at idle when EGR is not active. 
This adjustment allows a fixed % of the input air flow to pass unmetered. 
The more unmetered air the higher the air/fuel ratio (runs leaner). This 
adjustment effects the air/fuel ratio at and off idle.

Sounds to me like you have the picture.
