Kind souls,

I hate to bring the list into this, but i need some
help.

I sold my '68 sunday to some nice folks for their
16-year-old son. I was honest to a fault about it.

Besides some body issues, it's a good bus. I drove it
all over all week without a hitch, just did a tune up
and the engine isn't using any oil.

Of course, they got 20 miles down the road and broke
down.

The father, a truck driver and mechanic, nursed it
home. He says it lost power and blew some smoke out
the pipe then stopped. It started a coupe times, then
died. The VDO temperature was 210* and it had plenty
of oil. NO horrible noises outta the engine.

He surmises the engine sucked oil from the air cleaner
into the carb and fouled the (platinum) plugs. He said
he got it home by fiddle with the choke by hand to get
it started, then played with the gas pedal to nurse it
home.

His explanation doesn't sound right to mesucking oil
out of the air cleaner!
My best guess is something electrical went wrong, then
he flooded it trying to keep it going. God knows what
he did with the choke trying to get it started. Also,
he acknowledged he was testing how fast it would go on
the interstate--probably 70mph--the speedo is kaput.
Maybe the unusual heat affected something electrical?

Long story short: i would rather CANCEL the deal than
have bad KARMA. I told him that i'll come get it,
about 45 miles.

Any suggestions on where to look for the problem? I'm
going up there this evening with a set of new plugs
and my spare parts box. I might buy a new coil.

Any clues greatly appreciated.
