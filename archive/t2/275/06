 The 'vent' system is fresh air coming thru the vent on the nose between the
turn signals. You operate by moving the blue lever down. The blue one is next
to the 2 red ones to the right of the blank hole in the cluster.

 The fan switch you are turning sounds like you have an air conditioning
system installed in the bus..... another giveaway that you have air
conditioning is the 'radiator looking part'!
