It was a while back, but the tires in question weren't aged or worn out.
The first was a French "X" in 235R15 on a lightly-loaded Chevy van, which
belonged to my father who knew not to swap sides.  It stripped
its tread and beat the living daylights out of the body and wheelwell
before i could get stopped.  The second was (IIRC) a nearly new Canadian
XZX in 215R14.  I had installed it new only six months before on a
utility trailer.  It peeled the tread off in only a few revolutions, but
this still did bad things to the fenders.  the trailer was left on the
fully-inflated carcass.  This tire had, at most, 2000 miles on it and had
never been loaded to even 50% of its capacity.

I've run all sorts of tires, from top-of-the-line Contis and Michelin to
cheapo Nankangs and East German Pneumants.  The only tires that have
experienced a vehicle-damaging failure were the Michelins.  They may say
that they have corrected the problem, but Michelin has already "fooled me
twice" so I avoid them.
