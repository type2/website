You can't go too far wrong with Bosch, Hella, Marchal, or other quality
European lights.  Beware the cheap 3rd world lights.  They may be good,
bad or indifferent.

Many motorcycles used 7" H4 headlights, even here in the US.  Check
motorcycle dismantlers for the lights.  Don't get BMW lights, as they are
200mm

As for bulbs, stick with the stock 55/55 H4 units.  If you decide to run
"hot" bulbs you will have to upgrade the plugs and wiring as the bulbs get
hotter.  Don't get fancy with the "blue" bulbs unless you want the
attention of John Law.

Do check the voltage at the bulbs and correct any deficiencies.
