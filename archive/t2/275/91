How long ago?
How old were the tires?
Old Michelins did this when you reversed direction of the tire.
The belts 'set' in one direction, then let loose when you swapped them side to
side. This is the reason you always rotated them front to back, never in the X
like you did with bias ply tires.
Supposedly Michelin has corrected this problem.
I have had Michelin XZX reinforced tires shed the tread. But I have never seen
the replacement MX do it.
