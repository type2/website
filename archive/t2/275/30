Subject: pop top canvas a little small

Thanks, Mike -

Mike Keenan, on his pop top page   http://princessann1.home.mindspring.com

"" Once you have the top painted, we're ready to begin installing the new 
canvas. Ours was a Sunbrella brand, but I've
heard that all replacement canvases for our busses run a little small and do 
not necessarily go on properly via the
instructions included. ""

OK, since all the vendors seem to get their canvas pop tops from the same 
manufacturer, wouldn't it be nice if SOME ONE TOLD this single source that 
they are cutting their canvas pop tops  SMALL ? ? ?

Man, like when it was reported that in China, a woman has a child on an 
average of once every 4.3 seconds.

I mean, like, couldn't SOMEONE find her and stop her ? ! ? ! ? !
