Subject: Doghouse Oil Coolers

I'm a bit confused about how all the 71 oil cooler and all the associated
cooling tin for the doghouse oil cooler fits together.  It's my understanding
that the oil cooler mounts horizontal to the ground (unlike the earlier cooler
that was upright).  Looking at RMMW (as an example), how do parts 113 119 431
and 113 119 419 fit with the fan shroud?  I'm just trying to get an oil cooler
into my DP engine.  Is it easier to just use the earlier upright style oil
cooler?  If someone knows of a good link with pictures or has been through
this I'd appreciate your advice.  Right now I have a remote oil cooler that
I'd like to get rid of and get back to a more stock installation.
Thanks,
Hal Landvoigt
