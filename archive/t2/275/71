Subject: Re: [VB] Full-length rack for sale

What's really funny about this comment is I was at a campout in my Panel bus
the last weekend in July.  I have that exact same rack by the way(happen to
know anything about it?).  Anyway, this couple was camped next to me, and
the guy looks at my bus and said "nice rack."  His girlfriend of course
turned and said "thank you."
