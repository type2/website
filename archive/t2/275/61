Subject: Re: [T2] pop top canvas a little small

Gee, why didn't I know that!  (Re vanagon top fitting better)-for my 78,
I got what Bus Depot sent and definitely had to staple the top part
directly to the wood rather than fold it over the plastic strip.  The
lower edge I did first and it screwed down fine.  The staples got
covered with a decorative strip (can send pics to interested parties). 
It's still very tight, with the elbow of the poptop really stretching
the canvas where it presses.  I see no reason the manufacturer can't add
vertically about 2", since it is hidden at the top under the strip.
