I'll second this.  I've had the same issue and found the same problem.  
Now
I not only carry a spare fuel pump, but 2 spare actuating rods (figured 
I'd
buy two at once).  Although I avoided it for a year or two, I finally 
broke down
and bought a fuel pressure tester (it's also a vacuum tester, which is 
something
else I needed) from autozone for $20.  It's worth it's weight to be able 
to
simply check "do I have fuel pressure and is it up to spec (3-5psi)".
