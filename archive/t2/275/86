Hello Michael,

Thanks for the reply. That is good advice. I would
have to use a long dip stick huh. It would have to be
right at 35"-36" long! Plus I would probably end up
puncturing the old filler neck at some point any way.
Your method sounds much more feasible.

Thanks again!

Have a great day!
