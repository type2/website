Subject: Front Middle seat

Hi all,
Would anyone have any pictures or details of an original front middle seat (to
make a 9 seater bus) to suit a '77 delux bus. The delux had no bulk head
behind the front seats, where most middle seats attached to.
I occasionally need to carry an extra person.
Thanks,
Richard
