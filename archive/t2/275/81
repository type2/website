Works for me: 80W low beam, 100W high beam. The wiring and relay seem
to hold up well ...

If you have sealed beams, I have no idea ...

If you have European style headlights (you replace the bulb only), you
may already have H4 light (it will say on the glass). If not, there are
lot of suppliers who have H4 bulbs that fit Bilux sockets.
