You need 75-78 exhaust parts. Not 79. 72 to 74 is one style. 75 to 78 is your
style. 79 Fed resembles 72-74 but the ports are square. 79 Cal right side is
79 Fed. 79 Cal left side is one yesr only.

74 with manual trans came with dual carbs. Only 74 Calif with auto trans came
with FI.

No, those ports are NOT EGR. They are air injection ports. If you had the
original manifolds, then you would have EGR diaphragms in each manifold.

EGR = exhaust gas recirculation. Inert exhaust gas comes from the exhaust and
enters the intake stream after the throttle plate.
The purpose is to lower combustion temps to stop the formation of oxides of
nitrogen [NOx].

Air injection = fresh air in pumped [or pulsed] in the exhaust system just
past the exhaust valves. The purpose is to complete the burn of the exhaust to
lower carbon monoxide.
