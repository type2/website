The ONLY mixture adjustment you have is at idle.
EGR ONLY works at part throttle......
The injectors inject the same amount of fuel, whether EGR is working or not,
the ECU has no feedback to know if EGR is open or closed.

No it won't. See A above.

The mixture would not change off idle. But you will run the risk of failing
the test if they test for NOx [oxides of nitrogen].
EGR lowers the combustion temps.

Again, unless you change the operating pressure of the fuel or change the ohm
value of the cylinder head temp sensor, there is NO mixture adjustment you
could do off-idle.

It would be more interesting if you understood how L-Jetronic and emission
controls worked......
