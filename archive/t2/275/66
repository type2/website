Subject: Stored Engine Starup Question

So I'm getting ready to install the engine into the 69 westy I've been
restoring. The engine is out of another bus that was crunched up front. As
of six years ago it ran great. So, should I do anything special before
starting it up? I was thinking about pulling the heads off and squirting
some oil around the pistons and rings and whatnot... My partner on the job
just wants to spray some WD-40 in the spark plug holes and fire it up. What
do you all suggest?
