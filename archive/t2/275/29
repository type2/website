This sounds just like a situation I had with my bug a few years back.  After
lots of replacing fuel filters--in the fuel tank, and the in-line one, I 
finally
discovered that the fuel pump rod was worn very short.  For some
reason, it would drive fine, until it got hot, then act as if it ran out of 
gas.
After an hour or so of cooling down, it would run fine again.

With the pump removed, and the engine turned so that the rod protrudes
from the Bakelite block as far as it will--it should stick out 1/2".

I would also replace the points and condenser with new Bosch, and check
the threads of the hole that holds the screw, that sets the points, for 
stripping.
Checking/replacing the "finger sleeve" filter in the fuel tank and any in-line
filters would also be a good idea.
