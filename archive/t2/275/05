Subject: I need new carb!

Hi gang,

What/which are the best (quality/price) carbs out there for my 1700cc
73'.

My newly rebuilt twin Solex are pissing me off!!!! the damn choke and
cam are not working properly.

I know you all don't like the weber single progressive but
why?????????????

If not, which dual should i buy???

Which carbs are you guys using!

Thanks, Ben
