Paul,

Let's go over this again....wife driving, bus dies.

You come and find points are bad(closed up).
You reset points. 

Bus fires right up.
Short test drive...still ok.

Get ready to leave and drive ?? miles and bus dies.

Why??? were the points closed up?  

My guess is that the fuel pump is ok and the points are bad.
Forget fuel pump until you look at the points again.

or...if you dump a little gas down the carb, will it try to start?

Stick with what you *know* was bad to start with...sounds like you
needed new points anyway...

Cheers, dave
