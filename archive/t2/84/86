Subject: Re: spare tire mount

Tom,

I haven't kept up with this subject so if I am repeating someone I am
sorry.  I recently removed the spare tire mount from my 74.  The
bottom two bolts I could reach from the inside.  I couldn't see them
but I could feel them and get a wrench on them.  The top two bolts
were "J" hooks that had threads and nuts on them.  After I removed the
all the nuts and removed the mount I wiggled the "J" hook bolts until
each came out.  I believe the "J" hook bolt is designed to spin and
catch on something or stop spinning as you tighten the bolt.  If the
whole bolt is spinning with the nut as you try and take it off then
cutting might be the only way.  I'm sure you've sprayed it already
with rust remover stuff?
