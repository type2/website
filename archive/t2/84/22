Subject: Re: DOT 5

On the DOT 5 subject, 

About a year back we had a 911 race car in for brake work. 
We bled the system, yet didn't flush it completely, as all 
we wanted was just to bleed it. It had DOT 5 in the system, 
though nowhere on the vehicle it stated that it had that 
in it. No one gave it a second thought either. The guy took 
it onto Zandvoort, a racetrack in Holland, and the mix of 
DOT 5 and 4 resulted in NO PEDAL PRESSURE AT ALL. He spun 
out of the first curve on the track. Needless to say, the guy 
was quite pissed off at us. Yet, when do you come accross a car 
that actually has DOT 5 in it? It was a human error, from the 
guy putting it in there and not stating it on the fluid reservoir, 
and from us not thinking about it seeing an all out race car. 
Porsche uses DOT 4 in its new cars, from Boxster to GT2. 

On a side note, I moved to Lancaster County, Pennsylvania :) 
I took my '74 Single Cab with me and would love to get in touch 
with fellow VW and/or Porsche enthusiasts (or nuts, if that's 
what you prefer :) in the area.
