Subject: RE: [VB] broken head stud on new rebuild

Ronnie- I'm still learning about head bolt size and such. Are you suggesting 
that 8mm bolts should not be used? Does that mean case savers should not be 
used? Reason I ask is because I'm planning this spring to drop my engine and 
replace my 10mm bolts that are pulling out with 8mm/case savers (if I got 
that right, maybe I'm confused). Would you suggest something else?
