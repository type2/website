Check with any local cemetery headstone companies - the ones that do the 
writing on headstones.

Our local one will do sandblasting for me cheap. I wouldn't let them 
ona  car body though. I've never seen the blaster so they may be using 
enough pressure to warp up a body pretty good. There is also a local mobile 
sandblaster service (we have alot of farms in the area) but I don't know 
what their prices are.
