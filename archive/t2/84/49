That's one SMART idea... would be cool if you could have an electric one
of some sort so you wouldn't have to crawl under the car to turn it
on/off..

But I think eventually I'm just going to do something with the EFI
system wired to a kill switch.. that's probably just as good and much
easier to do :)
