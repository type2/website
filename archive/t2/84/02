Take a  3-4" section of 1 1/2 -2 " plastic pipe..   cut a slit on one side
and clip it on over the tarp holding it to the rain gutter...  ( 3 or 4 of
these would hold it on snuggly)

Dear List,
I am planning to make an awning out of a tarp to attach to my 73 Westy with
Poptop (original idea from the Type2 library).
The original plans were for a Vanagon, which I am unfamiliar with.
Any ideas/suggestions on how this type of home-made awning would best be
attached to the bus, for a good seal?

Thanks,

Tom Adams
