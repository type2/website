Sounds like it's time to take a look under there yourself
and get familiar with your suspension. Put the bus on stands
and leave the jack under as well. Place hands on the wheel
at 3 and 9 o'clock and wiggle hard, this will expose play in the
tie rods. Same at 6 and 12 will verify wheel bearings. Look for
torn boots on tie rods and ball joints. Find the zerk fittings and
grease them. This is a regular maintenance item, needs to be
done frequently in wet weather, at least w/ oil change schedule
( remember ?, "oil, filter,lube" ). Maybe it hasn't been done.
Look at the center steering pivot ( zerk ) , and examine the front
beam with an ice pick for rust. The pivot is susceptible to breaking
from rust-thru and causing total steering failure. It could be a source
for the noise.
Tie rod ends can be replaced easily. Once removed, measure the
exposed threads and total length, and match the new ones on install.
The bus will require a toe-in alignment adjustment, if you are not
not accurate the bus will have poor handling and rapid tire wear.
I would recommend taking the bus for an exam at an alignment
shop, they will do the diagnosis and tell you what is wrong.
