that have purchased and installed bilge blowers, would you please send me a
source for them so I can order one?

You can purchase these at any marine supply store.  They are used to blow gas fumes out of
inboard motors before startup.  They come in 3 & 4 inch (I think) and should only be about
>$20 US.
