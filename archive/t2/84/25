I had 4 bugs (a long time ago) before I got my bus, and that 'air pressure
to the washer tank from the spare tire' didn't work in any of them.  I still
like the one in my friend's MG: a soft plastic squeeze bladder under the
dash.  You reach down and squeeze and the increased pressure forces the
solution out onto the windscreen, er... shield.  Has a real bus kind of feel
to it.  When I get around to it, that'll be the way to go.  All I'll need is
a sports drink style bottle and a little check valve, stealable from any
bicycle air pump.

Or maybe I'll use the foot pad pump I salvaged from a hospital scrub room.
It's the same pneumatics only system, only you step on a 4" dia bladder and
it forces liquid soap out of a wall tank.  No worse than the starter buttons
that used to be on the floor of American cars, right?
