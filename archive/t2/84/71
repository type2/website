Hey Bruce,
Thanks for the archive link - that helps.
Good idea about using the rear window defroster - mine
never works either - I also like Scott's idea of
getting a two or three speed windshield wiper switch.
I could mount one (a VW switch from a donor) and be
able to select speed!
What about Scott's comments on noise? Is your set up
loud? Any ideas about mounting the blower back under
the center of the bus to reduce noise? This might also
push more air to the rear vent when desired... My
defrost is o.k. - I am just trying to get more volume
of heat. I just don't think the little fan in the
engine bay is sufficient.
