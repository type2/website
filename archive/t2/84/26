     They will interchange, although the Type 4 engine is a lot heavier.  If 
you plan on doing a lot of Type 4 engines, you may want to reinforce it.  I 
have two engine stands.  I converted a V-8 roll around stand to Type 1 VW, 
using a part of a VW bench stand (the part that holds the engine), I also 
welded a gland nut and pipe to it for building cranks.  I liked  being roll 
it so I can push it out of the shop on sunny days.  
     My Type 4 stand, I used the bench hold down part of the Type 1 stand and 
build my own engine holder.  I don't remember the proper pipe size, I was 
just glad it was a fair amount heavier than the type 1 stuff.
     I think all together I have maybe $50 into both stands. (I not cheap, 
just thrifty!
                                                                             
Peace,
