The difference in these fans, and the bilge blowers is
significant----these fans are not of bilge blower construction----these
are cooling fans, used in the cooling of race car oil coolers---more
stout construction---

Bilge blower's are cheaper--but they also are.

I say:
Yes, I bought the kit.  The blowers Barney sells in my opinion are CHEAPER.
The one in mine lasted about a year before I had to replace it.  It also
does not move near the same amount of air.  The Atwood bilge blowers work so
much better.

The switch Barney sells didn't even make a winter before I had to replace
it.

Go with the do it yourself and get a better product for less.  My .02
