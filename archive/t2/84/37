Subject: Help! Bus is dead


Hello list. I posted a message a while ago. I was having an electrical 
problem, an intermittent shorting out. Well, now it's completely out. When I 
turn the key there’s nothing. A lot like a dead battery but the battery has 
juice. Here is what happened. Just started up the bus and backed up, getting 
my rear wheel stuck in a small ditch, enough stuck so that I had to give it 
a good amount of throttle to get out. So upon giving it gas the first time 
the engine stalled. I thought it stalled because I didn't give it enough 
gas. So I started the bus up again, revved the engine a little higher and 
again it dies only this time when I go to restart it there is no electrical 
juice. Absolutely nothing. I go to the back, look into the engine 
compartment and it smells as thou I've fried something. It was dark and hard 
to pinpoint anything. I felt the ground wire from the battery and it felt 
unusually warm. Does anyone have any Ideas as to what the problem might be? 
The vehicle is a 75 and it's fuel injected. I replaced the main computer 
about a year ago. Any help would be most appreciated.

Thanks,
Darin
