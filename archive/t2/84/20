Subject: new VW club in North Carolina

A new VW club is being formed in the Triangle RTP area. Please stop by at
one of our regular club meetings every 3rd Thursday of the month (next one on
Jan. 17th. at 6:30pm) at Transporter Werkes in Raleigh, NC.
Additional information is available via email from fraserworksinc(-at-)hotmail.com.

This month's Tech Session will include a general discussion about compression
ratios and how it relates to general engine function. There also will be a
demonstration which will include cc'ing a cylinder head.

See y'all there....
