Subject: Live Radio Broadcast from Bus Depot this Friday!

Philadelphia rock radio station WMMR (93.3 FM) will be broadcasting LIVE
from the Bus Depot this Friday (the 18th) from 1 to 2 pm!

The station contacted me and asked if they could do it. Turns out that just
before Christmas, the station held a big 20th-anniversary party for on-air
personality Pierre Robert. Big shindig- ex mayor Ed Rendell was there, lots
of bands, etc. etc.  He had driven a '72 Westy cross-country years earlier,
and as part of the festivities the station manager gave him an identical bus
as a gift.  They now want him to come to the shop with his bus and talk on
the air about busses during their Friday "workforce block."  Apparantly they
will play 6-7 songs during the hour and the rest of the time will be talk.

Of course everyone at the shop is excited to have their "15 minutes of
fame."  We'll be closing the phones from 1 to 2, so don't bother calling.
But if you happen to be a local customer, and would like to meet Pierre
Robert, it might be a good time to come pick up your order. :-)
