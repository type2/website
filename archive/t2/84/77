When is the little fan insufficient? You do realize that it only moves air at
idle? As soon as your engine goes above idle speed, the cooling fan on the back
of the engine puts out more volume then the little fan. The air from the engine
fan shuts off the air flow from the little blower fan. There are 2 flaps in the
little fan housing.
If you have insufficient volume driving down the road, look in the ducts for
blockage.
