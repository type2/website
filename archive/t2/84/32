Subject: Re: Bilge Blowers

A couple questions for those that have installed a
bilge pump in-line with the bus “heating” system…
Where did you mount the thing? Did it replace the
existing blower motor or supplement it?? What size
blower did you go with (3”- 4”??) A link to where you
found it would be cool.
Thanks for the info…


P.S.
The unit I asked the list about previously from
Bluebird comes out to be about $150 after shipping
blah, blah, blah – so I am definitely looking for a
cheaper alternative. Bluebird has some really cool
stuff for the type2 but the darn shipping kills it!

that have purchased and installed bilge blowers, would
you please send 
me a
source for them so I can order one?

You can purchase these at any marine supply store. 
They are used to 
blow gas fumes out of
inboard motors before startup.  They come in 3 & 4
inch (I think) and 
should only be about
>$20 US.
