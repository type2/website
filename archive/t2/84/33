at altitude, the density of the air has changed. A given volume of air
flowing
through the meter has less mass than at sea level.

This air has a velocity, and when it impinges on the valve, it will
create 
some force proportional to the mass and velocity.
 
If the mass goes down for a given volume of air, the force goes down on
the
AFM flapper.

Shifting the wiper arm only shifts the fuel map. You will end up with
perhaps
the correct mixture at *one* point, but you will still be feeding the
computer
incorrect data about the mass of air flowing into the engine.
 
The air bleed screw has a similar effect as shifting the wiper position.
Its
just way to offset how much air can go unmetered by the computer.
 
 
If you think your flap is freely resonating, ask yourself what stops it
from fluttering at any given spring tension. There is no device to damp
the movements, other than the airflow itself. It's highly unlikely that
adjusting the spring tension will cause any issues with resonance.
 
 
Now, what you may have is a lean fuel map. After adjusting the spring
tension, you may
find it helpful to adjust the wiper position to shift the entire fuel
map a little richer
or leaner. 
 
If you simplify the system to look linear, the relation between position
of the flow meter
and the fuel sent to the engine could be the "classic" y= mx + b
 
Y= amount of fuel sent to the engine
M= volume of air going to the engine
X= spring tension
B= offset caused by either wiper position or air bleed.

 
hopefully this isn't too muddled...
