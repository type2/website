Although I agree with the second statement, there is in fact a device
built into most every L-jet AFM to keep it from resonating, the second
flapper vane and dead air space "cushion" behind it.  Something the
original poster might look into that is pretty far from FI but bears to this
is in the car stumbling or oscillations can actually be mechanical in
nature.  Poor motor mounts.  The engine shaking as clutch is released
even at speed can set up a vicious cycle that feeds on itself as can
odd road surfaces, even acceleration.  Anyway happened in my '81 until
I realized what was going on.

 A nice way of looking at it, though the simplification to linearity of course
is just for illustration.  I ran across an interesting L-jet tuning site a
while
back I'd never seen before, sort of bears to these discussions, anyone
interested might take a look.  I was interested in performance gains for
larger engines but that is a no go, stock injectors barely flow enough
fuel at the set pressure to feed the stock engine, and the AFM is very
small and terribly restrictive.  A digifant system off a 2.1 waterboxer will
run a 2.2 type4 pretty admirably though, but warm up is a bit stumbly
Anyway the site is.

The guy originally responsible for this was a EE and apparently took a
custom L-jet basically to the limits and found those to be pretty restrictive.
I've previously mentioned that everyone with a running L-jet system basically
has a built in flow bench to tune their system, namely the car it's on.  Some
people scared of electrons scoff at this but an O2 sensor or ideally a real
CO meter and an already running engine will allow you to tweak the AFM
back to at least stock specs.  Don't ever expect much more from it though.

Some thoughts anyway.
