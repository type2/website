I thought the main reason was to help gas flow, you want to help heat out of 
the engine rather than have it overheat the pistons.>    o... is he saying

Here in the UK  one of the latest go faster product is a fibre glass rap to 
go around exhaust pipes to help keep the air coming into the engine cooler 
(cooler air is more dense so gives more power)
