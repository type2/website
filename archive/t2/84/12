Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for the air hose to make my wiper washer work

Here is page 61 from the 78 Owner Manual. You put air in at the gas station. On
my 77, the sticker says "Max air pressure = 3.0 bar [43 psi]"

OK for those that think I am nuts.
I have a 1970 single cab...............there is the windshield fluid reservoir
down on the passenger side front.  Looks same as a bug.  In a single cab, the
spare goes in the cab under the front seats............
How do transporters get air pressure for the window washer?   If not from the
spare tire, where?
