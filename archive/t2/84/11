If you have a pushrod tube that is a chronic leaker
even with
new seals then I would take it out and clean and
polish the mating surfaces real well. Any crud will
become a weak point where the oil will work it's
through.
I use 3M type scrubbing pads. Regular old 409 works
well to clean the area and "goof off" will cut almost
any sticky stuff that is left.

Worth a try and cheap!
