I paid 16.95 for each of my 3 inch blowers right off the shelf at the local 
small town fishing boat store.

SAME blower as Barney's. His ain't worth $77. Save your money - build your 
own kit. I'd describe Barney's kit as price gouging.

Remember it is better to blow air through the system than sucking - less 
chance of sucking exhaust fumes into the system through leaky pipe joint.
