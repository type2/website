A couple of weeks ago, I brought up why not rig up an auxiliary oil
cooler in the rear of the Bus, with a fan mounted behind it for some
extra heat---I read this posting, go to the site--and lo-and behold,
this outfit has the exact same thing, as a kit, to mount in the back of
the Bus----

I am truly amazed !!!:>)

Check it out----
