Hi Kahndeed,

Same thing happened to my 1800cc 73 engine this past summer, except I pulled
over very soon after the light came on. I have no heat gauges, so I have no
idea how hot it was. In my case you could hear the fan squealing as it
rubbed against the timing mark metal, which was completely destroyed.

Also different in my case was that the bot had broken off, and we had to
drop the engine and drill out the remains. Major PITA.

I reassembled with lots of red loctite on the bolt and between the crank and
the flange to ensure this wouldn't happen again.

The new owner of that engine doesn't expect to get much use out of the
crank.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
