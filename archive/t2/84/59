Subject: Loose fan hub 80 Vanagon

Hi,
I was driving along and the alternator light went on and the voltage gage
showed 10 volts. I thought it would be OK as I didn't need lights or anything.
Then smoke started coming in the van. I stopped and smoke was even blowing 
out the air intake vents. I looked at the engine and it didn't seem hot, 
plenty of oil, then the smoke went away and I thought I could make it. (Must 
be oil on the exhaust, I thought) A mile further I saw the cylinder temp gage 
pegged  600 degrees and oil tempeture 350 degrees.

After a 95 dollar tow job, I tried to find out what it was, the engine ran 
well
but the fan wasn't turning. The center bolt had gotten loose and the hub key 
was
sheared. The hub had to be replaced but the crank was OK.

I am soooo lucky I didn't burn the engine up. How did those heads survive 600
degrees and not lose the valve seats?

Moral to the story, if the alternator light goes on, stop and check it out.
