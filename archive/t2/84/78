in my '78 I had a wired turn signal thing going on where my signals would
sparaticly turn on for no reason then if I would turn them on, left or
right, I would get nothing then sometimes it would work fine for a week or
so.....
replaced the relay and found out the old relay was full of water, go
figure......
now she's runin like a spotted ape (real good)
