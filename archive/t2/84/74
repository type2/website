The difference in these fans, and the bilge blowers is
significant----these fans are not of bilge blower construction----these
are cooling fans, used in the cooling of race car oil coolers---more
stout construction---

Bilge blower's are cheaper--but they also are.

They want $77. If you buy the parts yourself you can get out of it for
under $30. Your decision.
