Subject: Fuel Lines

Here's a few questions I came up with while not working on the Bus in the
dark.

On the bottom of the gas tank, there are two elbows.  I know one is for the
feed to the fuel pump and one is a return line.  Oh 76 Bus 2 liter FI
converted to 2bbl.  Does it matter which hose goes on which elbow?

Somebody said, and I apologize for forgetting who, that there are three
different size fuel lines running around under there.  I have 6 feet of 5/16
fuel line.  What will happen if I use this one size on everything?  Where
can I find out what the other two sizes are?

Since the return line is capped on the bottom of the gas tank, I thought I
might install a tap for easy draining of the tank if I ever wanted to, like
when I'm replacing all my fuel lines.  Anyone else do this?

Much thanks for the help on my previous fuel-questions, and for these, too.
