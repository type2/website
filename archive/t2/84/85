Subject: Re: [T2] Engine-neering - combustion chamber question

Chris,

Someone intthe hotrod biz out there sells some stuff made specifically for
that sort of thing...one of the guys on the vintagvw list had used it
several years ago and was pleased....spray and bake.

Unfortunately, I seem to have lost the e-mail and pictures describing the
process.


Good for heads and piton tops.   Supposedly what the top fuel funny car
folks use.....in other words, "not cheap"


Cheers ,dave
