Subject: Re: [T2] CAT vs EGR (or both?)

Chris asked:


 Is there anyone out there passing CA smog without the EGR stuff in place?

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure, just ask the licensed inspectors who had to pay a $1000-$1000 and/or jail term fine for falsifying a
smog check inspection!

Calif air resources board send out ringers to trick inspectors to do illegal smog checks.
You, as a licensed inspector, get charged for missing things and doing 'clean piping'.
That is when you know the car you are testing will fail so you test a car that will pass but enter the info of
the other car.

In other words, no. Unless the inspector is totally blind.
