Subject: Fuel Line Routing and type

Hello,

I know this has been covered extensively in the archives and in the library
but I did not find an answer yet to my question.  I am R/Ring  the fuel line
and found it to be literally falling apart in my hands.  Just some questions
on routing and type of line.

On my bus, there is a rubber hose from the tank to a copper line to another
rubber hose to a fuel filter to another rubber hose to the pump and finally
to the carb.  Is this correct arrangement?  Is the copper line used due to
heat from the cylinder heads?  Can rubber fuel hose be used end to end?  Is
the copper line secured by anything after it comes through the firewall?  I
see where the rubber hose is clipped above the transmission.  Can anyone
point me to some photos showing what it should look like?

Thanks,

Scott
