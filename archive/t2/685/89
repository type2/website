A new head costs $200. If he doesn't mark it up he's charging $1700 to R&R the head which involves dropping the engine. If his labor rate was $85/hr. thats 20 hours of labor which is think is about twice too long.

Of course. Do you have a metric toolset (probably if you have a Japanese motorcycle). How about a floor jack and a flat parking space to work on the engine?

If you have a GEX and have gone 15k miles you might as well leave it in until you truly need a new engine.
