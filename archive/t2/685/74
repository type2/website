Subject: Re: [T2] Is a oil cooler a good idea ?

Oil coolers are not necessary if the engine is in good condition. You are looking at the ads I too fell for when I was a newbie thinking more catalog parts are better. Not so. 

Stock in 'A' condition will do dandy. I drove my VWs in 100 degree heat many times overseas. Slow down = cooler engine without the added complexity and cost of an oil cooler. 

You need to make sure the WHOLE stock cooling system is present and functional. That means all the rubber, the flappers, and all is clean. Change the oil religiously and use the right filter (brand).
