Althought I doubt most smog shops know what to look for if they detect tampering you will fail the test.

Do you have a CA model that requires the CAT?

The smog tech can't read m-codes but the emission sticker shows there is EGR and your BAR label should mention it also unless this is your first CA smog.

I can't detect a large change in %CO with the EGR on/off the bus. If I could measure NOx I might notice the impact.

Right now the air temperature is so cold I don't think excessive combustion temperatures are a problem if you smog your bus in Dec/Jan.
