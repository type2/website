Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarket A/C for Type 2 Camper

I was wondering if the A/C compresor is change by a newest more efficient 
model, keeping the whole system update and isolating the front part of the 
bus using some kind of plastic sheet just behind the front seats bulkhead 
reducing the total volumen to be cooled (I mostly ride my bus alone) could 
help to improve the system.
