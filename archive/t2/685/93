Thank you all! With this info, I'll head over to the garage to talk
with the mechanic about the current state of the engine. I'm prepared
to do the work myself (providing that the bus fits into my
miniature-sized garage!) so now have to decide, with your info and
that of the mechanic, which route to take - replace engine, replace
heads, or machine the heads (are these my 3 options?)

Keep the advice coming, too, please! I really appreciate everyone's
quick and informative responses - it's nice to have sensible
information on an otherwise disappointing day!

Cheers,
Mike.
