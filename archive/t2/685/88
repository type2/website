For the archive:

Tony in New Jersey is using 14" (fourteen inch) Mercedes Benz (MB)
wheels of mid/early 80s vintage. Tony enlarged the lug bolt holes and 
made an accomodation for the rear drum 10mm nuts. There are more details
in the archives, but I neglected to bookmark my search and cannot
replicate it at present.

Several people chimed in with the pros and cons of light truck,
reinforced sidewall, properly load rated tires and passenger car tires.

Ron, from Bus Depot, stated the same requirements for load and
reinforcemnt should apply to a 15" (fifteen inch) wheel. Ron also
recommended purchasing tires locally, should I decide to go with the
larger wheels, in order to insure proper fit and clearance. Ron also
pointed me to an online tire calculator for which I found the following
browser plug-in challenged alternative
(http://www.mindspring.com/~toy4two/tire.html).

Lucas at GoWesty has published a differing opinion on the subject
(http://www.gowesty.com/wheelstiresinfo.html). An
inquiry to support(-at-)gowesty.com yielded, "Our 15x7" alloy tire and wheel
package fits perfectly onto you 78 bus." Given my reading here, in the
archive, at thesamba.com's bay window forum, and in the other references
I received, caused me pause with regards to whether the wider, overall
taller wheel/tire combo would have adequate clearance.

The list seemed to agree a shorter sidewall means a less comfortable,
stiffer ride.

Tim Harper sent a link to Ronal Wheels
(http://www.ronalusa.com/cars/vw_vanagon_71to79.html).

Chris sent a reference to Baja Bus Technical which covered a decent
range of what would fit at a given lift
(http://www.baja.com/kombi/bustech.htm#wheels).

Neale Green mentioned some Audi A4 15x6 wheels will fit if the hub
opening is widened slightly (http://neale.org/images/a4rims.jpg).

My exploration did not yield a significant number of 15" light truck
tires which met both my preferences and VW's recommendations. As I
initially mentioned, I'm tire stupid, and may be totally off base with
15", reinforced sidewall, load rated C or better tire counts. 

My thanks again for all of the help on and off list with regards to
wheel and tire combinations.

For what it is worth, I'm picking up a set of 14" used vanagon alloy
wheels from GoWesty. I'm also placing an order for the 185R14 Hankook 
RA08 tires from Bus Depot once I have confirmation the 14" wheels are 
en route. It is the wimpy, safe, compromise solution which gives a
modest look upgrade (to my eyes) without compromising safety, the
speedometer, or my wallet (at least not as much).  When scratch and 
time are more plentiful, and the bus is in need of tires again...  Who am
I kidding?
