You absolutely must have the sender under the plug or the data will be more
or less useless.

We wrote an article on CHT gauge installation:

If you are building a new engine or have the heads removed, cut a slot in
the spark plug counter bore to locate the sender, it makes a world of
difference to how the sender fits, and stays put on the head. No more
mangled senders.
