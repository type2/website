Although the longblock will be new, many of the other parts often need repalcement or repair to maximize the investment. I just replaced a failed engine and the bill was closer to $1800 after all the necessary parts were replaced and that was only because I provided free labor over many weekends (weekends that the bus was out of commission).

If I had a GEX and I was doing the repair work myself I would just replace the one head and save the money for the next engine. No use throwing it away until it dies.

If I had to pay a mechanic, then I would consider replacing the engine but by then the price would ballon to $3500.
