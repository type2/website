Subject: Engine Codes - 70 Type 2

Hello,

I've recently purchased a 1970 Type 2 and am trying to figure out the engine
code.  I looked at the 2 library topics on Engine codes as well as some
information I found in the Bentley service manual.  I was hoping someone
could set me straight!  My engine code is H5099738, so according to the Type
2 library it is a 1493cc engine.  Since Bentley's Service Manual indicates
that 70 Type 2's should have a 1584cc engine, should I assume that a
previous owner pulled the original and put in the smaller one?  Didn't all
or most all 70 Type 2's come standard with a 1584cc engine?  I am wondering
as I am considering replacing the engine with a remanufactured one should I
find the existing truly a basket-case.  Are the mounting points and
connections to the clutch and transmission same for both?

I'm going through the process of trying to startup the engine (after a
number of years of sitting idle) and am buying some basic tune-up parts for
it right now.

Thanks for your help and such a great site and knowledge base!

Scott
