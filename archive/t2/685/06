Subject: Re: [T2] master cylinder leaking

Greg asked:


 hey folks, the master cylinder on my 74 single cab has
developed a nasty leak where the pushrod enters the
mc.  I need to replace this master cylinder but am
confused about the part with which to replace it.
This single cab's original destination was Panama.  It
has front disk brakes but no power brake servo and has
only one brake light switch.  The closest I can come
to on BusDepot's website is a mc for a 70 model, part
number 211611021T.
Does anyone have any idea what is the proper master
cylinder for this application?  thanks, Greg

From Bus Boys website:

211-611-021T IN  Master Cylinder, Brazil Bus/Pickup 1970 USA and Bus/Pickup 71-79 without Power Brake Servo
$40.00

NOTE:  Brazilian unit has provision for only one brake light switch.

This sounds like the one you want. But you need to measure the distance between the nipples on the lower
reservoir [center-to-center]. 68-70 are 100mm. 71-79 with booster are 85mm.
