Subject: Re: [T2] AC in Southern Buses

Okay, I'm talking about high summer temperatures and low humidities in 
the west, but everything I am going to say here applies.

We live in a competitive culture. "Nature red in tooth and claw," a 
19th century philosopher called it. In a competitive culture, you need 
every advantage you can get.

Now the bus content: a Volkswagen bus flies in the face of maintaining 
a competitive edge in our world, south or west. There is no reason to 
compound it. If you are competing with people who have AC in their cars 
(for composure, better odor, unwrinkled clothing, etc.), it's kind of 
foolish not to get that edge if you can.

It's really that simple.  Never mind how it was in the past. In the 
past, when one of us drove a vehicle without AC, there were other 
people driving without AC, too. That's almost never the case anymore.

There's no point whatsoever in becoming known as "that sweaty guy who 
drives the Volkswagen bus."

Rant over.
