Grinding and cleaning was fairly easy. However I put holes in the side of
my bus trying to mig weld the new tray without gas. The replacement trays
for the 74 Westy attatch directly to some pretty thin body metal making it
real easy to scar paint and metal on the exterior of the bus even if you
are welding the interior. After attaching the new tray I sprayed several
coats of rubberized undercoating on both sides of the new tray. Good Luck!
