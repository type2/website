Subject: Re: [T2] another Battery Tray replacement method

FWIW, I chiseled and ground out all the remaining rust (and trays) in my
'71, made a cardboard template of the area and had a local HS welding class
cut two heavy guage (good stuff, probably 16 to 18 ga.) panels to fit.  Then
I worked up a generous snake of that two part auto epoxy that comes in cans
and put that in around the perimeter of the void, sort of like setting a
sink in plumber's putty.  A little smoothing on top and bottom, paint and
that was that.  They're still there, rust free and holding up fine.  You
can't tell at all from the outside.

I still have the cardboard template (I think), and if anyone wants a paper
copy I can trace it and postal mail it to you.  I had to file the metal a
little here and there, but it's a good fit.
