Most expensive VW valve job I have ever heard of. But they must be doing 
everything. I had a pair of heads that I took to a local machine shop about 
5 months ago. Valves ground and replace 5 guides, cost $150, I thought it 
was a little steap.


GEX is something I have as well. Mixed opinion on this one because I still 
have not put her on the road.  For $1900, I would look for a rebuilt 
longblock and swap them yourself.
