Subject: Aftermarket A/C for Type 2 Camper

Greetings all,

Recent member, first time posting.

A quick intro - My wife has ALWAYS wanted a VW camper, and we have 
looked for the past two years to find "it." She's been a member of the 
Full Moon Bus Club for quite some time, and that's where she got the 
lead on our newest member of "la famiglia."

We're down in Charleston, SC, and have recently purchased a 1969 
hard-top camper in NC. We're picking the bus up next week, and since 
we're in the dead of winter, the fact that it doesn't have an A/C unit 
is not yet an issue.

However, come April, A/C will be a must-have item, even for short 
trips. I detest the hot summers down here (I'm more of a West Coast 
guy), and A/C is something we're very serious about acquiring.

Anyone have suggestions about this?

Since I am new to VWs (I did restore a 1957 Nash Metropolitan in high 
school, though) I haven't a clue where to start.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
Anton
