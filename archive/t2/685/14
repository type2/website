The engines can be assembled from a pile of parts and show all sorts of conflicting sizes and numbers. Generally a 1200cc block can be a 1300cc or 1200cc. A 1600cc block could be a 1500 or 1600. A Type IV engine (1700cc) could be 1700cc, 1800cc, or 2000cc. There is even more interchangeability than that if you want to pay a machine shop for the boring and clearancing but the above examples can be done with slip in parts. 

The only way to know for sure is to tear it down and measure everything. 

I'd run it until it is throughly tired and then build the largest stock engine you can and blueprint it to death. 

The large bore aftermarket parts are really great but it's hard to decide what is quality and what are just glossy magazine ads that promise much show and go but for only 30K miles... Raby and Boston Bob and Gene Berg can build you something that last of course if you can afford 'em. There are others too...
