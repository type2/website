T'is so, seriously in SWFL you take a 15 minute summer drive in a hot sun
baked bus, or any car w/o AC, and your shirt is drenched in sweat! Fine for
the military but not how you want to go into work everyday. Hot humid
breezes do nothing to cool ya down!

I suspect its one of the reasons I see very few buses in SWFL...
