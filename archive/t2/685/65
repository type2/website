Don,

Or use the digital turkey thermometer trick and put the probe thru a very 
small hole in the top of the tin and "wedge" it in next to the plug.

Radio Shack sells an extension that will fit between the sensor and the 
reader so you can put it where you can see it.

Just a thought....

Cheers, dave
