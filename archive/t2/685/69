Subject: Re: Is a oil cooler a good idea ?

I got the Race-Trim Oil Cooler from Bus Boys and its made a huge
difference in my '71. My only worry now is that the oil doesn't get warm
enough. I sent for an oil temperature bypass at the same time but it
didn't get to me until after I had my new engine and cooler installed so I
have yet to install it. I think that piece will allow the oil to get warm
enough so the cabin will be easier to warm up in the winter. My mechanic
welded a pair of brackets under the bus so the cooler lies parallel to
the ground in front of the left rear tire.

 I would like your opinion on the following for an 1983 engine:
 1) How bad is the engine heat when driving in the desert in summer time
 (.i.e Death Valley)
 2) I saw some oil cooler over internet for $250,
    - How reliable are they ?
    - Are they easy to install ?
    - Are they efficient,  meaning , can I go to Death Valley in summer
 time !!! ;-)
    - Any Brand better than others ?
 3) Do you have any other tricks to cool down the engine like adding an
 extra fan  ?

 Thanks for all your answers.

 Chris
