Subject: Permatex RTV curing in cold weather: Advice req'd

Hi Volks,

How long should it take for ultra-black Permatex RTV gasket material 
take to harden at low temperatures?

I used the stuff to seal a leaking sump plate oil temp sender last 
week, and ever since then the weather here has been somewhere between 
zero celcius and zero fahrenheit. I did put a hot air corn popper under 
the engine for about 40 minutes after the repair, but I don't think it 
was doing much good, the case was still cold right above it.

Now I am wondering if it's safe to put oil in the engine yet. Since the 
RTV means "Room Temperature Vulcanizing", I am somewhat concerned, as 
my driveway doesn't need another 3.5L oil soaking. Advice would be 
appreciated.

Happy trails,
