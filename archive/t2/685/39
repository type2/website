Has anyone had direct experience with the Ice cooler type of A/C?

I am intrigued about the idea...having seen this type of unit growing 
up in Europe (Penguino, etc.) and like the notion of it being somewhat 
portable.

It does look a little clunky, but beats paying $1,400 for an installed 
after-market unit.

And SERIOUS thanks for the quick replies.

Best,
Anton
