Roberto,

You could probably get what is called a "mount and drive" kit and rotary 
compressor from these folks.

http://www.iceac.com

You would need to communicate to them, the intended use and also whether 
you will use freon or r134a or something else in your "old" system".

They may be able to sell a "beefier" compressor that would still fit on 
the engine, but handle more capacity as your bus system will require.

If I remember correctly, you are in Venzuela?...might be easier to get a 
original York compressor there.....or a rotary compressor off of a newer 
wrecked car.

Cheers, dave
