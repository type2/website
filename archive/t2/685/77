You get used to the heat. I like the a/c for the highway where the roar of the open windows is so bad. 

These days I am inside 365 days a year and that does make the heat HOT in the afternoons when I go out and get into the car/van/cabrio. It is as if your body has to learn how to sweat again. 

Back in the Navy I was outside ALL the time (Italy '91-'94) and almost never had a/c. Got used to high heat. Not so bad. Still made me sleepy (always has).
