  Hello Guys  I agree with Richard here  fix the head on the GEX and save 
your money for either a good reman. or a good core to rebuild.  The problem I 
have seen with GEX is that the bottom end might not be any good, including the 
case. I have seen mixed pistons , rods, cranks turned too far etc. etc etc,  
mostly pure junk.  Anyway the price they are quoting is way out of line   later
