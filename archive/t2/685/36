Subject: CAT vs EGR (or both?)

Is there anyone out there passing CA smog without the EGR stuff in place?

maybe just a nice tight exhaust system and a brand new CAT would do the
trick, or should I just start working now to find all of these parts?

I need a crossover pipe, CAT, and all of the EGR stuff currently. (thats
whats missing anyway)

the EGR stuff is all blocked off, almost looking like it never came with it,
but from the Mcode I guess it did at some point.

I just wasnt sure if one of those systems would be effective enough in
reducing emitions to warrant skipping the other.

thanks for any leads
