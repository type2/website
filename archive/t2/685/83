Oh, my, Jeffrey. Oh, my.

First, use the archives on this list to learn something about GEX 
engines. If this one had 15,000 miles on it, it was one of their better 
builds.

Second, $1900 for a "valve job" is ridiculous, like paying $32 for a 
cup of coffee. But you are going to want an entire new engine, not just 
a valve job. Your GEX motor is a time bomb.

You can find well-built air cooled engines for as little as $1200. Bus 
Depot, an on-line dealer that many of us use, sells AVP rebuilds for 
about that price (busdepot.com). I just looked and didn't see that they 
have vanagon engines, but I was just skimming.

If you have the space, you can do the engine change yourself, using a 
couple of books and help from this list.

I'm sorry that your VW experience has started out badly. It gets 
better, really.

Mark
