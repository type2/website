T'aint so.  It just makes getting home to that AC a bit more anticipatable.
Y'all need to just open those windows and enjoy the breeze. :O)

(My first summer in the South, whilst in the military, we enjoyed 120 degree

sweated.  AC in my bus would be sweet, but I doubt I'll ever have the $ to
do it.)
