Subject: Buggy for free

I'm still looking for a good home for my buggy, it is in parts but it is
titled non-op so no back taxes due.  You'd need a flat bed trailer and my
help to get it on there but I need to find a new home for it quick before
I'm living under it.  I just have no time to complete it.  FREE!!!!!  in
SoCal.
