Hi Richard,

Another possibility is fuel theft. Perhaps there is someone else out 
there getting a bit of extra bang-for-the-buck in their tank.  It's 
happened to me twice that I know of. It's quite annoying running out of 
fuel a block from home when you know there was half a tank in it when 
it was parked.

Happy trails,
