Probably no need to do that. You're pulling the engine and one head.
Pull them both, check the mating surfaces. MAYBE have the valve seats
lapped. Get a good look at the valves themselves. 

Mine had to get loose enough to start losing compression before I
finally figured it out. I didn't have a constant net connection to ask
about it at the time. A quick clean up and it was good for a lot more
miles.

After you put it back together don't forget to retorque the heads after
500 - 1000 miles.
