On mine sand and dirt had collected under the heater tube on top of
the gas tank. This retained water and caused micro fine rust holes in
the top of the gas tank. They were so small that I didn't see them the
first time I took the tank out. So the first time I just did the hoses
and stuff as you were advised, but my tank still leaked. So the second
time, there was still quite a bit of gas in the tank and I could see
the gas seep through the holes. Also, when you fill up with gas, look
for gas seeping and collecting on the edges of the gas tank.

 If my heat smells like gas are the only possibilities something

I can be relatively sure the problem is in there somewhere.  This is
killing me, please help.  Thank you in advance.
