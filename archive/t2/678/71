Crickets. Did you ever retorque the heads after break in? Sounds like a
loose head. Just like my bug sounded. I'd pull the head as the other post
suggested but check all mating surfaces and all valves. Loose head burns
and scores surfaces you wouldn't expect as exhaust gasses and air are
pushed and pulled around the loose surfaces.
