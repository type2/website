To make a long story short, the conclusion of latest discussions is
not to do it if you can avoid it, but if you must, they tend to care
for your car better and the paint will stick better if they see you
have gone to some TLC to prep your vehicle for paint yourself.

 I won't take it there if someone has a horror story.
