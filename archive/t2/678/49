Subject: What's the going price?

Hey guys.

Got a question for you.  I've been looking around on the internet to find
the going price for a restored Single Cab.  The one in question is a '61
dual treasure chest model.  It's had a ground-up restoration, has a 1600
with dual carbs, a canopy and safari windows.  It has the original
transmission.

What's a realistic price for one like this these days?

Thanks,
Victor
