Jeremy,

What Mark is saying is that the pushrod may have something in it that is 
blocking the delivery of oil to that particular rocker arm....oil is 
pumped up thru the pushrod into the rocker arm and then flows inside the 
rocker arm to lubricate the rocker arm metal to metal surfaces.

If the valve stem is "stretching" , I would expect the adjustment on that
valve to be very "tight" as compared to the intake.

Not sure if "thread showing" is going to be an accurate assesment or not.  
You will need to follow the instructions for valve adjustment and then
back off the adjustment till it gets "loose"....3 turns to get loose? or 
just 1 1/2....how many to get loose on the other valve?  Hard to tell 
about how many turns would be really bad across the net.

Cheers, dave

 What would you consider a "long way off of standard"?
