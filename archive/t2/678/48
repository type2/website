This might be a place to start: 
http://www.dawn-ent.com/molding/chrome.htm.  I saw some other likely 
prospects when googling "body molding chrome adhesive".

I think it's a great idea, even if you just use it until you can score 
some nice-looking original style stuff.  Bear in mind that this opinion 
comes from someone who once put chrome door-edge molding on the eroded 
drip rail of a 62 splitty and though it looked way stylee.
