Subject: Valve questions.........

Hello, longtime lurker, first time poster here.   First off, I  want to say 
that I have learned so much reading all the posts from you  all.  This is 
really a great resource for us bus owners.  
 
Here is my problem.........
 
I have spent the better part of this fall reading and searching for answers  
on web sites and manuals, but still no definitive answers, so I turn to  you.
 
I purchased a 78 hard top Westy that was then converted somewhere along the  
line into a custom camper interior.  I bought it for $500 with a motor that  
was shot back in 1998.  I purchased a new engine through Ron at Bus Depot  and 
AVP.  2.0 hydraulic lifters.  It went in great, and now, 30,000  miles later 
there is a strange sound coming from the valves.
 
 
It started this fall, a high pitch squeak whenever the valve moves.   It is 
the #1 cylinder, and I am pretty sure it is the exhaust valve.  I  thought that 
perhaps the valve needed a little adjustment, because I had only  checked 
them out once since the initial break in of the engine.  The  exhaust valve was a 
little loose, but I didn't hear the clicking that everyone  talks about.  
 

I have taken it for a couple half hour or so drives, at first  thinking that 
the lifters had bled down, and needed to be pumped back up, and  the squeak 
would go away for a little bit, but then come right back as we  drove.  

 
If I disconnect the distributor, so no spark will be produced, and it  
wouldn't start, it gives off  a squeak whenever the valve moves.   Squeak is the 
best word I can use to describe it.  Chirp might be  another.  It is definitely 
more than a click of loose valves that need  adjustment.
 
Any thoughts anyone?
 
Of course any assistance is appreciated and I thank you in advance.
