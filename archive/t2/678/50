Subject: Re: [T2] What's the going price?

Victor asked:


Got a question for you.  I've been looking around on the internet to find
the going price for a restored Single Cab.  The one in question is a '61
dual treasure chest model.  It's had a ground-up restoration, has a 1600
with dual carbs, a canopy and safari windows.  It has the original transmission.

I love how the words 'ground-up RESTORATION' and 'a 1600 with dual carbs' 
always seem to go together!  NOT!
