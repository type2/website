a local snap on dealer lets me buy from him when he stops at a nearby gas
station, have to pay all at once, no time payments, but will sell me
anything he can get, and yes highest quality and service. but also top
dollar too, not being a full time mechanic like you I am very selective in
what I get from him.   Most tools I have are good quality home mechanic
level tools such as Craftsman or my favorite S/K tools.
