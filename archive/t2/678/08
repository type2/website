take to heart the comments about the weather at this time of year, in fact
I would make sure you have what you need to live in that Westy for a
couple days safely if you should become stranded, either by weather or
mechanical or both.  make sure you have warm clothing and food/water and
some at least basic tools.

as someone who did a lot of winter camping the wise words were, "in the
summer you make a mistake you are uncomfortable, in winter make a mistake
and you could be dead.."   Be prepared to live thru the worst weather
possible in your bus for at least a couple of days.   unless you know
EXACTLY what the previous owner did to the bus and his/her level of
competence with the repairs examine the bus VERY carefully before
departing, fix anything you have any questions about and if in doubt put
it on a trailer and haul it home.

not being paranoid or anything just have been there and done that and it
can ruin your whole VW experience not to mention a lot more if you are not
prepared.  those are some long lonely dark roads you are preparing to
travel with an unknown vehicle in unknown condition at one of the most
unpredictable times of the year weather wise.

good luck
Bob
