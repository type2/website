I call Flagstaff home. Spent 3 hours today pulling snow off the tops of 2 
sheds and clearing my driveway and 4 hours doing the same for my neighbor. 
The main roads around here are clear as of this afternoon. If you come 
through when the roads are wet or snowy, make sure you stop in Kingman to 
hose off the underside of your bus. The state crews put salt on the roads. 
Also, don't get close behind anyone, even if the roads are dry. The City 
uses volcanic cinders on the snow for traction. The windshield repair joints 
around here make a killing in the winter.

Make SURE you have what you need to keep your bus running especialy if you 
are going to tour the reservation lands. The locals out there are nice 
people but DON'T expect to get any help or find any air cooled friendly 
shops on the reservations. Although Flagstaff is probably the largest 
Arizona city north of the Verde Valley (north 3rd of state), I don't think 
there is a single shop here that willingly works on air cooled stuff any 
more.

If you want to see some of the most beautifull views in Arizona make sure 
you drive through Flagstaff during the day. We are at about 7000 ft. at the 
base of some volcanic mountains that rise well beond the tree line.

So I am told there is good CX skiing here and some excellent downhill at 
Snowbowl resort on the peaks.
