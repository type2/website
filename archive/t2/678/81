Subject: Fridge specifications

Hi All,

I'm looking for the fridge specifications of a 1977 deluxe campmobile. In fact,
I need to know what's the current (A) and the energy (W) required for the
fridge to work properly. All those informations will be used to design a system
of self automony (solar power) when camping in the middle of but nowhere. Let
you guys know when I have a working prototype.

Thanks in advance

Antonio
