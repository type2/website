Subject: Re: [T2] Bad ges smell won't go away.

chris i also found this to be my problem as well when i started smelling gas and all my lines were fine car,under the bus etc.
also though i had to replace my filler neck hose also. this was the biggest of the two though that was causing my gas smell cause it was dumping gas through the brittle filler neck when the gas sloshed to the right towards the back of the gas cap it would hit and then pour down into that section.
good luck smelling gas isnt a good thing.
we keep smelling gas in my wife 68 beetle also but cant find the problem after changing all new hoses and vent hoses but i havent yet changed her filler neck hose which is probadly the problem on her car as well>? find out soon good luck with that though.
 
open your gas cap up and with a flash light inspect the area right inside the cap see how brittle that rubber part is?
if it has visible cracks this just might be it?
peace and love
chris

Vent tubing... There are some lines behind the firewall that went bad on mine and some in the air intakes that went bad. Check them all.
