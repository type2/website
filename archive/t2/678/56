Hey all,

Owner of a 80' Adventurewagen looking for a reliable place locally to rebuild
my engine. I'm looking for some place that will warranty their work for a year
or 12,000 miles once the odometer is working again. (I've replaced the cable
twice and it always snap) I've got a head out on the 3-4 side and too many
other issues to mention. I just want to get this bus into good hands that I
can trust to go in there and make him new. Any suggestions out there for a
great shop in Denver, CO?
