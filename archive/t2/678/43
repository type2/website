Hi John,

VW considers the series of short trips that you run in your bus as 
"Severe Operating Conditions". It's not the carbs it's just that the 
bus is running rich all the time because it isn't warming up properly. 
As a result, you will need to change your oil on a much more regular 
basis. Collie Corner had a similar problem with his 77 bus, and it has 
FI.

Like Chris Mills said, you should try to take longer trips. It would 
save you money in the long run to find a coffee shop somewhere along 
the route just to help the bus get warmed up before you shut it down.

Happy trails,
