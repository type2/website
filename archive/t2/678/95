Subject: [T2] Re: Valve Questions.............

Hi Mark, when the engine is running and the valve cover is off, there is  oil 
pumping out.  Does it come from that valve particularly?  I am not  sure.  I 
will have to let you know about that.  There is definitely  oil being pumped 
through the head though.

Dave, you asked :  
If the valve stem is failing/stretching, I would expect the adjustment to  
be a long way off of standard...is it?...compared to the intake on the  
same cylinder?

There is a difference in the amount of thread showing  through the tightening 
nut on the exhaust valve vs. the intake valve.  I  can't remember which has 
more showing.  Will have to check when I get  home.  
 
What would you consider a "long way off of standard"?
 
********************
Chris, when you say that it is "probably the pushrod retainer spring", do  
you mean that it is rubbing somewhere on the rocker arm?  I didn't notice  that, 
but will check.  Thanks.
 
 
More when I get home and get under there.
