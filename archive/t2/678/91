Doyt is right about this. $5k is an average, and assuming you pay a 
fair and reasonable price, you can deduct the purchase price from the 
$5k.

The fact that you know the bus is a Champagne edition means (I assume) 
that the seller knows this too. Unless it is in very good condition, 
don't let the "special edition" feature of this bus skew the price too 
much. A Champagne edition bus should only skew the price upwards if it 
is reasonably complete and in good condition. Otherwise, it's just a 
'78 possibly with bad (an expensive to replace) heat exchangers and 
exhaust, and with hydraulic lifters which may or may not have kept the 
valves properly adjusted.
