Spring is prob rubbing the pushrod. 

Also make sure that the rocker is not rubbing the vavle cover. UNLIKELY but look. 

Also you might need to remove the offending pushrod and check it for an obstruction. They carry oil from the lifter to the rocker arm tip as I understand it (should be a hole at least).
