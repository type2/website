Subject: Alabama Freeze out campout!

Alright this is it. Its official! the Alabama Freeze Out will be at Tuskegee
National Forest. This is the same Forest the "Getaway" was at, but we are
getting a better spot. The one that attended the "AL Getaway" will remember
the killer incline entering the camp site. I am going this week in between
classes and work to meet the ranger and find a great spot. We have chosen this
forest because it enables more people to attend. It will also be FREE. The
getaway spot had no water source. We are hoping the spots with water will meet
the rest of the needs. If not tote your own water. We will have a the Famous
Breakfast Burritos on Sunday. There is an awsome bike trail running thoughout
this forest. I will have my bike so if you like mountain biking dont forget
your bike and helmet. I will have deatiled directions for yall very soon
       We will also have the way marked once you get to the forest. Basically
all you have to do is get off I-85 at the exit with the ranger station on it I
beleave its exit 51. And head south. Go about a mile take the first dirt road
on the right and follow the signs/engineer tape/ ballons or whatever we hang
to mark the way. I dont think anyone had a problem last year finding the spot.
Just getting into it was the problem. Anyway better directions coming soon.
