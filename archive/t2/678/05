1-  Advice sought - is this a good or reasonable decision??  
 Its will work out very well

2-  The bearer bar on the '69  is basically worthless.  Do I need the bearer 
bar from a '67 - what else would fit, like bug bearer bars?? 
not sure what you mean about the bearer bar the split buses have no support 
bar , the engine is held by the tranny like it is in a beetle.

3-  The heat exchangers look pretty bad, and the muffler is totally rusted.  
Does anyone in the Washington DC area + 100 miles have a used and good setup 
they would like to let go?? [[ I have an excellent/primo stove top cover 
from a '79 Westy I could trade.]] 
I have single qiuet pack muffler on my 67 westy and it has worked out well


4-  On heat exchangers, is the"Made by JP Group of Denmark." a good or 
indifferent product. 
Very good heat exchangers
