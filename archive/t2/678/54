PS - I am also leaning towards the richness of the idle volume
settings. The right carb was 4 or more turns open. When I put them
both to 2 1/2 turns for initial setting, I still had to turn them both
in another turn to get in spec. So I am thinking with those screws so
wide open that it had to be a factor too. Just in the time I have run
it to do the settings, I have burned off a good deal of the black
residue inside the tail pipe and have begun to see the healthy golden
brown again.
