Subject: '69 engine into a '67 - engine tin

Thanks for the advice, and thanks for the HE offer, Mark Dearing.

Still another question:

Does the '67 use the same engine tin as the '69??  Or can I trash the '69 
engine tin?

If the '67 engine tin is different from/than [any English teachers out 
there??] the '69, would it be the same tin as the Beetles??  Or should I 
have to ask that question on the vintagebus list??

TIA.  I am off to find a $20 Beetle muffler, and it would be nice to know if 
I should be pulling the waist tin off the Beetle, too.....
