Thanks for the thoughts Tom. I just learned recently that gas can pass
through to the crankcase on any kind of engine when a pump diaphram
tears. I don't know enough about the internal construction of the
different pumps to know which ones this can be possible on. The only
time I have ever had non-electric fuel pump fail was way back in high
school on my falcon. Just changed it and got it going again,
blissfully ignorant of any side issues. That vent is a good idea on
those types of cars though. Too close to exhaust on VW's though!

Thanks again,

John

 I have never had this problem but I have read that a bad mechanical fuel
 pump on an upright engine (1300, 40Hp, 1600, etc) can cause gas in the oil.
 I don't know If this can happen on your 73 but I think that's one of the
 things I would look into. I think I remember you saying your engine seemed
 to run fine but got BAD mileage. If a torn diaphram in the fuel pump could
 leak into the crank case on your engine (1700 I think?) this could be the
 mystery leak you are looking for.
 
 I have had bad fuel pumps on f*rds and Ch*vys. Usualy the engine still runs
 ok if the pump can make any pressure at all. the tell tale sigh on American
 engines is a puddle of fuel under the fuel pump. These pumps have a vent on
 the non pressure side of the diaphram to let air in and out of that side of
 the pump. If the diaphram is torn or cracked the fuel is allowed to leak out
 the vent and doesn't usualy get in the crank case.
 
 Maybe some one else on the list knows for sure if this could be the cause on
 your engine?
