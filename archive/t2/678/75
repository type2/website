Crickets. Did you ever retorque the heads after break in? Sounds like  a
loose head. Just like my bug sounded. I'd pull the head as the other  post
suggested but check all mating surfaces and all valves. Loose head  burns
and scores surfaces you wouldn't expect as exhaust gasses and air  are
pushed and pulled around the loose surfaces.

Crickets is a good term for the sound.  

 
No, I did not retorque the heads.  The instructions that came with the  
engine did not include that.  Oh well, what can you do?  Pull the  engine and pull 
the head I guess.
 
Well that gives me a bit of a winter project.  What about replacing  the 
whole head with a good one that I have?  Is there a problem with using  one with 
30K miles and one with 5K?
