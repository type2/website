I felt suspect over the residue build up around the carbs too. Now
that it's all cleaned up it seems to be running dry. But I will keep
an eye on it. I'll be changing oil and filter to eliminate that
possibility too, plus being able to keep an eye on the effects on
fresh oil.

I'm concerned about my left carb though. When running the volume
control adjustments, I noticed the RPM would go up when putting the
synchrometer on it, but would not on the right carb. I am thinking
that is a sign of running lean if it runs faster when the throat is
partially obstructed by the synchrometer.

This is coming up too fast and last minute. I don't want to take a
chance on burning up the left head. So it looks like I am going to
have to spend some more time with this and take the 62 panel to BBB.
