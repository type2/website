Hi Scott,

I can speak for Maaco in general, but I am not familiar with the 
Portland location,

Do as much prep yourself as possible. Maaco does a fine job of spraying 
but they don't like doing prep.

It only takes a couple hours to pull the bumpers, door handles, door 
seals, jalousie Windows, turn signals, etc. If you leave it to them to 
do they will merely tape them off and the areas behind them will go 
unpainted.

I had my westfakia painted at Maaco 4 years ago with the prep done 
myself as above, and the results turned out very good.

Happy trails,
