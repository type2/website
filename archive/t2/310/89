Hello,

I am not saying that what he charged you for the
starter isn't high, bue marking up the price on parts
is common practice with repair shops. Many shops
charge for labor, mark up on the cost of the parts,
then charge more for profit. I have seen many shops
that refuse to work on your car if you furnish the
parts for them. This is partly so because they cant
garuntee the work and they are unable mark up on your
parts. IT is just how they make their money. I have
seen one shop owner who calculated the cost of labor
by multiplying what he paid the mechanic to fix it by
2. Common practice? I don't know but I still try to
support my local vw mechanic. With out him, I would
loose a major source for parts and resources.
Expensive? Yes. Unfair? Can be. Worth it? Your call. 

Any way, have a great day!
