Then uncle Karl told Vdub horror stories around the campfire all night till I got so scared I crushed my bus!

Seriously though, this is going to be a big challenge to the California VW crowd. I see a lot of VW's leaving california by way of samba/ebarf or the crusher. 

Unfortunato, but whaddya gonna do? The Sierra Nevada are 12,000 feet tall, I live at 300ft elevation 12 miles away from them and I can't see them all summer.

I for one am torn.

I'm looking guiltily at my bus, and riding the bike more these days.

Billy
