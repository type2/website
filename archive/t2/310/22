Subject: metagal mirrors?

Hello,

I have in my hands an drivers side mirror for a baywindow bus, black 
plastic, stamped 'metagal' on the back.

On the base, its got the audi/vw logo, and the number 211-857-5131514-12NK

Any idea where this came from? Brazilian made?

Id like to get a matching one for the passenger side if possible, but who 
knows if i'll ever be able to track one down.

It sure is nice having a side view mirror that I can see out of again.
=)
