Note that it wasn't the driver telling the good samaritan to get lost, it
was the cop who undoubtedly felt that her turf was being trod upon by an
unwelcome "civilian."

Also, I think that a survey of british drivers has little applicability to
Americans, particularly VW folks.  I've never had a VW person be less than
delighted when I've stopped to assist them, and I would be delighted to
receive help in my hour of need.
