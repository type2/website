Subject: BBB AZ Propane tanks.

The requirement to have overflow protection valves is a national
requirement, not local. The old tanks without the OPV are now junk and hard
to get rid off.  Even in slower lower Delaware they stopped filling the old
tanks last summer. Good prices( about $25) can be found at Costco on new 20
lb. tanks (standard size for grilles etc.)
