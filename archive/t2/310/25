Subject: Seeking VintageBus parts...

My friend Tom Tarka just purchased a 67, and is driving it from San 
Diego to DC. He is currently in San Fran, and heading this way. He is in 
need of some parts, and frankly having only bays I don't know of a good 
source in the Scaramento Area.

Here is what he is looking for:
Drivers Side Stationary Door Glass
2 Rims

If you know of any source for these parts please let me know ASAP so I 
can try and get them for him before he departs.

Thanks bunches,
-Nick
