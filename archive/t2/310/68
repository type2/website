Cops are pretty strict these days. Last week the local cops got a call from 
a woman near Nashville that saw a car pass her with the wallet on the roof. 
She reported that it might be a kidnapping or a robbery suspect (I've heard 
both versions). The cops proceeded to catch the car here in our little town 
(on the interstate) and did a felony stop on the car. Hands up, back up 
towards my patrol car, handcuffed them and when the curious dog climbed out 
the car to see why it's people were outside on the ground the cop shot it. 
Said the dog was threatening.

Me thinks there is a lawsuit out there on this one. The media reports it as 
a pitbull. The owner reports it was a boxer/bulldog mix and a big baby.

The media fails to mention this same cop has been in trouble for shooting 
dogs before.

Anyhow (better squeeze in some bus content) as a former Navy MP my 
suggestion would be to treat every cop as if he was scared to death and 
trigger happy too. I don't like that, but you'll be safe that way...

He should not have acted that way. Complain. Makes things change.

We vintage Volks are a very misunderstood breed.
