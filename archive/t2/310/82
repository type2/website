Subject: AIRS visit

Tom Tarka came by tonight on the first leg of his x-country journey.
He needed a piece of glass for the driver's door and some extra
14" wheels for snow tires.  Rather than take the door all the way
apart to replace the glass, we fashioned a replacement out of
plexiglass.  Only we didn't have a piece big enough, so we used one
big piece and one small piece, and used an original to trace from.
It took some prying and whatnot, but we got it installed, and then
I epoxied the 2 pieces together.  I also gave him another extra 14"
wheel with a good tire for an extra spare.  

He heads out again tomorrow - wish him luck!

That's my 2nd AIRS visit this month, and the 3rd within a month's time!
