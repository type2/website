It will work like this way just fine.

Another good relay to check out is a motorcycle starter relay. My '81 Honda 
CB900 Custom (light touring bike) needed a new one. The Honda shop wanted 
$120 for one! I went to the local Kawasaki/Yamaha shop and they sold me one 
for a Yamaha for $16. The wires had different crimped ends but the rest of 
the relay was identical. It is weatherproof! (The real reason I wanted to 
mention it here).

My bus is and has been using a Ford Starter relay in place of the WR-1. 
I've had a person or two say it has too high a current requirement for it 
to be effective as a hard starter relay but only once in 7 years has the 
bus failed to roll over. We just roll started it that time. It was what I 
had on hand at the time and it has not disappointed me. By the way, a Ford 
Starter relay is about $10-$15 FWIW. They are so common I bet you could buy 
one at the local junkyard for $5.
