> the shop my bus is at is trying to charge $160 for the starter and then
some for labor. i guess if i was more knowledgeable then i wouldn't be here.
it sounds simple to check out if you know what you are doing, but like
anything written by someone that knows what they are doing it leaves those
that don't in the dark. just to me if it starts up with no problem when the
battery is charged how can it be the starter? i read about having the
solenoid rebuilt. i got no clue and it's a lot of money for me. thanx for
trying to help me, i appreciate it.

Nathaniel-
The best way to solve this problem is here.
You are correct. If it starts with no problem,
it most likely isn't the starter. $tarters cost $.
My guess was corroded connections. EZ.
Always disconnect the battery when working
on the electrical system. Negative terminal first.
If you are unable to do mechanical repairs, you
can read instructions for a friend to assist.
Wiring diagrams and technical instructions
can indeed be scary and complicated.
