Subject: Starts and Stall then starts fine

I have a 76 with a 2.0 FI and I was wondering if any
one has had the problem:  When I first start the van
it starts for a second and then stalls.  When I start
it the second time it runs fine.  This problem started
after I had the engine out to change the clutch so I
think I might have hooked something wrong or missed
something.

Any Ideas?
