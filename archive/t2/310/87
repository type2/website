Subject: Re: [T2] '78 battery drain

the shop my bus is at is trying to charge $160 for the starter and then some for labor. i guess if i was more knowledgeable then i wouldn't be here. it sounds simple to check out if you know what you are doing, but like anything written by someone that knows what they are doing it leaves those that don't in the dark. just to me if it starts up with no problem when the battery is charged how can it be the starter? i read about having the solenoid rebuilt. i got no clue and it's a lot of money for me. thanx for trying to help me, i appreciate it.
