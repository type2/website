Strip it to long block configuration and CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN.

Check endplay, adjust valves. Do FULL service. Check clutch. Replace seals 
and gaskets. Grease the gland bearing.

Reassemble cooling and exhaust - painting as you go along.

I have done several engines this way with excellent results.
