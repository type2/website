This is actually on the "Pearblossom cutoff" which is not yet the 138.
From the 14 north take the Pearblossom exit.  You'll go downhill, cross
the aqueduct, pass a couple more lights, and you will see the Pines on the
left side of the road.  If you get to the big intersection at 4 corners,
you have gone too far

I'll be on FRS too.  I usually listen out on 40m (7288kHz) on the hour and
monitor 146.52MHz simplex otherwise.  Big things are planned for after we
get to Havasu, as we will be running a special event station with the
special callsign "W7V".  Any hams (or even non-hams!) who would like to
help operate please get in touch or drop by at the event.  Look for the
extension ladder mast!
