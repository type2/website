Subject: shaft bushing kit for PDSIT carburetors

hello list, does anyone know where I can purchase a throttle shaft bushing 
kit for 32-34PDSIT carburetors?  I've found a machine shop here in 
Tallahassee the says they can fix my left carburetor it but I have to 
supply the bushing.  The right carburetor is fine. tx, Greg
