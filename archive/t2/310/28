Subject: R,3,4 shifter situation solved, I think

Hey folks,

Last week I told the tale of losing reverse, 3rd, 4th gears.

I bought the shift coupler last week and figured on giving it a go.

Per Dave Bolen, I watched the exist'g coupling while someone ran it through the gears. (un)fortunately I saw no play.

This being 12 noon on sunday, and me actually having money for a bus repair right now, I decided to let the mechanic have a look. I'm not fond of transmission work anyhow.

According to him, his guess that a particular bushing inside the tranny's nose cone that the hockey stick rides in had crumpled and vanished into my gear oil, had come to pass.

He replaced it and the coupler at the same time and is in the process of test driving it right now. But I feed pretty confident about it.

Almost confident enough to pull a 600 mile trip to BBB out of my butt next weekend!

He didn't use the coupler I bought at my vwflaps, he said he got better ones from (IMC)? He said they were like a OEM supplier.

Questions, concerns, comments?
