Subject: san francisco bus campouts....

Hello fellow listmembers..

With all of the baywindow busses driving around fully in tact, it nearly
shocks me that there are no bus campouts organized in this area. They
all seem to be up north in WA, or too far east of me to drive... Am I
just getting left out, or does anyone know of any in this area?

I guess if there are none, and someone else from the Bay Area reads this
that is also interested, hit me back with a reply, (cr(-at-)midwestbass.com) - 
maybe we should
organize one already! It's a shame really with all the great looking
busses we have around here....
