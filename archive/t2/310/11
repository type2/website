Can you move the squirrel cage part of the blower in and out or
sideways? A common problems are bad bushings in these as they run
whenever your heat lever is all the way down - i.e. all winter long.

They are not too hard to take apart. Check the bushings and the brushes.

Problem: Supplemental blower fan won't work.

I'm also getting power passed 
the relay which eliminates the "bad relay" theory. I also tried to
hardwire 
the fan straight to the battery just to see if the fan motor would work
at 
all. It didn't kick the fan on which means the blower motor is shot 
(right?).
