Subject: pushrod tube seals uh oh

uh oh.

I did my pushrod tube seals this past weekend, and it looks like the oil 
leak is worse, not better.

I did put little dings in them where I grabbed onto them, would that matter, 
or do I just need to get back in there and make sure they are snug tight?

I went out to the bus a moment ago, and the passenger side heater box looks 
like its leaking oil, right by that tire. It's too dark to see well (ill 
check with a flashlight when I get home from work), but id bet its from 
those seals...

dangit.
