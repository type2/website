Subject: UK student insurance

Can anyone studying in the UK recommend an insurance company?  HIC have
a no students with campervans policy- how can we be considered higher
liabilities than the rest of the population??!?

 

Any advice gratefully received

Btw, thanks to those that helped me out on my intermittent starter
problem.  The problem was indeed poor electrical contact but between
positive cable and battery terminal.  I used to unhook the positive
cable from the battery every time I left the vehicle because of a
current drain, and I guess this caused the build up of grime on the
terminal and connector.
