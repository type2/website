Subject: RE: [T2] solex carb source

  I have those carbs in stock. I haven't had the opportunity to test them
out yet and will have on display at BBB VII. They are actually 32/34 PDSI/2
carbs but without all the adjustments as on a 72 and above type 2. On the
carbs are cast Borosol and Solex.
  Type 4 kits are not available yet, but are in the works. The price on type
1 kits $299.95 with type 4 should be close to that.

ps. EMPI has just released there Kadron kits for type 4 but the price tag is
well over $400 dollars, they really need to work on that!
