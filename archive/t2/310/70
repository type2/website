Subject: '78 battery drain

hey,
  i'm not very knowledgeable so please any response dumb it down as much as possible. i got a '78 automatic transporter with fuel injection. 2 days ago i go out to it and it won't start. just makes this clicking kinda noise. so i get this jumper pack i have and hook it up then it starts fine. i take the battery to autozone to have it checked. they say it's fine and recharge it, then this morning i go out and it doesn't start so i have to hook up the jumper pack again. it starts fine. i take it to my local vw shop and they tell me it's the starter. i just don't understand how it could be the starter when it starts fine once i have something to jump it?
