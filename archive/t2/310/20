Subject: Any Coloradans headed to Havasu this weekend?

Howdy,

I'm mulling over the trip to BBB this weekend, and being as it's such a long 
haul from here (800+ miles) I wouldn't mind taking along some passengers 
and/or cara-bussing down there. Anyone interested on the Front Range or 
along the I-70 corridor? If so, p-mail me or call me at home: (970) 
920-2489.

Thanks,
