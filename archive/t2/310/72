Mr. Bartnik has a great article in the type2 library on this problem.

go to:

type2.com; enter library;  then under catagories select Electrical
(Primary), and then scroll down to Starter Troubleshooting and let Mr. B
lead you down the path of step-by-step troubleshooting.

Feel free to e-mail me (or the list) if you get stuck.

good luck and welcome!
