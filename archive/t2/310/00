Subject: '79 backfire, decel valve hose popped off

I got in my '79 CA bus, which had been sitting at the park and ride all day
and it backfired once (like a gunshot) and died when I cranked the ignition.
Additional cranking resulted in the engine starting, and dying immediately
no matter how much gas I gave it.

A check of the engine revealed that the hose on the decel valve had popped
off. I reconnected it and everything was fine. 

So, what does this mean? What caused the backfire? Does this mean my decel
valve is going bad? Is there a work around for the decel valve so that the
bus can get you home without it?
