Subject: Odd repowering (Ford V4)

I looked at one of the oddest repowerings I've ever seen yesterday.  This
engine oddly keeps crossing my path as I looked at a Saab Sonett a few months
ago with the V4, asking a whopping $700 in good shape, here in the great white
north.  Then last month I bought one, in a commercial 175cfm air compressor
(big Gardner Denver affair '73 vintage, with commercial sandblast pot to do
the log house with.)  So yesterday on the way home, in town there is a '70
camper sitting there, with a radiator on the hose, and the radiator setup
wasn't recent for sure, I had to stop.  So copper plumbed front to back, Ford
radiator of some sort, and what should be under the hatch, a little Ford V4. 
On a commerical appearing adapter plate, as in nicely machined but certainly
hard to say if a one off or not.  Freeze plug on one side popped, block not
obviously cracked though, has not run "in ages" and asking way too much, but
interesting none the less.  Anyone ever
 see one of these hanging on a VW in any sense, perhaps a German listee if any
of you still out there?  This was on an 002 tranny of course.  It was actually
a very compact installation.  I have no idea of size or source of the engine,
had Ford stickers on the valve covers, nothing Saab on it, so perhaps
industrial motor like my compressor (which is the 104 cid version.)  Anyway it
actually fits very nicely.  Parts I'm sure would be nightmarish, as I'm
learning for the compressor.  Although this eventually became the V6 for the
Capri, then I guess eventually the 2.8/2.9 used in all those Rangers/Bronco2
trucks in the 80s, not much is the same of course.  Anyway, neat, odd, and
seem to be crossing my path a lot up here in AK.  Neat too in the sense this
is not actually a V engine strictly, more simply a staggerd inline ala the VR6
though not as compact an angle as VWs.
