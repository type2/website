'73 should have the huge round taillights, which (in 
US models) have an (amber) turnblinker on top, below that
a (red) taillight outside (closest to the curb) and a (red) 
brakelight inside (closest to the center of the car), and 
a (white) reversing light on bottom.

But maybe yours has the '72 taillights?  They have a (red)
turnblinker on top, a (red) combined brake/taillight in the
middle (dual filament bulb), and a (white) reversing light
on bottom.

Hope this helps.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Ermel.
