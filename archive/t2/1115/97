Hi Kevin,

My goals for the westfakia conversion are increased fuel economy 
(greater range and lesser cost) and more reliability with full loads 
while cruising on the highway.

Another benefit of a diesel engine is the potential to reduce fuel costs 
by brewing biodiesel from waste veggie oil.

That said, the aforementioned benefits have increased the resale cost of 
core engines, pricing a typical low-miles donor motor above what I am 
hoping to spend.

Happy Trails,
