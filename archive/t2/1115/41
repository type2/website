Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Hitch Mounting and Trailer towing for a 1971 bus

Thanks, Doyt.  Great information!  All I would want to do when I a Round 
Tuit, is put one of Jamie River's nice hitches on the Bopmobile and haul 
my new 1200 CC BMW motorcycle behind it.  Haven't got that yet, either.  
:)  But I did sell my Goldwing and I actively looked while I was at 
home.  And when I say new, I mean new to me.  I don't buy new vehicles 
of any kind.  I can't stand to lose several thousand dollars driving it 
off the showroom floor.  Warranty, shmarranty.  So how many of you guys 
haul big bikes behind your buses and what do I need to know about it 
other than the usual stuff about towing?  Cheers from the Suez Canal.  
Just got through it.  It's great to be back in the Med!  Happy Friday, 
everyone....KR
