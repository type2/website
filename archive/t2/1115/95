TDIs are nice, but I wouldn't say that a "plain diesel" isn't desirable.  I love my 1.6 TD - the diesel clatter is endearing, like the rest of the bus and I am getting an honest 30mpg.  Another benefit is the ability to run on vegetable oil, canola oil, peanut oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, biodiesel, motor oil, transmission fluid, kerosene, or even mixtures of the above that include up to 30% unleaded gasoline.  It's comforting to know that if the stations run out of fuel, I can always run into Albertsons and pour a few bottles of Wesson into the tank to get where I need to go.
