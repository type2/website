Subject: Re: [T2] 78 shifting issue- help please`

No secrets to making a bus shift.  Every part of the linkage (internal trans
and external needs to be pretty close to perfect to make shifting easy.  Start
with
a new cable, adjusted on the tight side to eliminate clutch drag influencing
trans problems.
Then follow the Bentley step by step to get the shifter, plate and rod in the
right location.
VW transaxles are also sensitive to fluid.   Preferably a good GL 4 (not 5)
80-90 works
best.  Synthetic will work, but shift quality sometimes is an issue due to the
design of the
syncros.  Later syncro's seem to work better with synth oil, but if everything
else seems to
be correct, I would try GL 4 to improve shifting.
THere are a few weaknesses in the late tranny's.... especially the bent metal
holder
inside the shift housing that holds the internal linkage.  Be VERY careful
about "forcing"
shifts.  If that bracket fails, you will have to remove the trans to repair.
Take your time making adjustments, lube EVERYTHING external with
silicone/waterproof grease
and just make TINY adjustments until it shifts like "butta".
