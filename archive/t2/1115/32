Subject: Hitch Mounting and Trailer towing for a 1971 bus (was Re: [T2]

Are you saying 1000 lbs from a "not overheating" perspective
or a "frame" perspective?

Also: I was noting the horizontal, threaded bolt holes on 
the frame of my '71, just under the battery tray (which is 
just about to be welded in).  These holes go through the same 
metal [] peice on the frame that the mustasche bar mounts
come off of...

Has anyone used these holes for mounting a hitch to and/or
what is the original purpose of these?

Thanks,
   tom
