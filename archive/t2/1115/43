The Ford V6 from the Taunus/Granada/Capri was used for quite a lot
of VW conversions in the 80s and 90s, because it was relatively
powerful, rather sturdy and literally dirt cheap.  However, its size
called for rather unwieldy body modification (on Bugs at least), 
and its weight resulted in quite interesting handling.

I habe never been close to such a car, and haven't seen one in ages.
The replacement engine of choice seems to be the Subaru boxer these days,
but most volks tend to stick with modified VW engines anyway.

But from what little I know about Fords, the V4 and V6 were pretty
much interchangeable; I seem to have heard or read of many a Capri 
3 litre V6 that started life as a humble 1.7 V4 ore some such.  So
the Ford V6 adapter should accept a V4 as well, and that might even
make a sensible conversion for a Bus (in its day at least) -- not 
much more power, but stone dead reliable power, and hot water to go 
with it.

These days of course, you'd go for the VW 827 inline four for that.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
