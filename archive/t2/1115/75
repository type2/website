Subject: Re: [T2] fuel shut off - eek, diesel content

This may be an old question, but why would anyone want to convert to
diesel with it being as expensive as gasoline?  And as reliable and
easy-to-fix as is the T2 motor, what's the upside?  I guess I should
pore over the archives but I'm at sea and surf-time is expensive out
here.  I can read all you guys' emails off-line.  Thanks...KR
