Right. I was worried after Richard's recent post on NGK availability.
Tried to buy the correct BP5ES for carbs, but could only get the BP6ES
for FI.

A bit cooler plug, but the heat ratings for plugs are for purposes of
tip temp and the dangers of pre-ignition. I don't think changing a
plug heat rating will change CHT ratings, even when using a spark plug
sensor.
