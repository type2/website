Subject: front emblem install

I added a front emblem to one of my recent parts orders.

I got the little connectors too. I put the connectors in the holes on the
front, and tried to fit emblem. It seems so tight, that I think I will dent
the front trying to install it.

 

Then I tried to attach the little connectors to the emblem first, and it
seems too tight to get them on. Am I being too weak? Should I just force
them on.any suggestion on this install? It seems like it should be
simpler.and I am a bit nervous about breaking the emblem posts, or denting
the front of my bus.

 

I checked the archive, and it looks like the following are some options:

 

-Some folks threaded their posts, and put nuts on from the inside

-some silicone them in place

- I see a few folks suggesting magnets.

 

As all these posts are a few years old, how are these attachment methods
holding up? I like the idea of threading the posts, and putting nuts on the
back, but it looks like it would almost impossible to get my hands up inside
the bus to tighten the nuts adequately. I guess the best would be using the
original method.by the way this is for my '69 singlecab.

 

Suggestions?
