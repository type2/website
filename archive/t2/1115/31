Subject: Buses By the Beach - LAST CALL FOR T-SHIRT PRE-ORDER

LAST CALL FOR T-SHIRT PRE-ORDER!!!!!!

 

Hello Fellow Bus Pilots!

 

We are so excited that we are only four weeks away from the 8th Annual Bus
Benefit hosted by Buses By the Beach in Grand Rapids, MI May 20-23! (Always
held the weekend before Memorial Day Weekend) This event is held to raise
money for the Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors.

If you haven't taken the time to order your T-shirt yet we would suggest you
get it done soon! Think of how silly you are going to look standing there
with no shirt on. :-) This is especially important if you need a size other
than men's large. There will be a limited number of large shirts at the
event and they do sell out fast. So the only way to ensure you will have a
shirt is to pre-order. There will be no women's or kids shirt sizes
available at the campout so those must be pre-ordered. 

 

Deadline for T-Shirt pre-orders are 5:00pm Friday April 30th!

 

To order shirts email brien(-at-)busesbythebeach.com with the following
information:

*	Name
*	Address (If you want your shirts shipped)
*	Phone Number
*	Style (Men's, Women's, Kid's)
*	Short Sleeve ($20), Long Sleeve ($22) (Long sleeve in Men's and
Kid's only)
*	Size
*	Quantity
*	Payment Type (Cash, Check, Visa/MC)

Once again our friend Mary Wisnewski has out done herself on the Buses By
the Beach 2010 T-Shirt design! It is a very cool Vintage Vegas theme. Check
