Will a 411 dash timer switch fit your needs, Steve?  I may have one. Plus
all the crap under the 411/412 rear seat, if you or anyone wants that stuff.

Steve, this next pic is like the BN4we pulled from the '77 at my house.  The
extension came from to just under the rear seat, it was from a VW station
wagon, not a camper.  Things would need be done to feed it through the
Westfalia rear seat cabinet.
