Subject: Re: Hitch Mounting and Trailer towing for a 1971 bus (was ~

Tom,

I have made a hitch that uses these taps to mount to.  And on the 68, it is
a pretty stealth setup.  I pull a small trailer that carries all the
essential "stuff" for my family of 6...  

I have seen period correct hitches for sale on the samba that use these
tapped holes as mounting locations.

It has worked well for me, there is no rot in these areas on my bus, so that
makes me feel better. YMMV.

<Also: I was noting the horizontal, threaded bolt holes on 
<the frame of my '71, just under the battery tray (which is 
<just about to be welded in).  These holes go through the same 
<metal [] peice on the frame that the mustasche bar mounts
<come off of...

<Has anyone used these holes for mounting a hitch to and/or
<what is the original purpose of these?
