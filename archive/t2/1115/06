Subject: RE: [T2] exhaust manifold

Hi John,
 
My neighbor an old time mechanic looked at the engine and suggested that I
cut the manifold, set each half on the studs and weld it back together. I
know how to tack weld, so if I do that I can have a friend finish the weld
up. Also I put a straight edge across the manifolds. The one that fits
snuggly is perfect. The one I'm having problems with is about 1/8 off.
 
Do you think the cut and weld method is a good on, or should I buy new
manifolds?
 
Bob

I, at the suggestion of Bob Donalds years ago, always overdrill the holes a
bit (and its tough, they are hard) then a good high grade washer (I just use
an american Grade 8) then a proper solid copper or bronze nut (I made 20-30
of my own from 1/2" hex stock years ago.)  Also always a good idea to dress
the surface of the flanges on a long belt sander if you can so they are both
even (they usually aren't anywhere close on a new Dansk or a used OEM heater
box/manifold.)  Clearance stuff as needed, either the head and/or the
manifold flange for a nice fit.  And anneal the O-rings if they ring as
hard, they must be annealed/soft and aren't
