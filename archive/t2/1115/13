Subject: RE: [T2] driver door glass

I am looking for the glass for the driver's side door. Or Left side. The big
piece that goes up and down.

I have a few leads, but my body shop guy said he had a lead on a whole door,
that he will track down. If that doesn't pan out, I've got a couple others
locally.

Thanks for all your help, I know what to look for...(ie compatibility)
