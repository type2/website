It appears that PPG has spun off its glass business into the company called PGW.

I did a search on PGW and while the website lists various production facilities, factories such as the Oshawa and Hawkesbury plants have closed recently. As you may guess, this has meant that the bus windshield is now sourced from China. Checking with a large distributor (Vanfax) there is another windshield available but it's also Chinese made and not as good as the PGW unit or so I'm told.

The bus PPG windshield was part number FW201 (sometimes FW00201). It's solarized which is nice. 

If you can find some old stock, grab it.
