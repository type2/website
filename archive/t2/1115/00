Subject: RE: [T2] driver door glass

Thanks for the tip, but according to Jim, I guess the glass actually has a
slight curve to it. My body shop originally asked about parts, and I told
him I would try to track the stuff down. But on Friday, he said the
insurance company gave him a lead on a complete door. He doesn't believe it,
but I think he needs to at least call them to find out about the door.

Is the door glass flat in your van/truck?

I got flat glass amde locally and then tempered (even tinted) a few 
years ago. Not expensive.

Take them the passenger side rollup glass for a template.Chris Mills
