As you may guess, this has meant that the bus windshield is now sourced from China. Checking with a large distributor (Vanfax) there is another windshield available but it's also Chinese made and not as good as the PGW unit or so I'm told.

I called the glass replacement company my insurance company reccomended 
and they came out and put in a windshield....  no questions asked, 
although they brought the rubber for a vanagon and had to reuse the old 
rubber but it doesn't leak.

funny thing they sent out a young guy he spent hours sweating with the 
glass and couldn't get it in, called another guy and he comes over to help 
and can't get it in..... finally call an older guy, supervisor and he 
comes out with his truck, zips it in about 10 minutes, says these kids 
just don't know how to string a piece of glass in....,. haven't done it 
enough.

billed my insurance company about 150 dollars.\

so call your insurance company and ask em who they reccomend.
