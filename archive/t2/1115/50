Subject: BN-4 installation and wiring

I went out today to try to reinstall the BN-4 that I acquired (a long time
ago) in the '69.  This bus originally came with one, and all the cuts have
been made, but the original heater disappeared long ago.  As a result, I
have a bunch of questions:

First, while the bus still has the  cable for the thermostat (cut, but
extensible), I don't have the dash timer switch.  Does anyone have one of
these?

Second, exhaust...  I know I'm going to have to fabricate this, but does
anyone know of a common pipe that has the same diameter?  My FLAPS  could
not match it (albeit the idio...gentleman who was "helping" me was very
unenthusiastic).

Third, at the front, where it dumps into the passenger compartment, it
almost reaches through the Z-bed cabinet.  There must be an extension and
grille that I am missing. Once again, anyone know where I could get one?
