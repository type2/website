Erik, I was hoping you were still around and would chime in.  Indeed I've read
the V6 and V4 bellhousing flange are identical, so the V4 would seem to me an
ideal little conversion, in Europe, in the 80s or 90s at least, excepting the
obvious plumbing issues.  I bet it would fit under a bug decklid as it left
quite a bit of space in the bus, and probably doesn't weigh much more than say
a big T4 (which it displaces about the same as.)  Anyway it is a neat bus, but
one I am not destined for unless I see it on craigslist in a few months for
$300-400 or so.

3 litre V6 that started life as a humble 1.7 V4 ore some such.  So
the Ford V6 adapter should accept a V4 as well, and that might even
make a sensible conversion for a Bus (in its day at least) -- not
much more power, but stone dead reliable power, and hot water to go
with it.
