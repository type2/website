Subject: Re: [T2] Sourcing a new windshield

Thank you Richard and Treyjung for the tips.  The glass shop I spoke 
with originally said they source from PPG.  I also called Binswanger, 
and they said they source from Pittsburgh Glass Works.  So I suppose the 
glass would be made by PGW either way.

Ordering a new seal as a just-in-case.  My current seal is in good 
shape, but better safe than sorry.  I will be using this "opportunity" 
to do some needed repairs to the windshield lip.

Florida is a couple thousand miles away, so that's out.  :)

Thanks again.
