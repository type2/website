Subject: Re: [T2] Passenger Door Mirror Replacement

Although not listed in the factory parts book/fiche, the internal nut for
the mirror was available as a replacement (and for conversion to add right
side mirrors on a 68-77 Beetle Sedan).  VW part number 111-857-517 C,
obsoleted by VW a decade ago, but Airhead Parts/VWG now makes a dead-nuts-on
reproduction of this.  This is normally spot welded inside the door.
