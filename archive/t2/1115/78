It's TDI that's really desirable, not plain diesel. Lots of power and
great fuel economy.

Well, T2 motors (type 1 and type 4) are easy to work on compared to
modern vehicles, but they are vulnerable to overheating damage if not
properly monitored and looked after. I prefer keeping an air-cooled
motor myself, but would not be adverse to a motor change if I got a
bus with no engine, and a donor motor was offered.

 diesel with it being as expensive as gasoline?  And as reliable and
