Hi Rob,

I think that method will work just fine, and would be much preferred to
writing off a new heater box. As long as the repair weld doesn't deform
the tack weld positioning it should be fine.

I suppose the end product might have a slightly shorter life span if the
repair rusts out before the manifold does but in this case ANY life span
is an improvement over none, assuming the rework isn't prohibitively
expensive.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
