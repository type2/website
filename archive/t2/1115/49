sound about right. A standard bus is good for around 1000 kilos.

I was wondering what the load rating for my single cab is, or what is was
originally. I checked the manual from the samba, and it looks like on page
51 that my truck can handle 2,370 pounds, basically a bit over a one-ton
pickup. That sounds like a lot! Am I reading this correctly?  

I'm just wondering, as I was talking to one of the guys I work with who has
a modern, large pick-up. This is for my '69 singlecab.
