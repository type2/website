on comercial vehicles there is usually an emergency switch on the 
dashboard somewhere that releases a damper valve that cuts off about 95% 
of the air, enough left for the engine to come down to a slow idle (so you 
can get off the road) and then go to the engine compartment and finish 
shutting it down.

one reason for any diesel and other cars to have a shut off system for the 
fuel or air.
