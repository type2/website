Subject: RE: [T2] Trailer Wiring

Not sure if this will help.  I installed a hitch and 7-wire harness on my
minivan, and published the process on one of my websites.  It was especially
interesting as the van didn't have the factory harness,  I ended up getting
service manuals (which didn't help), and managed to get it done by taking
apart most of the back of the van.

I would hope that wiring the harness in a bus is a lot simpler for you.
Especially after all of the help that you're probably going to get from this
list.

I also had a special shank made for the ball, combining a Rapid Hitch System
with the Convert-A-Ball System.

Hope this helps somehow.
