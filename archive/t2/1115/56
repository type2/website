The claim indeed is 3/4 or 1 ton trucks depending on year, springing, and
obviously how fast you want to go.  Though oddly the lowly 1600 seems to move
about the same with either me alone or a ton of shit, with mileage only
falling off a mpg or two.  Dad and I once figured (after the fact) that we
moved about 3000lb of block, several trips worth, in our '76 standard (bus)
one time, did fine with it.  You will of course not move it fast.  And of
course you won't tow like an American 3/4 ton truck.  Though I bet with a
power boost on second thought, a SC would be ideal for a 5th wheel.  The load
platform for a VW SC is sort of idea truck wise with that damn big bed
stretched out mostly between the wheels, the load right where you want it
supported with very little overhand on either end, on a SC the treasure chest
area is even better sitting directly between the wheels probably right around
the center of gravity.
 
(however though as I hate to admit it, I still like jumping in the beater '97
Chevy now and then)

I'm just wondering, as I was talking to one of the guys I work with who has
a modern, large pick-up. This is for my '69 singlecab.
