Hi Bob,

I think Greg covered the pros and cons pretty well. 1/8 inch off is a
lot to try to cover with the means explained in the article.

Basically that is their goal in using a long flat file to file both
pipes together at the same time. Then even if you can get them level
and eliminate the 1/8" difference, the holes are out of line, which is
why they drill them oversize. You could try this first to see if this
yields the wiggle room you need before deciding to cut the manifold.

Of course, you have to realize that the original is welded at the
factory, so a good quality weld should be as durable as the factory
weld. You might cut one of the pipes near the factory weld so you
don't end up with an extra weld.
