from what I'm told a slightly rare item, but some use a defroster switch
instead

I've got one that I can measure and take pics of-if I remember it was like
one inch pipe with one or two bends, and a round bracket to give it support
where it exited the engine compartment

> Third, at the front, where it dumps into the passenger compartment,

again useing memory- I think there was two pieces-one attached to the heater
thru the firewall and a longer square piece to get to the passenger
compartment.

Steve, we're in a new place, but I have an idea where I've got that stuff
stashed, at least I can get you pics and measurements.Is this the euro bus?
Thats one I wish I coulda kept.
