Update on my post about a 73 camper:

"Rust in the usual spots":B  means to me
the wheel wells and the lower panels.B  This guy has a van full of sheet metal
parts ready to be repaired.B  Panels will go all around the base of the van.
NY State Title:B  In hand! - Legit

Status:B  Older gentleman inheritted this
project from another older guy in the local MG/foreign car club here in
Roch.B  He did not know a thing about VWs and took on a more of a project
plusB storage than he could.B  He is more involved refurbushing old Mercedes
and needs to clean house.

Make him an offer - any offer (hint hint nudge
nudge)B  As they say in the housing markets "anxious seller".

Hi Joel,

Sounds good.
Before I pass it along to the S. Onatrio group I gotta ask: 
Does he have a

Happy Trails,
