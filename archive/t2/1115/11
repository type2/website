The email address bounced but the phone number worked.

I was quoted $685.50 + $105 for FW201. The operator couldn't determine the country of origin or markings. This price is silly given that VW windshields are still common replacement items even though they were 70's vehicles (Bus/Vangaon/Eurovan/etc were VWs gift to the windshield biz!).
