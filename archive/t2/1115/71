Have heard of that happening in a golf diesel... Unfortunately it's not 
really practical to block the air intake from the driver's seat. 
Typically the driver has to try to avoid hitting anything while waiting 
to run out of oil. But that could take a while, given that there's a 
gallon or so in the crankcase. Most often it is put into neutral, 
something goes bang, and the end result isn't pretty.

This is one of the downsides of a potential diesel conversion for my 
westfakia....

Happy Trails,
