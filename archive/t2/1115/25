Fuel injected Buses, Bugs, and Vanagons all take the same fuel pump.  They
are also interchangeable with the pumps on certain 1980's Jaguars, Beemers,
and Alfa Romeos, although typically the pump costs more when you attach one
of those names to it. :-) 

I have a closeout buy on brand new Bosch pumps for $119 or $129 (depending
on terminal style).  They sell for around $200 elsewhere. Also new U.S. made
ones for $99, although for the $20 price difference I'd probably go for the
Bosch.
