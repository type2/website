Subject: '78 Westy Question

Hi, Happy cinquo de Mayo!  Today saw a Westy at the side of the road, and
stopped and backed up, to offer help.  Owner was a young girl of 25, first
van, 78, supposed to only have 5000kms on engine..and looked 'decent', re rust
etc.  She said as she approached the traffic intersection on Highway, she
stopped, and the 'red' oil light on dash came on, and engine stalled.  She got
it started, but way down on power, and after about 1/8 mile, pulled over in a
safe area, and bus would not turn over!  Had it towed to one shop, a tire
store, at which point I interceded, and used my AAA card to have bus towed to
a 'competent' shop I know and trust!  They said they would check it over and
contact her before any 'majors'!  I thought it might be a 'spun' bearing, but
oil was perfect color, she said dip stick was not hot to touch when she
checked it, and no oil leaks underneath!  She is a 'first time' Bus owner, and
very enthusiastic about her ride!  Talked to my friendly Mechanic at shop
where it is now, and he said.."if spun bearing and age of motor, might be at
least 4000 Can $, but not to get 'excited' before.."look"!  Gave her a lift
back home, and said when she finds out,..I would be interested!  Turned her
onto this site, as well as Samba, and AIRS!  All 'felt' good
Syd
