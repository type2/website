Another mystery. Reminds me of what we went through with Bob's breakdown.

I'm almost thinking a likely electrical problem rather than engine.

Still reminds me of Bob. Why would the oil light come on with the oil
full and no leak?

Overheating can reduce viscosity, but it was not hot. And it would not
affect cranking.

I'm thinking electrical.
