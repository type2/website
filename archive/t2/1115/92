Subject: 78 shifting issue- help please`

Hi there,

New to your list, thanks for the terrific resource.  I just picked up a 78 
type 2 pop up top that has been non opped and sitting for 5 years give or 
take.  Had to start it in gear initially and nudge it to get the clutch to 
release.  I can't get it to shift smoothly into second gear, and all the 
rest seem to require extreme motions to engage.  I installed the front 
bushing for the rod(it was lying in the pan), and greased the shifter. 
Still no better, but at times I can get it right into 2nd with no grind 
(granted moving slowly, and not often).  Trans was rebuild according to FO 
receipts like 12k  miles ago.  Clutch adjustment is at it's cable limits. 
When you mash the shifter down to hit reverse, it does not seem to stay down 
like my 57 does.  Any help here highly appreciated.

all the best,

Dan Belick
