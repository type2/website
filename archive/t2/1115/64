I didn't install it (other things hopped in front priority-wise and then I got this crazy diesel engine idea), but it cost me around $75, I think, and then shipping from Australia.   It came with a controller that lets a few seconds of fuel through when the ignition is first powered.  Then, once the engine is running, it keeps the valve open.  Once the engine kills, the valve shuts.  Pretty snappy.  I got it from macmotors.com.au.  I'll sell the set-up they sent me for what I paid in January 2004, if you want it.  I don't know what they ask nowadays, or if they even still sell them.  I imagine someone sells those things online.  I'm not exactly a fountain of useful info like many others on this list, but I do have one of those valves. :)
