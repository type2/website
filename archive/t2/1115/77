That's really interesting because no matter what AFR I use (lean or 
rich), I still end up with the CHT going really high at high speeds 
unless I run really, really lean.

Specifically what NGK plugs are you using?

One thing to be careful about is that those may be hot plugs (or cold, 
not sure which way it works), so they're not shedding as much heat from 
the combustion chamber as your other ones, and skewing your CHT 
measurements.  I guess the real test will be EGT, and to see if that 
changes with different plugs.  Hopefully I'll have that up and running. 
  It would be interesting to do some tests with different spark plugs, 
and also with EGR on/off, and then see what kind of EGT changes I get.
