Subject: Passenger Door Mirror Replacement

Hi all,

Ever since I have had a relationship with my bus, KK-Louise, she has had a
mirror screwed into the door, not the original. I bought a replacement for
the original and went to put it in but it appears that all of the threads
have been stripped out. There is no way the stock mirror is going back into
the hole. KK is '71 Westy.

What is the fix for this? Do they make some sort of heli-coil for this
application?

As always, thank you for the advice.
