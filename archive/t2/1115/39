Subject: Re: Hitch Mounting and Trailer towing for a 1971 bus 

The 1,100 lb un-braked trailer weight limit mainly reduces the probability 
of the trailer having sufficient momentum to either overwhelm the bus 
braking capacity or cause fish-tailing....whip the rear of the bus 
laterally back and forth. These out-of-control conditions could take over 
steering from the driver and cause a collision or roll-over. The bus has a 
designed braking safety factor to allow a loaded bus to stay under control, 
and the moving weight of the trailer eats into that safety factor. If an 
operator loaded up the bus with camping gear, and added a thousand pound 
trailer, the brakes would be perilously close to not being able to slow and 
stop the rig in straight line reasonable distance. A heavier trailer that 
approaches the weight of the bus alone would be able to push the bus around 
uncontrollably at road speed and in a turn. You don't want to discover that 
situation while you are sitting behind the steering wheel at 50 miles an hour.
When towing anything, reduce speed, increase assured clear distance, and 
keep the trailer as light and stable as possible. Stay out of situations 
where you would have to brake or turn suddenly. And park it when the roads 
get wet and slippery or windy.  Also, any of these conditions can result in 
a situation that puts stresses on the hitch and frame that might cause failure.
