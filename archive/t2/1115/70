On a VW diesel, a solenoid on the injection pump stops fuel flow.
The ONLY way to stop a diesel engine is to remove one of the three things
that makes it start. Fuel, Air or Compression.  Fuel is the common way.

Had a diesel run away (started drawing oil from crankcase) in mechanics
school (Army 1968) and as the 8V53 started to hit some really scary 
RPM's an instructor casually walked over and threw a clipboard over 
the air intake.  Took about 10 seconds for the engine to choke and die.

When do you want to go to Haiti?  I can make it happen.
Christ lays opportunities to serve him at our feet every day.  
We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
