Subject: rust

Hey,

For years I have used Rust Check.

Only problem  is that it eats rust. So, if your vehicle is mostly rust,
you loose because it eats, well, your vehicle which is mostly rust.

It munched on my westy when I first moved east to atlantic canada from
the arctic.

Had body work done and now it is better.

Currently working through faults until it is very nice to drive. 

Last on the list are new seat cushions.
