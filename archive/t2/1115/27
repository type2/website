Thanks for the input,

I have to go out and check for the nut. When I bought the van it did not
have the original mirror, just a ghastly three legged contraption with
machine screws holding it to the door skin. I'll take off the door panel and
look for the nut. Thanks for the tips everyone.

The mirrors are held in place by a large nut on the inside of the door.
