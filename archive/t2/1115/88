Got out again tonight for another run with my other sensor. Results
were pretty much as yesterday. Less traffic meant I got to spend more
time at the high speeds to accumulate engine temperature longer, so I
reached the magic 340 degrees sooner, but still much slower than
before. Temps went something like this:

Idle after warmup - 286 degrees
City driving speeds up to 40 kph - 292
60 kph - 305
70 kph - 312
80 kph - 325
90 kph - 330
100 kph - 335
110 kph - 340
120 kph - 345
130 kph - 350
140 kph - 355

Keeping WOT at 140 (about 87 mph) to find top speed and also simulate
heavy hill climbing caused the temp to steadily rise from 355 to about
385 before it stabilized. I couldn't maintain that speed much longer
(about 150 kph / 92 mph) because of road conditions, so I'm not sure
temp wouldn't have gone up more had I kept it at WOT longer. At high
speed I had to pay more attention to driving and less to the gauges.

Anyway, it looks like 5 degrees of temp increase per each 10 kph, or
about half what it was before.
