Hi Guys, I need some help!

VW Buses and Drivers wanted to  transport the walkers....

Note from the Guthrie Center...

Our  10th Anniversary
"Arlo Guthrie's Historic Garbage Trail" Walk to  Massacree HD
will be on SUNDAY, MAY 16TH, 2010

We will be walking  backwards again, beginning at Theresa's Stockbridge 
Cafe (formerly  Alice's Restaurant) and ending at The Guthrie Center.
(formerly "The  Church") Registration begins at the church (Guthrie Center) 
at 8:30AM and  
everyone will get rides to Theresa's in VW Microbuses. The walk will  
begin at 10:00 from Theresa's. When everyone gets back to the church  
there will be sandwiches and we will have a concert featuring Xavier -  
Abe Guthrie, Tim Sears, Randy Cormier & Dan Teichert beginning at  NOON.

You can print out a 2010  sponsor sheet above and if you would like to 
help promote the walk, you  can print out some downloadable fliers to 
post in your area.
Looking  forward to seeing everyone again!!!
