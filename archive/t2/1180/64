Subject: Re: [T2] sand or strip and paint

Guy is full of shit.  You may or may not however need to sand down to metal
depending on how the bus is right now.  If solid original paint and less than
1-2 recoats, with no deep checking/crazing through the primer to the metal, I
would only do bare metal if forced by circumstance or for a very high end
restoration, and I wouldn't even then ususally.  Circumstance to me mostly
would be rust under the topcoat and primer in checks.  Sometimes I will
(despite the royal PITA it is to do) take a sunburnt roof to metal because of
rust pitting down in crazed areas.  You can do exactly what you have done
previously, sand to your liking (using the topcoat(s) as a guide coat for
sanding say to primer/some remaining original topcoat.  Then simply put on a
quality epoxy primer/sealer (which you should do anyway) my favorite being PPG
DP 40/48/50/60/74/90 (whatever color you like) and it will never lift. 
Period.  Standard rules apply, at least 2 TSP/hot
 water/multiple rinsings then wax/grease remover, before ever touching the bus
with sandpaper if you still can, and the same expecially a couple wipedowns
with good wax/grease remover before the DP40.

You will NOT have a problem. 
If the guy thinks you will, find another guy, he is a fool, and I'm serious on
this, if you are thinking about paying any money whatsoever from a job from
this guy and he is balking about his gaurantee if you don't take it to metal,
walk on.  If you want to pay the money it will take to take a bus to metal, go
ahead, I'd be more worried about failure from getting proper bare metal
conversion and primer on there immediately before flash rust.  In all reality
modern paints are as a generality more tolerant of mixing types for these sort
of things.  In the day the usual problem child was shoot lacquer over
something it would lift (no one uses it anymore), or the early waterbornes
that had adhesion issues (what they classicly had in the 80's and 90's with GM
and Chrysler) over older technology surfaces, but I'm sure that most of the
major lines have primer/sealers specifically for this issue.

I've got a painter telling me I need to sand down to bare metal or my 34 year
old paint will cause his new paint to lift after a short while, using acrylic
enamel years ago I used to get a pretty decent paint job by sanding, was I
deluded or will the new 2 parts be the problem.
