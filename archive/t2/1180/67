Has anyone found a scissors style jack that can be used under the frame area or on the beam etc to change a flat? I would love to find one in a junkyard from a vehicle that has a big enough scissors style. Has anyone ever found one suitable, and if so, what vehicle did it come from?

the dang bus is a heavy beast
I never trusted the stock jack
just break down and carry a small hydralic jack
either a shop or bottle version.
I found one that is a combined jack and jackstand
kinda neat, picked it up at Pep boys on day.

is like a jack stand but has a bottle jack on an outrigger, to lower
you have to both turn the release valve on the jack and hold up on the 
jackstand release lever.
