  Did a little research,

  https://developers.google.com/maps/  this is free for public apps with
  some limits to size and hit count.

  I would be interested in help with this.  Been on this list for
  and have seen many attempts at this and have volunteered but never
  received follow up.

My background is in systems development and systems management
primarily on the unix based platforms.  C/C++, java, perl, php, and
others.
