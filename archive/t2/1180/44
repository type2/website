Subject: DIY EGR linkage to throttle

First , A big thanks to all those folks who help me fixing my 
transmission, the culprit was a loose screw and a better tune up of the 
linkage ! fishing trip in perspective this WE near Tahoe ! ;-)

NOW , my present problem is to build the EGR linkage to throttle. I have 
a smoke  inspection ... tomorrow !   I could not find where to buy them. 
what about making one ? Did anyone built one which looks like ... pro, 
any diagram ?
I am going to home depot now and see If I can play Macgyver for this guy !

Thanks for any help.
