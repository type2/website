Subject: sand or strip and paint

I've got a painter telling me I need to sand down to bare metal or my 34 year old paint will cause his new paint to lift after a short while, using acrylic enamel years ago I used to get a pretty decent paint job by sanding, was I deluded or will the new 2 parts be the problem.
