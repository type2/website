I'm glad there is excitement for this!

At the same time, I feel Dan's
sentiments that "too many cooks spoil the broth".
So if we get a small,
dedicated team doing the heavy lifting (i.e. back-end/DB and UI) then other
folks/teams can work the features (e.g. VW route planner).

Should we take
this discussion off-line or lay bare our nerdiness for the amusement of all?
CV
C/C++
Java
Tcl/Tk
A lick of *NIX & Windows Server administration
A sprinkle
of PHP

Did a little
research,

https://developers.google.com/maps/  this is free for public apps
with
some limits to size and hit count.

I would be interested in help with
this.  Been on this list for
and have seen many attempts at this and have
volunteered but never
received follow up.

My background is in systems
development and systems management
primarily on the unix based platforms.
C/C++, java, perl, php, and
others.
