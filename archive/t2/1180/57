Figured I'd toss these out here just in case anyone here has multiple vintage
VW's, before I put them on samba.  Picked these up at a yard sale today, 5/58
date codes, speedo and fuel gage both look very nice.  The clock got some
moisture in the front and the hands are rusty and the face delaminating some. 
However it is free and the back is perfect and looking down into the mechanism
through the adjuster port it looks perfect.  I'm sure it could be
rebuilt/refaced.  I didn't put power to it as I don't have a nice small
regulated supply for 6V.
 
Anyone with interest shoot me an email.
 
John
