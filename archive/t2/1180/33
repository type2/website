Subject: Re: [T2] THE BUS

Hi Kevin,

I saw it this past weekend when it was screened at BusFusion. There was 
a crowd of a couple hundred people watching and it was very well received.

It has some great footage, and it's well crafted. The two big things I 
was looking for were missed completely though... no mention of the 
internet and no mention of any bus gatherings other than traditional car 
clubs. I can't see how anyone could talk about the bus for over an hour 
and not mention EveryBus or Buses By the Bridge, HCBF, etc.

I suppose that would be enough topic for a whole other movie.


Happy Trails,
