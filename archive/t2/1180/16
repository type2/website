Subject: Steve Dolan's cats up for readoption.

He had 3, ahem...   They are all special needs (each has a problem with one
appendage), but function pretty well, ages 5-11.  Now personally I'm the sort
of person that would just as soon see them off the new Woody Wilson as it is
convenient to their current home, burlap bags are still relatively cheap,
etc., but if anyone near the metro DC area who likes cats is interested in one
(or all I presume) I can put you in touch with Steve's brother.
 
In all
reality, if I were near, we probably would take one, would give me something
to try to kick again.
 
I may or may not be being serious.

wrote a description of  them:
 
1) Luna: 11-year-old female tabby with a fused
ankle (probably from being clipped by a car). She was rescued in west Texas as
a youngster. I picked her up on a road trip without realizing that she had the
old injury or pyometra; rescuing and spaying her saved her life. She's sweet,
fat, has fur like a rabbit's, and considers snow a personal affront.
2)
Selene: 9-year-old tabby with radial nerve damage to her front leg. She was
brought in to a rescue as a feral kitten who had been hit by a car. She has an
independent personality and loves playing soccer with snowballs.
3) Eclipse:
5-year-old black male with 3-1/2 legs, as one rear leg was traumatically
amputated at the hock when he was a street kitten in SoCal; that leg was
subsequently surgically amputated at the knee after he was flown out and
settled in back east. He forgets that he's a lap cat until you bodily place
him, then he doesn't want to move. He can catch birds given the opportunity.
