Dizzy is stock to the bus, again only 96k miles, rock steady dwell, no play in
shaft etc.  Condensor is new 10 years but only 5000 miles ago and was an NOS
German Bosch of 80's vintage, not some crappy made in ??? Bosch new one.  Coil
is original however.
 
I've never had this exactly out of a coil though when
failing, though perhaps...
