Subject: Re: [T2] 1974 Bus, left side battery tray floor 

Hello Jamie,
 
I could not find one either. I ended up buying 2 right side
battery trays. I am just going to flip the one for the left side upside down.
I got the trays from Bus Depot. I figured it was better than using flat sheet
metal or a rivited old chunk of stop sign. I am just going to cut off the
battey hold down bracket off of the bottom. 
 
Let the list know if you find a
supplier of the other side at a reasonable cost.
