This small group already exists. Message me directly if you want in. As much
as I would love to knock this out, the learning curve is too steep for me
currently, and I don't have much time to dedicate. That said, a few of us have
put a descent amount of discussion and analysis toward this topic, as well as
a few pieces of code. Nothing near a release yet though.

Peace, Troy
