Subject: rear brake backing plates

Hello from Canada.  On my '74 Westy, I have removed all parts to get backing
plate off, but in "BENTLY', it does not say remove axle hub, and states
backing plate will come off!  I can only assume that 'they' figured axle hub
was off, because visually there is no way backing plate can be removed without
removing axle hub.....yes?
Cheers
