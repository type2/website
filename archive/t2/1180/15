they were a lot of fun, some years ago they had an on line car buying 
advisory thing, where you answered a whole bunch of questions and they 
would tell you what to buy.
well I took the survey and about a week later they went on this long 
winded (typical of them) rant about what was I trying to do actually use a 
car for something other than show.  well they ended by telling me to buy a 
Hummmer 1. the big diesel version and went on and on about how it was the 
perfect vehicle.  and then at the very end.
   they said if you don't have 150k to dump on a Hummer go buy an old VW 
Bus.   !!!!!

not sure how long I laughed on that one.  they actually got it right, must 
have been an accident.
