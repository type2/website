Subject: Re: [VB] Split/Bay Single Cab gate interchange?

Actually not really on the repair metal.  There unfortunately is no "just buy
and have shipped" when it comes to sheet metal to AK, cost of shipping light
but bulky parcels like this is usually 5-10 times the value of the parcel.  So
if sectioning the split gates helps me as far as repair panels, I need to
know.
 
So I guess what I'm wanting to know is what are the differences here,
hinge spacing, overall dimensions, what exactly?
 
Thanks anyone.
 
John

Rear gate will fit, but you can just buy and have
shipped the repair pieces
for the bottom frame.....
