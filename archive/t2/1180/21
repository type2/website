Subject: Mud flaps

I had a friend ask about Mud Flaps.. he is looking for something more modern 
than the original westfalia mud flaps because he has wider tires on his 
camper.
He would like something that follows the contour of the "fender"  ..

He wants to do front and rear wheels....   any suggestions?
We were thinking of cutting a cardboard template, and just searching the 
FLAPS stock..

Thank
Jamie
