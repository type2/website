Solex orginals work perfectly until the throttle shafts wear and start to
leak air. Bronze bushings can be installed to make them like new, but this
is not typically within the domain of the DIY'er. Rebuilt Solexes are
available from several vendors in the UK. They were used there as factory
through the 70's so lots of market there.

Webers are ball bearing shafts so better for longevity and rebuilding. You
may have to experiment some with jets to get them right for your engine.
Get the 40mm. Don't let anyone sell you the 44's as "bigger is better" is
just hype here.

No difference at all in balancing either, unless the Weber "kit" includes
a "designed to be cheap" linkage. Perhaps more fussy with the Webers
initially to insure full throttle opening, unless you get a quality
designed linkage purpose designed for this conversion. A bit more fussing
to hookup the factory aircleaner to maintain the pre-heat system for warm
up. No chokes on the Webers but you simple do not need them except for
Arctic temps.
