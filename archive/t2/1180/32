Subject: THE BUS

Just got my advance copy of that movie "The Bus". If you guys remember it
was a kickstarter project.

 

It was a good movie, not amazing, but pretty good. My wife really liked it
too. She thought it would be boring, but she got into it. She is a VW fan,
but not like me. She doesn't like the working on them aspect.After it was
over, I was like."Wait, I want more!" I wish it was longer, but then again
it also made me want to get back in my bus and go on a trip.

 

I recommend it. Not sure about when the real release is going to be, the guy
who made it is waiting for licensing permission for some songs, or something
like that.
