I thought they were a lot of fun and I enjoyed making a guess along with
them.

Highlights of the times I listened to them include twice when people called
to ask about Kia Whatevers with engine noises and when they held the phone
up to the engine, the knocking was so incredibly bad that the caller
couldn't hear both brothers yelling at them to stop and turn it off. In both
cases, the callers came back on the phone to report that oil was now pouring
out of the engine so it threw a rod right on the air, which was awesome.

One other time they played "stump the chump" and invited a married couple
back on the air to discuss a diagnosis made during a cross country trip only
to find out they got divorced at the end of the trip. That was awkward.

Last weekend, I learned that diluted Muratic Acid will remove concrete from
a car without harming the paint. It was better than a lot of other crap on
the radio.

I will miss them.

For those of us who listen to and like this show:

It's the end of the road for "Car Talk." After 35 years on the air, Click
and Clack have run out of gas, and will stop taping new shows this fall.
