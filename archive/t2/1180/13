I don't think a photo would be a lot of help it is a black disk placed 
over the shaft with 4 slot in it, and a U shaped sensor/light that wraps 
around the black disk, and a sloted shaft that holds it in place.

pretty much it, nothing touches it is a light beam thru a slot thats' all.

wires run to the command module mounted elsewhere and to the coil.
