Autozone is coming to AK, Autozone is coming to AK, right here in Wasilla,
right here in Wasilla (insert Palin joke here) the building is almost done,
the building is almost done.  All the worthless places will go out of
business, go out of business.  We are almost out of the auto parts dark ages,
out of the dark ages.
 
No seriously folks, when Advanced and Autozone came to
WV (damn near 20 years ago) it was great, and now finally I won't have to pay
300% more than going internet price for the same Chinese crap from O'Reilly or
or Carquest.
 
It is a great, great day for AK.
 
John
