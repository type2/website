First, RIP, Steve.  I did not know him, but his reputation preceded him.


Any
chance on using the GoogleAPIs with the AIRS members data to get a nice map?
When I plan a journey I plot out the AIRS members and any known air-cooled VW
specialists within a given radius of my trip.

Having a automatic route
planner that did this (like ETOPS for old buses) would be great.



PS.
 Please don't ask me to implement this.  I just provide ideas.  

PPS.  If
sufficiently browbeaten, I will learn what I need to get the job done.

Troy,

Let's make this happen.  Steve's
passing is a great opportunity to do this.  No committee.  No importing of
data.  You do the UI.  I'll do the DB.  It'll get done.  I bet this would make
Steve happy.  I bet it would make a lot of people happy.

Dan
