Subject: Anyone found an aftermarket scissors jack that works on Bay

As much as I love my bus, I'm loathe to use the stock VW jack because my bus has seen better days in the jack point area, and is waiting me to weld in all the new parts. Has anyone found a scissors style jack that can be used under the frame area or on the beam etc to change a flat? I would love to find one in a junkyard from a vehicle that has a big enough scissors style. Has anyone ever found one suitable, and if so, what vehicle did it come from?
Just wonderin'. :-)
