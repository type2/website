Subject: Re: [T2] Webers?

Single throat Webers are awesome carbs, just make sure you can get rebuild kits for them. There are a number of these webers, baby-webers, etc etc. I think CBPerformance was the big importer of them. Check out their website. Redline was a US distributor as well. Check them out.
