Subject: Update re 75 bus ECU bad- 78 one works

Waiting on a replacement ECU from a list member, I tried the 78 ECU- it 
ran in  place ok; changed the fuel lines and today Nyssa drove it with 
me- she
says the power is slow on acceleration and up hills.  Will check valves
and compression and wait for ECU.
