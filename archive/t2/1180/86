Subject: Re: [T2] rear brake backing plates

For any rear brake work, you will do yourself a favor by just getting the
tools and process for R&R of the big nut and hub down. You don't even need
to remove the tire/wheel/drum from the hub. Pull them all together as a
single unit.

It provides much better access to R&R the shoes and clean everything
properly. In fact, once you got the big nut process down, much faster as
well for standard brake maintenance and inspection.
