Subject: Looking for blue green plaid upper bunk cushions

Hello List,
 
I am looking for upper bunk cushions/covers with blue-green
westfalia plaid. Anyone have any? I need them to recover the z bed, jump seat,
and I need some for the upper bed. I know that there are venders seling repro
fabric, but I would rather have the original unless someone has left over
scraps of the original or repro they are looking to sell or get rid of. Let me
know what you have. I have not seen any pop up on the samba lately or ebay.
Thanks!!!
