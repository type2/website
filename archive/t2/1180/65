Subject: A public thank you.....

I made a random post back in early May about The 26th Annual Bug-In for the
Twin Cities Volkswagen Club will be on Sunday, 5 June 9:00 am to 3:00 pm at
Luther Westside Volkswagen in Saint Louis Park, MN.  My post went like
this.....

"I sure wish these guys had T shirts or some other swag for sale on their
web site.

Joe (Luther)

from the West side (of the Dayton Ohio region).  

:)"

Yesterday, my postman brought me a large envelope from Bradley Spear of the
T2 list with a license plate frame and dealer plate insert from Luther
Westside Volkswagen.  It now occupies a place of honor downstairs in my bar.


This is just another example of what a great group this is - thank you Brad!
