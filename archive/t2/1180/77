Subject: Alternator B+ Stud

I've recently changed an engine from 6V generator -  to 12V alternator  with
help from you all. Thanks.

 

The issue I'm running into is the stud on the alternator that is labeled B+.
I have tightened the nut on it a few times, and it keeps loosening up. I
noticed that there is a small black plastic washer on it, that appears to
keep the stud from grounding? Anyway this little black thing appears to be
melting. I don't know if I didn't tighten it properly the first time, and
that caused a lot of small arcing, which caused it to melt.which further
loosened the nut..anyway at this point I added some wavy washers, and
tightened it up again. I think this was also causing the battery to not
charge up properly, as I had a few times where I had to jump it. 

 

I'm not sure if I'm good to go at this point, or if there is something else
I should be doing?

 

Thanks for your  suggestions.tips.comments.
