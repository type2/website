Steve never unfortunately did finish the split volks, it remained a bare shell
sans interior except for the front seats.  He had the entire interior in his
basement of course.  I would imagine his brother will have it findings its way
to a new owner at some point, and in a few days I'll mention to him that
someone in DC should figure out the interior so it can go with.  Fortunately
for anyone that ever saw Steve's basement he did toss loads of stuff there 6-7
years ago and relatively speaking there were probably only 5-6 busses worth
left down there I think 8-)  It is a neat bus, which despite my always joking
that it should have stayed in the junkyard I helped drag it out of, is neat in
that it is an early 12v with single reverse light, is a tin top, and was
essentially single owner prior to Steve.  It still looked pretty good last
time I saw it 6 years ago, Kelly got the gaps a bit tight such that the finish
paintwork ended up a little rubby on
 the cargo doors and one front door, but still top notch metal work, and nice
finish work by Mark.
 
If someone does pick it up, I have the factory case
sitting in WV, which may actually have been a documented factory replacement
case, I don't recall.  I'll need to get down and find it among other things,
as I was trying to get around to building it with all NOS stuff, but time got
in the way...  Sorry Steve, you know it was coming when you got around to
doing the interior, sigh...
 
John
