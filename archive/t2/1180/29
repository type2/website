rather than repeat all your symptoms.

intermittent problems are a real PITA to find. but
in a LOT of years driving air cooled I've run into this problem twice. 
took about 3-4months to find it the first time many years ago. and it 
turned out to be a tiny pinhole leak in the fuel line on the vacuum side 
before the fuel pump, when the engine got warmer the fuel line rubber 
softened up and it started sucking air.
I don't think this is your problem.
but a couple years ago I had a very similar problem and it took almost a 
year to find it and it was a broken connector on the fuel pump. this 
sounds more like your problem.  try another fuel pump if you have one and 
check all the wiring to make sure everything is tight.

good luck
Bob
