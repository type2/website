Douglas County. I was in Arapahoe County yesterday and they're the ones who
wouldn't talk to me.

I went to the Douglas County DMV this morning. Reached for a number and
hear, "I can help you over here!" !!!! Turns out the lady helping me used to
work in the Fresno CA DMV office. She hates the county stuff here still and
she's been here 4 years.

LoL!
