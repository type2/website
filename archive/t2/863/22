David,

I have three or four of the horrible freight ones and they seem to work 
well on everything from my riding lawn mower to 3 vw's.

Did you actually take one apart in the store? and look at the circuits?

Picked mine up on sale for $5.00 each.

Bottom line for me is that they were relatively cheap...it appears that 
the rest of them tend to run about $50+.

Cheers, dave
