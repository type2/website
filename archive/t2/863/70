I had one of those carbs on a Pinto way back when, but I never did anything
to it other than replace vacuum lines for the vacuum controlled automatic
transmission.

Lean=heat. I don't know how Type 1 engines handle it, but our Type 4's have
those delicate heads that dislike heat. I've already experienced a sunk
valve in the GWB, and have no desire to experience it again in the Guac.
