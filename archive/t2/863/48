Chai,
IMHO, maybe sticking brake caliper (or plugged brake hose) is the cause of pulling to the right.  I guess it could be screwy camber or funny tire too though.

  is that good or bad...

Camber is part of alignment spec.  I recently learned that many alignment guys don't know how to set camber on an old ball-joint VW.  Many cars have non-adjustable camber.  They didn't do mine on Monday either.  pretty pathetic since this is what you pay for.  

As Tallman did, you could take them the manual and open to the page with the picture where it shows the eccentric bushing that sets the camber.  For him, his camber was so far out it destroyed a brand new tire in 3000 miles.  Funny, it was the same shop I took mine too, must have been a different tech.  didn't hold their hand though.
   
Still looking for a decent shop.
