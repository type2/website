Unfortunately, the Harbor Freight one is garbage.  I took a close 
look at it in their store the other day because it was on sale for 
$9 and I had a stack of 20% off coupons, which would have made it 
about $8 out-the-door after tax.  I did not leave with one and the 
coupons went to waste (well, I did buy a Mi-T-Vac).  

This charger does nothing more than pump a constant 500ma through 
the battery.  It does not appear to have a voltage regulator and 
probably relies on the relatively low amperage to keep from 
overcharging a typical automotive-sized battery.  It has no 
business being called a float charger.  Save your money for 
something with a bit more sophistication, IMO.
