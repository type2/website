Subject: Re: [T2] Yet Another Smog Story

Problem  is that in some states, like TN, different municipalities have  different smog regs.  So they prevent you from registering in  other counties to get around them.  A lot of that was going on  here before they banned it.  Chattanooga was going to lose a lot  of federal money unless they started emissions testing.  But then  TVA is burning coal by the metric megaton to keep the power on.   Cheers....KR
