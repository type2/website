 You know a big camp trip is on when you start watching the ten day forecast!
Looking good! Will prolly hook up the heater boxes. :-)

Who is in from TN? As of now, Jason (Dixon), Cwis (Knoxville), Dirk
(nashville-maybe), Roberts ( a maybe from Chattanooga).

At any rate, "Howling Bus" is on in Roan Mountain, TN one week from today.
Anyone is welcome to camp at my house on the way to EB2006. It is only 5 hours
from here. :-) We leave Thursday at Dawn's crack.
