BTDT, may I highly reccomend
. 197 to Bowie
. picking up 301 South
. stay on 301 over the Nice bridge into VA
. at Bowling Green turn onto 207
. at Carmel Church (11 miles) join up with I-95 South
. at Petersburg take I-85

almost perfectly flat and at least an hour faster than any other route.
also a lot nicer, you might also be able to Carabus as I think a couple
folks are going that way.  unfortunately I will not be able to make it
this year.
