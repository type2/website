you could start by checking the 12v before and after the ign switch at the
fuse block.
the incoming side from the battery is always hot, should be a group of
red, red/white wires bussed together.
the outgoing side of the switch is a bussed group of black wires, hot only
when the key is on.
one of those black wires runs back to the coil.
all of this runs through the fuse block terminals but not through any
fuse.
all should be 12v.
could be a bad wire, a bad crimp terminal, corrosion on a terminal or the
ignition switch itself.
