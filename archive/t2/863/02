Subject: poptop seal

I need to do mine.

The ones I have been seeing aren't like original
but are said to do the job.
Anyone found a generic seal that does the job?
Im sure that the ones being sold are off a fridge
or something and should be in a parts catalog
somewhere for 30 cents a foot :)

Any ideas or best buy somewhere ?
Canada preferably
