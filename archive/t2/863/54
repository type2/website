Subject: ignition wire on coil

Hi List,



'71 Westy 1600dp



I am still trying to figure out my problems with my ignition. I turn the
key and get power to everything, and the starter spins really well. I
get a really tiny bit of current coming to the wire that connects to the
coil. I would assume I am supposed to get around 12 volts. Since
everything works and there are no blown fuses, and the terminals are
clean, I am left to believe that the wire from the fuse block to the
coil is shot. Does this sound like a correct diagnosis? I am bypassing
the whole system right now but it is annoying because to turn off the
bus I have to pop the clutch to kill the engine.



I look forward to the advice,



Thanks,


Max Bronsema
