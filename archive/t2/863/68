Subject: Re: [T2] Definition of a VW Cultist

Hi Don.  I'm definitely a VW cultist.  Just let me know when you want to schedule the mass suicide. :)  
  
  I took a look at the Gaucamole Bus today.  NICE!  Question though, you said, "I  was afraid to leave it like that though for fear of overheating the  heads due to too lean a mixture."  How does one determine the  correct mixture?  I have to run mine pretty lean to keep it from  dieseling.  (Single Weber).  How much does it affect head  temperatures?  Other than that, the Bopmobile runs great.   Thanks...KR

Definition of a cult, as applies to Bus ownership:

A cultist is one who has a strong belief in the Bentley Manual and John
Muir; who frequently attends Fix-It parties and Bus campouts; who has a high
level of financial giving to an air cooled cause; who schools their children
in the proper use of a wrench; who has accumulated survival foods and has a
strong belief in the ability to fix anything wrong with his/her Bus on the
side of the road; and who distrusts newer water cooled vehicles. Any of
these may qualify (a person as a VW Bus cultist) but certainly more than one
would cause us to strongly look at this person as a threat to modern
automakers, and his family as being in a risk situation that qualified for
rides in "normal" vehicles provided by family and friends when "The Bus" is
again broken down.
