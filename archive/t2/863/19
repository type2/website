Subject: 1300cc or 1600cc which is it ?

Was New carb woes.

Still on the solving the poor idle problem... and I know you might think 
I'm dumb for this but I checked the engine code today against some 
documentation and found that I'm running an "AM"  which is supposedly a 
1300.  I've got a 34-Pict3 which I guess is simply too big for the job.

The question is how do I check that this really is a 1300 and not a 
"rebuilt to a 1600" motor as for example some refurbish shops do, 1300 
cases being seen as less stressed over time, so make a good rebuild.
