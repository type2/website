But, again, how does one determine the correct mixture?  I got  mine to run well but turning the mixture screw all the way clockwise,  where it won't run, and then backing it back counter-clockwise until it  idles nicely.  At that point it doesn't diesel, even when it's  hot.  But if I go much further counter-clockwise, trouble!   So how do I tell when I'm overheating the heads?  What's the  procedure for determining correct mixture?  I realize that our  air-cooled babies don't like heat.  No engine does.  But help  me out here!  Cheers....KR

I had one of those carbs on a Pinto way back when, but I never did anything
to it other than replace vacuum lines for the vacuum controlled automatic
transmission.

Lean=heat. I don't know how Type 1 engines handle it, but our Type 4's have
those delicate heads that dislike heat. I've already experienced a sunk
valve in the GWB, and have no desire to experience it again in the Guac.
