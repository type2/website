Subject: [ANOTHER QUESTION] Number of Gallons to Paint

Greetings Group,

Thank y'all for the feedback, but I forgot one *important* detail!  When we
talk "number of gallons of paint", are we talking before or after mixing
reducer, etc.?  For example, the paint I'm considering using is mixed in a
ratio of 8:3:1 (paint:reducer:hardener).  If I can still do math, this
means that if I need one gallon of "sprayable mixture", then I only need
2/3 gallon (approximately 85.3 ounces) of paint (also need 1 quart of
reducer and approximately 10.7 ounces of hardener).

So, are suggestions for "number of gallons of paint" typically made with
respect to actualy paint (assuming some sort of reducer and hardener mixing
ratio) or are suggestions typically made with respect to "sprayable
mixture"?

TIA,
David
