drag down the voltage of the primary *and* sap enough of the alternator
current such that the engine dies after it starts? Anyone?

The trick is not to use a thick wire to join the two batteries. When 
two batteries are joined together the thickness of the wire controls 
the size of the current between them. If you use an appropriately 
sized wire you shouldn't stall the engine as you will only be drawing 
a couple of amps. I'm sure I've read what size wire to use - probably 
right here on the Type2 list - but I can't remember the details. :(

Cheers,

Martin.
