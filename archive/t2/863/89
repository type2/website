Well, I guess intuition told me the best way to set it.  I did it  
exactly as Weber recommends!  I may look into checking it by the  exhaust 
gas when I can find a shop that has that capability.  I  think I've seen 
one that advertised emissions pre-testing for  $10.  Any idea what 
range the numbers should be?  Thanks...KR

you said, "I  was afraid to leave it like that though for fear of 
overheating the  heads due to too lean a mixture."  How does one 
determine the  correct mixture?  I have to run mine pretty lean to 
keep it from  dieseling.  (Single Weber).  How much does it affect 
head  temperatures?  Other than that, the Bopmobile runs great.   Thanks...KR

I had dieseling with the single weber and it turned out to be the 
valves needed adjustment. The weird bit was the engine would run backwards!

The best way to check the mixture is through analysing the exhaust 
gas. Failing that you have to use fairly crude techniques to know 
you're close to the mark. If you're way too lean you will get 
backfiring through the carb(s). Closer to the mark you can check by 
adjusting the "lean, best idle" (at least for the idle jets) - see 
below. In this process you work out the number of turns the idle 
mixture screw needs to be screwed out to achieve smooth idling. Too 
far out and you are running too lean (and vice versa).
