	This is a great idea Marcus on making the most of your trip!  I am
somewhat in the same boat.  I am delivering a bus to the coast of NC and
will be heading to EB with an empty enclosed car hauler afterward.  Since we
are bringing the motorhome to EB this year, I planned on leaving the trailer
elsewhere in NC instead of packing it into the campground.  But....if there
is someone that could use a haul or delivery from EB to somewhere between
there and Colorado, let me know and I can bring the trailer to the
campground.  My load limit is 8,000 #..not including the trailer.  A Westy
is in there now so clearance should not be a big issue if it comes to that.

Peace...and looking forward to heading East in a few days for EB!!

I am heading from College Park, MD, to Atlanta, GA, in a couple of weeks and
will have an empty tow dolly on the way South. So, if you have a small car,
I can give you a good deal on hauling. All it needs are two good tires in
the rear.
