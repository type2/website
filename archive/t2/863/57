Subject: [Q] Number of Gallons to Paint

Greetings Group,

How many gallons of paint does it take to spray a Type 2?  Specifically, I
have a '71 Camper which should take a bit less than others, given the
fiberglass top.

I know the answer depends on how many coats I apply, so I guess the best
answer would be the number of gallons to cover the Camper once.  I can then
scale up to the number of desired coats.

BTW, I plan to gut the interior before painting so that I can cover the
complete inside of the frame/body also!

Kind Regards,
David
