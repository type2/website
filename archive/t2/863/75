Hey, I hope you left the dash painted as it was?   Bring it to Everybus- 
my daughter (at art school) is leaving Savannah Fri morning
(21 Apr) for Greensboro, NC- you can carabus with her. It's 281 mi to 
her and about 340 from her to Hagan-Stone Park with about 180 or more 
busses!
http://www.geocities.com/mike_benthin   -our 78 bus (she grew up with it)
http://www.geocities.com/the_fider - has a link to her 75 bus- she plans 
to do anime all over it this summer.
