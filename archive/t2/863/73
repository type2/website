Why did you have to drag Dawn into this?

I'll be there.

Jason sez if'n he can't get Wyatt out of school early, he won't be 
passing through Knoxville until 8 PM Wednesday.

I would like to leave outta here in time to get there before dusk 
(sometime in the afternoon).

We'll see what shakes out.

I don't know if I want to see Dawn's crack ever again.
