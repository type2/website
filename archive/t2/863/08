Hello all,

I am heading from College Park, MD, to Atlanta, GA, in a couple of weeks and
will have an empty tow dolly on the way South. So, if you have a small car,
I can give you a good deal on hauling. All it needs are two good tires in
the rear.

I am saying "small" car because my camper will do the hauling. I have done
many thousands of miles with this setup and my experience tells me that any
compact to mid-size car is doable. I will only consider hauling a bus if it
is relatively empty (i.e. NOT a fully equipped Vanagon camper ...) and the
route does not involve too many hills. Splitties should be fine.

My route will either be I-66 to I-81 or I-95 to I-85. Let me know if you are
along the way and need help with moving one of your cars.

Even more bus content: Everybus will be part of my trip. So hauls from
(towards Atlanta) or (from points north) to Everybus (anyone need to pick up
their ride from Kelly?) would be fine, too.

To avoid a lengthy discussion about the suitability of our buses for towing:
I don't have a stock engine (though it could handle that, too) and my hitch
is a German Westfalia-made one rated at plenty capacity for this (1.2 tons).

Marcus
