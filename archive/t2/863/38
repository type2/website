Subject: alignment/steering system hell

Does anyone have Karl's sermon handy from last year concerning the right 
way to set up the steering?  I think I understand what is going on but I 
need to print and take to alignment guy.

I just installed new tie rods and I went to have it aligned.  I come 
back and they thought they were doing me a favor by adjusting the tie 
rods to center my steering wheel.  DOH.  it's about half a turn 
different side to side and I know this is now centered at the wrong spot 
inside the steering box.

diagram links welcome also.  I'd like to get this shop the right info, 
they are trying to be bus friendly and nice, they want to get business 
from the VWs in that area. (Asheville) plus they sell the Wynstar 
185R14C's.  I'd hate for them to screw up more.

However I'd also really like to take my bus to someone who can do it 
right--to whom in the continental US should I take my bus. it's not 
rocket science!!  just hard to find the right person.  in the southeast 
will be nice.  will travel though.
