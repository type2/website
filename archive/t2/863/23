Shad-

I spent $1500 more than that and got a near-perfect example of a '79 with
79k original miles, no rust and a sweet-running FI motor. I've driven it
regularly for over a year now and haven't had to do anything but change the
oil. While yours sounds like it may have some good things going for it, I'd
think you should be able to find a much nicer example for that kind of
money. Just my 2", and good luck!
