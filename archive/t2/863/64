Subject: BMW L jetronic explanation and fuel pump check

Hi all,

I've been fussing with the fuel injection some lately,
and while looking on the internet for info, I found
this pdf explaining l-jetronic in simple english:

http://www.firstfives.org/faq/ljet/jetronic.pdf

it's from a BMW website, but it's essentially the same
as on the bus. I thought it might be a good companion
to the Bartnik writeup on the type2 website.


Also, I have an easy way to test whether the fuel pump
works. Instead of taking the air filter out and that
whole headache, just take the cover off the top of the
AFM and gently move the wiper so the switch closes.

Does anyone else do this? It seems safe since you're
just moving what the air would move...


Valentin
