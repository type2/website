<<How many gallons of paint does it take to spray a Type 2? >>

It depends David.

If you plan on painting the same color as the Bus is now, and what type
of paint your going to be using, and then how many times you want to go
around the vehicle.

Straight enamel &  Acrylic enamel, after reduction, same color, two
passes, a gallon and a half.

Urethane Enamel the same.

Base / Clear three quarts color, one gallon clear reduced the Bus being
the same color as the paint.
