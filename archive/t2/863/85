Anthony,

The paint if it's unopened, and has no hardener in it, it will last a
lifetime--as long as it isn't in the gargage getting frozen in the
winter---and over heated in the summer--

I keep all opened partial paints and partial opened hardener's in an old
Crosley---
Refrigerator that is--not a station wagon--

It's shelf lile is unlimited.
