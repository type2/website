Subject: fan hub sealing ring???

I am in the process of replacing my crankshaft seal (fan end Type IV 1.8
litre, GEX).  Bentley says there should be a fan hub sealing ring.  It is
supposed to go on the crankshaft taper before the fan hub.  I removed my hub
and crankshaft seal and mine did not have one.  Do I need one of these?  Where
could I find on?.  I tried the Bus Depot site with no luck.  Thanks for the
help.  I feel like a noob all over again.
