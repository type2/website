how far we talking about??  do you have CAA towing they will usually tow a
certain distance I think stolen car counts for a tow.

if you have someone in Victoria you trust it may be worth it to trailer it
back..  a U-haul with 4 wheel trailer is not all that expensive, and you
never know it may be drivable. maybe someone in the area could check it
out.

good luck on getting your baby back home
