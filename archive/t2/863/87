Hi Volks,

I'll be offlist with "limited" access to email for the next 10 days  
or so, so I'm signing off the list until I get back.

EveryBus 2006 will be a bookend in a 2200-mile westy trip for our  
family... If you see a red late-bay decorated with white maple leaves  
somewhere in Ontario, Pennsylvania, West Virginia or North Carolina.  
be sure to honk and wave.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
Toronto, Ontario, Canada
