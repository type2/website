Shad,

Depends if you want a project or not. I just picked one up for $500 bucks
but it has at least 5 Grand in repair to make it perfect.

You can easily dump 1500 bucks in body work and another 3000 for paint and
seals to fix the rust (most shops charge 50-75 bucks an hour). Also the time
to strip the vehicle to get it ready for paint. If you want something nearly
perfect, you will have to budget 3500 to 4500 for paint and bodywork and at
least 6 months of non-drive time.

BUT, if you are into that kind of thing like me, it is worth it because it
is all you when it rolls down the road all shiny and new.

If you want a problem and rust-free rig, I agree totally with JJ. Spend the
extra dough and get one that is 99% rust free.

OR, offer a thousand less on account of the windshield rusting out.

Sounds like a cool Westy though, and complete.

 Shad-
 
 I spent $1500 more than that and got a near-perfect example of a '79 with
 79k original miles, no rust and a sweet-running FI motor. I've driven it
 regularly for over a year now and haven't had to do anything but change the
 oil. While yours sounds like it may have some good things going for it, I'd
 think you should be able to find a much nicer example for that kind of
 money. Just my 2", and good luck!
