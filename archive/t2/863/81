Subject: Confirm your PayPal account

Dear Sir,

PayPal is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community
of
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal
employs
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our
anti-fraud
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity.

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in
your
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that
your
account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited.
Your
account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved.
This
is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not
compromised.

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may
require some specific information from you for the following reason:

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal
account
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection

Case ID Number: PP-046-631-789
We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible.
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account or
may result in eventual account closure.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please understand
that
this is a security measure meant to help protect you and your account. We
apologize for any inconvenience.
