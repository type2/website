Check out my parts pages, I can't say about the rods but I'd suggest that
you get a copy of How To Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine by Tom
Wilson, It details interchangeable parts from 1800-2000 engines and tells
how to identify the parts. I think you also need to fly cut the 1800
heads to make them fit the 94mm cylinders but definitely get the book.

I'm sure I would need different rods, which ones?? 
 What recommendations would anyone have while I do this ?
