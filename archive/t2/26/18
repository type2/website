Here in Germany, it's little-known, but widely available under
the name of "photo glue".  A common brand name is "Fixogum",
green tube in a green cardbord box with white lettering on both.
Not exactly cheap though, your garden-variety glue tube (dunno,
maybe 200 ml or so) costs around 4 Euros.

Airhowlingly yours,
