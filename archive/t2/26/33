If you happen to live in California, your exhaust options may be different because there you are required to have a catalytic converter.  You could still use the '72-74 heat exchangers, and mate them to my $285 '79 49-state exhaust, which accepts both the cat and EGR.  Not sure how smog officials would like this (perhaps someone in California could comment) but since the California-only parts for the stock setup are no longer available, I can't see that you'd have any other choice anyway.  This setup would retain all of the emissions control stuff that your stock setup had, just in a slightly different

Facing this situation soon with a 79 cal. engine, my question:

Do the 72-74 heater boxes mount directly to my exist'g exhaust manifold flanges? Are the flanges the dual hole trapezoid shape? Are there any modifications required to stick the 79 49 state exhaust to the 72-74 boxes? Will my exist'g heat control boxes mount to the 72-74 boxes? How compatible are heat control boxes across the acvw line? can my exist'g cat be mounted to this setup? I know there were two kinds.
