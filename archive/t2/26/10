Subject: Camping in the San Diego area?

Listers,

I'll be going down to the San Diego area next week (probably leaving on the
25th).  I'm looking for any camp site info for the El
Cajon/Santee/Lakeside/etc. area of San Diego.  Checked the archives and
didn't find anything.  Just need a place with a shower and toilet - don't
need a lot of amenities (standard, not deluxe camper so the most I can use
is power).  Should be in the area for ~ a week, give or take.

On the same note, anyone needing transportation of something (parts or ???)
from the Eastern San Francisco bay to San Diego (or vice versa), let me know
and maybe we can get it done.
