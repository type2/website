Bryan,

If you have a reset button on the outlet, that usually means you have a
GFI outlet(Ground Fault Interruptor).  This is what saves you when you
drop your hiar dryer in the tub with you.

It could be bad(I've seen them go bad), but it is probably busy saving you
from electrocuting yourself.

Plug the tv in somwhere else and see if it works.  Unplug the extension
cord and plug something simple in to the outlet and see if it works.

Cheers, dave
