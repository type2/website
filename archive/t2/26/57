Subject: Re: Erradic loss of power (again)

        I had this problem this summer on the 73 distributor and after
checking it found the ground wire betwee the 2 plates to be loose and arcing
causing little burn spots.
I ended up stripping it down and cleaning it all with carb cleaner spray to
remove the oil and dirt and resoldering a new flexable wire in place. The
plate has to be extremely clean and dry to accept the heat for soldering.

     This had a very benaficial result in the smoothness of the bus and the
sudden lose of power snags.
