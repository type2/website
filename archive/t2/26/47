Go to http://www.rrdonnelley.com/contact/ and ask this there.

RR Donnelley is one of the biggest magazine publishers in the world; they
use this stuff by the carload. Unfortunately for you, that's how they buy
it, too--and in 55-gallon drums, to boot. It's a form of rubber cement.

The guy who came up with this system got the idea from a news story about
the making of Hostess cupcakes.

Hmmm...come to think of it, they still sell rubber cement in little jars. As
long as the paint on the inside of your door's still good, the rubber cement
would peel off if you were to use that to hang the plastic sheeting.
