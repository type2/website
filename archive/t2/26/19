actually I backdated my 78 to the older 73-75 exhaust which is compatable
with 76-78 and is a lot better quality and is cheaper.

now you do have to change the exhaust header and heater box though, I
lucked out and found a good header and don't use the stock heat system so
didn't want the orginal but there are folks who will swap

Ron at Bus Depot has a stainless muffler that beats any stock muffler for
the bus but it doesn't fit the 76-78 model, but is actually cheaper than
the flimsy stock unit and is identical in design

as always YMMV
