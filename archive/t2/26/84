Volks,
	I got burned trying out a local parts store here in Philadelphia, PA.
***** J&R Foreign Auto Parts*********  STAY AWAY FROM THEM!!!!!
The guy insisted that he was giving me the correct part, but when I 
checked the part number, it was wrong. He told me if I had problems, 
I could bring it back, but when I did, he got mad and told me "NO 
REFUNDS". When I pressed the matter, he began to curse me out. 
Needless to say, I have a brand new BOSCH Voltage Regulator for the 
55amp alternator that goes in the pancake engine on most late bays.
I paid $45 for it, and most reliable VW venders list it for that too. 
I'll sell it for $35.
Let me know if you want it.
