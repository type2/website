Subject: 75-79 exhaust WHATS THE BEST?

Hey guys the original exhaust on my 77 just gave up. 
Lost the muffler somewhere mid ohio today...any how
which is the best style exhaust available...?  I am
sure the orig is best and it is super expensive with
all those parts.  They have a stock replacement that
is one unit.  Do they work well?  Header system looks
crappy to me....but does it work and ???$$$

Or original and BIG $$$$


Let me know

Thanks
