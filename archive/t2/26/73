Subject: whats it ? 

Hello listmembers...

I found this little screw into something, thing, in one of the cabinets of 
my bus when I bought it. I always figured it would find its home as I used 
the bus, but still haven't found it's place. It either doesn't belong to a 
76 westy, or I haven't used what it connects to correctly thus far.

Any ideas?
