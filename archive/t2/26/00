Subject: up for suggestions

I have a 78 Westy, 2.0L FI.  We are needing suggestions as to what might be
wrong.  It will start, but, the accellerator has to be all the way to the
floor and then it putts and sputters and puffs some black smoke from tail
pipe.  Sometimes, it will finally clear out and will run, but is really
rough sounding,, almost like a bad exhaust.  But, we know it is not that
since it was just gone through.  We were thinking it might be a spun, or
stacked bearing... but, it just seems to start to easily, as long as it is
cold.. when the engine warms up a bit , it starts harder, or not at all...
And and all suggestions are greatly appreciated
