Subject: No A/C on '71 Westy

> I recently purchased a '71 Westy 2 weeks ago so its

ready.
> I have the extension cord running to it so I could
> have my 9" t.v. out there so I could watch the news
> while working on it. It's been working great until
> last night when I unplugged it to move it. I plugged
> it back in and had no juice. First I checked the
> extension cord--it was plugged in and was giving
> power.
> I then hit the reset button on the outlet--it
clicked
> but I am still not getting any power. Does anybody
