Subject: Looking for 1970 Single cab parts

Volks,
Looking for a source for new or used single cab parts..........looking for
obscure stuff such as body repair panels, those covers that hide the gas
tank in the cargo area, etc.

Found most of the other bits at Wolfsburg West, but it is sheet metal I
search for now............
