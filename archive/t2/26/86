Subject: Flywheel advice needed 

Hi Folks,
   It looks like my wife and I will be going to Campers on Cape Cod, this 
coming weekend, in our Mitsubishi and using our tent :(
   With the engine out (1971 bus with a 1600 engine) and the flywheel off 
I've noticed a very faint wear mark on the flywheel, where the crankshaft 
seal rubs.  It's so faint you almost can't feel it with the edge of a 
fingernail, although it is easily seen.  I'm wondering if the flywheel can 
be machined to get rid of this wear mark.  I've check all the usual manuals 
and it isn't mentioned, and I can't seem to get into the archives right now. 
     Have any of you ever had this done?
