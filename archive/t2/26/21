Subject: I'm one of you now!

Thanks to Ed M. in Abilene, I'm now an owner of a '72 hardtop 
Westy...officially moving me into the bay-window bus owners group. I have 
to admit it's been fun admiring all the fancy stuff on this "new" bus when 
comparing it to my old splitties.

Anyway...nice to be here.
