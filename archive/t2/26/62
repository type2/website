Joel,

Had this problem once in a bug with a holley carb.

I had rebuilt the carb and it was running great.  On the way to work,
bam!..no power, but idle perfectly.

To make a long story short, when I took it apart, there was a small piece
of fuel line type rubber in the float bowl.  It would semi float until it
happened to cover one of the main jets and then no more power until I
turned the engine off and it would sort of "float" away from the jet.

Just a suggestion.

Cheers, dave
