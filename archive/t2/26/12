No personal experience here. Digging data out of Tom Stienstra's most 
excellent book "California Camping". Note that my edition is 1991, so I'd 
highly reccomend calling ahead to verify these places are still there... 
;-) Or go grab a newer copy of the book, well worth the cost IMHO. Check 
the archives for my past raves regarding it. Sites, listed in what I 
think is order of convenience to El Cajon:

Santee Lakes Regional Park
50 tent/rv, 102 rv w/full hookups
619 448 2482

Rancho Los Coches RV Park
4 tent, 60 rv w/hookups
619 443 2025

Lake Jennings County Park
35 tent, 13 tent/rv, 63 rv w/hookups
619 565 3600

Also note that San Diego changed some area codes a few years back-I know 
north county is now 858, no idea if east county still uses 619 or 
not-creative checking will no doubt confirm or deny. Looks like Lake 
Jennings will be your best bet if you desire (and have the time) to catch 
fish, book sez bass and catfish can be had. Have a fun trip! ;-)
