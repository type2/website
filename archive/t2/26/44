Don't know if you got any joy from the rest of the list, but the best stuff
is called acoustic ceiling caulk. They use it for installing the vapour
barrier in houses. It comes in BIG tubes, it's cheap, it stays flexible in
cold, and it's MESSY. Be really careful not to get it on anything you value.
