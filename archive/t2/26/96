Subject: Anyone Build Their Own Air Dam?

I've been contemplating building an air dam for our 1976 Bus.  Hopefully,
this will give a bit more stability at highway speeds.  Has anyone here
tried this before?

My idea is to attach brackets made of flat bar stock under the bumper using
the bumper bolts and fabricating the spoiler itself out of plexiglas or a
similar material.  I may have to laminate several layers of plexiglas
together to get a bit more stiffness.

Any thoughts?
