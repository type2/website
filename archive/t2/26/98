Subject: anyone in st.pete, fl ???

Hey all ....if there is anyone in the st.pete, fl area
that can help a sistah out in finding a decent place
around here for purchasing parts then respond please.
I'm from nc and I'm just visiting here for a couple
months. My muffler blew out big time when I drove here
a couple weeks ago and I'm lookin to find another one
for my bus that is pretty decent in price. I dont have
much money so help me out here please.
