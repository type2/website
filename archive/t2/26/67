Subject: turn signals

Well now that the paint is done, I put the signals, etc. back on, but when I
tested them the signals were blinking really fast (including the GEN lights)
and I knew this meant they were hooked up wrong. Only problem is that the
wrong fuse was in the fuse block, so something fried before I turned them
off.

 I have replaced the fuse with the right one (8) and a new turn signal relay
that plugs in under the fuse block, but still no turn signals. The GEN
lights do come on now and the gas gauge works.  Any ideas? This is a 72
Westy, all original for the most part.

Thanks in advance,
