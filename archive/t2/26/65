Subject: Re: [T2] cost of transmission repairs

Certainly sounds like it.

All the symptoms sound the same as the problems I was having recently,
everyone that knew what they were talking about told me that it was the
clutch cable, half the strands go first, and the rest a bit later.

Sure enough, when I picked up another cable & pulled it, about 2/3 the
strands were gone, the rest would have gone soon after.

Good news is that it's cheap & easy to fix ( I've hardly touched my bus
since I've had her, and I did it no worries ), get a new cable, undo the
butterfly nut on the end of the cable, disconnect it from the clutch pedal
up front, pull it out, slide the new one in & hook it up again, simple as.

Luck,
