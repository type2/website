absolutely nope they don't.  in my experience later lates are bigger.

for my front cab door plastic sheeting, i used the 3M spray trim adhesive
recommended by karl. man, i got a tight drum fit. it must shrink or
something. made the door seem like it was halfway covered in saran wrap.
good suggestion!    - steve
