Any chance of getting the list administrator and members to submit
pictures of the different varieties of Westy type conversions that can be
put on a link so we can see what the various configurations look like?.
I'm sure I've seen a lot of Westy type units but it certainly is
confusing. I know some are very rare and  I see many list members with
nonstandard conversions that were special ordered or modified.
A picture gallery of side mount accessory tents would also be nice.
A home page link could accomplish this task nicely and serve to educate
us type confused list members.
