Subject: engine is finally hooked up, but won't start

Well I got my engine bolted back in and put the tin on and hooked up the 
wiring, the gas line, the vacuum line, the throttle cable, and put oil in 
it. Hooked up the battery, lights came on, turned the key and the starter 
went for about half a second, then the whole electrical system went dead. I 
unhook the battery and rehook it and it will do the same thing again. There 
were very few wires on my bus, the black one to the coil, the green to oil, 
the red one on the starter solenoid, and two wires near the silver regulator 
thing. I hooked them all back up the way they were before so I am not sure 
what is wrong. I did not remove the clutch, and the engine went back in and 
i tightened the bolts so it shouldn't have anything to do with the flywheel, 
but I don't know about the starter, the solenoid is about a year old. Any 
body have any ideas?

Thanks,
Nathan
