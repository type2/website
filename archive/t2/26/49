Subject: I scored an engine, now what?

Hey All,
I scored a running, supposedly recently rebuilt engine at the Cincinnati Family reunion show this past weekend.  It has not been in a bus for about a year, but the guy says it ran just fine.  Anyway, before i toss this baby in my new '64, is there any prep work to be done to an engine that has been sitting this long? Lubrication? Good karma mojo? or anything you would do to it before I fire it up?
