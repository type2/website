Subject: 79 Riviera Tune Up problems continue



Hi all,

First off I would like to thank everyone for their help in the past.  It has
been extremely valuable.

Now for my ongoing probem..

I am still having problems with my engine missing at certain rpm's.  I had
it completely tuned up, and even took it back in to the mechanic to have
them take another look.  They can't find anything, and I really have no
confidence in their abilities.

Basically it misses at certain rpm's through each gear.. for example, in 3rd
gear it will consistently miss in the 33 to 38 mph range.  My timing is
currently set at 7.5 .  It is a 1979 California edition, but I do not
believe it has the 79 engine installed (no hydraulic lifters).

Besides the timing, here is a list of what else has been replaced in the
last week.

Spark Plugs / wires
cap
rotor
fuel/oil/air filters
points
condenser

Any other idea of what I can change or check?

Thanks again everyone,
Nick
