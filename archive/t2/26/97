What I would check are two things.

1. See if the distributer shaft is warn, check by removing rotor and with
your fingers wiggle it back and forth.  If you feel play, you need to
replace the distributer.  A warn shaft will make the spark jump and can
cause mis firing.

2.  Make sure the cylinder head temp sensor is tight on #3 cylinder and
make sure the wire connector is also tight and not frayed.
