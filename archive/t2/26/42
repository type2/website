Subject: cost of transmission repairs

Hi again everybody. Due to a lack of knowledge and ability on my part, I am 
considering taking my bus in to the mechanics to fix the problems with my 
transmission including but not limited to the clutch. Right now the bus will 
not shift into any gear with or without the engine running. I tightened up 
the clutch one time and that gave me the gears back, but half a trip around 
the block and it was jammed again... I know the clutch is worn out but a few 
other things could be wrong... does anybody know how much this could set a 
guy back to get fixed?
Thanks for your time! - Andrew Dickerson - '71 bus
