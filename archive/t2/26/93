The number you listed has something to do with the EGR. The middle numbers
(131)are EGR related

I BOUGHT THIS 73 BUS WHICH BESIDES HAVING AIR CONDITIONING AND AN AUTOMATIC
TRANSMISSION IT HAD BETWEEN 2 AND 3 DISSASEMBLED ENGINES IN SIDE THE BUS. i
HAVE THROUGHT THE HELP OF THE BENTLY MANUAL AND FROMER VW EXPERTS IDENTIFIED
MOST PIECES TO MY PUZZLE.

ONE OF THE REMAINING UNIDENTIFIED PARTS IS A BOSCH  0 588 099 004.  IT ALSO
HAS THE VW PART NO.  021 131 604.  

DOES ANYONE RECOGNIZE IT?  THE WEB SITES THAT LET ME ENTER PART #S DONT SEEM
TO RECOGNIZE.

IT MAY NOT EVEN BE FOR A BUS AS I HAVE FOUND BUG PARTS IN THE MIX I HAVE.
