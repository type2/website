No, they just TASTE like rubber cement.

Be careful of the thinner, which is called Bestine, if you buy any rubber
cement. The main ingredient in Bestine is normal heptane. Uncountable
numbers of fires and explosions have happened in graphics shops when some
damn fool tried washing his or her light table with Bestine and blew it up.
It's also real good for your kidneys, brain and reproductive organs. (The
health warning goes for the cement too--it also contains heptane.)

OSHA enjoys computer graphics because, so far, no one's yet figured out how
to blow up a light table or dissolve her ovaries with a Macintosh.
