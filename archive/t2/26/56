'79 is a bit of a different animal from '75-78. Best solution is to replace
your left-side heat exchanger with a '79 49-state heat exchanger. (The right
side is the same for '79 in all 50 states, so you can leave it alone.) By
changing this one heat exchanger, you can you can use the '79-83 49-state
exhaust (or, for that matter, a '72-74 exhaust, if emissions were not a
concern).

However, I'd recommend one other modification, now that I think about it.
You have an oxygen sensor on your '79, which was only used on California
models.  Since they are not found on the 49-state busses, the 49-state
exhaust system doesn't have a port for one. Of course you could have a
fitting brazed onto the pipe. But a simpler solution is to use my 22918
catalytic converter ($95), which is the same as the one you have now except
that it already has a suitable 02 sensor fitting built right into it. To use
this cat converter (or your stock California emissions one, for that
matter), you'll need to use an 025 251 053E muffler (usually found on '83-85
Vanagons) instead of the stock '79-83 muffler. It is identical to the '79-83
muffler in every way except for the flange which connects to the cat   I
could substitute this muffler for the stock one in the '79-83 complete kit
for a $15 difference in price.  This scheme would effectively give you a
"49-state" setup, but with a fitting for an 02 sensor, all with
easily-replaced parts, and of good quality.
