Subject: Bay Bus Paints

Does anyone know of a supplier who has paints that match the original
volkswagen colors. I'm looking for small quantities for interior touch up
that will match up later when I have the whole exterior painted. In
particular I am seeking Kansas Beige, Pastel White and that gray/black used
on the dash, steering colum, etc.
