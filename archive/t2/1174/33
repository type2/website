Subject: Clutch geometry question.

Hi Volks,

Last fall, not long before I put the bus aside for the winter, I swapped 
out a noisy 3-rib transmission for a known-good 6-rib unit.

In order to make the swap with the least amount of fuss I used the bell 
housing from the 3-rib transmission and was thus able to continue to use 
my existing starter, flywheel, pressure plate and clutch.

Prior to the swap, the clutch was fine. The cable had broken not too 
long before that, so the replacement was sill in good shape. The clutch 
disk is about 5 years old, so it probably has about 30,000-40,000 miles 
on it.

I am definitely noticing that the clutch seems to be perilously close to 
slipping. But if I loosen the cable, it gets harder to shift into 1st 
gear at a light.

I guess I should have thrown a new disk in the package from the get-go 
while I had it in front of me, but I opted not to since there were no 
issues before that, and I am still planning an eventual watercooled 
conversion that will use a different clutch disk altogether.

Should I keep trying to find the sweet spot on the cable or should I 
just accept the need for another engine drop to make it all right?

Happy Trails,
