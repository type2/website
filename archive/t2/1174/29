Subject: Re: [T2] door latch jammed

With the inside panel off, Can you reach around and raise the lock
button on the door? That would be a good first step. The lock button
has a vertical rod which goes from the button at the window to the
latch assembly.
Pull that rod up from inside the door, or from the button if it works.
If the vertical lock rod has come unattached from the latch assembly,
you will need some finesse to feel where to lift the lever on the
assembly to unlock.

Notice the horizontal bar inside the door. That may have disconnected
on the inside handle, or on the latch assembly. Find out which. Best
case, you could push or pull that horizontal bar to release the latch
and open the door.

Hope this helps some.
