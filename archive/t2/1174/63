Subject: Door seals

I replaced the seals on one of my '70 Westys several years ago, but do not
recall from where I sourced them. They are very high quality, and seal very
well.

My other '70 Westy is all original, even the paint. Those door seals have
shrunk over the years, I am thinking. Even though original, and quite still
soft, and appearing to be good, these seals just do not seal as well as I
might like (wind noise, etc.)

What is the take on best current sourcing for new door seals. - Go with
original OEM design, or has an upgrade been created?

The seals I used for replacement on bus #1 several years back appear to be
slightly thicker, and better design when compared to my #2 bus "original" door
seals.

Comments?
