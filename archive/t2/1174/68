I've bought a lot of stuff from Ron over the years
and the only products I've been disappointed in has been window and door
rubber. I know he buys the best there is but it isn't good enough.

when my windshield was broke Safelight came out with a nice new one but
they brought the wrong rubber gasket, they had one for a vanagon. so I
whipped out the new one I had bought from Ron and three guys sweated over
that for hours (including one older guy who looked like he knew what he
was doing) they could not get that gasket to seat, so finally they had to

use my 30 year old seal which they popped in the first try.
same on a side glass I changed, I fought with that seal, laid it in the
sun all the tricks and finally got it in but I swore I was gonna break the
new glass.

same with door seals fight with em to get em in and then they just never
seem to sit right or seal right. one door I could not get closed no matter

how hard I slammed it, finally took the new seal out and put the old one
back.

was hoping that someone had found a stash of NOS somewhere....
