Subject: massive sink hole

Apparently there has been a bit of catastophe at Doc Rics place..  there was
a small hole just behind the new shop.. and when he went to investigate it..
he parked his Harley ,, and stepped off... and the ground gave way!
They haven't been able to get to the bottom of the hole yet.. but they do
hear sounds that may be Ric banging a rock on the ground.
The hole caused the building to shift! ... they think it is a massive
underground cave!
Is there anyone near Ric that can report back on his condition?
