I have had no trouble finding everything I have needed for a complete
rebuild and rejetting of my Dellorto DRLAs.

CB Performance in USA has jets, and most parts available. Some parts
are not, but that list is small, and I haven't run into it yet.

The only thing I have had to buy from "over the pond" was an
anti-pulse valve from dellorto.co.uk
