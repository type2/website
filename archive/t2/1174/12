These adapters are first rate BTW.  For T1 or or occasional T4 use you could
even use his cheaper 3 arm one if he still sells it.  I'd take one of these
and as he mentions a cheapo $50 local stand (750lb rated fine) for VW use any
day, particularly over a bench mount, which I find very inconvenient (not
being able to roll around.)  You can also notch out a spare T2 bellhousing for
an adapter, but it is inconvenient to do so enough to easily get to the gland
nut/5 crank nuts for tightening.  But I will say, many a light little T1 has
been assembled on a regular old 4 arm stand without the case breaking away,
particularly if it isn't dressed with tin and exhaust on the stand.  But if it
does and it is your case, you sure will be pissed.
