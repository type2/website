Just before John's comment about production scares you off.
Eurocarb Ltd over
on this side of the pond has DRLA (and other Dell'orto and Weber carbs)
spares.
They can also provide advice on jetting and do a bit of VW work.

Mind
you, you'll be paying up the wazoo for some items when you convert from
sterling...

I'll plug DRLA's here for Joel as
MASSIVELY a better carb than any
other/Weber.  Always were, still are, always
cost more in the day.  BUT a
caution and a big BUT, Dellorto of course quit
production long, long ago now
on these.  Didn't get to move to Spain like
Weber did with production...
