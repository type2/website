I've seen a few of those for sale and that's really not a bad price for
them.  I really like them in concept, but they are a bit expensive.  FWIW,
we ended up with a Winnebago Sunstar to take our family of 4 on the road.
 This year the east coast, 2013 cross country via the southern route, and
2014 cross country via the norther route.

A bit more comfortable than my 1968 tin-top camper. And, right now the
Winnebago gets better gas milage than the bus, too.

BTW, I would need to be an actual millionaire to afford a 3,800 sq ft house
here outside of Annapolis, MD.
