Subject: Re: [T2] battery tray for '69 singlecab

Kevin, I'm in the same boat and am cross posting this to VB, cause I've
wondered if the samba single cab tray (particularly the '67 with the 12V
battery depression) works, seems to me somewhere I recall that?

The battery tray on my '69 singlecab is practically not there..

When I looked
online for replacement metal, it appears as though the trays
available are
specifically labeled "not for pickup"
