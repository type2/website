I have a bench mounted engine stand for the T1. I also built the T4 on it,
but became alarmed when the engine would flap around when  I turned it over.
My buddy lent me a regulation engine stand. We just needed to drill a couple
of holes in the arms to line up with the holes on the engine. We used 3"
black iron nipples to make up for the space. It works great!!

Hmmn, when I bought one from him (6-7 years ago?) or so they were drilled
for
use in the stand.  I think he sold 2 versions on *bay back then of the low
level, one drilled one not with a slight premium for being finished, but
this
was before the advent of the 4 or 5 arm versions.  I do see there are 2 guys
on *bay now, so I wonder who mine came from.
