I'd caution that although the 1250 will support more, and is perhaps ever so
slightly more stable, I think as a minor gripe the two forward feet are a pain
to roll around and store compared to one foot with the cross bar, YMMV.  You
can however lift something up onto the stand with a tranny jack with the 2
forward foot one so again +/-.  I have both styles and like the 1000 lb style
shown there better.  In fact for any VW use (including inline 4's, and even
5's) you can probably get by fine with a 750lb.  But you got to watch as some
750's don't have a cross bar on the front wheels, just a 3 wheel tripod
arrangement and they can tip.  Always good for the extra $10-15 though to go
at least 1000lb as who knows what will find its way onto it eventually, at the
moment one of mine has a spare Triumph engine, the other a Chevy 6.5 diesel. 
That ebay 2000lb one is built like most shop cranes, with the folding legs
(which are convenient to store) but is
 real, real overkill unless you are working on big blocks all day every day.
 
As usual though YMMV.  When I bought mine, Advanced or Autozone were $15-20
cheaper than Homedepot though doesn't seem so now online, and Sam's club used
to have a nicer one cheaper as well.  Look for a sale, or as always, they
float around on craigslist all the time often for about half new money.
