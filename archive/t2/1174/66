Subject: Re: [T2] Door seals

God, it is like I'm plugging Ron continuously today, how times have changed...

But I would mention
here, again although this is as good as you can get today Bob, I've never
found any Brazil rubber to fit and seal as well as German, always seems a bit
too dense and hard, maybe they figured it perfect for South America temps and
service 8-)  But after all 10,000's of buses have come from the factory with
them and all so can't be all that wrong.
