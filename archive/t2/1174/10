These cannot safely be used with aircooleds straight out of the box.

Aircooled cases need to have a flat flange to bolt to that spreads the load
across the case.   The typical mounts on standard engine stands can break out
cases once a full dressed motor is hung from them.

Chech thesamba classifieds or eBay for a few folks who sell adaptors.

Also, as chris mentioned - they are low!    Bench height is usually a nicer
level for a Vw engine, so expect to spend a lot of time hunched over or
modifying your stand.    I realized this last night when I finally started
using mine....
