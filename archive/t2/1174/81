Subject: shocks

The more I try to research shock absorbers for my 1976 Westfalia, the more
confused I get. From some sites I get the impression that it's almost
impossible to obtain the proper and best shock anymore. And I don't want to
pay through both nostrils at the same time.   If you can offer any advice I
will appreciate it.
