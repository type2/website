Well, sacriligious to
mention, but probably a fair deal.  Any internet millionaires on the list who
want to come up for an AK vacation, I'd be happy to do a prepurchase
inspection, and you can use our 3800 sq ft log house as a basecamp for your
adventure in exchange for a weekend's use before you drive/ship/boat it back
down.  We are in the scenic Mat-Su valley, yes famous/infamous thanks to Sarah
P.  Great central base of operations for both the Kenai and Denali, and not
bad if you are heading to the Wrangells.
 
May is a beautiful time to come
before it starts raining.
 
Yes I am sort of serious, please buy this camper
and let me use it for a weekend or two 8-)
 
I don't know anything of the
seller except they must be loaded and have nice taste in modern RV's.
 
John
