Subject: cone nut

Hi -
Odd part search department. I'm looking for the square headed cone nut that connects the shift linkage to the shaft in the cone of the transmission on a 1961, although probably a number of years will work. It has a square head, about 6-8mm. fine threads. 1 inch or less in length. the tip is tapered like a cone. Also, the head has a hole through which a safety wire is run.
I will pay good money! At least a dollar, plus shipping--I'm that kind of a guy. 
Anyone can help me out on this I will really appreciate it. Thanks, happyfeder(-at-)yahoo.com
