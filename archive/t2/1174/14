Hmmn, when I bought one from him (6-7 years ago?) or so they were drilled for
use in the stand.  I think he sold 2 versions on *bay back then of the low
level, one drilled one not with a slight premium for being finished, but this
was before the advent of the 4 or 5 arm versions.  I do see there are 2 guys
on *bay now, so I wonder who mine came from.
 
As to the American style stand
height, yeah in some regards they are meant to have some distance of V8
sticking up above.  Something worth mentioning, consider sitting down beside
it, if your parts and tools are all at hand, you can sit for a lot of
assembly.
 
And BTW I'm not even going to knock a $25 EMPI bench style stand
for the totally cheap money.  You can get one or two uses out of it certainly
with a T1, and perhaps even an undressed T4, but it suffers the same problem
as using just 2 arms of an American style stand, only two points of support
(admittedly with small flanges tacked on.)  In some regards, the American
stand is better, because once you finish up the internals and have the short
block together you can put on the other 2 arms and have 4 support points
before you hang the jugs and heads.
 
Like I said YMMV on all this.  First T4
I assembled way back when I just bolted half the case straight into a
workbench with 2 lags and washers to back it up flush under them.  Worked just
great to assemble the shortblock, wasn't spinning much though...

Just plan on spending an evening drilling it to work with your stand - it
doesn't come pre-drilled for the "stop" pin that, nor for a handle.   And it's
pretty thick tube.

I dunno, I'm finding the low height of the
typical engine stand to be very annoying for a VW motor so far.     Debating
switching back to my bench mount, actually.    We'll see how it goes.
