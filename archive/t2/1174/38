Subject: tail lights

So, I found out something,,

the rear tail lights on a 73-79 bay bus came from the factory with a machine
screw thru the lens, and a captive threaded "nut" in the plastic.

but, then somebody started to ship lenses with self tapping screws... that
have a different thread pitch than a machine screw.

once the self tapper gets tightened into the captive nut... the nut breaks
free and isn't sooo captive anymore, it just spins and spins.. with no real
way to undo this ...other than breaking something to get the lens off.

bummer... tiny little thing to pay attention to...
