Subject: Smoke and smell from rear brakes

In Cambria, Calif - putting around in my 74 bus, had to brake a little
harder than usual for a yellow light on Hwy 1. Cloud of smoke behind
the bus! Yucky smell! Stopped and checked and it was coming from my
rear brakes. Stopped smoking immediately bit still smelled yucky right
around the wheel hub.

What could be mis-adjusted to cause my rear pads to burn when stopping
a little more firmly than usual? The pads are new.
