Bob.. that is a VERY good question!
I just got a sliding door seal [seal#1] from BusDepot.. and it is built
wrong..... no doubt about it.,,, well that is the opinion I have
presently....  it is a very nice seal .... but.... here is the story.

I ordered a 211843792B .. and that is what is on the invoice..
I recieved a 211843791B  J10011 sliding door seal type2 aug 67 to may 79
pick location A05-35A 211843791B
http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=214843791B

so,,, in complete puzzlement,, I tried and tried to orient the seal so the
"lips" would match the way the door slides to seal it.
but,, it appears that *maybe* the seal is for a left side door...

as far as I can tell... there is a top, and a bottom to the seal.. they have
the same profile.
there is a front edge,, it has no lip.. but a shoulder for the front of the
door to slide against and seal
this shoulder sort of fills the gap between the front of the door and the B
pillar when it is closed.
this shoulder matches the shape of the front edge of the door..
and.. a rear edge with a lip to fold against the door as the door lands
against it.
BUT,, that lip faces to the rear of the bus..

from my perspective [at this point] ... it only makes sense for that lip to
face the front of the bus..not the rear.. so when the door is sliding
forward and inward,, it folds the lip "properly"

but this seal wants to fold the lip over itself..  ...... I dunno,, I just
don't know!

I think this seal has the back edge glued on inverted, end for end.
That in itself sounds easy to fix.. cut the seal, orient it "correctly" and
reglue it! ...  but it has nice mitred corners.. and when you cut a 45 deg I
am going to loose about 0.500" on both ends., so it ends up being 1"
shorter.... the rubber stretches.. so I just might end up doing this.....
this seal fits the body channel very nicely!  I like this seal,, it has an
issue tho!

ah... then I found another seal in my box of goodies from who knows
where..... this seal#2 has the same profile for the top and bottom ...
nothing different so far.
the front edge has the same shoulder..
and the rear edge has the lip that folds towards the front of the bus!
There is the difference!

should be an eureka moment right??   but alas.. this other seal I have
doesn't fit the channel it resides in as nice as seal#1
it is smaller,, and seems to rattle loosely in the channel. It has a couple
of nics as well...

I can glue it in...  but i really don't want to if I don't have to ... but
it is an option..

so I called and emailed Busdepot..  they say,, left and right door seals are
the same..
the webpage says,,Sliding Door, Left for 211843791B $125.55
and the 211843792B .. right side door $64.95

so.. I read the internet...
google  J10011 and just kampers in austrailia says....
All 4 sides are different profiles as per the original and comes with pre
joined corners. One Piece Construction. Will fit both nearside offside
sliding doors

so... neither seal I have has 4 different profiles......  it sure looks like
3 different profiles to me! top/bottom.. front , rear.

more on the internet..
cip1.ca says something more to confoooooose me!
they use a similar part no,, but not the same....
214 843 791 B ... and they state that is for left side,, right hand drive
vehicle..
211 843 792 B ... they state sliding door seal, RIGHT,, and then note,, We
also now stock the seal for the right sliding door.
http://www.cip1.ca/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=VWC-214-843-791-B
http://www.cip1.ca/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=C24-211-843-792-B
they also state.. These are the best quality replacement right sliding cargo
door seals available. Genuine Volkswagen !
but I don't know what to say ...........


more on the internet..
http://www.airheadparts.com/vintage-vw-parts/sliding-door-seals/seal-sliding-door-right-german-211843792-b-gr

if you look at the corners on this seal... they appear to be molded,, and
then glued to the sides..
where as the ones I have , are mitre corners..

so,, now I seem to have the choice to order a cip1 - C24-2-843-792-B and see
if it is a better seal than Bus Depot.
or from Airhead parts.... as that one looks like the best to me.
or Cut the seal from Busdepot and glue it back in correct orientation..

or.. learn something I don't know!!
