Kevin,

You will need to use two battery trays, cut them and weld them together to
combine them. Use the front half of a '68-'71 battery tray and the rear
half of a split window truck battery tray. It works out quite nicely. The
rear portion of a split window truck battery tray has the correct profile.

Good Luck!
