Subject: Bad CV Axle out of the bos?

Ever heard of a "bad" CV Axle Shaft out of the box. Yes, I did buy this axle
6 years ago for an emergency on the road and finally had a shop install it -
they called me after they put in on to tell me it wouldn't  turn. It was an
Empi brand , I'm sure it was made nowhere near the motherland, I told them
to take it apart to see what's up, they said no, you got another one?  I did
get another one and no problems. I have the old one complete with grease. J 

Is the old "new" one worth anything?
