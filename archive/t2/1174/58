when you have a drum that has a round circle that is say ,, 200mm... and you
have shoes that are made to fit a 100mm drum,, you can see that the tiny
circle of the shoes only contact the large drum in the center of their arc.

there is no pulsing going on,, the round drum isn't warped,, it is round,,
but just toooo large to contact the shoes properly,

or,, the shoes have the wrong arc... and you can machine the shoes to match
the drum... on really large vehicles
hope that helps

the other guess that I might hazard to make,, is sometimes a rust blister
can happen on the shoes, under the lining,, it lifts the lining and creates
that hot spot ,,, which hastens the wear of the shoe ..
