Subject: Re: [T2] Heater pipe ducting on a 79 bus

I have been using 3" (3" OD, 2.25" ID) water heater exhaust pipe from Home
Depot. It is double walled, so naturally insulated. Just cut to size and
sheet-metal screw it into the metal pipes that go through the frames. A
little butyl tape to seal the gaps, tape up any seams with some flashing
tape, zip tie to the shift tube tunnel and bang, done! Any other
insulation, I use the "bubble wrap" style reflective insulation taped and
zip tied to the pipe(s).

Does anyone know where to get some replacement ducting for the smaller 2.1"
