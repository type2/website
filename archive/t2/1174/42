Well Greg, even with me unemployed the wife does well enough and all, so I
can't bitch too much.

But I can't drop $53k on a Westy MBZ either (not that I
would anyway.)  I looked at a US conversion (may have been a Winnie) on a LWB
one 3-4 years ago when still employed and it was quite nice, and was selling
for same sort of money, not quite as nicely finished, but at the time
proportionately newer.  The thing that nearly swayed me was the owner (first)
had documented every single fill up on numerous cross country and 48 to AK and
back trips.  If he kept the cruise at 60-65 mph (which he did) it got an
honest 25-27 mpg on AVERAGE.  He had a couple tanks pushing 30mpg.  And he
towed about 3500lb with it occasionally to boot, with only about a 1-2 mpg
drop.  Stunning, makes one realize why they are popular delivery vehicles.
Frankly the real target audience to me are the idiots (and they are still out
there even in this economy) who would drop $40-50k on a late Vanagon Westy
from some certain famous resellers.  I mean if it ain't a syncro (and they
sell em 2wd at that money) I'd take that MBZ Westy Airstream any day.  Much
nicer than their 90's Class B versions which were just Roadtrek copies, and
not as well developed as Roadtreks.

I've seen a few of those for sale and
that's really not a bad price for them.  I really like them in concept, but
they are a bit expensive.  FWIW, we ended up with a Winnebago Sunstar to take
our family of 4 on the road.  This year the east coast, 2013 cross country via
the southern route, and 2014 cross country via the norther route.
