For my money:

and
http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=211831722DG

with that all
important G at the end.  I presume by thicker you probably used a VW Brazil
seal back when, which if you got it to work as well or miraculously better
than OEM and the door to close completely and easily I really applaud you
Bob.  BD's German seals also have the correct corners, and as I think they
say, no one else does.  But it does cost 4x their Brazil seal.  I guess in
some respects VW did "upgrade" as a running "improvemet" but I presume it was
to improve their bottom line, not the performance of the seal.  I can never
get a Brazil seal to work like the original in this application, but maybe it
is just me...

They sell both as kits with all the other scrapers and seals as
well BTW.  And real German quality outside scrapers are even more important
(less frustrating) to get to fit well.

And as to price, I'd mention that I
distinctly recall paying about $40-45 for an OEM front door seal in the late
80's from the dealer for my '76 at the time, which makes $60 or todays money
seem like a damn bargain.

My other '70 Westy is all original, even the
paint. Those door seals have
shrunk over the years, I am thinking. Even though
original, and quite still
soft, and appearing to be good, these seals just do
not seal as well as I
might like (wind noise, etc.)

What is the take on best
current sourcing for new door seals. - Go with
original OEM design, or has an
upgrade been created?
