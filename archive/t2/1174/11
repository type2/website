These cannot safely be used with aircooleds
straight out of the box.

Aircooled cases need to have a flat flange to bolt
to that spreads the load
across the case.  The typical mounts on standard
engine stands can break out
cases once a full dressed motor is hung from them.
Chech thesamba classifieds or eBay for a few folks who sell adaptors.
