No first hand info but it's overkill which to me makes it a great tool! LOL!

Four wheels - good, three can be tippy.
Adjustable arms so you can adapt them to your VW engine.

24" height sounds kind of low but it would be easy to buy a piece of 
steel stock locally and make the post taller.

I welded up my own engine stand years ago and had more materials 
invested than $80 but it was all the right dimensions for my needs. 
Taller, four steel wheels, etc.

That's a great price b/c Sears wants about $100 more.
