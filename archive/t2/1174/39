Subject: Re: [BP] Clutch geometry question.

Hi Jamie,

I am noticing slipping as the pedal comes to the top. The clutch is fully
engaged at the floor and does not start to engage until it's a few inches
down.
It feels like there may be oil on the disk, it slips a bit as the pedal
comes up but it does come around.

I don't think it's a fork related issue as I didn't have any problem with
the forks before the swap.

Perhaps I need to get brave and just spin it up and burn it in a bit. If
its oil, that will burn it off. If the disk is worn, that will finish it
off. Better to have that happen in the driveway than on a long hill en
route to EveryBus.
