Subject: Re: [T2] massive sink hole

Well, I fell right in that sinkhole.  Seems like I did one year before.  
One day I'll learn.  I never pay attention to the calendar.  When I 
worked on ships all those years, you just couldn't keep track of what 
day it was and it didn't even matter.  Every day was the same.  Just for 
the record, I'm glad nothing bad happened to Doc Ric.   And these days I 
don't even feel like an idiot.  I'm starting to expect to do stupid things.

Ron, I'm going to need two more Hankooks soon.  One of these days I'll 
win the lottery and can afford some Koni's.

I know I haven't been active on the list in a while but I have been 
lurking.  Actually, the Bopmobile is running better than she has in 
years but looking much worse.  I really need to get her in a body shop.

I hope somebody got some enjoyment out of me falling in the sinkhole.  
Ciao everybody....KR
