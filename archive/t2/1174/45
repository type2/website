Subject: battery tray for '69 singlecab

Hey guys,

 

The battery tray on my '69 singlecab is practically not there..

When I looked online for replacement metal, it appears as though the trays
available are specifically labeled "not for pickup"

 

Any suggestions? Am I looking in the wrong spots, or can you use this?
