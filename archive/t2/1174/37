what does "perilously close to slipping" mean?  are you feeling the friction
zone when the pedal is near the floor?
or,, do you have to let the pedal almost all the way up to engage

If you have the cable adj so there is play,, then the disc shouldn't slip,,
unless it is worn out. or the pressure plate is weak or broken.. so.. that
means engine pull time..
or ,, If the throw out shaft is seized, or binding,, and not allowing the
pressure plate to grip the disc...

hmmm,,  when do you notice this slipping feeling?
