Subject: Re: [T2] Smoke and smell from rear brakes

Opened up the rear drivers side wheel hub, and found that a 1/2 strip
on the inner part of the pads (both) had burned, causing the smoke and
smell. Cleaned all the black soot out with carb cleaner, and couldn't
really see why the inner 1/2 inch of the pad would burn while the rest
of both pads were fine. Spin test after brake adjustment had no
binding and free wheel spin. Could this have been caused by the rear
drum brake going out of adjustment? Or perhaps some grease got on the
inner part of the pads.

I'm actually releaved, because I feared the expense of replacing my
master cylinder and booster, under the diagnosis that leaking M.S.
sent brake fluid into the booster, damaging the booster diaphragm,
sending brake fluid through the vacuum line into the intake manifold,
to be burnt by the engine releasing a cloud of smoke.
