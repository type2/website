Subject: RE: [T2] battery tray for '69 singlecab

Great, Just what I was looking for. I've filled out a form online asking for
info on the tray for my application. I'll let you all know what I hear.

 

Do you guys buy directly from him, or through a VW vendor in the US?

I expect Scholfield in GB can supply an original one for you.  You can email
them and let them know what you need.  I've bought many things from them.
