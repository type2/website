Subject: Re: [T2] Door seals

Bob, I've had a couple windshield seals from BD over the years (OEM size and
that bigger lipped one he had at one point) as well as WCM and ?? suppliers
and have never had an issue.  Got to have em real warm of course (in the dryer
in an old pillowcase so the SO doesn't yell,) but I've done em in a 40F garage
more than once.  The bay bus windshield is a tougher install than most even of
it's day due to it's curvature, but is no worse than a '68-72 Chevy truck, or
any 50's-60's wraparound glass.  You may have just had 3 idiots trying, even
the older guy, but on this YMMV.  And sometimes it can take some time/hot days
to sit down perfect.  He has OEM German windshield now in with or without trim
groove if you want to chance it again if that originial is looking real
rough...
 
But for the sliding door alas, just OEM Brazil.
 
John

when my
windshield was broke Safelight came out with a nice new one but they brought
the wrong rubber gasket, they had one for a vanagon. so I whipped out the new
one I had bought from Ron and three guys sweated over that for hours
(including one older guy who looked like he knew what he was doing) they could
not get that gasket to seat, so finally they had to use my 30 year old seal
which they popped in the first try.
same on a side glass I changed, I fought
with that seal, laid it in the sun all the tricks and finally got it in but I
swore I was gonna break the new glass.
