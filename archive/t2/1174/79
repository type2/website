Subject: Re: [T2] calif electronic ignition system

Hi John
I was sort of heading to "no points" so,,, no rubing block to wear out...
sort of maintenance schedule...
I have a dist with some sort of electronic ignition,, I don't think it has
points either..

back to the cali ignition,, sitting in a box at my feet... with a burned up
wiring harness.. and the fairchild ignition module that took the brunt of
the heat and flames....
Karl [RIP]  talked to me until I tried this ignition system .. and then I
had the fire from gas leak!

I have acquired a new ignition module.. and I am pretty sure the dist is
ok...

the coil has a plastic "box" between the terminals..
I just found that is says 211 905 115B ..  so now I can compare that to 211
905 115 D
I think these coils are the same

I think I have enough of the parts to butcher together some new wires... and
give it a try again,,
but I'd love to find one from a wreck ...

Thanks for your help John!
Jamie

Coil is green label Jamie, . Probably can use about any 80s VW coil
actually, golf/jetta/waterboxer/quantum Module wiring is probably pretty
generic for a pre knock sensor VW with the idle stabilizer module as well,
just may have differed in length to things.. Bet a 1.9 waterboxer is damn
close if that helps you  Main thing that changed from car to car was
occasionally the connections on the dizzy, there were (at least) 2 styles.

To me I'd chuck it all and go "points" dizzy with your favorite aftermarket
ignition be that a CDI, Pertronix, Crane, etc. I of course would go CDI
though points as always to be bulletproof and arcane.
