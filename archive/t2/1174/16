Subject: beetle wiring problem

Hi guys!

 

I was reinstalling the dashboard into my late 1973 super beetle when all but
the brown wires fell out of the edge connector for the brake/seatbelt light.
It is one unit. I looked at Bug Me Video's wiring video, but that was no
help. I poured over the schematics in the Bentley book but that was no good
either!!! The connector is numbered 1-8. There is no reference in the
schematic for these numbers. I just want to button the damn thing up so I
can get back to the bus. It's 75 degrees in southern new England today. A
perfect day to be welding on the bus.

 

Does anyone have any references I can look for? OR better yet the colors of
the wires that go to the edge connector?

 

Thanks guys.
