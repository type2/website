Subject: door latch jammed

I have an acquaintance that, in a fit of inspiration, pushed the lock button
down, held the door opening lever on the outside, and slammed her right front
door.  Now the door is jammed shut.  The lever flops around seemingly
disconnected from the latch mechanism, and I have been unable to make any
progress towards opening it.  I did pull off the interior liner but don't see
much in the way of access to the latch. She has been living with this
inconvenience for more than a year.  I must admit in the face of such an idiot
move, I'm not prepared to do anything really invasive, like cutting the door
off and repairing the bodywork, but would like to help if I could. I'm sure
this isn't the first time this has happened.  Does the list have any
suggestions?  Thanks. jon
