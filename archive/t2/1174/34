Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch geometry question.

One thing to rule out is the throwout shaft. Bushing kits are not spendy
and easy to install. Just do check for play in the shaft whenever you have
the tranny out.

Then you must verify the ends of the forks. If they are not dead parrallel
to the clutch it can cause issues similar to what you describe. If wear is
apparent, any machinst can regrind the curve in dead plane and restore the
orginal. Better long term solution than any of the current new repop stuff
from the southern or eastern climes.

There can be some issues with the replacement tranny. Wear inside of forks
and dogs and splines and such, particularly if the problem is with just a
gear or two.
