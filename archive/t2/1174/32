Subject: Chitty Chitty Bang Bang meets a Splittie

My wife and son went to CA for a week, and brought this book back for me - 

 

"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Rides again"

 

I've just started reading it to my son, but the gist of it is an old VW
camper van that gets the engine from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. He is enjoying
it (I think), he is only 6 months old.but never too early to teach him the
beauty of VW's.
