Subject: Re: [T2] Pair of 40D's available - Dellorto Carburetors

I'll plug DRLA's here for Joel as MASSIVELY a better carb than any
other/Weber.  Always were, still are, always cost more in the day.  BUT a
caution and a big BUT, Dellorto of course quit production long, long ago now
on these.  Didn't get to move to Spain like Weber did with production.  Some
thoughts here, out of the performance box a set of 40 DRLA's usually came with
the max size venturi (which I think was 36mm?) which was more sizeable than
what usually came in 40 IDF's.  This would be too big for even a lightly
warmed 2.0 liter.  Would have to be a seriously gone over 2.0 machine to flow
them, or a more moderately tuned 2.2ish, usually out of the box people
compared 40 DRLAs to 44 IDFs.  However there WAS a wide range of venturis and
jets available so you could run these even down to an upright 1600 if you
cared to with little 25mm? venturis and appropriate jets.  Joel might look
down the throat and if OEM the venturi's size will be cast
 or stamped in them which can give one an idea of what these were set up for.
Now I have a set of these on the shelf myself, mostly in case I ever pick up
another 914 or 912E in a moment of stupidity, but I'll also caution that last
time I looked for even a rebuild kit just because mine had been sitting
several years (call CB Performance there was a girl there at CB who was so
smart on these you could tell her your displacement, CR, altitude, and cam/rev
range and she would off the top of her head in 5-10 seconds tell you exactly
what combo of jets an venturi's to run, and it would work) they were getting
hard to find and pricey.  This was about 7-8 years ago, may actually be
better, or perhaps a lot worse today.

Dell's body material was soft an they
also really liked to egg out their throttle bores, so a low mile set does
have solid value IF they are appropriate for you.  Run much smoother an more
driveable than even IDF's, let along compared to IDA's.  Can't beat em with a
stick for a performance application because of the wide range of applications
you could have tuned these for in the day, hell just as good as a Megasquirt,
better in some regards depending on you POV.
