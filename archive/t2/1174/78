Subject: Re: [T2] calif electronic ignition system

Coil is green label Jamie, but specifics beyond that I don't know.   Probably
can use about any 80s VW coil actually, and I likely have a few
golf/jetta/waterboxer/quantum if I can lay hands on them, I'll look.  Module
wiring is probably pretty generic for a pre knock sensor VW with the idle
stabilizer module as well, just may have differed in length to things.  That
unfortunately I don't likely have.  Bet a 1.9 waterboxer is damn close if that
helps you (all this of course not counting the dizzy which would be specific
to your application.)  Main thing that changed from car to car was
occasionally the connections on the dizzy, there were (at least) 2 styles.

To
me I'd chuck it all and go "points" dizzy with your favorite aftermarket
ignition be that a CDI, Pertronix, Crane, etc.  I of course would go CDI
though points as always to be bulletproof and arcane.
