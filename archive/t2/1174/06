There is a sandwich of insulation (presumeably asbestos.)  I agree with Bob
and have made them for years.  I feel the reflective value from a sheet of
1/8" aluminum lightly polished probably washes out vs insulation as a nice
solution.  It is what I do when they become too far gone, you can pop rivet
the original bracket onto said aluminum, if you care can isolate it with
something, and it will last near indefinitely.  Entire thing is about a 30-60
minute project depending on how beautiful you want it.

*not
hard to make a reasonable replacement from sheet stock*

From what I have
heard, these sheilds have a layer of insulation sandwiched
in between the
tin.  There is NO mention of them in Bentley and only
passing reference on the
Samba discussions.
