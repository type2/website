I have owned a 4 arm for years now and love it.  You do have to drill your own
holes for a stop, but if you start with a small bit and work your way up it's
not too bad.  Just go slow and use some lubricant and you should be fine.  I
do 
like it better that way as all the stands are different and it makes for a
custom fit. He also makes this mount that looks interesting.
