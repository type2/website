No pulsing at the brake pedal, but a bit of rear "side drift" under
very-firm sudden braking, which may indicate that one side of the bus
was doing more braking than the other.

I installed new rear drums pads and cylinders on both sides about 6
months ago. Confirmed no fluid leaking from the cylinder in the
suspect drum.
