Subject: Re: Higher MPG for our buses

I seem to recall that Jake Raby reported elsewhere there was a tradeoff
between oil and head temperatures with the 002 and 091 gearboxes. The
higher revs of the 002 decreased head temps and increased oil temps and
vice versa for the lower revving 091 at the same highway speed.

As I have suggested previously the cheapest (free!) ways to improve mpg
are reducing both speed and vehicle weight. Next cheapest is keeping the
engine in tune...

Cheers,

Martin.
