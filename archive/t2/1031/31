<<gone from 18,000 miles a year to about 5,000 a year in my 78 bus >>

And here is the big crime of it all----

The big juice squeezer's are going to prevail , and the exorbitant
prices at the pump is going to put the damper on the wanderlust folks
with the Buses.

Somebody should be thinking on how to make freeway flyer (373, 365, 323
) gear sets available for Type 2's .

Problem is the Buses will have a hell of a time making it up every mole
hill with taller road gearing.

On the flats they'd be good to go--
