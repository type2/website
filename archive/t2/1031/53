I had a similar experience with more of the 50 than 55 mph! Remarkably good
mpg and those behind me got to see more of the countryside! Win-win!

Slow down! When our 78 Westy reached 245,000 orig miles I had to drive
at 50-55 mph to keep it from overheating (lower oil pressure, dirty
engine)....wow, I got 25 mpg going to Everybus! And that's with the big
"mailbox" on the roof rack.
