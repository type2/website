Subject: Re: [T2] Thermostat installation - Type 1 Engine

My '71  bus engine is totally stock, except that, for years, the thermostat   
has been missing.  A few years ago, I saw the light and got the  thermostat  
and 
all associated parts (mounting bracket, link rod,  etc) so I have everything  
I need.  What I can't figure out is  how to install these parts without  
pulling the engine.   Obviously, if there is a way to do this without an  
engine 
pull, that  would be best.  Has anyone ever done this without pulling  the  
engine.

hello Rusty  I am assuming that the flaps and rod aren't there.   Have you 
checked for these?  If they aren't there then you will need to  remove the 
engine.  be sure to support the tranny as 71 was the last year  of the floating 
tranny.  After removing the fanhousing and installing the  flaps and rod and the 
return spring that hooks to the back of the fanhousing and  the cross bar make 
sure it all moves easyly and doesn't bind. When reinstalling  the fanhousing 
the rod goes thur the hole closes to the case and  clylinders.   later  mark  
d.
