Ashamed to admit not keeping my 76 Westy stock with regard to poptop seals. 
Maybe my fix will work on your Sportsmobile.

I went to a big box home building materials store and bought lengths of the 
material used for sealing sectional garage doors.

It is called "Dual Vinyl Garage Door Seal for Top & Sides"  here
http://www.mdteam.com/products.php?category=235,

and  "M-D Building Products 9' Vinyl Garage Door Weatherstrip   Item #: 
61601       Model: 87700"   at Lowes
http://www.lowes.com/lowes/lkn?action=productDetail&productId=61601-81-87700&lpage=none

I drilled about a dozen small holes in each lower edge of the pop top, and 
used short stainless bolts from Ace Hardware, that went through the pop top 
and the solid vinyl slab of the replacement. I kept the bolt heads on the 
inner face, with the nuts on the outer face, with  stainless washers on 
both sides.

The seals can be bought in lengths appropriate for your vehicle.  I used white.

Good for about 7 years, so far, with no signs of aging yet and no problems.
