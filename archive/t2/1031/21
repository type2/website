Subject: Re: [T2] Gasoline Boycotts are Bogus

Don't care if its bogus,
You can make it real if you send millions of email.
I like this idea actually ,  consumers have much more power than they 
think if organize in a large scale.
My only concern is that boycotting Exxon and Mobil must be done in a 
long run, because if we assume these companies will lower their price by 
even 10cents, that would be enough for consumers to buy them gas again 
(I know drivers which would drive more than 10miles to save 10cents/gal).


My other thought is that high gas price means more technology research 
effort for fuel efficiency and fuel alternatives , that is good to fight 
global warming (assuming you are doing it right !)

I think this is worth it, but resistance need to be organized !! ;-)
