Wow! Talk about turning a lemon into lemonade!

I am still curious about the whole water injection bit. I know that our
buses were never meant to be fuel efficient - hell, many of them were built
in a time when 35 MPG was a DREAM... or for trains. Either way, I know we
had one listee that converted himself to water injection as a way to
increase power and improve mileage. I am still excited to hear what the
result of that was.

Just my .25 (recessionary inflation)
