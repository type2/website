You might try Trim-Lok (http://www.trimlok.com/); but there is a 250ft
Minimum order.  I conquered that issue by recruiting some Riviera Conversion
folks to purchase the rest, since each of our vehicles only need about 40'.

I also found decent trim at Camping World (http://www.campingworld.com/ ;
and they can order stuff not on the shelves) but they wanted $40-50 for 25'.
