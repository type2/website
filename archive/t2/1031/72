DANGER WILL ROBINSION!

Numbers like this raise red flags for anyone who knows their
thermodynamics.  Cars tend to be around 25% efficient.  The most efficient
heat engines we have (huge monsters in power plants where weight doesn't
matter) run between 40 and 45% efficient.  Any claim beyond that for a
heat engine has to be put into the "prove it" category because they would
require major revisions to the laws of thermodynamics.

The best possible efficiency of an engine can be determined by the formula

e = (Thot-Tcold)/Thot

where Thot is the input temperature of the engine, Tcold is the
environment temperature, both measured in absolute (kelvin) terms.

Since the environment temperature is fixed, the only way to increase
efficiency is to increase the input temperature.  That is why so much
research is being done on ceramic engines.
