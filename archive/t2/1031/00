   Hydrogen powered cars are a reality...BUT...the big stumbling block is
the generation of hydrogen (and storage)...The "Brown's Gas" generators
that run off your car's charging system are, in effect, just converting the
electrical energy that your alternator/generator is producing to "crack"
water into its constituents, hydrogen and oxygen, and using the combus-
tion in the cylinders to recombine them...You'd be better off just adding 
an electric motor (a hybrid car does this) rather than trying to violate the
second law of thermodynamics...i.e. you can't get more energy out of a
chemical process than you put in...I'd be interested in seeing the results
of these add-on systems and the effects they have on the charging sys-
tem of the cars...

Besides, what happens to that mason jar of water when it drops below
32 degrees...?-(
