I've been working on a writeup-slash-howto with pictures and  
everything but haven't gotten all that far with it; lack of time,  
lack of ambition, lack of time-at-the-computer-without- 
distractions... heh.  I'm about half-done, and the only reason I got  
that far was because I took the laptop with me when I went camping  
with the WetWesties group at Nehalem Bay State Park on the Oregon  
Coast back in February.  No wifi == no internet to distract me from  
writing.

The best I've got online right now is probably my discussion thread  
in the Fuel Injection board at shoptalkforums.com .. there's some  
pictures there, and while there isn't a huge amount of detail in the  
text if you read between the lines a bit and reference some of the  
other CIS conversion threads in there, most of the details should be  
covered.  I've also thrown bits of Linky Goodness in there, sites &  
pages where I've found info & parts that might be useful for other  
people
