The Melrose Street Fair had well over 100+ vehicles of all types, about 4
blocks of just about what ever you wanted really a neat show,  two  VWs
showed up.

 

Shangri La again was great fun. Weather was great super nice cars and people
, hot tub really felt good. One VW showed up, and Bessie won a trophy. The
scope of nice cars and their condition was superb. Bessie our VW camper won
a trophy against some very tough competion.

 

See all of you there next year, uj
