Subject: CIS and hydrogen

Ok guys.. I have done massive amounts of research on this whole  
hydrogen hho deal. Here it is in a nutshell. Gas engines from figures  
i have found are between 18-25% Efficient. Essentially adding the HHO  
to the mix, Changes the burn rate of the gasoline and can bring that  
efficiency average up to between 50%75% Efficiancy. I have been toying  
on doing this with my dual carb system and it all looks good on paper  
and i have made a couple cells with impressive results. in the shop.  
not installed yet, but yes, I have actually been able to produce  
enough hho to light, put through a cutting tip and cut water. it is  
flammible.. and the byproduct is water.. My friend has put one on his  
honda and is now getting between 45-55 miles per gallon. and on cars  
with oxygen sensors, there is more to do than just throw a tube in the  
intake and down the top of the carb or whatever.. you have to fool the  
computer into thinking that air fuel mixture is what it thinks it  
should be, because when you burn the hydroxy as they call it, you  
emissions drop drastically. But yes, I HAVE seen it on a car and  
working. And if you guys are interested in seeing how it works on a  
VW?? Does anyone remember Stanley Meyers...He is who invented the  
technology, and if you look, His first WATER POWERED CAR, was a VW  
Powered Dune Buggy Check out waterpoweredcar.com There is a movie of  
His car RUNNING on water. There are lots of resources there, If you  
look on the left side of the site and click do it yourself  
hydrobooster.. it explains a few things. Now do you guys want to see a  
Finished CIS Injected Bus??? go to my friends page... http://www.rivieraregistry.com 
  Go to the forums... Look for CIS its in there with complete pretty  
much how to do it and all the pictures, Here is a link to Brandons  
other site http://www.zestybus.com He shows pictures there too.. I am  
looking at doing the CIS conversion also.. .Doesnt look super difficult.
