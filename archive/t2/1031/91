I've found my CIS system to be slightly more fuel efficient than the  
Weber ICT carbs that were on the engine before the conversion, with  
far better throttle response.  While this is totally subjective, it  
also feels smoother and seems to have more "pull" when I stomp on the  
skinny pedal.  Additionally, while the MPG isn't spectacular by  
modern standards, it's well within the published figures from VW for  
a fuel-injected Type 2.  I can't speak about troubleshooting being a  
PITA, because I haven't had much *trouble* to *shoot* with it since I  
got it dialed in.  I've also had no trouble with the CIS in our '89  
Cabriolet -- it's been sitting ignored in the carport for the last  
four years, I put a fresh battery in it last week and it fired right  
up no problem .. though the lifters made a horrible clattering for  
awhile.  Guess they bled down sometime between 2004 and now... :lol:
