hello Rusty? I am assuming that the flaps and rod aren't there.?? Have you 
checked for these?? If they aren't there then you will need to? remove the 
engine.? be sure to support the tranny as 71 was the last year? of the floating 
tranny.? After removing the fanhousing and installing the? flaps and rod and the 

return spring that hooks to the back of the fanhousing and? the cross bar make 
sure it all moves easyly and doesn't bind. When reinstalling? the fanhousing 
the rod goes thur the hole closes to the case and? clylinders.?? later? mark? 
d.


Flaps and return spring are there, but the link rod is not.? That's the tough part, as I see it.? Without either pulling the engine or doing some real hardcore engine bay gymnastics, getting the rod and the keeper clip in place looks virtually impossible.

Rusty?
