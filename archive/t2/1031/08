Subject: Re: installing  the window crank regulator-no "howto" in

Yes I saw the only difficult to get to bolt head when you look through 
the slot forward of the post- but I thought that just clamps the holder 
around the base of the pivot at the bottom of the vent window. True that 
it is accessible more by drilling a hole big enough for a 10mm socket to 
get through.  Also thought about cutting that ushaped bracket so one 
could pry it apart enough for clearance.  Then I'd install a "floating" 
bolt locked onto the inner metal panel of the door where the access hole is.

  the cable part behind the bracket the bolt held ??vent window.  but I
  am pretty sure I did not remove the vent window at all.
