It's best to block off the hose openings on the fan shroud so that you don't
lose any much needed air for cooling, especially in the summer time.

EMPI #00-9151-0 from your local VW Parts supplier for the OE Fan Shrouds.

When you get the new heater boxes, juct yank the plugs and reinstall the
hoses.
