=============

I may give that a try.  I had to get pads for the existing calipers anyway, so
I took off the calipers, cleaned them up, and put them back on the bus.  The
right one seems to be freely floating (not locked on the disc) but the left
one is still rubbing a little.  I'll bleed the brakes this weekend and see how
things go.

If things don't work well, I may take the spindles and everything off the 76
and do the swap.

I am still a bit concerned (if anyone saw my post last week) about the small
vacuum on the 1776sp I put in the bus not giving me enough volume for the
vacuum (the vacuum line now is about 1/4 inch and the orginal was about 1/2).
Oh well, one thing at a time.

Thank you all...
