Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Higher MPG for our buses

I have heard a lot about reducing speed to conserve
gasoline, and ya really can't argue that point, but
logic has never stopped me before...

With the Subey I get about 21mpg which is the high end
of what I got with the bus motor.The BEST mileage I
ever got was 24mpg on a tank that I averaged 80mph on.
Not a lie - it actually happened! -BaH

As I have suggested previously the cheapest
(free!) ways to improve mpg
are reducing both speed and vehicle weight. Next
cheapest is keeping the
engine in tune...
