No, they do not.  The bracket/mounting ears are entirely in different
positions, plus a number of other trivial differences.  Output is 90amp
verses your original 55amp.  No go as well for the Air Cooled Vanagon
version (65 amp) for basically the same reasons.

But my late father always said "a big enough hammer, hacksaw and torch, you
can do anything".  More often than not, he did it (aircraft mechanical was
his background) ;-)

For better output, upgrade to the 70amp unit used on 75-79 Westfalias and
optional on regular Buses in that time period.  I believe the pulley maybe
different (I'd have to check), the air exhaust boot is definitely different
(and available from Airhead Parts - search 022903655 on the website), but
the mounting ears are the same.  Voltage Regulator mounted on the engine
wall for either unit is the same, so no change there either.
