Subject: RE: [T2] unable to bleed front brakes - need help!!!

Hi Mark,

My stuff is new (I think) from some company in Italy  - got it through
CIP1.com  I think I will check my rubber brake lines first then the push rod
length - what a pain. I disconnected the lines at the calipers and nothing
came out!! Well, at least I didn't get snowed on today.

 

Rob

hello Rob   You say new master and wheel clys but where did they come from?
new or reman. ??  One of the hardest things nowadays is getting good quality
parts.  I do bench bleed the master clylinders by installing them in a vice
and adding a reservoir for the fluid, then pumping them till nothing but
fluid comes out. I have seen a lot of the cheap master clylinders be bad
