Main seal would cause mixture change.

I always did engine and tranny together. The top bolts
are the buggers. The most recent engine change I built
a new carrier for my ATV stand, this time engine-only
and it was by far the easiest thus far. In the future
I will always remove / install them separately even
though I have always claimed previously that leaving
them joined was easier. I think where I had the
problems pulling them separately when I still had the
T4 motor was the bottom studs. IIRC I finally started
removing the studs as soon as I had a big enough gap
between engine and bell housing to reach the long
nosed vice grips up there. I double nutted to start
them loosening, but it seems to me there is not enough
room to remove them that way - I think I just loosened
them, then removed the double nuts as soon as I could
reach up there and grab the stud.

As far as energy exerted, I suppose it's about a tie.
I have always labored over reinstalling connected
because of the hanger bolts. At least I finally
figured out to put all my socket extensions together
and work from ahead of the tranny to loosen them.

When I built the carriage for the subey/tranny
together, I added a tilt mechanism for after I got the
nose of the tranny attached loosely - then I could
alter the tilt until the top hanger slipped in to
place. Working alone it was still a pain to get those
two bolts though. Not that bad with a partner to raise
& lower the engine.

Good luck. - BaH
