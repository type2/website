   IIRC, VW's numbers for a type 2 were 16-21 mpg (??)...I'm gonna assume
   that VW tuned their engines and were as optomistic as they could be...It's
   just the nature of the beast...A too small air-cooled engine trying to 
push 
   something as aerodynamic as a barn just hasta work too hard to get any
   "modern" mileage numbers... ;-(
