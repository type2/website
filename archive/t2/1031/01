I was wrong. The Guac only ran good that one Saturday. Symptoms came right
back the next morning.

To top it off, the rear main seal has blown. Oil is pouring out of it.

This sounds like a great excuse to pull the engine and trans, do all the
shifter bushings, clutch, bearing (to get rid of the clutch chatter), CVs
(boots are shredded), and replace the seals on the engine. I expect I'll
find whatever is causing my problems during the pull. Another compression
check prior to pulling to give me a baseline.

The paycheck I get on 4/8 will pay for all the parts. The following weekend
will be the pulling. My first shot at pulling the engine and trans as a
unit. Should be fun. (Ok, I lied. NOW </sarcasm>)
