Subject: re: rear-end tent

I actually found a link to someone who makes new ones in Oregon. For 400
bucks, though, I might just finish what I started last summer in trying to sew
my own tent. I've already fabbed the board. Check out the link to the
manufacturer:

and their home page is:

I have no problem sharing the tent pattern once I make my own. BTW - I
discovered that the 14 dollar bug screen you buy to put over a baby play yard
(like a Pack and Play) will fit perfectly over the opening to the rear hatch,
with enough room for the board also. It's just a bug screen, though.
