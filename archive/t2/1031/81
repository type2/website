Subject: Alternators

Do the alternators off a '83 or 84 vanagon watercooled work for a 72-79 bay? is it better output? With all the discussion on the hydrogen set up. what would be a good alternator for this output? Not that the hydrogen unit is worthy or would work... but anyways, how about the alternators off vanagons....
  Thanks guys/ n gals...
