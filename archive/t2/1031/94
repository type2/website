Subject: RE: [T2] rear-end tent

My parents had this on their '77 sunroof deluxe. I have been trying to find
one for years since I sold the bus to a friend 13 years ago (sniff) and the
tent went with it. I never could figure out how it worked, so we never used
it. My Dad said it didn't come with an instruction manual, so it gathered
dust in our attic for years.

The nice thing about them is you can slap it onto the back of any regular
transporter and it extends the storage area and folding seat into a bed.
That way you didn't have to do the "Z-Bed" conversion or start swapping in
Westy parts. Ours came with three cushions, one for the platform, one for
the wheel well(it had a little piece of hardboard to cover the well) and one
for the storage area.

I would love to find one and duplicate it if anyone ever comes across one!

Stef,

Are you looking for the Westfalia rear tent?

Scroll down to "Rear Ender" (sorry, not my choice of words!). I've actually
seen this, but it's been a few years (sorry, Dan!).

Pretty cool device for the station wagons.
