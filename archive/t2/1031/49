im working on my 62 type II Sc. I put on an aftermarket master cyllinder.
the resevoir leaks on the bottom. is there supposed to be a washer that you
install under that plastic resevoir that screw into the master cylinder ?

someone told me it needs a copper crush washer is this true or a rubber one
? or does it need any washer ?

thanks in advance
