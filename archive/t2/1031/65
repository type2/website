Subject: replacing heat exchangers

Hey,

I have a 69 with a type 1 engine and I need to replace the heat 
exchangers (I just dont trust them any anymore).
My Bus came with J-tubes and I was thinking of using them at least for 
the summer until I can afford to get the exchangers.

My question is if I use the j-tubes, what do I do with fresh air that 
normally connects the exchangers?


thanks,

brian
