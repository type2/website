Hi Don,

I find that clutch chatter is usually due to oil on the clutch disk or a 
warped pressure plate, (or both) but not the throw out bearing.

Dropping the engine/trans as a pair is not so bad, but you want to make 
sure to stay safe and have a helper close by... that's a lot of weight 
to be lowering.

Good luck with it,

Happy Trails,
