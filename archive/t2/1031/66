hey Jason Why use CSI system??  last Vw with it was around 1988 , this  makes 
that system 20 years old at least.. A lot of the stuff is NLA. Fuel dizzys  
for one and they tend to go bad if they have been sitting for any length of  
time.  I personally never liked that system and I owned a hand full of  them.  
EFI is much better. Mega squirt would be better.   Water  injection works ,also 
so does hydrogen injection.  later  mark  d
