Last  winter I acquired a Cabriolet that has CIS, and I found that system 
to be  a huge PITA to troubleshoot, and it isn't very fuel efficient,  
either.  When it runs, it runs fine, but when there's a problem with  the 
fuel system I have to send it to a local shop to have it sorted out.  I'd 
strongly recommend L-Jet or Megasquirt over CIS if you want to replace  
your carbs.

Happy Trails,

system being over 20 years old and old used parts just being junk   later  mark
