Aint that the truth... Found that one out the hard way and I *still* don't
have it shifting as cleanly as it did before. I do think though that getting
the bushing replaced threw the rest of my already aged system out of whack.
It was better off with a bunch of crappy parts working in dysfunctional
harmony than it is now with one new one mucking up the old mojo.

Next toy for this summer is a rebuilt tranny and a fully replaced shift
linkage!!!
