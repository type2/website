Subject: Dual Carb Vacuum Hose

While replacing the vacuum hoses on on my '74 Westy I found a small diameter hose about a foot
long running from the right side of the right carb, across the engine toward the left carb and
connected to ... nothing.  I can't find a vacuum hose diagram in any of my books.  Can anyone me
an idea where the left end of the hose should be connected??  The one on the left carb runs to the
silver vacuum can(?) next to the distributor, but I don't see a place to connect this one.

Thanks,
Steve
