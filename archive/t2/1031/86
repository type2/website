Mike -

Your 78 Westy *should* already have the 70amp Alternator, at least every one
of them I've run across for the past 20 years has had one.  But if yer
looking to upgrade further, a competent rebuilder should be able re-wind the
unit for higher output.  But I'm not sure the stock external voltage
regulator would be up to the task of like say, 80 to 90 amps.  It may be
possible to have the rebuilder take a 90amp Wasserboxer Alternator with the
built-in VR and exchange the pulley side of the case with the earlier year
case, then there's making sure the pulley alignment is "true" or you'll be
losing belts  But then again, there's no provision to adequately cool the
unit via the air exhaust elbow used on the Bay Window models.
