Subject: tapping 40mm kadrons for vacuum advance

I'm curious if anyone on the list has tapped, or had their kadrons 
tapped, for vacuum advance.  It seems like there is a blocked off port here:

http://www.benplace.com/kadron/kadron1.jpg

But many people have disputed that location saying that passage is used 
for other purposes while others have said it's not.

Has anyone on the list done this modification?

Thanks!
Mike
