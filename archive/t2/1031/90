Westy *should* already have the 70amp Alternator, at least every oneof them
I've run across for the past 20 years has had one. But if yerlooking to
upgrade further, a competent rebuilder should be able re-wind theunit for
higher output. But I'm not sure the stock external voltageregulator would be
up to the task of like say, 80 to 90 amps. It may bepossible to have the
rebuilder take a 90amp Wasserboxer Alternator with thebuilt-in VR and exchange
the pulley side of the case with the earlier yearcase, then there's making
sure the pulley alignment is "true" or you'll belosing belts But then again,
there's no provision to adequately cool theunit via the air exhaust elbow used
on the Bay Window models.

No, ONLY Canadian buses with the BA-6 heater came stock with a 70 amp
alternator.

All others are 55.

Besides the 70 amp alt, you will need the correct pulley AND fan [unlike the
55, the 70 uses a fan], and back plate, and harness, and cooling tube.

The pulley has been the stumbling block for a LOT of people wanting to do this
swap.......

And the Vanagon alternator has an internal regulator..... not much room for
it.
