hey greg  I find it to be the flywheel needs surfacing along with  motor 
mounts.  I am going to take some pixs of some type4 flywheels as we  surface them 
so that you can see the warpage. just as you can't see it on a  brake drum or 
rotor till you either put it on a cutter or set up a dial  indicator , you can 
not see the warpage on a flywheel just by looking at  it.  I have a peterson 
vertical flywheel grinder that does a great job of  surfacing a flywheel.  do 
not use a brake lathe to do this job as it will  skip over hot spots   later
