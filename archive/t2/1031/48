I wouldn't be too sure about that.  My '75 Westy gets around 15-17mpg  
in town,
and around 21-22mpg on the freeway (as long as the road's flat!).  I  
get that
mileage fairly consistently, so I know it's not a one-time fluke.    
All I do is try
and keep the engine more-or-less tuned up and stay under 75 mph on the
freeway.

Stock '75 002 transaxle, 2.0L TIV engine, CIS injection, LT195/75R14  
tires.
I'm even running kinda rich -- still need to dink with the CPR and  
get the
mixture closer to where it ought to be.
