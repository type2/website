Subject: Re: sportsmobile pop top seal

Is that seal similar to the riviera seal like i have? If so, check http://www.rivieraregistry.com 
  in the forums there is a guy whom is ordering about 250 feet of it.  
selling enough to people per pop top at around 30 bucks a pop, he does  
have pictures in his post.
