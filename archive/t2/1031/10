Subject: [T2] unable to bleed front brakes - need help!!!

Hi Mark,

My stuff is new (I think) from some company in Italy  - got it through
CIP1.com  I think I will check my rubber brake lines first then the push rod
length - what a pain. I disconnected the lines at the calipers and nothing
came out!! Well, at least I didn't get snowed on today.

 

Rob
