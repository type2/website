Subject: Front Shifter Bushing Replacement

I just replaced the front shifter bushing on my '79 and thought I'd 
put this into the archives. Not hard.
I followed the Bentley. Section 6, page 9 & 10.

Mark the shifter assy if you plan to put it back together <g>. Undo 
the two bolts and pull the shifter out. You can see the bushing.
Underneath my bus all the covers are missing so take off what you 
need to find the parts.
Under the bus, find the coupling connector between the front and back 
shaft and take the screw out, it's not too far back, my head was just 
past the front tire. Mine did not have the safety wire, the set screw 
(10mm head) had a spot of plastic lock on it.
Slide the front rod forward to clear the back rod and move it a touch 
to the side.
Go forward and pull the front shaft out of the old bushing. Remove 
the old bushing.
Put the new bushing in and put some grease on it.
Get the front shaft through the new bushing. I had to fiddle with it 
then it slid right in.
Reattach the front shaft to the rear shaft with the coupling ring 
lined up (all 3 holes) and put the set screw in it. Wire it if you 
need to. This was easy

That part is done, I can't off any advice on putting the shifter back together.
