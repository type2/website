Subject: Higher MPG for our buses

To convert this into a bus relevant thread.

Somebody had posted a Gene Berg 5 speed conversion for sale on Samba 
recently which prompted me to go look at Gene Berg's site and read about 
them
His FYI states that a taller 5th was not his intent, but rather a close 
ratio 5 speed and he goes on to say that reducing RPMs at highways speeds 
is bad.

"In my opinion, people who try to install a even higher than stock final 
drive for an air cooled VW are crazy. Our tests have proved conclusively 
over and over again that a higher overdrive causes the engine to get 
"less" mileage, and runs much hotter because the fan turns slower, which 
obviously shortens the life of the engine. Few people stop to think about 
what is actually happening when a higher overdrive is installed. You are 
giving the leverage to the car and taking it away from the engine."

We've had MPG threads before where people talked about what they get in 
their busses. Gear ratio got taller on the later 091 tranny and the engine 
got bigger and FI should make it more efficient, but it seemed the 71s got 
better mileage in general.

Opinions?
Suggestions?

You think grinding off that vertical drip rail on the A-pillar would 
improve aerodynamics? It's always bugged me that it's there but it must be 
there for a reason.
What about a lower air dam?
