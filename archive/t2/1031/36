Subject: Question marks in posts

"""In case anyone was wondering why my posts are full of superfluous? question 
marks, trust me it's that I'm trying to be cute, this is an artifact? caused by 
.aol that I have so far not been able to find a solution for.?? It's annoying 
and I wish I had an answer (other than dumping .aol).?? Happens on other 
lists I partcipate in, also.? If anyone has a suggestion,? please feel free to 
advise off-list.


I have this problem, too, but it seems to be confined to this list.? It is very annoying, but I don't know how to prevent it.? 
If anyone knows how, please advise me off list as well.
Thanks,
Greg
