Larry,

Oil ratings work like this:

SAE            - test standard of the Society of Automotive Engineers
first number   - viscosity at room temperature
W (if present) - winter rated (viscosity index has been modified so that
                 it thickens less at low temps)
second number  - viscosity at high temperature (200F, I believe)

That being said, you need:

<20 at 0F
~20-30 at 70F
 40-50 above 200F

In DC, I used to run 20W-50 year round.  This summer I went to straight
50W and was happier with it.  I will go back to 20W50 for the winter,
tho. You can't run 30 weight in the summer... it is too thin.  You can't
run 50 weight in the winter, it is too thick.  You *should* be able to run
20W-50 year round, but it seems that the viscosity improvers break down at
high temps, leaving you with unmodified oil.  I.E.  a 20W-50 will, at
high temps and over time, break down to a 20W oil, which is fine in
winter, but too thin in the summer.

It is a very "religious arguement", tho.  Lots of firmly held opinions out
there.
