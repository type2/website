Subject: bus door seals

Were there originally door seals both on the door itself (which is what
everyone sells) and also around the door opening too?  There is a thin channel
that would seem to accept some sort of pressed in seal or flocking.  Does
anyone have any clues about what this is or if its available?  Look at this
picture for a similar type seal:

I have a 71 bus and it appears to at least have had something that ran along
the bottom edge of the door opening.
