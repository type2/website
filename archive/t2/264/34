I've got the same in-out problem but will less play and no clunk yet.
Hopefully it will be the last major neglected item I have to deal with for a
while.

Why didn't anyone grease those things when the service called for it! Oh
wait, that was me. My bad.

So Steve, How hard is this?

Looking at the Bentley exploded diagram it seems that one could do this with
the housing still on the vehicle.  You seem to imply it's the best way:

- remove axle nut
- disconnect cv joint
- drive out stub axle
- drive in new bearings
- reassemble and swear all the way to 253 ft. lbs.

Accurate?
