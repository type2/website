Subject: ball joints/time

Just to let everyone know, the shop doing this, specializes in older VW's.  
Ball joints, so far, has taken at least 16 hours.  Told me it took 2 days to 
do them.  Also put in a new directional switch, rear light socket, mounted 2 
tires, and put on a set of wiper blades.  I traded him a brand new pressure 
plate, and a used 70 bus tranny, with axles, and cv's.  I am being charged 
close to 500 with my trades.  Seems a little pricey.  Told me the ball 
joints took a long time.  But 16 hours?
This shop is very well known here in Vermont, but I do not think I will be 
recommending them any time soon.    Gripe off!
