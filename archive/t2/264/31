We use hydraulic pressure to push it out.  Pack the cavity behind the 
bearing with grease and drive a ( your chose, we use socket, solid 
shaft, old input shaft, etc. ) solid fitting device ( no holes for the 
grease to get out } into the hole where the shaft would fit, sometimes 
you have to add more grease.  We have used this on very large pilot bearing.
