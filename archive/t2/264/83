You might consider the set of circlip pliers pictured here:

Brand: STAHLWILLE
these are Item # 908 99 999 at http:///www.samstagsales.com
Description: RJ Germany 4 Piece Snap Ring Plier Set
on "SALE!" for $53.82

I purchased this set w/ the idea that it would work on the rearbearing circlip.  I have never had a chance to try them, but the tools appear to be high quality circlip pliers.  The four piece set includes 2 inner & 2 outer pliers.

Hope this helps,
