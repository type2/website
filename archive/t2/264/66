Chuck and Bradley,

Here ya go.  http://www.shockwaverider.com/78busdoor/sdoor-063.jpg

Shot is a little fuzzy...kinda like me at 6:15am, but you should be
able to see everything.  Only non stock part there is the white
tie wrap holding the rusty spring at the center.  The original part
died and this was the alternative.

If you need a better pic, please let me know...I do much better taking
pics in the afternoon<grin>.

Cheers, dave
