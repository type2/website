dino oil gets thinner as it gets hotter, synthetic doesn't anywhere near
as much if at all.

wheeh I won't let mine get that hot, at 230 I slow down, at 240 I drive at
55 at 250 I pull over under a tree and open the engine comp door and run
at a fast idle in neutral or park

not wrong for Dino oil, synthetic operates under different rules....the
heat resistance of synthetic is one of it's greatest advantages
