Wow!  This sounds remarkably similar to my experience with a '79 bus.
I've had months of problems after replacing my heads (the lobotomy just
wouldn't take!)  Anyway... my latest problem has been idling low problems
due to vacuum leak (just as described above).

This past weekend, I replaced the 4 manifold runner boots and the gaskets
which joins the head to the runners.  In fact, one was cracked.  "Yeah!",
I thought, "this is the source of my damn vac leak!"  Nope.  Still same
problems.

Are the '71 gaskets different from the '79 ones?  Mine seem to be solid
material with paper gaskets stuck to both sides.  Do I need to follow some
prep work on this?  Is there supposed to be a rubber gasket, too?

Aack!  Thpt!  How do I track down this leak?  I've done the "cork the air
intakes" trick.  I've replaced: all the small vac hoses, FI gaskets, and
parts mentioned above.  What about the oil breather?  Could this be the
source of a leak?  Is the breather itself supposed to have some gasket on
it?
