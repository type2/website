Subject: Re:faulty new condensor?

Glen,
    Yep, it's possible to get a bad condenser.   Many years ago, while
we still had our "77 passenger bus, I promised our boys a trip to
Sesame Place.  The week before our planned outing I did a full tune
up, changed the oil and adjusted the valves all in preperation for the
many miles we'd drive to the park.   The bus ran fine all week.  On
the appointed day we left the house early and headed west to get off
of Long Island.  Going through New York city the bus started running
bad, backfiring, bucking and lacking power.  I got off the hi-way and
shut it down.  I was pretty sure it was the condenser, but did you
ever try to find a FLAPS in Coney Island at 6AM on a Sunday morning?
No luck!  We took the train home, got the other car and towed the bus
home.  A trip to my local Flaps for a new consdenser had the bus
running fine in minutes.  I gave the bad condenser to my sons and they
beat it to pieces for ruining their day.
Of course there is a bright side to all this too.  It's one of those
things that we still talk about to this day.  Come to think of it, our
sons have a few storys from growing up with a bus as the family car
:-)
