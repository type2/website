Subject: Re: [T2] What is the diff

It is a common belief that busses from '72-'79 had type 4 engines, but they
are really a type 2 engine.

Only type 4 vehicles such as the 411 and 412 used type 4 engines, but in
order to make the distinction easier, people would refer to the "pancake"
type 2 engine as a type 4.  It is true that they both use many of the same
style parts, but check the part numbers on individual pieces and you will
see they were made for the type 2.

I remember one old german mechanic that would get very upset and correct you
when refering to a late bay engine as a type 4.

Kind of like calling westy folding beds "Z beds" which they are not.
