Subject: Remove axle from CV Joint

"When the only tool you have is a big hammer, you tend to view every problem 
as a nail."

1) Pile 3 or 4 tires/rims on top of each other (flat), and under this pile, 
have something soft.

2) Axle (with the 1 or 2 CV joints attached, less the circlip and the boot 
pushed to the center) goes down the center of the 3 or 4 tires/rims.

3)  Two pieces of wood lay flat against the tires/rims, touching the axle 
and supporting the CV joint at the inner "thing".

4)  Place a third board (hardwood preferred, hickory the tradition choice, 
ash will suit, but oak is just too common to do a good job) over the axle 
protruding from the CV Joint.

5)  Apply 45 pounds of torque with a big hammer.  Whack, whack, whack.

6)  Stop after two whacks if the axle slides off the CV Joint down thru the 
3 or 4 tires/rims onto the soft thing at the bottom.

7)  Stop after one whack if the axle with CV Joint breaks through the 3 or 4 
tires/rims pile because you choose to use some 3mm paneling you just 
happened to have hanging around the shop, and thought you would be a wise 
(-at-)55 because I didn't specify the two pieces of wood as succinctly as the 
third.

8)  Stop BEFORE the first whack if you subscribe to the DM philosophy.

9)  Continue to examine your mechanical ignition switch for procedures that 
could be followed to get at the key wafers so you can help Barry re-key the 
'new' ignition switch he is expecting to get from Marcus S(anonymous) (local 
guy made good => left the Washington DC area [before he got shot in a drive 
by], to see parts of Europe and decided the place to be was here.)
