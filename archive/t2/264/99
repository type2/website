Subject: Stupid question about dealers.

     I'm seeing allot of posts about dealer parts.  Does this mean that 
dealers still stock some of the parts for older VWs?  I can actually walk in 
to my local VW dealership and say "Can you still get a rear brake drum for 
my 1974 VW bus" and not sound like a loon?  I didn't know dealers/VW still 
had parts available for such old/antique vehicles.  Are there prices stupid 
high like they are for new car parts or are they comparable to a bus-depot 
or busboys?
