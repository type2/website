There really isn't a spec, but I find that they develop more and more play
as time goes on and that you are at about the point where replacement is
in the cards.  If your hub/stub axle has *any* front/back or up/down
play... it is shot and needs replacement now!

It's the inner (ball) bearing wearing out.

There is no adjustment. It's *barely* possible that regreasing will help,
but as much work as it is to get to them, replacement is the only option
in my book.

Yup.  'Fraid this is the job you face.

Tough beasts, ain't they?  I went ~1,000 mi on a loose axle nut before Dr.
Tim figured out what it was.  Then drove south, had the nut loosen again
around Fresno, and drove on to LA.  Replaced the bearings there and it
turned out the race for the outer bering was split across its face.

Believe it. There is no adjustment possible.

Nope.  I found Bentley to be just fine. The only real sticking point is
getting the stub axle out and now that I have the big puller, even that is
not a problem any more.

1971-1992 are all the same.  The only difference between the V'gon and the
bay is that the bearing housing on the V'gon comes off, so you can do it
on the bench (a HUGE advantage!!!)
