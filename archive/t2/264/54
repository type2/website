author unknown
1.7 Series
Part Number Engine Valve Sizes, intake x exhaust, mm Notes
021-101-371J 1700 39.3 x 33 Some had breather pipe or CHT sensor fitting for
carb. vehicles; some also had EGR holes by intake ports.
021-101-371Q 1700 39.3 x 33
021-101-372 1700 39.3 x 33

The 1.7 heads can be interchanged with 1.8/2.0 cylinders. It will be
necessary to machine the head opening to match the larger cylinder end.

1.8/2.0 Series
Part Number Engine Valve Sizes, intake x exhaust, mm Notes
021-101-371H 1800 41 x 34
or
39.3 x 34 f.i. models had the smaller valve sizes; some had EGR holes; some
had CHT sensor
021-101-371S 1800 41 x 34   or   39.3 x 34
022-101-372G 2000 37.5 x 33 CHT sensor on one side; sodium filled exhaust
valves
071-101-371A 2000 37.5 x 33 The "Vanagon" head; exhaust ports not compatible
with earlier exhaust systems or most aftermarket exhausts.
071-101-371B 2000 37.5 x 33
039-101-371A 2000 42 x 36 The highly desired 914 head; easily identified by
3-intake port studs; steeper spark plug angle. Generally believed to be the
best starting point for highest HP.
