(forwarded back to the list, I'll post the results too)

okay, this is what i'm going to try...

if air is blowing out of it, I'm going to connect it to one of the two
inlets on the underside of the right air cleaner arm.

if air is being sucked into it, I'm going hook it up the the mystery
hose in question #4

I might do this as a last resort, i feel better now knowing that
somebody else did it without ill effects.

yes, i found a recent post not yet in the archive archives) from
someone named Benoit, and the folks responding to his post said the
same thing.  sounds like a consensus!

yes... see #1 and #2

yeah, except the branch and dangling hose is mentioned by at least two
other people in the archives... and nobody seems to know what it is.

there is a picture of it in the Bentley manual... Section 7, page 18,
figure 9-2, item #11 (do i sound like a lawyer?).  the fat hose is
listed as going to the brake servo, but the skinny hose at the "Y"
isn't labeled.

now.. in the bentley manual, section 3, page 27, figure 7.3, item #8
says "to brake servo."  item #5 is labled as simply "solenoid operated
vacuum valve."  on page 51 (fig 2.9) of Haynes, a similar diagram
lables it as a "two way valve," again leading to the brake servo...

so maybe if i hook up question #4's mystery hose to question #1's
valve, I'll kill two birds with one stone?

i just wish Haynes, Bentley, and others would call the parts by the
same name, then I could proceed with certainty...  :-/
