Subject: 1979 Rear Wheel Bearings?  HELP!

Hi Folks,

I've been noticing a ~CLUNK~ type noise coming from the right-rear of my 
1979 Westy when I go over bumps, and checked it out yesterday.  I pulled off 
the wheel and unbolted the brake drum, and was able to move the stub axle 
in-and-out about 1/8" by hand.  That would explain the ~CLUNK~ noise!

Obviously, it's something to do with the bearings, but what?  Do they just 
need repacking with grease and readjusting?  Or, do I need to remove the 
entire assembly and replace the seals and bearings?  It has been doing this 
for about 3,000 miles.

I believe one can't adjust rear bearings the same way one can adjust the 
front.  In addition, I helped a friend with his sag correction and rear 
bearing replacement on his '71, and agree with the general consensus that 
Bentley is a pretty poor resource for this job.  Does anybody know of a 
better resource?  My friend will be helping me, but I'm sure that '71 is 
different from '79.

Thanks for any help or suggestions.
