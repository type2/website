I Personally ALWAYS replace the cold start valve, but then I had a car
fire (412) due to a faulty cold start valve, seems they can/do fail in the
on position and dump so much fuel into the intake that a fire is almost
inevitable.   Those were the stock units and at some point they were
changed to ones that fail "off" but I know of no easy way to know which
one is installed so I just swap in a known new one that fails "off"
