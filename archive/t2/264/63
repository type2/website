Subject: Re: [T2] REQ: pictures of sliding door mechanism

Hey Chuck,

I too am looking for some pictures and or a diagram.  I posted something 
six weeks or so ago and got no response.

I have found out by fool'n around the the "spring" needs just a little 
tension on it to make the rear latch work.  I have jury-rigged a short 
piece or wire cable to a wire tie in the center of the door to provide 
the necessary tension so it work.
  If this is all too confusing let me know and I'll email you directly 
some pictures of what my door looks like.

Either way keep  me in the loop if someone sends pictures, I would love 
to see how it is suppose to be done.
