Karl,

Whoa!  Yes/No...I didn't actually measure these as I was standing in a 
used car lot without a measuring tape.

I didn't mean to infer that they were exactlly the same, but by golly, 
close enough to be able to order a part that I can always trim.

The point here is that the *rubber* that I ordered can be trimmed!

Longer and taller might be really good for my bay as it looked
short to me anyway(the old piece).  

They also ordered the back "bumper" piece for me also.

The bad part will be if the thickness of the frames themselves are 
different where the rubber needs to fit.  This is why I only ordered for 
one side....I will take my old one with me tomorrow when I pick it up and 
compare them.

If this works though, then everyone with sliders can at least get some new 
rubber in them...even if they have to trim a little off the ends!

I stand corrected, dave<grin>
