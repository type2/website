Subject: Re: [T2] 1979 Rear Wheel Bearings? HELP!

I replaced the rear bearings on my 70 and 77 vans following Muir. I did it 
with out removing the bearing housing as outlined in Bentley.  This allowed 
me to drive out the stub axel with a fiber hammer and brass drift. Bentley 
is a good resource but it assumes you have VW shop tools.

It has been many miles ago but as I remember I tapped the inter races out 
with a drift and in with a wood tool and a large socket from a Harbor 
Freight 3/4" metric set.

I pulled the seals with a hooked brake tool and drove the new ones in with a 
wooden tool.

If you helped pull a 71 bearing you know you need a healthy inside Circlip 
puller. I bought mine at NAPA. The 70 had two Circlips the 77 only hade an 
inside bearing Circlip.

It took awhile.
