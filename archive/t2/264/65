Subject: Re: [T2] Kermit comes home.

I have a hand-crochetted "Kermit" on my desk.. (a nifty yard sale find) and
my mascot from my working days out on the road. Kermy is also my Windows XP
desktop logo! :0)  Kermy is such a "mensch". He helped raise my little girl,
for which I will be eternally grateful. (God bless you, Jim Hensen).
Every now and then I see one of these green buses, and I've been wondering
when I would finally see one named, "Kermit". That day has come!
