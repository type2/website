Subject: Unconfused about oil weight

Larry,
    George Lyle responded to your question by saying..."That manual
was printed 31 years ago, and oil technology has marched on quite a
bit."   How true that is, here's what my latest copy of the offical
service manual  calls for in the way of oil viscosities.
100        80        60        40        20        zero        -20
degrees F
** SAE 40**
                   ***SAE 30***
                                            20W20
                                                *SAE 10W*
                    *** SAE 20W50 ***
                    *** SAE 20W40 ***
                    ***** SAE 15W50 ***
                    ***** SAE 15W40 ***
                                   *** SAE 10W40***
                                   *** SAE 10W30***
                                                       *SAE 5W20**
And now to quote the manual..."The table lists the proper oil
viscocity for VW engines under specific climatic conditions.  The
viscosity SAE number of the oil should be selected for the lowest
anticipated temperature at which engine starting will be
required.....Because the temperature ranges of the different oil
grades overlap, brief variations in outside temperatures are no cause
for alarm"

Now all that being said let me say this.  I live just east of you , on
Long Island and also have a '71.  In the dead of winter I use 10W30,
spring and fall I use 20W50, and in the heat of summer I switch to
straight 40 weight.  The reason for the straight weight in summer is
that the polymers used to make up the multiweight oils tend to break
down at the high temps our engines can run at, or at least that's my
understanding.
