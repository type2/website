The way I was taught this was:

The designation ending in "W" gives you a viscosity range at low
temperature (something like -30C) on a standard (ASTM D5293) testing
machine.

The designation not ending in "W" gives you a viscosity range at high
temperature (something like 100C) on a different standard (ASTM D445)
testing machine.

The two numbers are simply designators, not actual measurements, and they
cannot be compared to each other.

Oils with a "W" designation usually have viscosity modifiers that give
them a flatter viscosity/temperature curve, but this isn't always the
case.
