Subject: 1979 Rear Wheel Bearings!!

Hi Folks,

Thanks for all the info on the bearing replacement.  It sounds like it'll be 
quite a job, but I feel better having the good karma of the mighty List on 
my side.  I'm stocking up on metal and wooden drifts, and a pair of circlip 
pliers is on my list of Stuff to Get as well.

Given the high PITA-factor of this job, it seems like some enterprising VW 
parts retailer could offer a complete bearing carrier with new bearings and 
seals and even a new stub axle; kinda like the front torsion arms with the 
ball joints pressed in.  That way, you could unbolt the old carrier and bolt 
in the new one -- no sub-axle-driving, circlip-swearing, 
inner-bearing-drifting, or re-greasing.  You'd still have to deal with the 
axle nut and brake backing plate, but that just keeps things interesting.

Thanks again, and I'll keep you all posted when the job is done.
