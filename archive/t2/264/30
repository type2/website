I've been running synthetic in all my vehicles since 1976 or so (71 bus

I'm also using Mobil 15W50  (recently switched from now discontinued
Pennzoil 5W-50)

hmmmm, I used dino oil in my rebuilt engine break in and did a test day
before/day after switching from dino back to synthetic  and I got almost
no change in readings of presure and temp.  maybe ever so sligtly lower
temps

I would chalk it up more to the weather change

remember the synthetic is less thick and flows easier than dino oil,
consider the fact that it "always flows" at a 15W rating.  but lubes at a
50 or so sayeth Mobil.

keep an eye on it, my presure stays high even when hot too so that also
helps
