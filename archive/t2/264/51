Subject: Split 'da case

So I got a long block from Dolan that wouldn't move a bit. After
running around with it in the back of my bus for a few months after
HCBF I decided to tear it down & take a look. Well it appears that the
#4 main rod bearing has seized on the crank. I have not split a case
before, but I think I know what the answer is. I'm assuming it's not
just as easy as unbolting it like normal & letting the pistons slide
through. Seems like someone mentioned that the webbing would get in
the way. Can someone confirm this?

Also, any suggestions on getting this case split. The bearing is stuck
so the piston is at the lowest point of it's travel, therefore
effectively making it impossible for me to get to the wrist pin &
remove the piston. Any/all suggestions welcome.
