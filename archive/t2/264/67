Subject: headlight chrome ring question

Folks,

I have two different kinds of chrome headlight rings on my 78 and need to 
know which is the correct one.

The passenger side is metal with a hella part number 11-941-175A
The drivers side is plastic with a KOA? part number of 211-941-177

Cheers, dave
