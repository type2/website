And again I say:  No way, no how.

I have both bay and Vanagon sliders outside, so I measured them. [Instead of
giving 'about' figures]

Measuring the outside frame where the seal rests around the edge end to end
[length]:
Vanagon = 41 3/4"
Bay = 41 1/4"
Vanagon is 1/2" longer.

Measuring top to bottom [height]:
Vanagon = 16"
Bay = 14 1/2"
Vanagon is 1 1/2" taller.

Measuring the center post where it meets the frame:
Vanagon = 15 1/4"
Bay = 13 3/4"
[same 1 1/2"]

WCM outer seal part #:
Vanagon = 253-8411
Bay = 241-321A-L/R

The only part of a Vanagon slider that may work on a Bay slider would be the
felt on the center post.......
