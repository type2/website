Subject: Synthetic oil

(Whew! I sure am glad somebody else started the oil thread this time. ;-)

Anyhow, I just switched from 20W50 kendall dino oil to Mobil ! 15W50 full
synthetic. I seem to be reading slightly lower oil pressure, both at idle
and when cruising at 55-60. The weather has begun to get milder finally;
today's high was around 85 with high humidity. At 200F oil temps running at
55 I get a pressure reading of 30 - 35 psi. [This is on an 1800 with Weber
carb at 21K miles.] With the Kandall I was seeing pressures 5 - 10 psi
higher. Cold start pressuers are similarly lower. No changes made at all
except the oil.  Has anyone else experienced this sort of reading when
switching to synthetic oil?

Just when I thought I had this oil stuff figured out!
