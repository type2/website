Subject: Oil viscosity versus oil temperature

The recent thread about viscosity brought a nagging question back to mind.

Oil flow through the cooler is basically regulated by oil viscosity.  When
the viscosity is high, it doesn't flow through the cooler well, raising
pressure until the bypass valve is opened, allowing oil to flow directly
to the bearings.  As the oil warms, its viscosity drops, making it flow
easier and allowing the bypass valve to close.

My thought (theory only) is that thicker oils will keep the bypass valve
open for a longer period, requiring higher oil temperatures to thin the
oil enough to allow it to flow through the cooler.  Higher viscosity oil
might just be the cause of increased oil temps!

Of course, if the bypass valve is fully closed early on in the warming
process (say at 120F oil temp) it wouldn't make any difference at higher
temps.

Does anyone have data relating operating temperature to a change in oil
visosity?  It might not be such a good idea to run 20W50 in summer!
