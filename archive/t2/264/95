Mark,

Yes, I know the value of new, but the starters I have gotten from
Autozone in the past 4 years(have 6 vw's) are all still turning fine.

They also say "Bosch" on them and were rebuilds.

They also have a "lifetime" guarantee.

First thing you have posted in a long time that I gotta 
disagree with!<grin>

Cheers, dave
