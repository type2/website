Subject: Re: [T2] compression and vacuum reading

They are related but it's not as simple as a direct relationship.  For example vacuum is affected by the intake tract (throttle, manifolds, ports, etc.) while compression is not.  Low compression will, however cause somewhat lower vacuum readings, all else being equal.
