I don't remember the answer to that one.  I removed my smog equipment over ten years ago.

Yes, I blocked off the egr ports on the manifolds when I did this.  Believe it or not, I made the blockoff plates out of scraps of wood (I was living in an apartment at the time) and, with a homemade gasket underneath they lasted until I removed the carbs (about 8 years).

Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I think that goes to one of the outlets listed below in #3.

I think one goes to #2 above and the other goes to a vacuum source.  Which vacuum source I couldn't tell you but it ought to be in a book somewhere.

Sounds like a non-stock item.  I've never seen such a thing on a bus.
