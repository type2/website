Subject: Re: [T2] more on heaters

That's not going to heat a bus very well, the South Wind bus heaters are
20,000 BTU, the under dash models are 13,000 BTU.  Even the bug style South
Winds are 13,000.  Check out ebay, buy a South Wind, then get the parts and
rebuild it.  Gas heaters are no harder to work on than a carb and just like
a carb, you need to be sure and replace the fuel lines.

I started working on the South Wind heaters in the early '70s and have never
seen one that was every on fire, but I've seen PLENTY of VW's that had been
at one time (or more).  Many people will say gas heaters are a fire hazard,
but none have ever been able to produce a burn't South Wind heater other
than ones in engine bays where the engine caught on fire.

I've got all the tune up parts and NOS manuals for the South Winds at:
