Richard,

I order some parts for my sliding window day before yesterday from the 
local vw house.

They have changed ownership lately and started supporting all of the 
local vintage vw events lately....even free t-shirts at the big 
Eureka springs show in August.

They let me look thru the EKTA electronic catalog for the parts that 
I needed....sure enough, the little pastic slider came up as NLA, but the 
rubber that I needed *was* listed.

He ordered it and said it should be here in 3 days.  We will see if
it actually shows and is the right thing.  He said that if it was listed
on the EKTA stuff, then they should be able to get it.

I was in luck cause I ordered it from a 81 vangon parts list rather than 
the 78 bus parts list.  Sliding windows were the same when I looked at
an 81 last weekend.

Maybe some things *are* possible!

Cheers, dave

He offered to give it to me when it's replaced but he doesn't know when that will be (maybe Dec?) and I'm sure he will throw it out before he remembers the promise he made.
