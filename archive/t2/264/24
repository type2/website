Subject: REQ: pictures of sliding door mechanism

Hello-

I need some pics (or really talented ascii diagram) to aid the 
re-assembly of my 78 Bus.

What I need now is a picture showing how the springy thing attached to 
the rear-mounted latch on the sliding door relates to the cable that 
connects the latch with the handle.  All of this jazz is located under 
the interior panel.  The pics in Bentley show an older model with two 
cables (oh, dear- do I need two & have I misplaced one?), but doesn't 
show the big springy thing, which apparently serves to take up the slack 
from the latch release cable.

Thanks.

-Chuck
