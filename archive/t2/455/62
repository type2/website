Subject: High Idle after removing EGR..WHY?

Yesterday I removed the EGR valve and successfully placed a block off plate
over the remaining hole. Today, when I started HER up.. I noticed the idle was
really high (1200). I could close the idle screw completely and it still
wouldn't lower it enough. Does anybody know why this is?...And is there
anything I can do about it? Plus, the idle oscillates about 200 rpm between
high and low. I'm surprised by the affects of removing the EGR system. Note:
It's a 1980 FI that never had a crossbar exhaust set up and my EGR filter was
holey and the adjusting rod was defective. Reason for removing my EGR system.
I can't tell if I have a vacuum leak somewhere by the throttle body or if it's
just the sound of air flowing through it. I disconnected the lines and made
changes to the hose connections by cutting off the tips and re-inserting them
back. Still have the same noises. I know for a fact that my block off plate is
sealed shut. Please help...I have a Widespread Panic show to get to tomorrow
night.
What are the problems of running idle at 1200 range?
