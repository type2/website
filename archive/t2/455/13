Subject: Re: [T2] door rubber really tight

Meg,

Yes, it will relax over time.  Mine are still pretty tight to
close, but it is also a funtion of the air tightness of the rest of the 
bus.

I can hardly get mine closed with all the windows closed and with the
sliding door glass open about 5", it will blow a *lot* of air at you
when you close the door.

Otherwise, just some time!

Chers, dave
