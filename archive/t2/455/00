Subject: clutch pedal groan

My 73 Westy seems to have a dry clutch pedal that moans and sticks when releasing, making it hard and jumpy to get started!  I located the "pivot joint" (for lack of better term) where the cable connects to the pedal arm and greased it as much as I could- to no avail.  It does it more when the engine is on, seeminly just due to the pressure. The entire clutch is new and the cable looks clear, lubricated, and unsobstructed.  Any similar problems and/or (hopefully) solutions?
