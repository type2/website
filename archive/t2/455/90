A shot of PB Blaster, then take a medium screwdriver and use the business 
end to tap-tap-tap all around the perimeter a hundred times, 'nother shot 
of penetrant, more tap-tap-tapping. It just may come loose. If not, get a 
90 degree hook scribe and try to force it under the copper at various 
points around. Once you get it to move a hair, work it back and forth and 
it will become looser and looser and move more and more until you can get a 
good grip and force it cattywampus and out.

Get a giant flat file. Push it across the two header pipe openings that 
seat against the copper gasket. Get a flat and parallel file image??? No?? 
Continue stroking until you do. I always watch for files at garage sales. 
If I see one of a size or shape or type I don't have, I pick it up. Must 
have 30 files of great variety, including one 18" long of raspy nature that 
I use for this particular application. I'm sure I paid chump change for it. 
Didn't know what I might use it for at the time, just that it would quite 
evidently do some jobs better than anything else. I would hate to have to 
go down to Lowe's and pay 30+ discount dollars for a new Nicholson like that.
