Filth under the bearing on that case half when assembled. Poor bearing 
tolerance during manufacture. Case warp. Sleight bend in cam shaft. A valve 
spring with way over spec strength, or installed height too short. All just 
guessing at possible causes. I would measure that cam journal for out of 
round wear. Evidence of poor lubrication and overheating points to case 
warp. Out of round journal would point to valve spring over strength issue.
