Hi Volks,

Just a reminder that the United Empire Loyalists Fall Colours Tour is 
coming up in just over a week. The nights are getting cooler now and 
the leaves are just starting to turn. By next weekend it should be 
truly spectacular. If you are interested in attending, please let me 
know so I can have maps on hand for everyone.

There is no charge for this tour because nothing is included. Please 
bring your bus fully prepped and ready for a 2-day 600 mile excursion.


For lots more information, please visit the tour website:

PLEASE NOTE:  THIS TOUR IS  **WEATHER PERMITTING**.
If weather conditions require a cancellation the decision will be 
determined by 6PM Friday October 3rd.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
