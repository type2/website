Subject: door rubber really tight

Hi,

We put in new door seals (German ones from Bus Depot because they were
suppose to be the best fit) the door is soooo tight. It closed and when
you open it, it pops open. I was looking for advice if this is a problem
or will the rubber relax (lack of better description) with age. Have
others had this problem and there solutions?

Thanks in advance for the help:-)

Peace
