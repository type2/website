Subject: Sink/Fridge Unit for 1970 Westy

Hi folks:

I friend looked at a local bus here in Sacramento today which had no 
sink or kitchen cabinet.  Unlike mine Bus, with the kitchenette down 
the driver's side, this Bus used to have the Sink/Fridge/Stove behind 
the seats.  My friend wonders, if he buys this Bus, how hard would it 
be to find the kitchen unit and what would he call it when speaking 
to Bus enthusiasts?

Thanks,

BEN
