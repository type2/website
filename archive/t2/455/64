73 Westy...
How do the windshield squirters work.. someone told me they were pneumatic and there is no electric motor, is this true?
Mine do not work, the tank holds H2O and all hoses are unclogged and present. Should there be a noise when you pull back the trigger? Any suggestions? Sorry if I sound like a dumb-a$%!
