Yah, I searched for "oil + breather + hose", and I saw this reply to a 
message of yours:

...but had a hard time finding anything conclusive.  In any case, I 
found a suitably molded and sized-close-enough radiator hose at my 
local parts store, which I'm going to trim and use as an interim 
solution.  Obviously, I would like to find one that is oil resistant, 
but I couldn't think of any harm that could come from using a radiator 
hose temporarily.  I'll probably call Buslab on Monday and ask if they 
have a source for this part.
