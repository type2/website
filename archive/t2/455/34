I am thinking of pumping the special liquid used by model airplanes into the
exhaust tialpipe with an electric pump.
They used it on the nitro powered model engines to make smoke, but I don't
know if I could make it copius enough for effect.
I'd love to say "activate smoke screen!", and produce a detering, but not
dangerous effect, don't need them too close AND blind./
OR A SKUNK SMELL SPRAYER.
I have been using the down to 40mph here we go method.

The 50 caliber on the roof rack is an option, but I need a sunroof bus for
that.

Slow down to a crawl ;-)

It's the quickest way to get them off your butt.
