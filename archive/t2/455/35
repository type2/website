Subject: Tapping a Case for Full Flow

Volks,

I'm getting ready to tap my type-1 engine case for the return line on 
a full flow oil filter system.  

I am under the impression that the place to tap the case is in the rear 
(RIR, what you look at when you open the hatch) of the engine on the left 
side, just under the dizzy, where there's a little circular nub.

The one you can kinda see here: http://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/75814.jpg
(random engine image from the samba).

Is that it, or should I be tapping the case somewhere else?

thanks,
  t
