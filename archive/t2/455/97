Yah, the vacuum hose on the decel valve goes to a tee which connects it 
to the intake air distributor vacuum port, fuel pressure regulator, EGR 
valve, and retard port on the distributor.

Hm, any advice for getting that thing out?  I can get to the screw on 
the rear of the throttle, but the one on the firewall side looks 
virtually inaccessible (along with the screw on the clamp on the bottom 
end of the throttle boot, grump).  You'd think that when people put 
clamps on hoses, they'd orient the clamp to make sure the screws are 
accessible from the hatch.

BTW, underneath the bottom throttle boot clamp, there seems to be a 
wire plug similar to the injector wire plugs.  Is this sensor output 
from the throttle?
