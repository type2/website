Subject: on the road again :)

Hello all,
I want to say thanks for the assistance and support of fellow listees in
getting my bus back up and running.  I would also like to thank my local
FLAPS, Bow Wow Autoparts for their patience with my all questions and parts
exchanges. I ran the bus on the road for the first time since the engine and
tranny rebuild today.  I had to fiddle with the shift gate to get 3rd/4rth,
(it's now difficult finding reverse but I'll get it right yet, otherwise the
gearbox feels great when shifting).  I'm afraid to add up all my bills, but
after the dust settled I am into the engine/gearbox overhaul for at least
$2300 Cdn. This includes new clutch kit, P&C's, Hydraulic cam and lifters
and all those little pieces plus new hoses, Ignition wires etc., but with
self overhauled heads (new exhaust guides and valves along with a helicoil
and fly cut) and my free '74 exhaust system...the straitened German muffler
appears to work great.

I have some minor problems still to iron out.  My turn signals stopped
working, but the hazard flashers still work...I'm sure that they share the
same relay, all I get from the turn signal lever is a steady indicator light
in the dash (left and right) and nothing from the lights themselves.  Any
ideas?  Also, does anyone have a picture of the clutch cable routing forward
by the front axle beam?  While the bus was up on the ramps I noticed that it
isn't sheathed here forward of the front axle beam where it comes out from
the pedal and it is rubbing against the frame and a wire harness (not worn
through it yet).  I'm wondering if something is missing or mis-routed.  When
running today, I'm now concerned if the engine is running too warm.  The tin
air flaps are open (the torsion spring holding them full open when the
thermostat is fully expanded) but it feels awfully warm in the engine
compartment. My new Cylinder Head Temp gauge is indicating about 310 degrees
F on the highway at 55 mph, but my new VDO oil temp sensor isn't installed
yet as the thread of the sensor appears to be different from the thread
pitch of the plug hole.  The oil sump is quite warm to the touch, I'll see
if I can mount a thermometer somewhere for the time being.

Cheers,
Drew
