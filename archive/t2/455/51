Subject: New bus accessories?

In my boredom i bought some things because i thought they'd work well 
for my bus (in the eventuality that i get another, as mine is currently 
across the country with a broken beam).

The first thing i got was air compressors from a Ford lumbar seat.  I 
have three of them.  They're small twelve volt  compressors that i 
figure could be connected to the wiper reservoir with a switch on the 
dash, so that if i need a bit more pressure, i can just run the 
compressor for a few seconds.  I'm sure there's some other uses, but i 
can't think of them right now.  Pretty sure they aren't big enough to 
inflate a tire.

The other thing i got was a set of motors that the seller said were from 
a vibrating bed.  They are also twelve volt, and there are eight of 
them.  They aren't very large, but i'm thinking, for cross country 
trips, if some of those were attached to my driver's seat, it might be 
like having a massage chair right in the van, and i wouldn't have to 
wait for the feeling to return to my butt while pumping gas. 

Anyway, it's just a thought.  What do you think?
