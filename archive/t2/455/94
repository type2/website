Subject: Re: [T2] door rubber really tight

Hiya All,

I'm getting into this thread a little on the late side so if I repeat or omit 
something cut me a little slack.

I too had tight fitting door seals.  Got 'em from my FLAPS.  West Coast 
Metric stuff.  I was surprised at the poor fit given WCM's reputation for good 
rubber.  I gave Ron Salmon a call and he set me straight.  Seems that WCM both 
manufactures and imports their products.  The door seals were Brazillian 
aftermarket imports.  Not so hot.  And remember, Ron is a WCM dealer, so I was 
thinking this guy is giving me the straight shot.

Anyway, Ron recommended going with VW Brazil seals.  Said they'd be a good 
fit.  I ordered 'em out, and they fit like a glove.

The lesson I learned?  Before I buy any kind of body seals I talk to Ron 
Salmon.  The man knows what he's talking about.
