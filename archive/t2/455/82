Subject: stuck exhaust gasket

Hello,

I am in the process of tracking down and exhaust leak.  After removing my 
heater boxes, I had one exhaust gasket that would not come out of the head. 
(The round copper gaskets between the heat exchanger and the head.)  I have 
tried to pry it out with a pocket knife and a small screwdriver blade bent 
at a right angle, but it will not budge.  I am avoiding using too much force 
because I do not want to damage the exhaust port.  I was able to remove the 
other 3 gaskets with my fingers. Any ideas about how I could get this out?  
I am stuck until I do.  (This was after breaking off, extracting and 
replacing one of the exhaust studs on the other head, always a pleasure.)  I 
am still at a loss to explain the exhaust leak.  My heater boxes look fine 
and the muffler had already been replaced.  The gaskets showed no signs of 
warpage or damage.  Thanks for the help,

-James
