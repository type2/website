Ryan:

If *all* you did was remove the EGR and then replace it with a block off
plate, and now you have high idle, then I'd guess you haven't really blocked
off the hole in the air distribution box where the EGR used to sit.  Air
leak = high idle.  Or, maybe you knocked off a nearby hose, like the one of
the hoses that attaches to the fuel pressure regulator or decel valve?

I think the biggest issue with running a high idle due to a leak somewhere
is that you're "leaning out" the fuel mixture, which can be a problem.
