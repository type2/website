i am proud, too. my 6-year old daughter has helped me rebuild every engine i
have done in the past 1 1/2 years (3 and counting). i mean it, she actually
helps for real. she is especially good at using the torque wrench on low
settings. so much so that she asked me a few months ago if she could have a
torque wrench - she has her own collection of tools starting up. i told her
she could have one if she could tell me what a torque wrench is used for.
she told me exactly, "dad, it is so you don't make the bolts too tight or
too loose", so now my little girl has my sears torque wrench, and i have an
excuse to buy myself a snap-on...

cool.
