Subject: Re: [T2] clutch pedal groan

My 73 Westy seems to have a dry clutch pedal that moans and sticks when 
releasing, making it hard and jumpy to get started!  I located the "pivot 
joint" (for lack of better term) where the cable connects to the pedal arm 
and greased it as much as I could- to no avail.  It does it more when the 
engine is on, seeminly just due to the pressure. The entire clutch is new 
and the cable looks clear, lubricated, and unsobstructed.  Any similar 
problems and/or (hopefully) solutions?

Check your bowden tube's angle, and how secure it is attatched to the trans. 
  The other thing to check is the T/O bearing crosshaftwelds and bushings.
