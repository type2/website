Subject: Bus Haiku: Another Silly Friday Idea

Hi Volks,

I just got this in from another bus list I'm on, and since it's Friday 
I had to share.

> My fuel pump, a Haiku
>    By Adam
>
> Falling leaves on hatch,
> The smell of gas flows through me
> Rebuild or replace?

Anyone else want to share some culturally uplifting prose today?

Happy trails,
