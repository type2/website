Subject: Re: [T2] squirters

On the passenger side under the dash is the washer bottle and it should have
an air line dangling from it. You pump the bottle up using air pressure.
BUT, dont exceed the maximum PSI or you will be sorry, it should be marked
on the bottle, I dont recall the PSI off hand.

Beetles and 914's (for sure) use the pressure from the spare tire to
maintain the internal bottle pressure, but then you have to always check the
pressure on the spare or you could be left stranded...

When you pull the handle, you should hear nothing.

Ofcourse, this is only applicable if your system is stock.
