Happy Friday!
I'm looking for a chrome front air vent screen (grill?) for my 73 Westy.  Anyone know where to find one for sure?  If not, where to get it done in Riverside, So-Cal area or anywhere in So-Cal.  Does anyone have a chromed grill or is this rare?  I don't seem to see any and I just want to match my headlight rings.
