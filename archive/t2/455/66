Subject: Re: [T2] Ebay Scam alert, BEWARE!

Actually I have the current price list here in my lap--and their is a
guy selling Mllre's at E-Bay--with free shipping, that is selling them
cheaper than a "sale price" is here locally---no tax--no shipping
charges.
I think it's a good deal--

The only thing I would be worried about is--if in fact the welder your
buying is a current model--and what doe you do if there is a warrantee
issue--ship it back to the seller?

This is a time consuming headache--so I feel for the couple extra bucks
you'd spend at home--it is woth it, eliminating the possible hassle .
