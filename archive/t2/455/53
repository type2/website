Subject: What kind of 72' camper do I have??

I originally thought I had a Riviera conversion b/c of the style of the pop
top, but.....
The interior furniture doesn't seem to match up with various pictures I have
seen of these models.  I don't have access to a camera at the moment but
here is a brief description:

Straight up pop top w/ the yellow plastic canvas material. Manila colored
front vinyl seats as well as the same on the foldout bench & rear cushion.
A fold up table that sits flat along the drivers side wall when not in use,
the panel below the foldout bench has spring loaded roller clips on the
sides and it is hinged on the floor in order to open downward.  There is a
jump seat behind the drivers side seat and a small fridge in a nice cabinet
behind the passenger front seat.  The finish is a nice glossy wood veneer
with occasional vinyl padded trim in spots.  The curtains have buttons that
fit into plastic holders on the runners above the windows and the two side
median windows are sliders and not the louvered style.  The closet is on the
passengers side and that whole piece extends back to the rear door and has
some side cupboard space but no covers for the openings.

I would love to know if this a stock conversion or not b/c if it isn't
someone did some very nice work to the inside of this at one time.
