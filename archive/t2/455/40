Within the trades there are fewer and fewer craftsmen. When the tradesman 
fails, only a craftsman can pick up the slack. Typically, if you are a 
craftsman, but charging trade prices, you need to find another craft, or 
learn to sell the extreme extra value of good craftsmanship. The older 
these Buses get, the more craftsmanship will be needed to keep them as 
functional as the original design. At some point, we may need a craftsman 
welder to add metal to a worn spindle NLA, then a craftsman machinist to 
turn it to true spec, then a craftsman mechanic to put it back together 
with an original brake cylinder re-sleeved by the craftsman machinist and 
generic seals custom fit by the craftsman mechanic, cause the tradesmen of 
world make new cylinders that have a ridiculous half life that only a 
tradesman would agree to install.

More and more, tradesman=inconsistent results, craftsmanship as 
always=insured results.
