Subject: Hill Starting...

Hey Robt or anyone else on the list..

I have had to start my bus with a push sometimes, popping the clutch, but I
never heard about not to use 1st  gear to do so. Why shouldn't one use 1st
gear when push-starting, or hill starting?

 

Was Writ:

"Absent any hill for a rolling start, a suitable vehicle is not always on
hand to tow you on the flat till you can switch on the ignition at c.10mph,
drop the clutch in 3rd gear (arguably 2nd; please, not 1st), declutch as
soon as the motor fires, and then change into neutral when the engine gets
going."
