Subject: Re: Rear sealt belt mounts

We have a 78 camper.  The 3 point seatbelt must be lifted over the back 
of the seat and then put over your shoulder.  To keep it from slipping 
down, an anchor slot can be fabricated for the bed back  to slip the 
belt over. In busses with headrests on permanent seats the belt could be 
tied in someway to the headrest?
