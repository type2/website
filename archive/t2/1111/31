Subject: 034 distributors

Ok guys; here comes another distributor question.

Samba has a "HOT-SPARK" ad for a 034 SVDA with electronic must assume both are
Chinese.
They also sell a Bosch 034 also with electronic but once again not a
Pertronix.

Have a 1800 type 4 with a baby cam from Web and a 009 electronic Pertronix but
I am thinking of changing to get rid of the flat spot.

Any feedback on the "Hot-Spark" distributors?
Other than a real 205 distributor timed at 5 ATDC, will the 034 really help?
Is anybody running the 034 and like it or dislike it?

Thanks,

Tom
