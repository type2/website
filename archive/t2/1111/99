I would hope so, too, because intermittent problems are the *worst* to 
track down.

Start with a can of starting fluid and spray it into the intake - if it 
kicks and runs for a few seconds, then at least you know your ignition 
is good.  Then I'd check for the usual suspects - dirty contacts 
(injectors, ECU plug, etc), fuel pump running, injectors firing.

I can't remember on the L-Jet if there's a way to trigger the injectors 
by grounding the tach line or applying +12v.. maybe someone else can 
clue us in.  I think it would be grounding the tach line because that's 
essentially what the points are doing.  I would tap that tach line to 
ground (I think it was ground) to fire the injectors once or twice to 
make sure they were working.  If you have injectors firing and it kicks 
over with starter fluid, my guess would be lack of fuel pressure.  You 
might also refer to the bosch EFI troubleshooting manual which I believe 
is posted either on type2 or ratwell.  Also follow along with the 
standard troubleshooting procedures in the bentley.  Good luck and keep 
us posted!
