Seriously, you're going to spend more time setting up and fussing with 
the remote starter than using a crescent wrench or box-end wrench on the 
alternator.

Point the rotor at #1 and adjust the #1 valves.  Then rotate the crank 
COUNTERCLOCKWISE 'till the rotor turns 90 degrees and adjust #2, then 3, 
then 4.

Or like I mentioned in another post, two turns of the crank and your done:

Point the rotor at the #1 firing position (the mark on the distributor). 
  Now adjust the 3 front-most valves (towards the front of the car) on 
the passenger side and then the 1 rearmost valve on the driver's side. 
More specifically, this would be valves 1e, 1i, 2i, 4e.

Rotate the crank until the rotor points 180 degrees from where it was 
(pointing at the #3 firing position).  Now adjust the 3 front-most 
valves on the driver's side and the 1 rearmost valve on the passenger 
side (3e, 3i, 4i, 2e).

This should take you all of about 20 minutes.

A trick I posted to the list a long time ago is a drum brake tool.  It 
is hands-down the best tool for lowering and raising the spring bail:

You just put the hook in facing down and close the handle and "walk" the 
bail down.  To raise it, hook it up underneath the bail and close the 
handle and it'll pull it back up.  Totally useless for our drum brakes, 
but truly amazing for valve cover spring bails :)
