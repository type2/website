> Any feedback on the "Hot-Spark" distributors?

I had a hot spark in my 78 bus, for a few days. I measured the coil, and it 
did not need the ballast resistor that it came with free, I did no feel like 
putting another wire on there, and giving it a tacky look. So I was cruising 
along on an important work trip, and the bus started loosing power, it 
limped to the closest parking spot.  An hour later I came back to it, and 
tried to start it, nope, tested fuel pressure, trouble shot the fuel 
injection system, spark (nope) spare distributor not under seat, still on 
the work bench as I put the HOT SPARK in,  and decided to walk home and come 
back later.  Brought the pickup truck, and a tow dolly back. It fired up, 
and pulled it on, towed it home. Started it up and it ran fine, left it 
running for 10 minutes, and it died.
Note this was the day after I put the HOT SPARK kit in.  Waited a few hours 
and it fired up again, and ran for 15 minutes, and no spark on continued 
cranking. New part new problem, points went back in, and the piece of 
crap(my opinion) want to be petronix back to the sales man.  This was when 
they were just hitting the market, so they might be better?

never again.

my 2 cents
