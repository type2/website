	 Good thinking 99 !  Sounds like the start of an argument for 
leaving a 31mm socket indwelling, forard of the forardest hole in the 
tin.  This metal would normally reside in a rubber socket-holder, ID 
30mm, suitably self-tapper'd into ...  ?

	Alternatively, the socket could be a snug fit, or even 
welded, on the 30mm nut.  In this speculation, the rear of the socket 
would be ground to a face-cam; minimally, 2 'verticals' & the 
corresponding 2 'ramps'.  No ratchet or freewheel needed, that way 
...
