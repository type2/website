As others have said, they are the seat belt mount points. I am guessing
that you want the rear seat belt for the baby? I am in Australia and to
fit a baby seat you need a lap (or lap sash) belt and an anchor point
mounted behind the seat that anchors the top edge of the seat. For
babies it is the seat that is anchored and then the baby is strapped to
the seat. I would check your local regs. The baby seats here all come
with the required anchor which you can install yourself. To stop it
ripping through the sheet metal it has a 2 inch washer.

I fitted the baby seat to the centre rear seat as it is safer than the
outer positions.

I would get a new seat belt rather than a second hand one from the
wreckers. They are easy to get and relatively cheap.
