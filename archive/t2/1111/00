Also, just be aware that you'll be adjusting your valves in reverse 
order (4-3-2-1) as the engine cranks over clockwise when you're looking 
at it from the back.  If you do it using the alternator nut (which is 
probably the way most people do it), then you can spin it 
counter-clockwise and adjust the valves in the order 1-2-3-4.  Also, 
won't make any difference if the plugs are in or out; if you turn it 
slowly the air will leak past the rings.
