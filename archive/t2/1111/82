Subject: Does anyone make a CDI unit anymore that's not crazy

I was researching CDI units like the old universal corp Tiger CdI which is
NLA, and could hardly find ANY except for 250-300 dollars outrageous way cool
rev limiter racing type of stuff. Who makes just a bonehead simple CDI like
the old Tiger unit that isn't ridiculously overpriced? I guess I could make my
own, but sourcing the components is getting tougher these days. Radio Shack no
longer exists in Canada etc etc.
