Regarding Weber sensitivity, my experience is that when using a carb,
you only have to match a fuel pump made for a carb - a pump that runs
in the low pressure range.

I've run a lot of Webers and a lot of fuel pumps, and while
theoretically aware of the problem, have never experienced it, and
have never used a pressure regulator, though I own one just in case I
come across a carb that needs it.

If you are smelling fuel, the first thing is to isolate the source.
Check fuel tank vent lines and filler tube and neck. Some of the tanks
of that era also have a central fuel overflow return line from the
filler neck. The elbow is usually cracked and hard to find. Some
vendors know about it and others don't.

Check the usual places, verifying good fuel hoses from the tank to the
carb with no leaks. Pop the top of the carb to see if the fuel level
is too high. Check for leaking accelerator pump diaphragm. Run a
pressure test on the fuel pump just for grins.

About it for now...

  My German mechanic (who swears that Solex is immaculate) admitted defeat,
 but not before selling me & installing a new Brosol fuel pump, which one
 might hope to be vaguely compatible with the carb made in the same country
 for the same motor.
        It seems to be agreed all around that Webers are very sensitive,
 delicate, or touchy wrt fuel pressure presented to their float chamber
 needle valve, viz.  3 psig max.

        Any ideas please?
