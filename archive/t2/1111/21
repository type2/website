Subject: sensitive Weber

	I'm reluctant to abandon the dreaded Brasilian Weber 30, 
especially since the only alternative I have to hand is the probably 
even more dreaded Solex 34 PICT-3.  But I keep smelling petrol, which 
always makes me nervous.  My German mechanic (who swears that Solex 
is immaculate) admitted defeat, but not before selling me & 
installing a new Brosol fuel pump, which one might hope to be vaguely 
compatible with the carb made in the same country for the same motor.
	It seems to be agreed all around that Webers are very 
sensitive, delicate, or touchy wrt fuel pressure presented to their 
float chamber needle valve, viz.  3 psig max.

	Any ideas please?
