Subject: Re: [WetWesties] Stock starter wiring and a hard start relay

The wire coming from Terminal 87 on the relay (with 1/4" push-on) goes to
the push-on male terminal on the solenoid known as Terminal 50 in the 1978
Bus track wiring diagram in Bentley.

On the opposite side of the solenoid should be another male terminal also
called Terminal 50 that the small Red/White wire goes to.  That wire goes
from the starter solenoid to Terminal 86a on the Fuel Injection Double Relay
to "tell" the FI Fuel Pump to run during "start mode". On newer solenoids
installed on the latest Bosch Rebuilts do not have the extra male terminal,
but has a double male terminal to accomodate both wires.

If the solenoid has only one male terminal (an older solenoid installed on a
later starter [it happens]), then a "piggyback" 2 into one terminal is then
used to join these two wires.

That huge Red Wire is mostly likely for the gas heater, as suspected.
Hope this helps.  When I drew this many years ago, it was with Bugs, Ghias
and non fuel injected Buses in mind.  I suppose I could update the drawing
somewhere down the road.

Oh, and BTW, it's oldvolkshome.com not oldvolkshome.net
