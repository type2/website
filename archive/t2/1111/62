Subject: Re: [T2] Talking about bump starting

the downside of fuel injection- you need at least 9 volts to run the 
electronics/injectors.  If your battery is low on capacity (drops really 
fast under cranking conditions) you could jump start a FI bus if it 
reads at least 9 volts before you push it.  So if you hear that dreaded 
e-e-r-r  e-e-r-r at the starter in your FI bus, stop and push it!  The 
air intake through the AFM will pull the flapper open to let the fuel 
pump run if ignition is on.

start by
  bumpstarting? I'm just wondering about enough electricity to fire the
  injectors etc. Wouldn't you have to get it up to a fairly quick roll?
