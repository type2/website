>So what's a "hoon"?

	Ah  -   sorry  -  we've stumbled upon one of the Australasian 
terms which apparently has not yet become universal.

'Hoon' means approx.
		hooligan
		relatively mild antisocial behaviour in public
		wanton noise to annoy people, but poised to claim no 
violation of law
		defective or deliberately noisy exhaust system
		tendency to rip down fences when drunk
		probable past involvement with rorty flathead V8s 
(before the fuel got too pricey)

and ... (as Stan Freberg would have put it) ...  like that.


>  Anything like a "loon"?

	No implication of insanity is involved  -  just inconsiderate 
disregard for public order & peace.

	It is not a very pejorative term.  For instance, many of us 
call a hoon one of our much-loved endemic birds, the tui, which 
revels in waiting till you're tramping (that's 'hiking') along a 
quiet stretch of forest track, and building up speed quietly to come 
rocketing from behind over your shoulder to give you a fright.
