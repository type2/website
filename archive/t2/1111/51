Quoth Robt Mann:

	I'll use this as an excuse to plug anew for restoring the
good old-fashioned crank handle.  My '73 Devon has an alternator (I
think as early as any country got that advance) but no slot to poke
in a crank.  I miss it, and hope to restore it.

Hellz yeah!

Another layer of practicality to an already most practical means of  
conveyance.
