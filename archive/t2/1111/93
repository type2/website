Subject: RE: [T2] Hill starting

 >My Dad told me years ago to put it in 2nd gear because it will roll better
while starting. Like when my bus stalls and I pop the clutch in 1st gear I
will chirp the tires, in 2nd I won't. I also  consider available distance and
speed when determing the gear to put it in.

After getting a push to the start of a long hill in a 1995 car, I discovered
that roll starting doesn't work for modern vehicles! I presume they need 12 V
to get the electronics going. At least I had less distance to walk... I have
only had to roll start the bus once when I was fortunately on a hill. Works a
treat! I was also told to put it in a higher gear otherwise you tend to lock
up the wheels rather than turn over the engine. Another thing to remember is
that there is no vacuum for the brakes when the engine isn't going.
