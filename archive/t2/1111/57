Subject: RE: [T2] Hill starting

My Dad told me years ago to put it in 2nd gear because it will roll better while starting. Like when my bus stalls and I pop the clutch in 1st gear I will chirp the tires, in 2nd I won't. I also  consider available distance and speed when determing the gear to put it in.
