Subject: [T2] What Have You Done For Your Bus Lately?

My bus work so far is to prep for Everybus. This year that included a 
new TRW steering box from BusDepot, which I had installed by a local 
shop, since I don't own a puller for the steering arm and I don't have a 
warm dry place to do the work. I also had them adjust the rear brakes 
while it was there.

Driving home I noticed that the brake light would flicker on 
occasionally but it would go away and stay out for a good while as soon 
as I touched the pedal. A couple minutes would go by before it happened 
again. I guess I will check the fluid level in the morning when it's 
light out.

Sure was nice to have that tight steering back again. The bus has needed 
this for a long time but I always kept putting it off and putting it off....

Next thing it will need is a new muffler; the one that's on there is 
starting to crack at the seam near where the 3-4 input pipe attaches. 
But holy crap when did the price of good German mufflers go nuts? Last 
time I looked they were around $200 and now they're $300? I thought the 
rising Canadian $$$ would work in my favour but I guess not.

Happy Trails,
