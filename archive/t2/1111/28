two things I always hated about my VW's from my first 59 up to present. 
and that was adjusting points and adjusting valves.

the first was taken care of by a crane fireball ignition and the second by 
hydralic lifters.

two greatest inventions in for me in keeping me busing.....

thet crane can go on any bus, and be done with points forever.

the hyd lifters are a little more of a problem but can be retrofitted into 
the type 4 engine when rebuilt for about a 100 dollars extra, worth every 
penny.......

adjust the valves on a new engine and check em every 10,000 miles or so 
once dialed in, can't remember the number of times they actually needed 
being touched once the engine was broke in.  needing to actually adjust a 
hyd lifter is usually a warning sign that you have head problems.

IMO
YMMV
usual disclaimers etc
