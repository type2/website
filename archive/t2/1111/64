Subject: Rather disheartening discovery on my 77 Bay - with flickr url

It looks like this van was not very well maintained bodywise from the P.O.
I've tried to keep the rusting under control by limiting the van's salt intake
in the winters, but after installing the hard start relay and working on the
cv boots, I discovered another rust area. I'm wondering if this van is getting
too far gone to redo. I've put a picture up at flickr to show you what i
discovered with some judicious use of a screwdriver. This is behind the
passenger side wheelwell. Is there a repair panel for this? Anyone seen any
pics of this section being redone?
