Subject: Re: [T2] valve adjustment

My favorite valve cover bale removal tool is to use the curved jaw of a set
of channel lock pliers. it's almost L shaped, and has the serrated jaw, and
it works quite easily. The other arm just kinda flops around, and really has
nothing to do with the process...But I've also used the 13mm wrench many
times as well, although it's not quite as easy.
