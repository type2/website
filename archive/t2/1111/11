Great work, Greg.   I'd like to try to put FI back on this bus when I 
get time.   I know I have some of the necessary lines and stuff as it is 
a '76 model.  But all the FI stuff is long gone.  I'll need to get a 
list of stuff that I'll need or maybe find a junkyard bus I can rob it 
off of.  Thanks for the great info.  Might come in handy sometime.
