'77 Westy, stock F.I.

We had to leave our bus last night and get a ride home.  It turns over fine
but doesn't seem like it is trying to start, maybe an electrical issue.  It
is near the bottom of the tank so we added about 1 gallon of gas, and
nothing.

About three weeks ago it did this the day after replacing the fan shroud and
we thought it was related even though I had driven it around doing errands
for a full day.  Before we could fix it it started up the next day.

There was no event that led up to this.  We went to a friends house and left
it parked for 2 hours.  I am going over there in an hour to see if it will
start now, almost hope it doesn't.

Thanks,
James, probably piling his 2 Great Danes in the back of the 122S to go to
Pagan Fertility dinner.
