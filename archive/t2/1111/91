Subject: Re: [T2] ve adjustment- Lucas

I've got two Jaguars.  Even little things like connectors just 
unexpectedly quit working.  When Ford bought Jaguar they wanted to use 
Bosch.    England had a law that if there was a local manufacturer, you 
had to use them.  Guess who?  Well, after so many problems, Ford 
threatened to close Jaguar down altogether.  They either changed the law 
or granted them an exemption because the newer Jags use Bosch and 
probably no Lucas if any at all.  But I've learned to drink beer warm!  
After a couple, who cares.  :)
