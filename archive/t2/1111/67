Hi Courtney,

In the case of a starter failure you can bump-start a manual 
transmission equipped FI bus. I have done this lots of times over the 
years due to a hot-start problem or a sticky solenoid or ignition switch 
issue.

In the case of a battery failure where the voltage drops below 10V you 
are out of luck.

Happy Trails,
