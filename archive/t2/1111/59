since when you are push starting the power comes from the momentum thru 
the wheels gear ratio's are effectively reversed. thus 4th is like first 
etc.

since a bus has a lot of mass an object in motion tends to stay in motion 
unless stopped by outside force.  you want that outside force to be as low 
as possible so you would chose a higher (effectively lower) gear to start 
the engine.

4th is probably two low and unless the hill were steep and you were moving 
faster it would not spin the engine over as fast as needed to get it 
going.   3rd or 2nd is a better choice. I've always recommended 2nd but 
that is because you can get it rolling a bit, but if you can barely get it 
rolling very slowly 3rd gives you a better chance of getting it turned 
over without stalling forward motion.

so more than you ever wanted to know, oh and be sure to turn on the 
ignition, I once years ago wasted almost a half mile downgrade trying to 
get it started and had forgotten to turn it on.....

PS all of the above is worthless on an automatic, get a jump start you 
will probably never be able to pop start an automatic, and believe me I 
have tried.
