	The extra revs per mph in bottom are of little or no use for 
an engine that is (for whatever reason) not going to fire.
	The temporary locking of rear wheels when you drop the clutch 
can make an embarrassing noise.  Don't want ignorant strangers to 
think you're a hoon, do we?
	A Govt Dept Head told me a rolling start in 1st produces 
dangerous unusual loads on the transmission.  That was wrt a '36 
Singer of his, so it may not apply to VW  ...  and he could have been 
entirely wrong, seeing as how his rackets were statistics & 
economics, but I see no harm in believing him.
	At the other end of the scale, top gear maximises the effects 
of slop in the transmission.
	2nd or 3rd give the smoothest result, with minimal stumbling, 
and all the revs you can use.
