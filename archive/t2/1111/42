Two barrel carbs may be progressive or not.  If "progressive", one barrel, the
primary-typically the smaller one, opens until fully open then the other,
secondary-typically larger, starts to open.  Alternately both, typically the
same size, open at once.

Single barrel carbs thus, by definition, cannot be "progressive", they can
however be variable venturi e.g solex diaphragm or SU piston.

Weber 24/36 progressive carbs were on every Ford Escort and Cortina GT in NZ
from the 60's through the 80's.  They were available as after-market
conversions from Ford, or speed shops, as well.  Should be no trouble to
source as many as you want.  Alternately the NIKKI, or Kehin, weber
progressive knock-off, as used on Datsun 180B or 1600 is an even better built
carb IMHO.  I think I paid NZ $25 for the last one I bought from a Manukau
wrecker.  In my experience the NZ wreckers are/were very well organized with a
computer net, and could locate any available part amongst their associates in
a few minutes. jon
