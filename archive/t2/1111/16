For pulling it down --- put a shop rag through the bail and yank hard.

For going back up --- walk it as far as possible with your fingers then
hook an appropriately sized open-end wrench under it and lift.
Actually, I think I usually use the box end of a 13 or 14mm turned
sideways/flat.

Yeah, that would work as well.  Heck, a cotter-pin removal tool would 
probably do the trick, too.  It's just knowing that when you're doing
it for the first time!!
