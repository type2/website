Subject: Re: [T2] Does anyone make a CDI unit anymore that's not crazy

If you want to go to a little more trouble than the CDI which is pretty much 
a bolt up and wire up, consider eliminating the dizzy all together and go 
with an EDIS system. Maybe twice as much as a CDI, but much more accurate 
and nothing to wear out!
See it here.
