So what's a "hoon"? Anything like a "loon"?

The extra revs per mph in bottom are of little or no use for 
an engine that is (for whatever reason) not going to fire.
The temporary locking of rear wheels when you drop the clutch 
can make an embarrassing noise.  Don't want ignorant strangers to 
think you're a hoon, do we?
