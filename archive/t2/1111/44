Ah -- you must have the upright motor. Easy for us Americans to forget
the whole world didn't go to the Type 4 motor in 1972.

The Type 181 (Thing or Kubel) was set up for cranks in the 70's. Some
wanting to restore that function to splitties have scavenged those
parts from 181s or 181 parts sources.

 face-cam is, I guess, a protection against arm harm from kickback; do
 we need that protection, if we hold the handle aright (not wrap the
 thumb around it), etc?

Use the ratchet! Put the socket on after you insert the extension so
you don't have to cut a bigger than standard crank hole.

VW didn't bother (unless someone can correct me - maybe all those
crank-equipped vehicles just lost their plugs over the years!)
