Tom I just asked about quality on these a week or so ago, I'll summarize the
responses I got.  General sentiment (from some smart people) as far as quality
was pay the extra $30 for a Bosch even if it is made in South America.  I was
asking for a 1600 so I have no opinion on using it for a T4.  FWIW, CB seems
to have the best price on a Bosch unit.  I intend to run a CDI so am leaving
it points as points last forever with a CDI and a little attention to wearing
block grease.  I like the extra 3mpg I ususally get out of a CDI, and as I
couldn't find my "Universal Products" box since the move I ordered the new
cheapo MSD (5520) off of the bay for $89.99 (usually $120 most vendors) and
we'll see how that goes, has built in rev limiter, price was right.  I will
modify my own rotor (15 min work) but I think Connely still sells em modified
likely to use with CDIs.  For me at least the combo of a CDI and the points is
usually the better deal than
 $60-70 or whatever a Pertronix costs now days.
 
YMMV.
 
Also consider the 050 for a T4, it can be a nice dizzy for the T4 if you get
one for a good deal off of samba or somewhere.  I have run them mostly in
slightly warmed over T4's but never had the issues with an 050 people "think"
they have with 009s.  Might oddly be a cheaper alternative now days if you see
one for a good price.

Any feedback on the "Hot-Spark" distributors?
Other than a real 205 distributor timed at 5 ATDC, will the 034 really help?
Is anybody running the 034 and like it or dislike it?
