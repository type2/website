Subject: Does one piece fit all type 2's??

I've been looking for the inner splash panel replacement piece for my 77 and
seem to only find one that goes up to a 72. At CIP it is Tab 402-101. I
emailed them and they said "with some work" it will fit the 77. Has anyone
seen one that is specifically for mine. Why would I buy a piece in order to
cut it up? I also noticed it has a 90 deg. channel cut into it. What would
that be for??
