Hi Courtney,

Clearly you don't live in the rust belt. We see plenty worse than that 
here in Ontario... I remember back in 1986 My 72 westy was worse than that.

The main difference is that in your market there is a more abundant 
supply of replacement units available to you, which greatly reduces the 
return on investment on that sort of repair.

They are NEVER too far gone to restore if you're motivated, but it can 
often be cheaper to start over with a different chassis in some cases.

Happy Trails,
