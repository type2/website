Thanks John.

I have decided to change the 009 out with a SVDA first and see how it reacts.
Did you run a weber straight out of the box or did you up the jetting at all?
I really wouldn't mind keeping the weber for its simplicity, and not much
worry about icy conditions(intake) here in Hawaii.


The 009 is your primary problem. Your bus will run fine with the
Weber. After the recent discussion on the GAMI article, head temps,
and cylinder mixture variation, I have decided to pull my stock dual
Solex and use Weber progressive again. My best bus driving experiences
have been on Weber progressive.

John
