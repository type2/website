Subject: Aftermarket steering coupler

I tried finding a NOS steering coupler after finding the one that  
comes through Euromax had failed after a few months of use.

Actually, Bus Depot tried to source one for me, but when they  
couldn't, they sent me another Euromax.  Thanks, guys.  I hope this  
one works better.

When I took the old one out, I found that it had cracked in a few  
places and there were frayed threads showing in the cracks and in the  
holes that the bolts go through.  What this coupler did was buckle  
when enough torque (40 ft-lbs) was put on it.  This buckling action  
forced the steering column up and caused the bolts to rub against that  
bell-shaped thing at the bottom of the steering column tube, wearing  
through and also breaking the horn wire.  This, IMHO, is a failure of  
the coupling.

I'm not exactly sure what brought this on - perhaps an abundance of  
three-point turns on tires that were nearly bald, but this coupler is  
apparently NOT designed to handle a lot of torque.

The one that I took out (it was only in the bus a little over a year)  
can be easily bent between thumb and forefinger.  The rubber is poor  
quality in that my hands get black just handling it.  The one that I  
put in is a little bit stiffer, but the black doesn't rub off of it  
(yet).

Is there another source for these?  I suspect that they are Chinese.   
They have "PREMIUM QUALITY" embossed on them.  My a$$.
