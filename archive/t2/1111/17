Subject: Re: [T2] valve adjustment

My favorite pry tool for in the car is a 9/16 or so combo wrench or the
14-15mm metric equivalent.  I wedge it at an angle under the center of the
bail (I put the open end on the cover, pull on the box end) and pull as Fin
hard as I can, pops the bale right back on.  There is just enough room above
the exchanger to pul the bale up onto the cover enough then tuck the end of
the wrech under the center of the bale, at an angle, closer to parallel with
the bale actually initially.  Some times it is a multi step pull working it a
little at a time, but 1 reposition usually.  Something better likely exists
but I've been doing that for 15+ years so why change now.  I've dry little pry
bars (brake adjuster) good quality snap on screwdrivers, many things, I always
come back to the wrench.

OK, what's the trick to the valve cover clips?  I ended up popping the end of
out it's hole on the passenger side.  The big clip was so tight that I had to
remove it to get the valve cover off.  The valve cover practically fell off
when I did and the seal looked good.  Everything was clean on the inside.  But
I thought I'd put it back on until I get back to it tomorrow.  I couldn't get
anything up in there to give me enough leverage to pry it back on.   I know
there's an easier way than what I was
