	I assume the float & needle valve are essentially similar in 
the Brasilian Weber to the corresponding parts in the 'real 
McItalian' 2-barrel (isn't that Yank for 'progressive'?).
	BTW the word 'Weber' does not appear on this 30mm 
single-barrel carb; but it does say IND. BRAS. which I take to mean 
'made in Brazil', and has a big bold cast letter W facing rearwards.
	Having just invested in a new Brosol mech pump I'm loath to 
go electric (and have never had to do with electric fuel pumps).  I 
suppose what I want is a spacer or some other device that will 
decrease the pressure from the Brosol without decreasing the flow 
below what's needed to supply, say, 20 mpg during wide-open running.
