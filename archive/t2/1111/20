I haven't changed stock jetting on any Weber progressive I have owned,
and have never experienced symptoms of lean or rich running on any of
them.

Even when I was in northern California with ice on the ground
sometimes in the winter, the electric choke was enough to get me
started and off to work.

Now I'm in climate like yours. Half the VWs I see here have the choke disabled.

Pretty much works as advertised - economy on the first barrel, power
with the second barrel.

 Did you run a weber straight out of the box or did you up the jetting at all?
 I really wouldn't mind keeping the weber for its simplicity, and not much
 worry about icy conditions(intake) here in Hawaii.
