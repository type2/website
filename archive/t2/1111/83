Radio Shack in the USA hardly has electronic components for the do it 
yourselfer. they'll order the stuff but walk in and as for a resistor and 
the kids might not know what you are talking about.  I had to show em 
something I wanted on their own computer the other day, they didn't even 
know how to spell it much less what it was.

but on to the real subject.  I bit the bullet and mulled it over long and 
hard before buying a Crane unit a couple years ago.  was way expensive but 
it is not a purchase I regret.

YMMV
