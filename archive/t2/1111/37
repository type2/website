Subject: Stock starter wiring and a hard start relay

I have posted this pic to flickr. If you have the time, please look here and
help me decipher this. There is a LOT of wires going to my one terminal on the
starter, and I want to hook up a hard start relay. I am assuming the big gauge
black and red wire is the one coming from the ignition (as per
oldvolkshome.net website)?? I'm thinking that other HUGE wire is for the gas
heater somehow?? What is the small red and white wire for??? On old Volks
website he doesn't mention which terminal on the starter relay terminal 87
goes to?? Any help would be most appreciated.
