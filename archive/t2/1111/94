The hard part is setting up the trigger wheel.  It almost requires you 
to pull the engine to get all the measurements dialed in.  Plus, nobody 
makes a trigger wheel for a T4 (I had to fab my own setup).  Now, if you 
have a T1 engine, it's quite a bit easier to get a fabricated trigger 
wheel installed.

If you're curious as to what's involved, take a look at my install:
