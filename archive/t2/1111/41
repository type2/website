Subject: wiper system "fiddly bits"

As I am putting my wiper system back in, I am finding that the
installation parts are not all in the Bentley.

Where do I go for all the fiddly little c clips and washers and spring
washer and ................... you get the point.

The last person other than me was the guy who did the re-install after
the Body/paint job.
