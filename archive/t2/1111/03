It looks to me from the picture that the seat belt upper anchor point would be
too low for all but children.  I wonder if the shoulder belt can do more harm
than good when the anchor point is below your shoulder.  It seems to me that
this is a great way to break collar bones and squeeze the torso in ways it was
never meant to be squozed.

Most modern cars have the shoulder anchor well above average shoulder height.
There must be a reason for this, does anyone know?

Also, since there are anchor points for a shoulder belt... where can these
shoulder belts be purchased? Anyone have any ideas?
