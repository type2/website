I imagine the van rear shoulder anchor point is related to the
structural strength of the frame.

There is nothing special about VW seat belts. What I did was take a few
measurements and go to an online seatbelt vendor and buy a generic
replacement belt. You are probably going to ask which belt I got but the
size of the belt will depend on the rear seat (I have a camper with fold
out bed) and you will also have to get belts that meet your local
standards to avoid grief if someone wants to do a roadworthy inspection!
