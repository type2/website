Subject: ve adjustment

Well, I finally found time to get back to my valve adjustment.  Thanks 
to Mike Soultanian for the easiest way.  I played around enough to 
figure out that is THE way to do it.  But all of you guys helped out.  I 
didn't have a drum brake tool but the long side of the crescent wrench 
worked just fine for the valve covers.  In fact, the left side came off 
and went back on quite easily.  The right side is a little tight.   As 
with anything it's pretty easy if you know how to do it and what tool to 
use.  The valves were all either right on it or really close.  I think 
the intakes had all been set to .oo6 and the exhausts to .008.  I just 
left them that way unless they needed adjustment.  I didn't think I had 
a valve problem as it ran so good when it was running.  I ordered a fuel 
pressure guage and the T is for a bigger hose than what I have.  I'm 
also going to put a regulator on it but that'll have to wait.  I'm 
thinking intake leak but we'll see. 

I'm getting ready to hit the road (or the sea) again on Tuesday.  Long 
flight with long layovers to Singapore.  I'll be gone several months.  
So I won't be able to get back to ithe Bopmobile until then.  Unlike the 
other trips, I think I'll stay on the list as I realize what I've been 
missing.  And there are not as many posts as in the past and I'll be 
able to handle it. 

Oh yeah, before I forget:  Robert Mann, the reason the Brits drink warm 
beer is because Lucas makes the compressors.  :)  Ciao, guys and gals....KR
