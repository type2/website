Subject: Hooning

Via the all powerful Wikipedia, I bring you HOON!

Hoon is a derogatory term used in Australia and New Zealand to refer to a
younger person who engages in loutish, anti-social behaviour. In particular,
it is used to refer to one who drives in a manner which is anti-social by the
standards of contemporary society, that is, fast, noisily or dangerously.
While generally applied to automobiles and other road vehicles, anti-hooning
legislation also targets hooning behavior wherever it occurs, including motor
boats. Hoon activities can include speeding, burnouts, doughnuts or screeching
tires.[1] Those commonly identified as being involved in "hooning" or street
racing are young, predominantly male although increasingly female drivers in
the age range of 17 and 35 years.[2]

For more fun and enjoyment, look it up for yourself and see about all the
anti-hooning legislation in progress in Australia.
