 Hi Kevin,

I was always told 2nd gear was the best, but I can't remember why.

Hey Robt or anyone else on the list..

I have had to start my bus with a push sometimes, popping the clutch, but I
never heard about not to use 1st  gear to do so. Why shouldn't one use 1st
gear when push-starting, or hill starting?
