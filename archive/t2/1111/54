Hi David,

I would not want to use a vent line for fuel return for two reasons.

Firstly, it means that the tank is not as well vented as it was before 
the line was adapted for fuel return.

Secondly, The fuel returning would be dropping into the tank and 
constantly splashing and increasing the amount of vapor in the tank. The 
fuel returning would be slightly warmer and even more prone to evaporate.

Putting a T inline in front of the fuel filter will supply adequate fuel 
without either of the above compromises.


Happy Trails,
