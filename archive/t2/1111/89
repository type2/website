Subject: Re: [T2] Does anyone make a CDI unit anymore that's not crazy

Ok, so isn't it time some boffin on these forums came up with a unit and
jumped back into the market. Hmmmmm, maybe it's time to check out the Asian
connection. Anybody want a CDI system for their Bosch dizzy powered Vw???
If it's good enough for West and Hoover, it's good enough for me!
