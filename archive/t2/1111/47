UPDATE! So after a loong time of tinkering, getting brake fluid in my eyes
(not fun!) and nothing changing, I decided to let her sit for a week or so,
and last weekend i put a good USED booster in, AND IT WORKS!! Pedal returns
just like normal!

Thank you everyone so much for your help! I finally just broke down and got
a different booster.

Also I didn't get a photo of this, but the push rod that comes out of the
booster into the master cylinder in the BAD one, was longer. The one that
WORKS the push rod barely came out of the booster (just the very end/tip of
the push rod). So I will remember that for future bad booster problems :)

Thanks again everyone!
