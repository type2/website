Subject: Re: [T2] dumb question- remote start

Or you can run a permanent wire from the upper starter terminal back 
through the grommet the battery cable goes through and keep the end 
handy to touch the battery- did that for years with a wirenut cap on it. 
  If you have the hard start relay (it's next to our voltage regulator), 
run your alligator clip from the terminal that starter wire goes to to 
your battery + terminal.
