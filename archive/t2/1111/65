Never be afraid of rust!

If there's no repair panel off the shelf, sheet metal can be shaped to fit!

Best of luck! (Send us the flickr link!) (Enough exclamation points yet!?!)

 I've tried to keep the rusting under control by limiting the van's salt intake
 in the winters, but after installing the hard start relay and working on the
 cv boots, I discovered another rust area. I'm wondering if this van is getting
 too far gone to redo. I've put a picture up at flickr to show you what i
 discovered with some judicious use of a screwdriver. This is behind the
 passenger side wheelwell. Is there a repair panel for this? Anyone seen any
 pics of this section being redone?
