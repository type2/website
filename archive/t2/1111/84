Subject: Re: [T2] Does anyone make a CDI unit anymore that's not crazy

Sears and Radio Shack used to sell the old Delta CDI's. I have a radio shack 
unit in my bus. Just a little lube on the dizzy bumps from time to time and 
the points last for 20K+ with little change in the timing. As for better gas 
mileage, I think I used to get about 1-1/2 better. Used to keep pretty close 
tabs on my gas mileage when my bus was my daily driver. Don't know where you 
can get a new one these days. Did you try ebay?

I was researching CDI units like the old universal corp Tiger CdI which is
NLA, and could hardly find ANY except for 250-300 dollars outrageous way 
cool
rev limiter racing type of stuff. Who makes just a bonehead simple CDI like
the old Tiger unit that isn't ridiculously overpriced? I guess I could make 
my
own, but sourcing the components is getting tougher these days. Radio Shack 
no
longer exists in Canada etc etc.
