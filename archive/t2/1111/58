The higher the gear you choose, the more momentum the bus has
per revolution of the engine.  Thus, the higher the gear, the
less it bumps and jerks when push starting.  OTOH, the higher
the gear, the more speed you need to achieve to reach the revs
needed to start the engine.  So it's a compromise; 2nd or 3rd
usually work best.
