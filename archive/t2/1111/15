Yeah, that would work as well.  Heck, a cotter-pin removal tool would 
probably do the trick, too.  It's just knowing that when you're doing it 
for the first time!!

I remember working on the bus with my Dad back in the day and we would 
sit there with a screwdriver fussing with that stupid spring bail for AGES!
