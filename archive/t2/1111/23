Its a play off between a broken collar bone etc or being cut in two by just
the lap belt.maybe if the belt brake had a bit of give like a H&S fall
arrester it would absorb energy and leave you better off

shoulder belts be purchased? Anyone have any ideas?

but I think that seatbelt bolts are universal, so you could recycle from
anything suitable pretty easily.

>> As others have said, they are the seat belt mount points. I am guessing

that you want the rear seat belt for the baby? I am in Australia and to

fit a baby seat you need a lap (or lap sash) belt and an anchor point

mounted behind the seat that anchors the top edge of the seat. For

babies it is the seat that is anchored and then the baby is strapped to

the seat. I would check your local regs.



This is a very valid point  UK regs dont seem to specify as long as chair
is mounted to manufacturer spec I already have a lapbelt in there, just
need to ensure the rock and roll bed is well secured and this should be OK.
Still fancy the three pointer though, so will investigate fully at the
weekend.



Thanks all
