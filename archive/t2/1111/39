Subject: Re: [WetWesties] Stock starter wiring and a hard start relay -

Sorry guys/gals, the tag didn't show on that picture with the vehicle info.
It's a 77 Westy Deluxe with propane, fridge, and gas heater. The rust was free
from the P.O. :-) That's what happens when somebody does a half ass job of
undercoating. Actually not as bad as it looks in that picture.
