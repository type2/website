Subject: Re: Does anyone make a CDI unit anymore that's not crazy

> I was researching CDI units like the old universal corp Tiger CdI which is
NLA, and could hardly find ANY except for 250-300 dollars outrageous way cool
rev limiter racing type of stuff. Who makes just a bonehead simple CDI like
the old Tiger unit that isn't ridiculously overpriced? I guess I could make
my
own, but sourcing the components is getting tougher these days. Radio Shack
no
longer exists in Canada etc etc.

What I find interesting and amusing was the description of "old" CDI units in
the blurb of an Australian CDI kit that sadly isn't available anymore. Most of
the attributes, such as limited multispark, the authors ascribed to the poor
capabilities of components available in the 60s and 70s. Lo and behold they
could have been writing a description of the $250-$300 units available today!
The article (including circuit diagrams) is online. Search for "Silicon Chip
CDI" and you'll find it.
I got this kit when it had got to the "throw-out" pile, but haven't fitted it
yet. It's on the gunna list...
