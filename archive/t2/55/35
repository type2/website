Subject: Re: [T2] splitting the main cooling duct

Mike,

IIRC, the sleeve doesn't come out, but the two duct halves separate at an
angle, i.e. approx. 45 degrees or the angle of the dipstick sleeve.  The
sleeve remains attached to one of the halves.  They don't simply come apart
but the you pull one half of the housing up and push the other down, sort
of...

The thing is one o'clock is an alignment casting, I'm pretty sure.  I didn't
have to do anything with it when I got mine apart, so that's probably not
the problem.

Good luck.  Once the thing comes apart, you'll see much more clearly what
I'm trying to describe.
