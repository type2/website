What I remember reading/hearing about the subject of
shiney aluminum valve covers is that they lead to
higher oil temperatures as the do not cool the oil
that splatters into them like the black stock ones do.
 There is often a problem getting them to fit tightly,
too, especially if they are held on by studs and nus
rather than wire bails.  
Sounds like something I may have read in the Idiot
Book years ago.
