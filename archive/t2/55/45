and no where is this more apparent than in stop and go driving, I live
"Downtown" in a major metro area.  a very large part of my driving is done
in stop and go traffic.  my 78 came with a 009 dizzy, I never felt like I
was going to get moving, merging into traffic was a nightmare and I caught
every traffic light even though they were supposed to be "timed lights".
  put the spec dizzy in there and the darn thing can keep up with traffic.

if you do all interstate driving you might not notice much difference, but
get the Bus "Downtown" and believe you me you will assuradly "NOTICE" the
difference.
