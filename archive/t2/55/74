Whos'there? Not me, because my bus is broken...

'72 Westy, 1700, 009, Webber dbl bbl progressive. On
The way to my girlfriend's house yesterday, I started
to lose power and then heard a loud knockin noise. Drove it the 100 yards to her house and parked it.
Took a look at it today and found that the alternator
belt was loose, tightened up and turned the engine by
hand a few times to make sure nothing was binding. While
I was at it, I fixed an exhaust leak and adjusted the 
valves. All valves were ok with the exception of one,
which was loose by .002" Checked the oil and it was
fine. SO thinking that the power loss was just the alt.,
I started her back up and immediately got a knocking
noise that faded away into silence. I've heard of this
before, so I cautiously crept up my girlfriend's long
driveway. Once I got into higher rpms, the engine was 
making the knocking noise. I put it in reverse and 
backed down the drive and parked it. It idles fine, with
no knocking. It knocks when revved up. Now, I didn't
run it for long, for fear of damaging something beyond
all hope of repair. Please help, as right now my bus is
my only means of transportation.
