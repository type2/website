Subject: Neighbor looking for loaf

He knocked on my door today asking if "China Cat" was for sale. He is looking 
for preferably a Westy, not necessairly running, but would require pretty 
straight body. Anyone within "recovery distance" of Knoxville TN having 
anything like that for sale?

Let me know via email and I'll connect you with the buyer.

Cheers/Don Carron
