don't want to be the bearer of bad news but that is exactly what mine did
when a wrist pin siezed...A panic fix (not endorsed by Dr Tim) was to pull
the head and swap out that piston, cyc, and connecting rod. yes it can be
done without pulling the engine.  I was only off the road for two days,
BUT it was only stopgap since I was already preparing to do a total
rebuild,  it held out for couple thousand miles, although I didn't push
it, until I could do the job right.

there may be other things, and I hope it is simpler but that was my
experience, and I know your pain, mine is a daily driver too, and at the
time I had no other wheels.
