Does this mean that the gaskets aren't needed?<G>
Seems to me that a lot of oil passes through the valve
cover area.  Of course, "a lot" is a relative thing,
and "a lot" leaking isn't the same as "a lot"
circulating through the engine.
What I vaguely remembered reading was that the color
of the valve covers did make some difference in oil
temp. The black stock covers radiate heat better than
shiney aluminum ones.
Seems like one of the technical types ought to have
the info at their fingertips.
