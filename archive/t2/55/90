   Back when I was young, dumb and foolish as well, I "surfed" my nearly new '73
Bug in much the same manner. There was an underpass near the University of Houston
that was notorious for flooding in heavy rain (I did not know this at the time). I
was zipping down the road, too fast for conditions (I told you, I was dumber than
dirt those days) and plunged right in to the water, thinking it was only a few
inches deep.

   Same thing as Bob, I suddenly felt the car take on a rather nautical motion. I
could hear the exhaust burbling like an Evinrude but the car seemed to be making
forward progress like a paddle boat. The front wheels made a reasonable
impersonation of rudders and I kept a light touch on the throttle, not wanting to
upset what seemed to be working. The car had a "butt heavy" attitude in the water
and as I approached the other side I felt the rear wheels grab and moved on up the
street, hitting terra firma.

   Then I tried to stop, but the waterlogged drums took quite a bit of "standing
on the freakin' brakes" before I came to a halt at the side of the road.

   Then I started shaking like a leaf. Took me a while to regain my composure and
motor on home, verrry carefully.

   I think the only reason it didn't drown is that all the seals and stuff were in
great shape (the car was only 9 months old). You actually had to crack the window
a bit to close the door. Remember the line in the old VW ad?

   "Volkswagens can definitely float, but they can't float indefinitely."

and yes, I still have that '73. It's in a friend's barn, awaiting reconstruction
after 241,000 miles.
