<<  DID I DO THE RIGHT THING?? >>

Hiya John,

Well according to Boston Bob, perhaps you did do the right thing.  I've got a 
heap of respect for Boston Bob, but.......................attitudes and 
approaches have changed.

A few years ago the 009 and the 34PICT3 were supposedly hot items.  Probably 
had something to do with Muir and his influence in the field.  Lotsa folks 
expounded on their way of tuning (actually fixing) these components so that 
they worked well together.  But the hesitation problem was there then and 
it's still with us today despite all kinds of "fix-ups".  In the intervening 
years a lot of folks have come to realize that the best way of handling the 
problem is to ditch the 009 in favor of a dual advance dizzy.

And that realization is simply based on the fact that the 009 is, at heart, a 
piece of racing equipment.  If we were to drive our cars at full throttle all 
the time the 009 would be OK for the street.  But we don't and it isn't.  For 
daily driving we need a dizzy with a dual advance to get us through the low 
end of the acceleration curve.

So do yourself a big favor and get a dual advance distributor.  Believe me, 
you will notice an immediate improvement and you'll wonder why you wasted 
your time trying to fix a set-up that can't be "fixed".

By the way, John C. over at aircooled.net has a great distributor (the SVDA) 
just for you.
