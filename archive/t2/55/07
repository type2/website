Subject: Accelerator/Idle


After the shake-down cruise in my 79 California FI, I noticed the engine
started running better and better. I developed more power and could cruise
easily at high speeds, when before it was a little more hesitant and would
surge a little.

All in all, it is running very well.

Here's my question. After all of that, my idle started getting slightly
higher and higher. As the week went on, the idle got very high, and it
would not slow down at all.

I checked the linkage and the cable and it moves correctly. It returns to
the stop appropriately, but the idle remains very high. I reduce the idle
at the screw below the spring accelerator linkage. It reduced nicely.

But, when I accelerate and let off the gas, I get a longer "hangover"
effect from the gadget that is supposed to do that. It takes a lot longer
than I believe is normal to return to a lower idle.

1. Is this a real problem? I don't think so, but I like things to run
right.
2. Is there any adjustment tricks I can try to increase the spring return
speed? I don't think increasing the spring tension will do it. It doesn't
seem to be tight.
3. Am I making a mountain out of a molehill?

Thanks,
This thing is gonna take me to Texas from Philadelphia before long, and I
almost believe it is going to make it, now.
