many years ago I "surfed" my bus.

just stopped raining real hard, genuine gully washer.  was living in the
city and had my 60 23window deluxe (wish I still had it)  came on a
stretch of road covered with water, being young and foolish I just reved
it up and plowed on in,  somewhere in there the wheels left the roadway,
but the engine kept runninng and the wheels acted like paddle wheels and
got me through the deep spot....

 never did that again, scared the **** out of me.  saw on TV the next day
many big American cars drowned in the water.  biggest surprise was the
engine kept running never stalled out. it was even more amazing
considering the condition of my engine comp seal?!?

so take my word for it, surfing a VW bus just isn't the thrill it is made
out to be.....or maybe it is too much thrill???
