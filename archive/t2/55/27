Hey All,
I have the infamous 009 w\34pict3 carb on my 1600 DP in my new 71.  Knowing the reputation of this set up, I thought I would be pro-active and deal with the situation before I noticed a problem w\hesitation.  I followed BostonBobs ("A gearheads Viewpoint on the 009 Hesitation Blues") instructions for making this set up work: timed the engine to 10 BTDC and put a pop rivet in the hole in the throttle plate inside the carb(I still can't believe this is a GOOD thing to do!)  And I must report that I see no noticable improvement except for at idle, where it does idle a little smoother and at the correct speed.  If anything, I notice MORE of a hesitation than when the throttle plate was untouched and the engine was timed at 0 degrees.  SO WHAZZUP WID DAT????  DID I DO THE RIGHT THING??



Peace, John Baker
