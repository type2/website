i was speaking of the aux air valve, not the decel valve. the decel valve
could be the source of, or part of the problem chuck is having too,
especially when you read the part about:

the way to check the decel valve is the same: just remove it temporarily and
see if anything changes. in the same way that the aux air valve should have
no effect on a warm engine, the decel valve should be doing nothing at idle.
when working properly, it only allows air to pass through it when manifold
vacuum causes it to open, i.e. when you are running along and take your foot
off the throttle. if the return to idle is very slow, or non-existent, the
decel valve may not be closing properly. i took the decel valve off my
motor, but this may not work for everyone.

if i may add, the important thing when troubleshooting is to test only one
component at a time.
