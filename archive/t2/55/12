Subject: VOA strikes again

Well Volkwagen of Amercia hit me with a cease and desist  legal warning this
morning. The VW symbol on the logo with my wizard and the POR-15 is now gone
from the website. After work today i modified the logo and removed the VW
symbol. Hopefully for awhile that will satisfy their need to harass people
trying to keep alive the very vehicles that they show virtually no support
for. Anyway thats the reason for the change in the logo, and in spite of
VOA's pissy attitude toward restorers of their namesakes, I'll keep bringing
them back from the rust grave. Including the 58 Binz i got for myself this
month,, Rant mode off. Well have a Happy & safe Thanksgiving holiday ,,later
