Subject: ignition lock removal

i bought a 73 bus which has only door keys that work and no key thats works
on the ignition.  I was able to remove the whole assembl;y that holds the
cylinder and the steering columb but cant find a way to remove the cylider
so that I can get a key made.  locksmiths are all quoting $70-100 to drill
it out, say I should bring it to them apart will be cheaper.  how can this
be done?
