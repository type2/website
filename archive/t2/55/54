List,
It is a 30-year tradition here in Ky that 100.1 WKQQFM plays Alice's
Restaurant in its entirety at 12:00 noon on thanksgiving day.
I caught it today while on the road to the family gathering.

Alice's Restaraunt - quite possibly the world's most famous bus sighting.=


"So, we took the =BD -a-ton-a-garbage, put it in the back of a red V/W
micro-bus, took shovels, and rakes, and implements of destruction, and he=
aded
on toward the city dump."

Happy Thanksgiving you buncha freaks!
