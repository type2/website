Subject: ISO: '68-69 red side reflectors


Hi, I'm looking for a pair of the *round red side reflectors* that go on
the '68-69 buses.  If you have a pair, please contact me.  I need the
'seal' & screws that go with them.  I'd prefer ones that are in decent/nice
shape.  I will buy them, or trade if I have something you're interested in.

thank you,
Keri
