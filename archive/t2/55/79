out there could answer.
> 1. Has anyone tried these out?  If so Did it work well for additional 
oil filtering and did it really help cooling to any appreciable 
degree?  In your opinion was it worth the cost?  What was the cost?

Here's the biggest problem:  The maximum pressure drop across a filter 
on the suction side of the pump is 14.7PSI.  This is because the only 
thing that is pushing oil through the filter is atmospheric pressure.  
If the pressure required to move oil through the filter reaches 14.7 
psi, the filter will be trying to pump vacuum!.  The actual pressure 
drop is less than 14.7, since it is determined by the highest vapor 
pressure of the components of the oil.

If there is the least leak in the oil pickup circuit, air will leak 
into the pump, causing it to lose its prime.  Oil pumps don't pump air 
all that well.

> 2. On an older topic of cooling - I recently read again (somewhere I 
can't remember) that the cast aluminum valve covers will help keep the 
engine cooler than original covers.

Hard to tell.  You are dealing with a thick piece of aluminum, which 
conducts heat very well, versus a thin piece of steel, which conducts a 
bit less well.  IMO, you can't go far wrong with OEM steel covers.  
They have the advantage of sealing better than the aluminum covers.

>I also remember in a forum that someone said the original valve covers 
worked just as well and that the cork gaskets served to insulate the 
cover from much of the engine heat.

Head heat yes, but heat from the oil splashing on the covers will be 
dissipated.
