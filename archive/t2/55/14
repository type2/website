Sean,

I have 78 so I assume that they may be similar...I had the same problem on
the 1/2 side of mine, but not the 3/4 side.

Lots of lube and the patience of Job.  Hold your mouth just right helps
too.  I just worked with it until I got it.  I think I ended up *just*
fitting them over the manifold end and then getting them started as I got
the manifold on the bolts at the same time.

It's just one of those things....

Cheers ,dave
