If you want Aluminum valve covers, just go get them.
If you engine is running so hot that 3 to 5 degrees is important consider
an oil cooler.
The valve covers don't have their own heat source all they can do is
reduce the temperature of the oil that happens to get on them before it
drains back into the oil pan.
I think aluminum valve covers look good, I wouldn't hesitate to throw
$39.95 at a pair. I'd just be buying them for appearance and expecting
nothing from them in return.
