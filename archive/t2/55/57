They might help keep the lifters cooler than the original covers, but that's
about all I can think of. Like the forum said, those cork gaskets are good
insulators.

You install cast aluminum valve covers because you think they make your
engine look good. There's nothing wrong with that, and if they're well made
they won't hurt anything by being there, but that's why you get them.
Because they're pretty.
