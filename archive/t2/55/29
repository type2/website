Subject: splitting the main cooling duct

Do I have to drive the oil dipstick sleeve out of the ducting before I
can split it?

Also, if you're looking at the hole where the cooling fan is (the big
hole in the middle of the ducting), just up to the right of the opening,
at about 1 o'clock, there is a little plug that looks like it's either a
screw that was sawed off or an alignment hole.  It's about an inch or so
from edge of the big circle opening.  Do other people have a screw
there?

It seems like the dipstick sleeve and this wierd plug thing/broken screw
are the only things keeping me from splitting the duct.  I'd like to get
in there, clean it out, and put it back together.

btw, it's a 78 2.0 fi

thanks,
MIke
