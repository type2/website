have you ever wondered about all the RailRoad Names that are used on Model
Railroad cars

  If I recall the Model Railroad Industry Assoc, has a contract with the
Association of American Railroads, in which they pay $1 or something for
the use of the coorporate logos and names.

how hard would it be for VW to license small time folks at $1 for 10 years
or something, pro forma.  everyone wins, VW controls thier name, people
get to use the logo legally and VW can keep misuse down.

instead of fighting why isn't it possible to work out something, I am sure
there are a couple legal types that own classic VW's that could contact
VWOA offically and work out something

oh well, HAPPY Turkey day to all (and for non Americans, have a happy day
too!)
