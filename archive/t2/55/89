Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Bus's and Surfing

I also have surfed my bus,,, well sorta. It was my first bus , a 68 craplux.
It had almost no floor in the cab. Well , there was this road that would
flood in my neaborhood every time hurricane season hit(in Florida).
I took a wrong turn and came to the flooded road , I really didn't want to
turn around so I gunned it over about 2 1/2 ft of water. my friend Ed and I
were reminded of the holes in the floor when water shot up and soaked us and
almost all of teh interior of the bus. We made it through , Barely.  I tried
the same stunt with my Fastback but failed miserably, The motor cut out and
it sank. Water all in the car and then I had to push it through the rest of
the way .
