Subject: re: sucked a valve?

I think I would have to go with Al's advice on this...
based on your description.... I once had my bus start
blowing smoke (or so it seemed) turned out to be a
broken ground wire in the dizzy... so it was making
poor/intermittent contact ( I guess)... dont know why
that would cause it to emit smoke from the exhaust...
unburnt fuel vapor?// anyway check the other stuff 
first!

I'd go through the trouble shooting stuff for the
ignition and fuel
systems and then check the compression again before
EVER taking  the
engine apart.
