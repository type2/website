Chuck, as Scott just wrote, this sounds very much like my rising idle
problem that was indeed a defective decel valve.  Mine passed Sean's test,
but did not fuction in real life, so I would say that replacement is the
best diagnostic.  Fortunately, most junk yards charge these under "misc."
and they are in the $5 range.  Alas, buses are not common in some parts of
the world.
