Subject: Water cooled H fitting.

I  was at the Vanagon boneyard trying to find a part for McCue, this is
as close as I got 025.121.082. It looks to be an H assembly for coolant,
never could find the part number for McCue.
Anybody want this good part for $12.00 including shipping (add $6.00 if
your in Canada).

Hello there...I am wondering if you can help me.  I have a 1984 VW
Vanagon,
and I need a coolant hose connector.  It is "H" shaped, and is located
near
the expansion tank.  Its part number is: 025 121 438.  If you have one of
these, or can get one, or can point me to someone who can, I would be
MUCH
appreciative!!!
 
Thanks!
 
Jim McCue
