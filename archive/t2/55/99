Subject: Power cleaners

I'm not one to just blatantly abuse my 83 Westfalia but today I got my
hands on a power washer.
It wasn't the type that you get from the rental store; this was a big
momma, trailer mounted with about 20 HP and a Diesel fueled water heater
that would crank out 3000PSI at 210 Degrees.
I cleaned out my CV pockets in the swing arms, all of my fender wells,
all of my front suspension and that always greasy rear area above the
muffler (where I dribble oil while adding 8oz.).
Things were going great so I blew off my rear brake backing plates and my
LP fuel tank.
This took all of ten minutes.
I was building momentum so I started cleaning parts that I have for sale,
heater boxes, Eberspacher heaters, used engine sheet metal, three 4 speed
transmissions and various other parts that all wanted to go airborne when
the high pressure spray hit them.
All of this airborne waste settled on my driveway so I cleaned the
driveway. The driveway took a little longer since its about thirty by
fifty feet but all it was an exciting day.
I may have to start taking my shoes off to walk on my immaculate
driveway.
