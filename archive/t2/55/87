Subject: Re: Water cooled H fitting. and Intake rubber

I also found part # 025.129.967 A, its the intake boot that goes between
the AFM and the Throttle body. 
I'm going to guess that this probably fits about an 86 WaserBoxer. It
won't fit my Air Cooled, thought it would. Its in good condition with
crankcase breather and vacuum adapter in place. I'd like to have $20.00
with postage paid in US.
