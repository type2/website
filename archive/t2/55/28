Subject: vaccum question

hey volks, my 72 westy has had this problem for as long 
as I can remember. Occasionally, not all the time, when 
I come to a stop the idle will drop to around 4-500 for 
a short time before it dies altogether. Fiddling with 
idle and/or timing provided a quick fix but it always 
comes back. Sometimes it will do this at one stop light 
and be normal the very next
I read in the archives that faulty brake servo vaccum 
lines and deteriorated vaccum hose can cause such a 
malady. I replaced the vacuum lines(and double checkd 
that all clamps were tight), asjusted the valves and set 
timing and idle and it felt like it was running realy 
well. The first couple times I drove it, the idle stayed 
steady and I was elated. But once again idle is 
dropping . I plan to do the vaccum test as described in 
the library as soon as i have a some good weather and 
child/chore free time.
Two questions:
1)If the brake servo itself IS bad, wouldn't this 
problem happen all the time. Is it possible to be only 
intermitent
2)If the brake servo passes the vaccum test, what else 
could cause this ?
Thanks and happy thanksgiving
mike
