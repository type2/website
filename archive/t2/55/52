it is for repair of steering wheels. It is a 2 part epoxy type paste. Drys
rock hard in 24 hours. Seems to be ever so slightly softer than the bakelight
plastic of the steering wheel. Makes it ideal for sanding to shape without
taking off the existing plastic as long as you use fine wet sandpaper. The
special paint someone is refering too was once called enamel. >>

No, I'm familiar with the PC-7 type of repair + painting. I'm really looking
for the formula for colored Bakelite...It's cellulose plus something based
and I was curious if it was possible to actually home manufacture a rim
for a "banjo" wheel. I've done one in mahogany in an octagon for an MG
(Natch!), now I'd thought I'd try a period Bakelite rim...
Thanks for the reply, anyway.
