so my main question is: is it possible for oil to leak out of the case =
bolts on a 1.8L engine?

i've rebuilt my engine and i've been tracking down oil leaks - i had a =
leak at the oil pump - fixed that with a new seal and some ultra silicon =
sealant...

but i've got another pretty fast leak at the left rear side - thought it =
was cooler seals so i replaced those (removing the fan housing is a =
PAIN!) - thought it might be pushrod seals too so i replaced two of them =
(on the pushrods that had oil on the bottom)... still leaking...

so here's what i see: the #4 exhaust pushrod tube has a sheen of oil on =
the bottom, and a drip at the junction closest to the outside (by the =
rockers)... there's also oil pretty much all over in that general area - =
around the case and bolts in that corner - the oil seems to leak down =
that corner of the case onto the fins on the bottom and runs along the =
fins, dripping off... don't see any oil on the seal to the filter =
bracket, but there is some oil drops on the bottom of the filter... i've =
checked the pressure sensor and it's not leaking at all - however, when =
i had the fan housing off to replace the cooler seals i did notice a =
sheen of oil on the tapped and plugged oil galley that's right below the =
sensor (on the fairing - is that the right word? - for the oil =
cooler)...

so i'm thinking either:
-my pushrod tube needs to be replaced with, again, new seals (all my =
tubes are a bit beat up but that seems to be the only one with oil on =
it)
-oil is leaking out of the case bolts on that side... is this possible?
-or oil is really leaking from that oil galley - problem with this is it =
doesn't look like it's coming from way up high - i don't really see much =
oil on the underside of that cooler fairing - but right below it there's =
oil everywhere...

any ideas? if there's oil on the bottom of a pushrod tube is that a sure =
sign it's coming from pushrod tube seals? that would be so much easier =
to deal with than if it is the galley plug

so close to being on the road!
