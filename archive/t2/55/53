Gillian,

I sympathize....Same thing happened to me at a New years eve celebration
at a bar....I have not been "out" on New Years eve since then....

I don't know if it is 9/11 or old age that is making me
cranky, but I'm getting to the point that if someone threatened me with a
tire tool right now, they would start having a very serious problem with
me.  They could threaten me with a bazooka and it wouldn't make any
difference.

I am *not* going to put up with people like that any more....

Sorry for the rant, but I *do* feel better now<grin>...and I'm still not
going to put up with it .

Cheers, dave
