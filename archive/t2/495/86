Subject: transmission issue

i was driving my 79 bus and suddenly i was no longer able to shift into
third...would go into fourth...but it was behaving like second...in that at
about 30 it was over revving...should have been under...there is also a
chirping noise when the bus is in motion...any ideas as to what is wrong? any
help would be greatly appreciated...i just got my bus back on the road and
this is discouraging.

thank you,
colby simpson
