Subject: RE: [T2] poptop seals

I replaced my '78 seals from Busdepot this past summer.
The one wrap around piece I trimmed and did NOT go between the pop-top part
and the luggage rack.
The "flap" piece attached to the pop-top part then presses against the
luggage rack when locked in place for travel.
