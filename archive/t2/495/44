Subject: Re: [T2] Porsche 912  Engine Swap

I had a pretty good look at that 912. The guy who owned it wanted to swap it
for my Harley I had at the time, which I wasn't going to do.  It had a 3
piece crankcase, sort of surface similarities to a Beetle engine, but
definitely was Porsche. I don't think it had anything much in common with
the 914/bus engine, it was more a carry forth of the 356 engine to the 911
body for only 1 year or so, I think 67. Or so I've been told. He had had the
engine custom built, and claimed it put out 150BHP, as opposed to the stock
90. My guess was that it would grenade shortly, even though I didn't own a
bus at that time, just my VW trike. :-)

Hi Tom,

The 912 is a 911 body that uses the T4 engine, basically the same as
that used in the 914 and in the later buses.

It was sold mainly in europe as the "poor man's" 911.
