Hey Steve. Is this a linux system? I have had little success putting my linux 
laptop "to sleep". I think I'm actually suspending to RAM. When it comes back 
up I lose the use of the keyboard and need to reboot. Maybe it's just my 
laptop. I'm using Mandrake 9.2.

I've used noatun with shortcut keys in the past to play mp3s in a vehicle. It 
worked OK. MDK 9.2 came with the Totem player which seems to do a good job of 
playing everthing...

Yeah, sounds to me like touch screen is indeed the way to go in a vehicle. 
Where did you get your screen from?

Got any pics? BTW, noticed your telus.net domain. Where abouts are you 
located?
