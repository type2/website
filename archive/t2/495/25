Subject: Clock wiring for 1978 Westfalia

I am restoring my 1978 Westfalia, and am finally getting around to wiring
up the optional stock clock in the instrument cluster I picked up a while ago.
I would appreciate any comments to either verify or recommend a different
way to wire it up. Here is what I did:

1) Clock Brown ground wire connected to ground spades in circle pattern on
back of speedo cluster

2) Clock light wire (grey/red) jumperd to wire that connects rest of
instrument lighting. I did this by inserting
    a multi-spade connector on the back of original single spade on the
emergency flasher switch.
    This is where existing instrument lighting wiring terminates (originates
at light switch).
    Then on the new multi spade connector I put on the original wiring for
instrument cluster
    and the new wire to the clock light.

3) Hooked up red power wire to top of fuse # 9 slot in the fuse box. My user
manual says
    this is for accessories, and it seemed to be empty on mine, with a couple
empty spade
    connectors. I attached the clock light wire to one of these empty ones.

Q1) Does anyone know if fuse # 9 is hot all the time, or only when key is
turned on ? I do not
have my battery/wiring installed since I just got the Bus back from the
painters, so cannot
test it. If not, which fuse slot should I use ?

Q2) # 9 fuse is a 16 amp fuse. Is this ok for the Clock, or do I need an 8 amp
to better
       protect the clock ? If so, any recommendation on which fuse slot I
should attach power to ?

Thanks all and have a great Holiday !
