   	  Black Coil 	 
 Size 	                 Larger 	
 Primary Resistance 	 1.0 ohms 	 
 Secondary Resistance 	 10.6K ohms 	 
 Turns ratio (calculated with 60hz power) 107.5 	

 Blue Coil
 Size                    Smaller
 Primary Resistance 	 1.3 ohms
 Secondary Resistance 	 8.95K ohms
 Turns ratio             80.6

 The Blue coil has a smaller turns ratio and this
would indicate that the current is higher for the same
spark voltage. The Blue coil also has a higher
resistance primary which would reduce distributor
current.
Higher voltage does not necessarily mean a better
coil. The spark plug will arc over as a function of
the gap/condition of the plug and the pressure in the
combustion chamber.
