Happy New Year Listees,

 ......."I hooked up my mechanical oil pressure gauge today but I
couldn't get my VDO hose to seal against the hole in the case.   What
I can't figure out is the threads of hose labeled (?1). It's the same
on each end and I can identify the other thread as an AN fitting.  Has
anyone else had this problem and identified these threads? ".......

Richard, do you have a tap and die set?  If so, the set may have a
thread pitch gauge that could help you figure out the threads on the
hose.  If it doesn't then try screwing different dies onto the end of
the hose until you find the one that fits.  Lacking  those options,
maybe someone else has a better suggestion for you.
