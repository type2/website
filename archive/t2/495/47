I'm assuming from the previous posts that this is a late 60's 912 setup (not
the 1976 912e).  

Others have addressed the engine issue and I fully agree - find a 912 or 356
owner who wants the proper engine for his/her car and doesn't mind spending
the money to rebuild it.  There are a lot of 912's running around with VW
motors because they're cheaper and much easier to get parts for.  Sorry - I
don't know what it's worth.

As to the transmission, it is basically the same 901 tranny that was used in
the pre-1970 911's (with different mounts, but interchangeable).  It should
be noted that there is a 4-sp and a 5-sp version so be sure of what you've
got.  If the tranny is in good, ready-to-use condition it'll usually fetch
anywhere from $300 - $600.  A lot of the racing guys actually prefer the
4-sp trannies and they're getting hard to find, but there's a bigger market
for the 5-sp variety.

You CAN use this tranny in a bus, but it's NOT a bolt-in swap.  And unless
you're planning on running it with a motor that'll put out a minimum of 90HP
and 100ft pounds of torque, you might as well forget about it 'cause you
won't have enough umph to make it work.

Now, if anybody IS looking for a 5-speed bus with a motor that'll make it
go, I've still got my 73 Westy up for sale...
