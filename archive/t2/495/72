That would connect to the charcoal canister that is used to collect  
fumes from the fuel tank.  You can see some additional details about  
these hook-ups here:

hose

These pictures are from a '76 2.0L with fuel injection, but you get the  
general idea.  If you don't have a charcoal canister, then I suggest  
you plug that hole by clamping a rubber cap over the nipple.

BTW, I would also suggest that you install an engine compartment seal;  
from this photo, it looks like yours is missing, and the seal is  
important for engine cooling.

Yah, that's the breather box.  Again, I have some pictures of this  
setup on a '76 2.0L with FI, taken when I fixed a vacuum leak resulting  
from a loose fitting on this hose:

I'm not sure exactly where the breather hose connects on a carbureted  
engine.  I see from the linkage in that photo that you have dual  
carburetors, in which case I couldn't even guess :-)

You'll need a molded hose for this.  For the fuel injected models, this  
hose is apparently NLA.  You'll see from my photos that I used a  
radiator hose of the approximate size that has a similar molded bend.   
It's not an oil-resistant hose, but the hose is cheap, and it'll work  
until I can find a correct replacement.

That one I can't help you with.

The small hose on the canister usually connects to the fuel tank  
breather lines, to collect fumes.  Then, when the engine is running,  
the fan pushes air through the charcoal canister, which pushes the  
collected fumes into the air cleaner (the two large hoses).  On the FI  
models, a vacuum-actuated valve opens up in the air cleaner to let the  
fumes enter the air stream.

On dual carburetor setups, I don't know which air cleaner these  
connections hook up to, or if they hook up to both.  And if you don't  
have the stock air cleaners, I don't know if they'll hook up at all.
