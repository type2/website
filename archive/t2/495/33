Hi Folks:

Before everyone jumps to conclusions, we had a NASTY storm here 
yesterday and early today and the folks in Redding got it as SNOW! 
Also a lot of power is out and phone service.  Redding is 3 -4 hours 
north from me but I looked at the weather maps.  We still have power 
out in places here and broken trees everywhere.

Let's hope the "boys" are down in Brazil scoring more parts for us!

BEN
