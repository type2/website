Subject: Re: [T2] Porsche 912  Engine Swap

Hello Guys   Being a 356C owner and driver for over 20 years  I think I could 
tell you about them.  The early 912 had basically the same motor as the 63-65 
356C except for the rear crossbar, the 912E had the 914 motor. The 356-912 
motors had problems with the cranks breaking mostly due to high RPMs , I broke 
mine 2 years ago and replace it with a 912 crank. Parts are exspensive for 
these babies, cranks run about a grand . but they will run  and you can get some 
good horsepower from them  up to about 250 if you know what ya doing. I agree 
with Tony that you can built 4-5 vw motors for 1 912 motor , and that the 356 
group would buy it in a heart beat myself included even thu I have 3 912 motors 
already. I just gave my wife a 66 912 for her 40th brithday that i put a 
2180cc vw motor in. It is faster with the vw motor .The 912 motor itself would fit 
in a bus without much trouble.later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import
