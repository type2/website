Jamie, when you got your boots did they have the metal
end on them or just the rubber by itself, you don't
reuse the clamps, you cut them off and put new ones
on, the only one I have to worry about is the small
clamp that fits around the axel, and I use a zip tie
for it, holds just as well as the metal clamp. Did
this help or just make matters worse... Phil  P.S. I
just repacked mine with new Rockford CV  boots they
looked good, now if they will just last longer than
400 miles.
