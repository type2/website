Hello Greg   Where are you?? The motor is easy to install in a 68 bus just 
have to fab the crossbar, The trans will be a little harder as the mounts are 
different. also the tin work will be different on the motor . Something is 
stange with thelist I didn;t see your first post or any of my replies don't know if 
they are getting thur to the list but the persons are getting them  But as I 
said on the motor they are expensive to rebuild but when done right they are 
very tough The only other problem would be that they come with a lightened 
flywheel for quick accleration in the car and this doesn't work as well in a bus   
later and have fun  Mark Dearing   Salem Import Service  Salem Va
