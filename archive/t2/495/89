Subject: selenoid for starter

Hi guys

I've run into a few times when I go to start the van
and I simply hear a click but no starter. Battery is good
connection is good, no corrosion on posts or stuff.

Got reading one of the books and it suggests the selenoid
is bad. I had gotten underneath the van and hit it a few times
with a plastic ended screwdriver. Might have knocked the wires
a little. Anyway it started. It's done it 3 times in the last 2 weeks.
Twice in the last 3 days.

Does this sound like the selenoid. Does it start to do it randomly
or is there something else Im missing. How easy is it to fix the problem?

Thanks!
James
