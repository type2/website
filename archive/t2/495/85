Subject: RE: [T2] Side Tents for $49! - UPDATE

Well, our site got hammered, and we've already sold out of the $49
factory-second tents. Wow, that was fast!  If you ordered one, and we
haven't already called or emailed you to inform you that we had to
cancel your order, then we expect to be able to fill your order. They
should all be shipped by Friday. Congrats to those who were quick with
the mouse. :-) 

We do have a few of the $79 budget-priced awnings left, though (see
below).  They are likely to sell out pretty quickly, too, so hurry if
you're interested.  Thanks, and have a happy and safe New Year!!!
