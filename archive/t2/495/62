Subject: Pictures of Disconnected VW parts

Hello,

72 VW bus needs help reconnecting parts

http://rich12345.tripod.com/one.bmp

here are links to pictures of the  parts I cannot find 
connections/descriptions for.

picture one is a hose connection (where a hose SHOULD go) on the left side 
of the engine, on the plastic shroud, next to the coil.  where should this 
go?  no hose connected

picture two is the box on top of the engine.  Appears to be ?crankcase 
breather?  this should go to carb, correct?  blow by gas fume recollection?  
there is a hose connection on it, but no hose.

picture three is vacuum switch looking device, mounted to roof of engine 
compartment.  has electrical connection, and hose connection on rear 
(pictured), and hose connection on front.  very small hose, like 1/8" inner 
diameter.

The charcoal canister has two large hoses coming from it, and one small 
hose.  The large hoses match the connection on picture 1 and picture two 
(left of engine fan shroud connection and crankcase breather connect), and 
also match a connection to the top of the aircleaner.  The small hose 
matches the size of the connection on the vacuum switch in picture 3.

so, I have 3 places where large hoses should go (left of engine fan shroud 
pic 1, crank case breather pic 2, right side of charcoal canister) but only 
two hoses (one from left of charcoal canister, one from the carb on the 
right).  where does the last hose connection go?  maybe a T connector?  I 
think pic 1 connector is pressure from fan.  no vapor.  pic 2 would be 
crankcase pressure, with vapor.  should all go through canister, into carb?

the small hose connector on the canister....maybe connect to the vacuum 
switch, but what would the point of this be?

any help in the correct direction is appreciated.

Rich
