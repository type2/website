Subject: GEX SN#

Hi Volks hope you all had happy holidaysand more to come as we press into 
the New Year.
I know the GEX thread is old but i have found something that is puzzling. In 
previous threads about the GEX engines I read that GEX grinds the numbers 
off the case. If so they may have missed one. I have GEX stickers on my case 
but i also have numbers too.

EC008811,   I believe this is a case for a '74 Cali FI 1800. This thing is 
in my 77 Westy Auto. I try not to assume to much so would it be correct to 
say that they missed one or is the number grinding a probable tale? Also 
what would be the difference in this case as opposed to the stock case that 
should be in my bus? TIA.
