Theodore,

I also use the xr700 system, with a non-resistance type coil (pertronix
flamethrower). It works perfectly with a ballast resistor installed.

I would use a ballast resistor with your setup. The coil you have is fine,
and your ignition will work without the resistor, but it is better to
install one to protect the ignition module. I've run mine both ways with no
change in performance, but the transistor on the module did get hot without
the resistor.
