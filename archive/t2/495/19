Subject: For Owners of $79 Bus Depot Awning

If you own our $79 Awning, just a quick note that we have a closeout on
the optional side wall for it. 
It was $50 but is now $19.95. Only 10 available. You can use up to two
walls per awning.

(And if you don't have an awning, you can still buy both the awning and
the side wall, at the special price.)
