Subject: ratwell website re-org

My bus website has over 1100 photos and I'm starting to lose count. Not only
that but it seems to be straining the limits of Apple's website creation
tools. To temporarily workaround the problems I've split the site in two:

* Restoration

http://homepage.mac.com/ratwell/78_Westy/

* Parts

http://homepage.mac.com/ratwell/Parts/

Thanks for all the kind comments from all the visitors during the last two
years. It's been a pleasure to host the photos and I'm sure I'll be taking
more in 2004.
