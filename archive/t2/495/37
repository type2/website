He mentioned it threw a rod. I knew a guy who had a 912, he bought it with a
broken crankshaft. If we can infer that it's not the strongest engine in the
world, not sure how durable such an engine would be in a bus.

 I doubt either will just drop in. That 912 engine shares a lot of basic
design with the Type I engine but all the parts are Porsche numbered and
ever so slightly different. Some are really different.
