Subject: Re: [T2] Porsche 912  Engine Swap

To elaborate on my original post:

The engine in question is from a 1968 912, and the transmission is 
definitely a 5 speed (with the racing H pattern, 1st is down and to the 
left where reverse is on our VWs).  I was the last person to drive this car 
when the engine gave out.  No drama, it just slowly stopped running one day 
on the highway, and although we never tore the engine apart, the 
consensus  opinion was that threw a rod.  The car had a worn distributor so 
I had to adjust the timing weekly and it ate points like candy.  But other 
than that it was bone stock and pretty reliable.  The 912 weighs approx 
2100 lbs, and I managed to see 105mph with 4 people and 2 cases of beer in 
the trunk.  I think it could move my 2500 lbs 1968 Kombi without falling apart.

The car sits at my uncle's house.  He and my father rescued the car from a 
junkyard, and among other repairs replaced the right half-shaft with one 
from a bug.  I'm sure for the right amount of beer and sailing gear, I can 
acquire useful parts from this car.  The body is shot, the floor pans have 
fallen off, and although there are people crazy enough to restore a car 
this far gone, neither my uncle nor I know them.

Since the engine design is basically the same as the Type 1 (hmmm, who 
designed these engines again?), my thought was a complete swap of the 
engine and transmission.  Honestly, the transmission is more interesting to 
me than the engine, but doubling horsepower and increasing torque by 50% 
doesn't seem like a bad thing.

My short list of items to plunder are

Transmission (close ratio 5-speed 902/50, I believe)
Engine
Wheels (has the Fulch 15x5,5J Alloys)
Axles/disk brakes
Steering wheel :-)

Am I crazy?  The engine would need a teardown and rebuild, and I would do 
as much of the work as I could.  If massive fabrication is required to 
install the engine, I would agree it is not work the time to pursue.  Ditto 
with the transmission, although I can take as much of the Porsche's drive 
train as i would need.

If not this Porsche transmission, has anyone converted their 1600 SP port 
bus to a 5 speed?

Finally, if this is far beyond a pipe dream and is really a full blown 
nightmare, I guess we could sell the car for parts.  I'd be willing to pass 
any leads to my uncle if anyone has interest in the car.
