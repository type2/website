Subject: Fw: [T2] Coil Resistance 

It seems Bosch Blue Coils have changed over the years. The one I have on my
bus had no resistance written on the box. I'm not sure what the effect of
this is? I ran the same set of points practically forever, and they didn't
fail prematurely or anything. I am now running Pertronix, and it seems to be
working fine too. Not sure about this resistance thing with these coils. The
guy at Bowwow Parts in Boise ID had a few different Blue coils, but wouldn't
sell me one because he wasn't clear on it either.
