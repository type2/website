Rust in your biggest enemy on the east coast. The steering box is a
hassle, but it's worse if the actual axle beam is rotted and this was
misdiagnosed as a bad steering box. This is a much more common scenario
on east coast busses than a worn steering box. See my Buyers Guide at
http://busdepot.com/links.jsp#GUIDE for some tips on what to look for
when buying a bus.
