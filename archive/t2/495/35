I doubt either will just drop in. That 912 engine shares a lot of basic design with the Type I engine but all the parts are Porsche numbered and ever so slightly different. Some are really different.

That transmission was designed to scoot along a 2000 lb. car not your heavy bus. Something to consider...

My advice would be to sell the engine to a needy Porsche owner and use it to buy/rebuild a good bus style engine.
