Colby,

Do you have the Bentley manual? It has the adjustment procedure you can do at the shift rod inside the cab.

It's the easiest/fastest/cheapest/first place to check.

1. Put the bus in second gear

2. Loosen the two 13mm bolts on the floor

3. Move shifter so that the bottom of the shifter before the bend is perpendicular with the floor of the bus, ie: straight up.

4. Push the reverse lock out plate (thing with tabs sticking out both sides) all the way to the right.

5. Moving the lockout plate forward favors engagement of 2/4. Moving it backward favors 1/3.

6. Tighten the bolts

Whaddya got now?

Billy
