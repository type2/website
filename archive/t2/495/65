Subject: original tire specs

I found an interesting tidbit in the VW Bus Performance book published by
Brooklands Books.

On page 101 is a Jan 77 review of a new bus and it mentions that the stock
tires are made-in-Germany Continental Radials 185R x 14C, Load Range C,
constructed with 6 rayon tread plies and two rayon sidewall plies.

Of course Continental wasn't the only brand used but what's interesting is
that the load rating for the tire is also listed: 1675 lb at 55 psi.
