Subject: Porsche 912  Engine Swap

I have a friend who put a 912 engine in his '68 Crewcab and as much as he
raves about it I'm never surprised when it breaks down on him. To make it
work he had to fabricate for the Porsche crossbar, much of the engine tin,
throttle linkage, & heating components. In addition it took a clever mix
and match of flywheel/clutch components to make it mate up with the trans.
Yes, it can leave many cars in its dust, but for my money, I'll stick with
something VW based. Which is exactly what I'm doing in 10 days when I'll
be going down to Phoenix to have my new 1904cc engine installed in my '71
Adventurewagen. It has a new case with thick walled 88 P/Cs, 78 crank,
and dual Kadrons on single port heads. I'm expecting that I should be able
to surprise some people going up steep grades.
