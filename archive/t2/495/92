A new-bug drivin' friend of mine at work picked one up for me...

(like I'm goin' to the dealer..even though we have a jetta!)

And it is nice. Starin' at the January '50 beetle right now!

p.s.

You might start seeing me more on type2 as I started clearing out the garage to begin re-assembling the almost perfect '79 deluxe sunroof I bought for $150!

Problems I see ahead:

1. Need to smog till 2008 
2. No title/paperwork
3. Live in California

Ugh.
