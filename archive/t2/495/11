My concern is purely for having correct resistance so I don't fry the 
Pertronix module.  I will check the resistance on my existing coil 
first, and if it's correct, I'll likely put off buying the new coil a 
month or two.

But the idea was to swap in the Pertronix and a new Blue coil, and put 
the old points, condenser, and Black coil (i.e. my "known good 
configuration") in with the tool kit I carry in the Bus at all times, 
just in case the Pertronix fails.
