The 914 engines will work just fine in a 72-79 bus.  There are a few
differences that present some difficulties, but nothing major.  Here's the
ones I can think of off-hand:

  1.  If it's a 2.0 914 with the correct (3-bolt intake) heads, the spark
plugs are located differently so you'll have to drill new holes in your bus
tin and fill the old ones (fiberglass works fine for this).
  2.  The oil filler is on TOP of the engine instead of at the rear.  Some
of the 914 engines have a screw-cap on top of the breather box for filling
oil.  If you're going to use a 914 motor, it's worth getting this style
breather otherwise you've got to slip the bail and remove the breather to
fill the oil.  You'll also need to cover the hole in the sheetmetal where
the bus filler tube would have come through.  The alternative would be to
open the case and fit a bus filler tube to it - the castings are the same,
just not opened up on a 914 motor.  I haven't done this so can't say how
involved it is.
  3.  The dipstick is on top of the engine right next to the breather.  This
a nuisance, but not a real problem.  You can cut the top of the dipstick
tube about 1.5 inches (and the same off the dipstick itself) so it's
possible to pull the dipstick without doing it through the top engine hatch.
Probably could fit a bus dipstick tube, but I don't know...
  4.  You MUST use the bus tin, motor mounts, clutch, heat exchangers, and
muffler - the 914 stuff is completely different.
  5.  You mentioned a 79 bus?  If you use the 914 heads, they exhaust ports
are oval just like the 72-78 bus type IV heads so you can't use the 79 heat
exchangers since they're designed for the square-port heads.

Well, that about covers it.  Everything else is pretty much interchangeable.
If I missed anything I'm sure someone will chime in.
