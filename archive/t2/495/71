Eric Eisenberg runs Very Wild Car Company in Wilmington, DE.  His number 
is 302.738.8989 and he's right off 495 (Govenor Prince BLVD exit).

He's almost entirely air-cooled and knows his stuff.  

There's another German Autoworks in Wilmington run by an older German 
gentleman who comes highly recommended, but I don't know the name of his 
shop.

Eric is probably more likely to fix what you want him to fix and ignore 
other issues if you ask him to.  The German gentleman may be more likely 
to say "I need to fix it all or I won't fix anything".

However, as usual the only way you know that everything will be done with 
the amount of attention to detail that you desire is by doing it yourself.
