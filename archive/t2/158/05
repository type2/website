Subject: Tranny Questions for the Wee Morn.

Morning!

Well as per my previous post, the engine is out, and the input shaft *was* 
sliding out :-(

So I've been told that this is a circlip that holds this piece in. Here are 
my questions:

1. Repair or Replace, I am kinding leaning to replace, when I drove the bus 
home from the PO's place, I noticed that even with the clutch depressed the 
bus seemed to be "dragging" but not apparently because of the clutch. I've 
also noticed that the tranny is covered in thick goo. I am betting that if I 
check the fluid level I'll be in for a big surprise.

2. How difficult to repair? Can it be done in the bus?

3. Replace, someone in this bus' lifetime someone welded the shift linkage 
cage in place :-( So I am stuck as to removing the old cage. I am thinking of 
breaking out the drummel and going to town with some cutting disks. (I 
already have the new one in hand)

Thanks as always, this is a great and helpful list. All of you people are 
wonderful.

Tyler.
