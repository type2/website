Richard,
I found the same wierd material under my upholstery 
while recovering my rear/middle seats.  I did as Greg 
did, and re-used it, over a couple of layers of 
burlap/sackcloth stuff.  It wasn't deteriorated at 
all, so reuse seemed the right thing to do.  Both 
seats had it under the upholstery.
I'm not that crazy about the foam, only because it 
doesn't seem to last 30+ years like the original stuff.

Good luck on your project,

Later,
