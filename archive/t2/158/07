Tyler,

Welded cage? as in welded it to both the tranny linkage and the rod 
linkage????  *bad, bad* PO!

If both sides and ya gotta pull the tranny to fix the circlip, then 
unscrew the pin in the center of the cage and take the tranny out to work 
on it...much easier than metal fillings in the eye.

Then you can pull the shift rod linkage and R&R it also.

Goo on the trans is pretty much standard.....

Never would have believed that the shaft was coming out.....amazing!

Cheers, dave
