Subject: Ohio VW Buses 'n Boats

Howdy All,
I apologize for taking up list space with this, but I want to be sure not to miss any bus owners. I promise this will be the last time I post info related to this event (until next year, anyway ;^)
So: Only 2 days until the Second Annual VW Buses 'n Boats Bash just North of Cincinnati, Ohio May 17-19.  Weekend will feature VW's, FMBC Breakfast Burritos, An 8 mile canoe trip on the Little Miami River (if it's not flooded!) and Live Music in the campground. Check out the event web page at  http://www.geocities.com/buses_n_boats
for all the info or contact me directly.



Peace, John Baker
