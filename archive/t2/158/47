No, that pic [fig 5-2] is of the manual trans decel valve. The auto trans
decel is a tall cylinder. The hose that goes to the valve from the big S hose
is rubber with a small end on it. Not the large cloth covered hose.

#5 is the manual trans decel valve
#47 is the cloth covered hose

#4 is the auto trans decel valve
#45 is the rubber hose
