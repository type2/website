Sure, I've seen lots of clasp hinges with padlocks.  I can't believe anyone 
would be so crude.  If you must have a locking door, you can get nice lock 
mechanisms for a few bucks at the hardware store that only require a small 
round hole be cut into the door and perhaps a small L-bracket mounted to 
the body inside the door.  I'd still rather not have a lock - I'd rather 
have someone steal all 15 gallons of gas than take a screwdriver to my 
locked filler door and do $200 worth of body damage.  As for people who 
like to dump stuff in gas tanks, they are rare enough that I don't worry 
about it.
