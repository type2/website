Tom,

I more-or-less agree with Rick that it shouldn't make a difference with the 
type of vacuum gauge that I have, but I have a vague recollection that I 
was seeing lower vacuum at higher altitudes.  Only problem is that it has 
been a couple of years since I drove the bus much above sea level, and I 
can't remember for sure.  How's that for a straight answer?  :)
