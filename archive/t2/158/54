Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Vacuum gauge

it's common knowledge that manifold vacuum decreases as elevation or air
pressure decreases. I'm very surprised that nobody has ponied up this info
yet (if they did, I missed it).

this is also why you need to size your carb's venturis (carb sizing) smaller
the higher the elevation the engine will be operated at, so you don't lose
your vacuum signal to the fuel circuit.
