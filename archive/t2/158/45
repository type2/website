John, 

There is a number stamped right below the 1-4-3-2 firing order and it's AB
796904. Is that it? 

Thanks, 

Trey

If it is a bug engine, then the generator will be the right one for the
motor and cause no problems. To find out what your engine is from look at
the code stamped on the base of the generator stand. Post that number to the
list and I am SURE someone can tell you definitively if it is a beetle
engine.
