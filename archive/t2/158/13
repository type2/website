Subject: Trademark infringement

Their is a whole article in the new VW trends this month (July) about the
trademark issues with VWoA. I have not read it, but am getting ready to.
They interviewed a lawyer for VWoA for their answers to why they are
screwing up all the aircooled business. Just thought I would let everybody
know.
