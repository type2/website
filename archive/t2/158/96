Subject: Re: [T2] Locking filler door

If you really want to use a locking gas cap rather than modifying your door,
just take your tank to a radiator shop or welding shop, with the neck to a
tank that will accept a locking cap.  A reputable shop can handle this  kind
of modification, and you won't have to put a hole in the sheet metal.  Plus,
IF someone wanted in there that bad, at least they'd screw up a cheap cap,
rather than tear up your fuel door and fender.

Just a thought.
