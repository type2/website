Trey
Its not a bug/bus issue but rather a 30 vs 38 amp generator issue.
The 38 amp gen is longer and requires a mounting plate with a recessed
area. Likely you have a mismatch. If it sticks out too far then you prob
have a 38 amp gen and flat 30 amp backing plate. If it doesnt stick out
far enough then you prob have a 30 amp gen and recessed 38 amp plate.

I hope this is clear.
