Just go to the junkyard and look for 80's vintage Japanese cars. They often

As for the locking gas cap - beware the common brands (mine is a Stan?) use 
keys that are often interchangeable. Basically one key fits many gas caps. 
Not very secure.

Has anyone ever tried to find a locking gas cap for the 71 style. Actually
