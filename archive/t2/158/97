Subject: Re: [T2] Locking filler door

	It might actually be 'easier' and nicer looking to fab a newer(later model) 
filler to your bus that accepts a locking cap.  I have to agree with whoever 
mentioned the damage that could be caused by the curious/reckless passerby.  
Another option would be to fabricate something like the 68'-71'(?) beetles 
had as locking doors for their gas-tank filler.
