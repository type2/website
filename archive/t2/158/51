Thanks David, I guess at this point I'll have to consider it opinion rather
than fact that vacuum decreases with altitude.
I have a concern because some folks on the list are getting 16inHg + at idle.
The best I get is around 14. I'm hoping that's attributable to the lighter air
density up here but I'd feel so much better if I knew this was a fact.
Thanks again,
Tom
