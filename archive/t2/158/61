Hmmm.  I was probably a little unclear in my last post.  I was trying to say
that the vacuum gauge itself will function accurately at elevation.  But it
would make sense that for the engine to idle, it has to overcome a certain
amount of compression and friction loads, which don't change much with
altitude.  This requires about the same amount of work as at sea level,
which would require the same mass of fuel & air.  Since density is lower at
altitude, the engine would need a greater air volume to maintain the same
idle speed, which would mean less vacuum.  Makes sense to open the idle
adjust to allow more air volume in (my idle adjust is usually closed tight
to keep idle < 1000).  14" sounds like a good idle number for high altitude,
compared to my 19" at sea level.

I love it when a logic chain reaches the desired conclusion (it doesn't
always work out that way :)

it's common knowledge that manifold vacuum decreases as elevation or air
pressure decreases. I'm very surprised that nobody has ponied up this info
yet (if they did, I missed it).

this is also why you need to size your carb's venturis (carb sizing) smaller
the higher the elevation the engine will be operated at, so you don't lose
your vacuum signal to the fuel circuit.
