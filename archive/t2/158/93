My experience is different.  A high-quality replacement (genuine VW from
whereever, Dansk, Leistritz) goes on much easier than the cheap mufflers.
It doesn't have to be from Germany, but you get what you pay for.

If you have to bend anything, bend the muffler, not the heat risers.  They
won't take much abuse!
