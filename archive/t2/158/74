Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Cap

I have to spray a bit of silicone spray on my gas cap to get it off and on 
from time to time.

Not good if you have an O2 sensor as I think silicone will poison it.

On my gas cap it is friction between the gasket&cap and gasket&filler neck.

Silicone makes it slide around easily and all is well.
