Steve,

I have done the filler door lock on a 67.

Go look at locks at the hdware store and pick and choose, biggest thing
to watch for is the amount of clearance between the lock arm and the
clearance for something to catch on inside the flap area.

Something like the locks available for tool chests is good.

Cheers, dave
