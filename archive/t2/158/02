Subject: Re: [T2] What is this material?

It's a covering material made of various reclaimed textiles.  I recently
restored my seat backs and couldn't find the stuff anywhere.  A lady at an
upholstery shop said it is not used anymore.  The modern day substitute is a
fluffy white polyester stuff of about the same thickness.  I bought some but
didn't end up using it.

I pulled of all the old horsehair and remains of that mystery material, then
covered the springs in burlap and tied that down.  Then on top of the burlap, I
layed down 1 inch of firm density upholstery foam.  I wrapped it around the
edges a bit and over the top, and then stretched the cover back over it.  Looks
and feels fantastic.
