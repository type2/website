I seem to remember a website where someone made one of these out of a garden
sprayer and an extra master cylinder cap fitted with a barbed fitting. One
could probably make one for less than $20. I know that Home Depot sells a
gallon sprayer for $10.

I've just used this device to replace the brake fluid in my three running 
AC VWs.
It's BY FAR the best of the several techniques I've tried.  Worth every
penny.
