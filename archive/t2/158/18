Subject: how to remove front door????

hello,

i need to know how to remove the front passenger door
on a 76 bus. the two pairs of bolts are easy, however
there is some sort of bar towards the bottom or the
door which connects door to vehicle, cant figure out
how to get it free. 

thanks in advance, as per. any and all insights,
answers, or opinions will be greatly appreciated.
thanks again.
