Subject: head (2)

Ok, I was wondering if anyone had a used 1700 head. As
it turns out, I have a 1700 type IV engine. My
mistake. I would like the head to be free of those
pollution controls, if possible. Just email me.
                                 Thanks
                                 Paul Deatherage
