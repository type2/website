Hi Greg,

Yes this could definitly be caused by excessive wear to the stop plate (especialy as you have removed more common causes by replacing the front bushing and rear connector).
The best soloution would be to get a replacement stop plate, second best would be to apply a bead of weld into the gouges and then to file flat with the underside and vertical face, remembering to shape it slightly upwards at the front to allow the stick to go into reverse.

Good luck
