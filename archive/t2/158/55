Subject: Still looking for EGR pipes for my 75

Still looking for EGR pipes for my 75. I'm trying to find the pipe that
goes from the vacuum actuated EGR valve to the throttle assembly. I have
one that came off a 78 but it is wrong for the 75. Also trying to find a
filter in usable or rebuildable condition. Maybe there is someone out
there who needs the 78 pipe or some cash? Hate to take up your time with
this kind of stuff but none of the salvage yards in Northern Az. have
what I need.
Thanks,
Tom
