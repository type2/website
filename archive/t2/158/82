Subject: Locking filler door

Has anyone ever tried to find a locking gas cap for the 71 style. Actually
it appears that a locking gas cap can't be made for this type of filler. 

This leads me to my next question. Has anyone ever fabricated a lock for the
filler door?

The '73 is different.  The '71 had that lovely big fill opening (you can
actually see the gas in the tank through it!) and the corresponding big
cap, which probably isn't available at the FLAPS.  The caps aren't all
that uncommon and should be available through VW suppliers or at swaps.  I
think that
they are the same as on early bugs, type III, etc.
