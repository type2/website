Subject: What is this material?

I started the reconditioning of my seats last night and after I got the seat
covers off I found a layer of padding between the horsehair and the seat.
Looks like this:

Does anyone know what this is made of and where I can find it?  Looks like a
mixture of cotton string.  If it's not available, what is the modern
synthetic substitute?
