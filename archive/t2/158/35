Chris,

I'm not sure if the 71 is the same as my 73, but I found that some evil
previous owner had hammered up my filler spout pretty bad.  I had to
bend it flat and it sealed a little better.  I got a new locking cap
(Stant) and it sealed a little better yet (new sealing material) but I
still got some slosh-out on left hand turns.  That's when I got a
flashlight, don't use a match 8-) and found that there is a gradual
ledge that was bent over.  I used a paint can opener to grab the bottom
and bend it back into shape.  Now when I lock it down and twist a half
turn, it seals down nicely.

Take a look and see if yours is the same.  Also check the seal on your
cap.
