Subject: Re: [T2] Upper Ball Joint adjustment wrench

Bill,

just to clarify, are you speaking of the camber adjustment bushing?  if so,
read on.

a couple of years ago a had an auto shop teacher who had a wrench that
worked perfectly for this.  he told me it was a water pump wrench for a
chevy or ford. honestly i can't remember which, memory is getting a little
hazy. it had a very thin profile which made it easy to get to the bushing.
there wasn't enough room in there to use a regular open-ended wrench.

ask around at FLAPS for this tool.  sorry to be so vague but hope that
helps,
