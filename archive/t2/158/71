Subject: Re: [T2] pop-top roof and spare tire mount

I have a nose mounted spare tire - makes my neck realllllly tired...

The spare tire on my bus though doesn't seem to suffer from fatigue because 
the weight of the tire is on the bumper. It's a 195/75-R14. I don't plan to 
use it b/c I have 205/70-R14 tires on it and there is a teensy little 
difference in circumference. However I will use it versus leaving the bus 
on the side of the road or walking home of course....

I have also created extensions on the bolts for the spare tire so that the 
front of the wheel faces outward and I can put a hubcap on it to make it 
pretty. I don't really care for the vinyl spare tire covers.

And again the tire sits on the bumper.

In the hubcap side out configuration I may later discover the metal flexing 
because the tire is moving around - trying to roll side to side - it has. 
In that case I will have to create rubber stops that bolt to the bumper and 
keep the wheel from wanting to roll.
