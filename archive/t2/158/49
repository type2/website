Subject: Re: [T2] Generator question on 71 Westy

Yes, the bus generator is longer.
Yes, the tin plate that mounts the generator to the shroud is special, it is
dished.
Yes, you can bolt on a Bosch or Motorola internal regulator using the tin
plate you have now. If you had the dished bus one, it would not work.
You will need to replace the stand and the fuel pump and the fuel pump push
rod.
Or, I have a good 71 bus only generator with the correct dished plate since I
just converted to alternator on my 67 bus......
