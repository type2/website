Subject: parts for trade...

Gentlepersons-
                       Two (count 'em) tailight lenses and housings from '69
K-G. Lenses are in good shape, housings are not but are included.
                       Five trim rings for wheels from same '69.

Will trade for late type 2 parts...All trades considered (I'll just add 'em
to the keep my bus on the road forever inventory).
Whatcha got ??-) (Morgan or Bugeye parts, too, but that's a stretch)

BTW...I sent a Porsche wheel out into the ether a while back but lost
the address of who got it...Hint. Hint.
