Thanks Rick, most informative. I was curious because I was used to using vacuum
gauge to assist in locating vacuum leaks. After fixing the major leak I had and
a couple smaller leaks I am still only getting about 14 inHg and rock steady at
idle regardless of temp. This may be due to the fact that to get 900 rpm at idle
up here, I have to open my Idle Air adjustment screw farther than if I were at
sea level, I hope. Just trying to find confidence that I have found all the
leaks. Your explanation leaves me feeling a bit better.
Thanks,
Tom
