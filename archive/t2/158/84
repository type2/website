hi there...i purchased a BAP Virtually New Longblock, and i've had it runnin in my 70westie for about 500miles now. of course i'm still breakin her in, but i haven't had any probs with it sofar. i went w/the DualPort, and put a new oilcooler, carb&manifold on, to avoid throwin any debrie into her. tryin to do it right, so that my warranty will hold up, if it comes to that. 
anyways..this is my first volksie, so i'm taken it slow and being very careful right now. 
if any one else out there is runnin a BAP engine, your input on how it's holdin up, would be much appreciated. 
*shine on* -Chris
(gettin ready to roll the bussie from E.Oregon all the way HOME to the midwest) btw; is anyone else goin to the gathering this yr? peace
