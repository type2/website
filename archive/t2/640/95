Thanks Mark. I was under the impression this motor was a pull from a 914, 
but I am not sure. As for the trans, I didn't look at any (it wasn't 
attached to the motor), but I was just told there were several porsche 4 and 
5 speed trannies to choose from, and no idea of what models they are.

You may be right about the 411 as this one has the removable oil cap Mike 
mentioned.

 would switch it over personally .  Is this a 914 or a 912E motor and 
trans???
 The 914 would be harder to use the trans from also all the 914s I have seen
 have 3 bolt intakes and breather ports in the top of the heads. Sounds like
 someone either has a 411,412 motor in there or changed the heads,   The 
dipstick
 should also be on top beside the breather  .   Anyway it should work 
later
