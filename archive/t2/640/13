All legislation, by the time it passes, is a compromise between several 
interests and constituencies. The environmentalists who push for smog 
laws would love to promote all sorts of things that we bus lovers would 
probably love, too. But to get anything that they want, they have to 
mobilize other interests (such as new car dealers). That's just the way 
democracy works (most of the time).

If I had the time and money (or support from an interest group), I 
could probably challenge the new law by driving Peregrine (when I get 
her engine done) as a refusenik, get cited, and take the case up 
through the courts with the argument that I purchased the bus under one 
set of regulatory assumptions and now have to operate under another 
set. There's a chance that this argument could win -- eventually. I'm 
not a lawyer, but I think the new law is clearly flawed.

Now, I don't have the money to do this. But Jay Leno does. So do plenty 
of people with high-end cars. This isn't finished yet. The change in 
the law constitutes a case of "taking."
