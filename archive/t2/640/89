Subject: Re: [T2] Sagging rear of Bus

My camper came from Westfalia with load levelor coil over shocks, according to
the mcodes,, and what was on when I got it... I have replaced them with astro
van coil overs,,  3 times,, as the chrome continues to peel off the rod and pit,
then tears the seals and leaks.... I got fed up and went with stock shocks...
the rear is only lifted 1/2inch  measured at the center of the rear wheel from
the fender lip to the ground..

I can live with the rear of my bus being 1/2inch lower,,, as it is in spec...

But if you want to try it,, using shocks. here is a link
