A lot of your success will be determined by your outlook. If you get
to the point that you perceive the bus as a burden instead of a good
reliable form of transportation you might as well give in, but I
encourage you to work though this problem and enjoy the bus more.

Like don suggested check the valve to make sure it hasn't gotten
tight, although w/ a 79 you should have hydraulic valves. I'd start to
kinda wonder what might have caused this anyway. What did the spark
plugs look like? Is #3 running lean. I squirt of oil will usually only
overcome badly worn rings, not a valve that is trashed. If #3 is the
one that keeps going south that is an indicator that something is
amiss there. My blind guesses would be a fuel injector that is
somewhat clogged, or perhaps a lifter that isn't operating correctly.
