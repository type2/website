Subject: Brake Booster Replacement

Hello List,

I need to replace my Brake Booster (aka servo). I have a good used one. 
Is it nesassary to drain/bleed the brakes to do this job?

I remember having to do it once before but that was a while ago. I plan to
keep the existing master cylinder.

Bentley makes no reference to draning or bleeded for the procedure...kinda
weird.


It seems too easy to just pull the old one out and bolt the new one in.

thanks,
