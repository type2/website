The change in the law will do _nothing_ to have your bus "run better, get
better gas mileage, and pollute less".  You could have done these things
at any time regardless of the law.  The law does nothing to make it easier
to get parts or anything else needed to make our vehicles cleaner.

The fact is, the change is a way that the legislators can give the
impression of "doing something" without having it affect the legislators
themselves (they seldom own cars old enough to even need to b smogged
once) or those people who feed money to the politicians (ditto).

Sorry, but I'm not buying their BS.
