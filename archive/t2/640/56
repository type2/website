Subject: Tranny interchangeability? Bearing replacement?

Listees,

I have consulted the library and Richards FAQ but I still have some 
questions about what trannies will fit my 71 Westy.

It seems that only a 002 tranny will mate correctly with my engine and that 
a 68-71 the flywheel is the same.

But I have my eye on a 72 tranny which has the 210 mm flywheel, would I just 
have to replace my current flywheel with the bigger one? Would my current 
axles mate correctly with any 68-75 tranny or should I get the axles too if 
I can.

Also my problem is a howling bearing. I've heard that the case can be opened 
and the bearing replaced which is alot simplier than messing with all the 
gearing. How big of a job is this. It's never popped out of gear, thinking 
my synchros are ok for now.

But also thinking of getting this tranny from a 72 then installing and 
seeing how it is then getting my correct tranny completely rebuilt.

Anyone have a known good 68-71 tranny for a resonable price in TN or a 
neighboring state?

Thanks,
Daniel
