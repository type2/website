That time of year. I have a bn4 heater, I hooked it up to a battery and the 
fan runs but I dont hear the fuel pump clicking. I took the pump and connected 
it directly to the battery and it would click every time I touch the 
connection, but not when  hooked to the heater, where do I start. thaks for any help. 
Buffalo is getting cold already.
