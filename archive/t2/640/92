Maybe so, George, but I don't remember seeing you standing by as *we* 
ran the tests and calculated the mileage. Or, did you buy a certified 
tester and the test vials? What were your findings? :-)

It is interesting that some folks can be so sure of their prejudices 
even when they are entirely without evidence.

Carry on, George, and thanks for the magnet links.

BTW, the magnets worked *very well* on my home water supply, stopping so 
much mineral fouling that I had to remove that section of supply pipe 
about twice a year and clean it out because the fouling stopped water flow.
