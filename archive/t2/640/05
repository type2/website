I've wondered that too. You cannot modify your vehicle to emit less exhaust. Why I can't do this myself or through an authorized BAR shop is a mystery.

What's clear is that when you fail smog and have to get another car you will be sending the state sales tax revenue on the purchase. Convenient for whom?

Raising the collect car age to 35 years is a joke just like the endless trademark extensions on Mickey Mouse.
