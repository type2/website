George and all,

This is overly cynical. I've already weighed in on this, but I'll do so 
again. Sometimes well intentioned bills become bad laws. This is a case 
in point, but it's only part of the process. Currently titled and 
registered automobiles should be grandfathered for current owners, or 
at the very least the law should kick in farther up the road (for, say, 
1986 cars).

The law will be challenged in court, and some of its provisions will be 
changed. I'm willing to bet on it.
