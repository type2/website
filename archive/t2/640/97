Part of the appeal was that he is including all of the components, including 
part of the wiring harness from the car, but not being familiar with the 
system, I wouldn't know where to start with the loose hanging spade-ended 
wires that are supposed to connect somewhere. If I take the motor, I'll 
probably remove the D-Jet stuff as a complete unit and replace it with L-jet 
or Megasquirt as others here have suggested.
