Subject: Re: [T2] Need help with possible engine purchase

I've seen a few positive comments in this forum on Megasquirt. I visited the 
megasquirt website, but found it rather intimidating. Has anyone worked this 
out for our VW bus application? Does anyone sell a complete solution?

Thanks,

John
