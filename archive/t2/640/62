All that analysis and he misses the reason entirely!

Refillable propane tanks are constructed in such a way that you cannot
overfill them.  By design, some gas space has to be left to allow the
liquid contents room to expand if heated.

Non-refillable tanks do not have this safeguard.  You can fill them
completely with liquid.

If you do this, and the temperature rises, the liquid will expand at very
high pressure, rupturing the tank.  This releases all the contents as a
very explosive air/fuel cloud, known in the military as a "fuel/air
explosive".

I've refilled the little bottles because I hate waste, and with the
knowledge that if I do it wrong I might as well be carrying around a hand
grenade with a loose pin.  I don't recommend that it be done unless you
truly understand what will happen if you screw it up.
