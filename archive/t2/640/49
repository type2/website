Subject: RE: [T2] Brake Booster Replacement

I know this one all too well, done it several times. You can get lucky with 
a used one, I just did on my 71 with a booster I pulled off a parts bus.

Yes, you can replace the booster without opening the system but it's pretty 
tight and you do risk snapping one of the lines into the master, cause you 
have to bend it out of the way, but I have done it.

There's 4 13mm's holding the booster to the frame, then 2 13mm's attaching 
it to the master. And just have to disconnect the pushrod thingy fromt the 
booster.

Be sure you have your one way check valve both my 71's where missing this 
and is needed to keep only air going to the booster.

You can get a booster rebuilt alot cheaper than it costs to buy a new or 
rebuilt one see these guys:

Just last weekend I did my booster, master. I got my master from bus depot 
for $30, my old one seem fine but looks suspeciously old/rusted, glad I did 
this.
