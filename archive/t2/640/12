Sometimes you gotta wonder just how serious they are about reducing emissions. This year a friend of my brother in law wanted to buy a TDI Golf or Jetta (obligatory VW content) for its fuel economy. The dealer informed him that they were unavailable in CA due to emissions recstrictions. This at a time when the state seems to be crawling with wannabe cowboys commuting in diesel pickups getting less than 20 mpg.
