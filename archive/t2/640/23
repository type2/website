It's the same D-Jet system that the Type III VWs used.

Harder to keep running than L-Jet in my opinion but certainly doable.
Personally I would convert it to L-Jet and benefit from all the help because
you'll be going it along with D-Jet or lucking on the 914 forums for help.

Slight difference in piston design, combustion chamber, compression ratio,
valves, higher rpm etc lead to different HP numbers.

Buses using these donor engines need torque. That's the number to look at.
