You're pretty much going to have to wait until things are apart anyway. 
I built one from that drawing -- forget how I finally made a 
determination about what the chicken scratches were meant to say, but 
even so, when it is time to mount it to the oil cooler you'll need to 
make some adjustments of hole locations from where they are drawn to be, 
and I believe that I had to trim the corner a bit to get the doghouse to 
settle down over it.
