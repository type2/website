If you've been dyno-tested and passed, then you should continue to pass 
if you keep your Bus in-tune.  Is your Bus a California model (does it 
have a cat converter)?

As has been said repeatedly on the (now in several fragments :-) 
thread, there are a lot of little things you can do that will help your 
Bus pass the test.  You only need to do the smog exercise every 2 
years... and your regular tune-up schedule is more frequent than that 
anyway (right?!!! :-)  Just adjust your maintenance schedule a little 
bit so you do your tune-ups right before you're due for a smog test.

I think you may be letting yourself worry a little too much about it.  
Above all, try to stay relaxed and approach it as a problem that can be 
solved, rather than a crisis.

Remember -- driving a Bus is fun!  If your Bus is well-maintained, it 
can totally handle that commute.  I certainly would have no qualms 
about driving my '76 up and down the Peninsula every day.

Davis is only a wee bit more than an hour away from San Francisco.  I 
could be convinced to trot up there, especially if I had someone along 
for the drive and could combine it with a trip to a junkyard or two in 
Sacramento (hey Richard -- interested? :-).  I'm not sure I could do 
that in your "week or so" timeframe, though (my wife gets back from a 2 
week trip to NYC on Friday night, and I'd really like to spend some 
time with her this weekend :-)  Maybe the following Saturday (Nov 6)... 
  Actually, my wife is a photographer who often takes photos at a small 
organic farm near Dixon, and it would not be out of the realm of 
possibility to combine the trip that way, too.
