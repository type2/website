Subject: rear hatch lever/lock

hey all,

ive never ordered anything online for my bus and am reluctant to do so 
again.  i bought a rear hatch lid lever/lock deal but thought i was ordering 
an engine lid lever w/lock.  i am wondering if anyone out there would like 
to buy this one from me, its brand spankin new.  i paid 12 bucks for it so 
if anyone would like it, i would sell it for same plus shipping.

other wise i will have to swallow the 20 bucks i spent(which i guess isnt 
all that bad since i could have lost a lot more.

thanks,
patrick
