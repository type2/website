...and figure out why that head keeps having trouble!  Cooling tin 
leaking air?  Mixture set too lean?  #3 is the hottest running 
cylinder, so if your engine is running hot overall, you're definitely 
in danger of killing #3.

Fixing symptoms is only a temporary solution ... root-cause is 
important.
