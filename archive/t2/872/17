Subject: 20th Annual Twin Cities Volkswagen Show

OK everyone.  It's time again the Twin Cities (MN) Volkswagen Club  Annual 
Show!  This is the 20th one this year and there have been some  changes in the 
Type II classes.  This is the break down:
 
1951 to 1967 Stock
1951 to 1967 Custom
1968 to 1979 All
1980 to  1991 All
 
I got them to do it this way so Vanagons weren't competing with custom  
Splits.
 
So, with all these Type II classes, bring yours in!  There are 1st  through 
3rd place trophies for all classes.
 
The date is Sunday 4 June from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm and it is a Westside  
Volkswagen's new New Car dealership (Their old New Car dealership sells Suzukis  
now.) on the west side of County Road 100, south of I-394, in Saint Louis  Park.
 
Hope to see you there!  I'll be at the food stand.

P.S.
Could someone forward this to the Vintage Bus list,  please?
