Chris,

There is a good possibility that the fuel injection tube(or what is left 
of it) is embedded in the head or top of the piston.

The "sharper" edges of it or the sharp edges of the places where it hit 
inside the head or piston may be causing some problems.

Bottom line.....pull the engine and the head and take a look.
Or...ignore the misfire and drive it...


Cheers, dave
