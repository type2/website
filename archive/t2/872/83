Hey Mike, I'm just catching up on my emails, and I read this.  I want
to add one of those 12V sockets to my bus.  I have the same sink/stove
unit, so I should be able to do something similar.  I went down to the
FLAPS (NAPA) and they had a pretty wide variety of 12V sockets.  Do you
happen to remember which one you used that fit so neatly?  How do you
wire up the backside of it?  From looking at the plug, there's a
screw-thread in the center (how you screwed it in, I reckon) and a
single fin on the edge.  I'd think the single fin on the outer edge is
for ground, so where's the B+?  What gauge wire did you use and what
size fuse did you run for that? Lastly, I'm not powering up the fridge,
and I'm going to run the juice that would have gone to the fridge to a
fusebox from which I'll be running the water pump, this socket and the
interior lights (and a radio one day).  Does that sound sane?  Anything
I should watch out for in terms of maximum draw, amps per cicuit, wire
guage, etc?  (obvious statements about watching out for smoke aren't
necessary hehe).
