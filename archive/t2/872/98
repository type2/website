Bob,

Identify the fact that it is one cylinder or not first.

Disconnect one spark plug and drive it....move on to the next one untill 
you identify that it is one cylinder or an overall miss.

Check the resistance in all spark plug wires from inside the distributor 
cap to the plug end.

Check the inside of the distributor cap for arcing and/or a crack in the 
cap.  Check the outside for any evidence of arcing.


Cheers, dave

 it starts having a miss, samething when driving from idle to maybe 2/3
 throttle it misses (sounds like one or more cyl is not firing) but from
 about 2/3 throttle to wide open it runs better than it has in years.
 smooth and quiet no miss, nothing.
 
 got me scratching my head, it is hard to trouble shoot because it only
 does it when under power not at idle or even in neutral at advanced
