While not an accomplished welder like Kelly I have done some, and looked 
into the adhesive. One mark against the adhesive form of repair is that 
the ones I looked at were not rated for any structural work. Which for a 
unibody vehicle like the bus seemed to be an issue. I have not actually 
used the adhesive products, just reviewed the product information 
available online. It was enough that I didn't feel comfortable to try it.
