I'd have to agree with that statement.  The bus has problems for  sure, but it's getting hard to find anything like that at a decent  price.  I'd probably snap it up at that price.  You certainly  wouldn't lose money on it.  You could probably turn it for a small  profit if nothing else.  But what do I know?  I've made some  bad trades over the years.   $1,100 for my bay was an  exception.  Cheers...KR

Still others might correctly observe that it's the best deal going for a 
pre-60 *anything*.
