LOL! no wonder he didn't provide pics of the driver's side!  it looks 
to me like he's either laid the bus over at some point, or been 
sideswiped from stem to stern by something going at a good clip. i'm 
willing to bet it doesn't drive too straight.

i'd still buy it for a grand or less -  but not 1800.
