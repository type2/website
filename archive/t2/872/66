Subject: couple cheap bays in NC

Ok, the yard is crowding up again, so things must go:
1974 deluxe Westfalia, automatic, but missing engine, trans, axles. Rusty,
NO TITLE, but mostly great interior, good glass, including windshield,
most lights & lenses, dash, etc.
Would prefer to sell whole, but may consider parting out if enough people
want to take most of it. $599 negotiable

1970 kombi - actually a roommate's bus he's selling - good running 1600
DP, some rust but not too much, new brakes, daily driver, asking $1800,
but that's negotiable, as he needs to sell it.

I also have a 71 super beetle I'm parting out, if anyone needs anything
(engine, tranny, & axles already gone)

Buy 'em both and make a really nice camper!
feel free to email for details, make an offer, etc...
these are in Raleigh, NC
thanks...
