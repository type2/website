Subject: backfiring

Well, I finally got around to fixing my backfiring problem.   Single Weber carb.  Thanks to Mark Dearing et. al. who offered  good advice.  I started with something simple.  Turned the  mix screw 1/4 turn CCW (richer) and then the idle screw 1/4 turn CCW to  bring the idle back down.  Drove 10 miles.  Instead of Kaboom  I got a good Pop!   Repeated the process and drove 10 miles.   A little poof.  Did it all one more time, 10 more miles, and  nothing!  Good idle, engine runs good, and no backfires.  I  guess I was running too lean and had set the idle up too high to keep  it running. 
  
  Been cleaning up in thrift stores lately.  Got a nice set of  waterproof roof bags for 10 bucks.  There are two that clip  together.  The smaller one will fit right in the forward roof rack  and I can slide my rear rack back and the bigger one will fit behind  the other one.  So I'll be able to carry a whole lot of stuff up  there if I ever need to.  All secured on my rack, which is an  adapted ladder rack.  
   
  Also got subwoofer box that's just a hair smaller than the center  stool.  5 bucks!  Hole in the bottom with feet just like I  wanted.  I'm going to buy some of the matching wood grain laminate  and cover it, then make a plaid seat for it.  It'll work great and  save me a lot of time and effort.  Who cares if it's not exactly  the right size.  Well, I'm sure some of you would.
  
  I'm still thinking about the set of 6 plastic party plates.   Several large compartments in each plate and a cup holder.  Great  for camping.  OK so why am I talking about plates?  They're  almost exactly Sage Green!  5 bucks.  
  
  And they had an original VW yellow trash can for 5 bucks!  (Sorry,  Karl, I coudn't resist.  It's still April.  The can was  red.)  Cheers....KR
