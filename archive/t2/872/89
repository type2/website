Subject: Re: [T2] High performance brake upgrades for bay window buses?

Greg,

Thanks for your ideas. The stock brakes are good for quite a bit of power
and hauling. However, since I will be starting from scratch with my new body
(so far I only have an empty body shell, a rebuilt front beam, and a new
brake booster), I figured this would be a good opportunity to invest in
bigger brakes rather than buying new stock parts. Also, this bus will go
back to Germany at some point and the German TUV may prove a problem if I
try to run 150 hp on stock brakes. I am mostly interested in improved
stopping power for when I use the bus to tow my other toys. Stock brakes are
fine for a bus by itself at any speed (my camper has seen 100 mph ...).

I did some more research yesterday and it seems that Porsche 944 Turbo
brakes are the way to go. Biggest problem seems to be the rear. Most people
are doing the 944 conversion on splitties where they use bug or Porsche
trailing arms. Has anyone successfully adapted these to bay trailing arms?

Hi Marcus,

Better wheels and tires are the easiest braking upgrades available.
Get some nice Fuch rims and then find rubber to fit... just be sure
it matches the right load rating ;-P
