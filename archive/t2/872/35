Wow, Don.  Great trip.  And the Guac still looks great, bugs  excepted.  I always said I was going to see the world while I was  young and head West when I was retired.  Now I've been to over 37  countries and I'm too young to retire.  So I'm thinking of heading  West one summer pretty soon.  Soon as I get the Bopmobile  ready.  Lots of work to go.  Cheers....KR
  
  PS...nice VW family you got there!

(Sorry Troy, I went with JAalbum.)

The thumbnails aren't uploaded since I'm at work behind a firewall and can't
use FTP. Individual files is a pain.
