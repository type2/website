Ray,

Thanks bunches...I figured you would chime in here.

The only difference is that I had to provide an appraisal
to Farmers at the same time they did the insurance.

That says to me that if the bus is "totaled" then I *will* 
get the agreed on "appraised" value.
I did read the link on "insurable interest", but I am off the hook since I 
paid for an up-front appraisal at the time the policy was taken out.


The charges for this are less than a new car, but more than just the 
liablilty that I pay on some of my other VW's.

Oh, and for the few times that I have ever had to deal with a claim(less 
than 3 times in 30+ years), Farmers was up front and IMHO *very* 
fair....oh, and very fast as well.

Of course, my agent loves me...4 cars(down from 6) + wife has 3)...LOL!


Cheers, dave
