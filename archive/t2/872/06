Subject: Engine Gasket Set Replacement

Current Mission: Replace engine gasket set
  Engine: 2.0 Liter w/ carb conversion (currently out, setting on my studio floor)
  Model/Yr: 1975 Westi
  History:  Bought '75 w/ rod thru the housing from college kid - bus was a daily driver around town until this mishap....  found additional used 2.0 liter w/ engine gasket set - engine on stand running but leaky leaky leaky (-at-) purchase
   
  I've read thru my Murr book highlighting all procedures that pertain to removing/rebuilding/reinstalling my 2.0 liter. I've read thru the archive & researched other sites.  However, im having a tuff time coming up w/ my own condensed list of procedures covering just replacing all engine gaskets.  
   
  Im a newbie on engine rebuilding but my daily driver for over 15 years has been a 71 super. 
   
  Thanks for any input on this current mission & for helping w/ past missions.
