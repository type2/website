Subject: Re: [T2] High performance brake upgrades for bay window buses?

Hi Marcus,

Better wheels and tires are the easiest braking upgrades available.  
Get some nice Fuch rims and then find rubber to fit... just be sure  
it matches the right load rating ;-P

QUESTION:
Is there evidence that the stock brakes on the baywindow are  
inadequate? Higher performance rims and tires would be a good start  
for performance, and this added traction might be all you need. I  
have heard people talk about replacing the rear drums with discs, but  
I can't see the point sonce the rear brakes never do much more than  
one third the work that the fronts do.

With the performance improvements you're planning I think you'd be  
putting yourself at risk from the suspension if you make the brakes  
any better.

Perhaps someone with a high-performance Bay could chip in on this  
thread.... AFAIK even the watercooled bays out there like Roadcow  
manage to get by with the stock braking.  I have cc'd Britt Grannis  
and Mike Visket on this thread as both of them have higher-than-stock- 
output baywindows.


Happy trails,
