The Morgan Aero 8 has a bonded and riveted chassis, but those 
aren't Home Depot rivets and a Harbor Freight rivet gun, either...
AFAIK, the adhesive also requires proper prep and careful temp-
erature controlled curing.
Same goes with welding...IF you know what you're doin' ...Buying 
a Craftsman 110v welder and reading the directions ain't gonna
make you Ron Covell... ;-(
