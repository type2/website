So far I was told i have blow by and therefore something in the engine
stinks. I need to open it to check it out, all the hard work...

Are there no folks to tell me that my engine is OK, including the
rings ? Any one has this also happening for a long time ?  Why would
rings go in 800 miles ? Come on 70mph next to a semi isn't that bad
for 3 minutes.

I am driving 300 miles in 90+F weather in 10 days. My first engine
will Live or Die.
