Thanks for the prompt advice. I have been into VWs
since I can remember but never too seriously. I drove
a '69 Westy through high school and into college until
one of Tucson's finer drivers rear-ended me and sent
me into a tree. Bye Bye Bay. I then bought a '71
Standard Beetle for something different but quickly
realized I'm a bus guy. I then decided to fullfil my
dream since I was 13 and buy a Split. I now own a 1967
Riviera in pretty damn nice OG condition and love it
to death. She does need some work mechanically to be a
100% solid daily driver, and unfortuantely I lack the
experience. I've read the books and spent many nights
browsing the Samba until the wee hours. I have the
base just not the hands-on experience. One reason I
joined the club was to hopefully learn a thing or two.

As far as my tranny. I know I'm gonna need a new one
soon. Where is AZ transaxle located? If I go for a
rebuild I will definitely keep my redux boxes cuz they
are rad. The question then remains to get a FF or a
nice stock rebuild. My engine is 100% stock so I don't
think a FF would be necessary, cuz I don't hace teh
power to push it. What do you guys think of looking
into local shops here in Tucson. There is Uncle Bob's,
Ernest's and the Volkstop. Anyone from Tucson have
some advice regarding these guys. They all seem to
know their stuff but I don't wanna mess around w/
gettin my tranny done. So somewhere around $450-650
might get me a decent rebuild? Should I have the
center done only or the RGBs as well? This sucks. I've
scoured the internet and Samba forums and have found a
million different bits of advice. Thought I's ask
locally to get the best possible advice. Thanks if you
read this whole friggin thing and now that school is
out I am hoping to come to more events (though summer
is not the best time). I wanted to come to Whetstone
and Pinal but school would simply not allow. Does the
ABC put stuff on during the summer? 
Thanks again for reading this and your input.

Aaron
