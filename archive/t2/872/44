Subject: More Insurance Questions

The thread about insurance has me wondering...

"Agreed Value" (or whatever your company calls it) is only if you have
comprehensive coverage, correct? It doesn't matter for liability? Example:
If I'm in an accident that's not my fault, I just have to prove the true
replacement value to the other company (and convince them to pay that
instead of blue book). Is that correct? Or is an agreed value necessary with
my own insurance company as well even though they aren't covering that?
