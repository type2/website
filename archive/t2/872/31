That is my (in)famous rattle can job. Actually, once it's color sanded,
you can't tell. My buddy down at the auto paint shop in town can put
almost *any* automotive paint in a can. With a little practice, it's a
great looking job.

Still have some bodywork to do, but my goal was to get it "presentable",
and go from there. I am going to try the new adhesive and rivet method on
the body panels. The pros say it's much better than welding.
