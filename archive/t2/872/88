Thanks to all. I found a company called 89glass online and they are 
coming out today. The vendors my insurance company uses were lame and 
didn't want to touch it.
If anyone needs this done 89Glass has a special running thru tomorrow 
that they will give you $50 off of your deductible. They give the 
savings to you and not your insurance carrier.
I'll let you know how the job goes.
