Subject: long clutch release in 1st gear

Hi fellow list members,



The clutch in my van has started to act very peculiar. When in first gear the
clutch will not engage until the pedal is almost fully released. Every other
gear when shifting works just fine. The free-play in the clutch pedal is at a
=" and the cable bends correctly, where it is supposed too. I do not know what
else to check. I had the engine and clutch out about 1000 miles ago and the
clutch was well within specs. What could be causing the excessive amount of
play present when shifting first gear? This is a '71 VW camper with a stock
1600dp engine.



Thanks,
