Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 DP engine (new) with bad #2 cylinder

Well, I've done almost everything I can think of.

I'm gonna see if someone around here can do a leak-down test for me 
(per Jamie's suggestion).

I will see if maybe somewhere in the hospital is an old fiber optic 
scope that has been retired (but is being kept around by engineering or 
biomed) that I can borrow to see inside cylinder #2.

Barring that, I will have to pull the engine over the weekend and pull 
the 1/2 (right side) head off and see what's been done.  This will be a 
difficult proposition because Lurch is my daily driver, and if I need 
head (or cylinder) work, I won't have any way to get around (like to my 
job 17 miles away).
