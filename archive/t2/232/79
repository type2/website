    Ok, I'll kick in my $ .02........................ I say stick with =
the original design, in other words points. Why? Two very good reasons, =
cost $3.50, and five minuets work, and mostly they work.

    Points may fail, but they never go down without a fight! The three =
main failures of points are, .......

1) Rubbing block wares out (which if lubed when installed this takes =
maybe 2 or 3 years or 30,000 40,000 miles), causing the points to close, =
which causes the engine run like a three legged dog.

2) Someone leaves the key on, causing the contacts to burn up, which =
causes the engine to run like a three legged dog.

3) Normal wear, which causes the engine to run like a three legged dog.

    All these options give plenty of warning, hard starting, pore =
drivability, no idle, etc, etc. But then if you take all of an hour =
every 10,000 to 15,000 miles and give the love of your automotive life a =
basic tune up, and do it right. I'll bet you wont be left on the side of =
the road, ever for the loss of a set of points!
    Now lets look at a wiz-bang, double throw down, run what the other =
guy has, so it must be the thing $$$$$$$ points replacement whirly-gig. =
They almost never give any warning before giving up the ghost. You pull =
into the driveway shut it off and no restart! Or you start to pass an 18 =
wheeler at 70 mph and its like you put it in neutral. Not worth it, no =
benefit to be had in a stock application!
    Now if your running a 3.0 lt turbo, with 10 to 1 compression, you =
may need the slightly hotter spark, but a good dual point distributor, =
and hot coil would still be more dependable!

    I follow the kiss principle,    "KISS".......keep....it.... =
simple......stupid!

    LET THE FLAMES BEGIN!   =20
