Subject: RE: [T2] Dwell on this

For that same price, you can get the Crane CDI.  It comes with the optical 
trigger(replaces the points) and the CDI 'brain'.  The brain is an epoxy 
encapsulated unit with a beefy heatsink on it that mounts remotely(in my 
case on the firewall), triggering the coil, and adjusting the dwell.  The 
unit DOES require a coil without internal ballast resistance(Bosch blue), so 
I bought the 40KV Crane for $29.95.  It hasn't failed me yet, and its been 
on the vehicle for 6 years.  Check what every 15 thousand miles?  I haven't 
even had to replace the cap or rotor yet.  No tracking, and no pitting of 
the contact surfaces.  I recommend them to everybody.  In case the 
Muscle-Car name scares you, Crane aquired Allison Ignition and revamped the 
line a little.  Same technology.

I think the Igniter II goes for about $100-$120. If you're stepping up to
CDI then the Igniter I is all you need since dwell issues go away and all
you need is a simple trigger mechanism, which for all intensive purposes is
what the Igniter I really is. It just happens to give you the correct
"fixed" dwell if its hooked up to a coil. As a matter of fact, I wonder if
the Igniter II would act screwy since its expecting to "see" and control a
coil, not a CDI.
