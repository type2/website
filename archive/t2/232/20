Hi Bob,

I was looking through the archives on type2  and came across your post
regarding the paint color for a 70 bus where you thought there was only one
color ( Pastel White) that they were originally painted.  Did you ever find
out if that was true?  I am having 3 (YES THREE) busses painted at the
moment, and they are all white. One is the 69 DC Company Truck, another is a
70 Transporter/Camper, and the other is a 70 Rivera Pop Top Camper.  Can you
help me with the m-code or point me in the direction to get the info. for
the correct original white color.....

TIA,

Bob, in Leucadia, So Cal
