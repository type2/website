It should have the Hella Logo stamped into the plastic for it to be
genuine.  The ones being made now are repros made in India.  I know because
I know the guy who's making them.  They're decent quality (could be better
tho,) and shouldn't be going for more than $10-$12.  Original Hellas when
last available commanded between $20-$25.
