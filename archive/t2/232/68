--Dave,

#1

the big nut is terminal 30. the other male tabs on the solenoid are both teminal 50 (no difference electrically)

you should have a red/white and a red/black correct?

#2

The only red/blue I know is fuel pump power from the double relay, but it would be much longer.

>Second Question:  I have a 4-6 inch piece of blue/black striped wire with a female connector at each end, but no idea of where it goes.
