Subject: flywheel seal

so i took the engine out, did a bunch of maint. including but not limited to 
replacing the flywheel seal. drove the bus about 1000 miles on vacation. now 
i have a pretty major oil leak from between the eng. and trans. (flywheel 
seal). i have not removed the eng. again (too hot in houston)what i need to 
know is there some trick to replacing this seal? i dont want to have to re 
re do it. i also want to know how to check the end play while i have the 
flywheel off again. this is a gex rebuild installed by p.o. 1600sp upright 
eng..
