Subject: bus back from doctor, pretty good bill of health


Hello,

I thought I would share my weekends findings, after spending the early 
afternoon up at Valley Wagonworks (what a nice way of being able to saw VW 
without saying it!) with Paul, the new shop owner.

Things needing attention.

My front left (drivers) upper ball joint boot is torn. I need to replace 
that, not sure how involved of a job that will be. It's just a boot, but may 
be a pain getting to the point where you can replace it.

The pushrod tube seals need replacing, as a little oil is dumping out right 
about there. Plus, when we had the bus up on the rack, you could see where 
the oil was coming from. (it was cool to finally look up underneath, without 
it all being 2 inches from my face)

Exhaust manifold gaskets are shot, you can hear a little air escaping from 
there. This one sounds like a pro job, I don't think I want to tackle 
removing the whole exhaust system.

Other than that, maybe some new wiper blades. All in all, ready for the big 
trek coming up quickly now.

Any thoughts or suggestions on how to go about these repairs, what is the 
most important, what can wait, or what I should just pay someone else to do, 
is always welcome.
