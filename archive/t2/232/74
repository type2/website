Subject: Re: getting the elec. fuel pump running & rebuilding an egr

[...]

billy - as soon as i read "relay closed by the afm" i said to myself, steve
dija even plug in the afm... dija? dija ya nitwit? and with a 50/50 mixture
of sheepishness and ballzout joy, it got that fuel pump whizzing, and it
turned over as much as any rig would with the egr not hooked up and wide
open. that egr is the last peice of the puzzle. THANKS 2XMILLION!! the
description is a huge help. p.s. i am working on a january 1975. the
diagram in bentley is for 73-75 carbed, and the 76 is the first one there
for fuel injection. thus, i am working off the 76 scheme.

other news:  in my hands i have a very interesting method for
reconditioning the egr valve for those interested. i have to thank barry
again for setting me up with the basic understanding and encouragement
which allowed me to further investigate this valve. if you are encouraged
to recondition your egr valve one might take a look at the following. there
are good photos to go along with this, and i can gladly pass them along in
p-mail.   - steve

from Giff Kucsma:

The EGR valve was re-assembled in the same manner as originally.

I used JB-Weld to reconstruct the valve seating surfaces within the body
casting.  After cleaning out all of the accumulated carbon deposits and
corrosion, the valve seating services were severely pitted - enough so
that the valve would certainly leak and admit exhaust gases into the
intake even when the valve was closed.

Solder might have worked, because it is relatively soft and could have
been machined/carved similar to the JB-Weld, but if its adherence to the
casting failed, it could be ingested into the engine.

Depositing a bead of metal by brazing or welding would also have worked,
but would have required machine tools and cutters to shape it to the
valve heads - equipment that I don't have.

Having used it on a few other applications, I was pretty confident that
the JB-Weld would adhere to the casting.  Using it also permitted me to
use the valve shaft itself as something like a male mold.  See first
attached image.  I masked off some of the shaft surfaces and threads
with tape, and then coated the entire thing with a light coating of
either grease or lanolin (I forget which I used).  This served as a mold
release, so that I could remove the valve shaft once the JB-Weld had
set, and it would leave an impression in the JB-Weld that approximated
the shape of the original valve seat.  Once the JB-Weld had completely
hardened, I used a large drill bit in a hand held electric drill to
"machine" the valve seating surface.  The second image shows one of
these surfaces.

I hope this clarifies my procedure.

Best regards,

Giff Kucsma
