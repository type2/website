Subject: Re: [T2] 70 speedo adjustment?

wait... isnt 14 the width or something? 195 is diameter? what exactly IS
stock tire size? i thought i got stock size! ARGH!

there were 3-4 different types of tires on my bus when i got it. 2 steel
studded snow tires (talk about dating itself) without ANY sizing on them
and the other 2 were totally different sizes! i aquired a spare from a
friend (as i have driven my beetle for 5 years without one, and i felt i
was pushing my luck) and it was ANOTHER size... i remember reading
something SOMEWHERE that in 70, you had an option of using 14s or 15s...
now i cant remember where i read it. or even WHAT THAT MEANS!!! brain
overload...

ARGHHHH!!!

chris, the seriously confused one
