Subject: if it ain't one thing...

it's another.

After a couple weeks of a gradually increasing
whinning noise my generator light came on last night.

I haven't had time to dig into it yet, but i'm
guessing Generator bearings are gone. (?)

need some savvy: Should I get it rebuilt or buy a new
one?

What bugs me is the generator is relatively new (two
years and about 20,000 miles).
