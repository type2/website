Hi Chris,

The 195/70R14's are the cause of your speedo error

If you know a hiker, hunter or backwoods type person you may be able to 
borrow a GPS. This will give you a very accurate speed reading which you 
can use to "calibrate" your speedometer. It won't fix the output, but at 
least you'll know exactly how far off it is.

Or buy your own GPS and use it instead of the bus speedo. You will never 
be lost again!

Happy trails,
