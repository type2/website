Thanks.

I didn't believe the vendor but I thought I would check before I sent them
back only to discover all new Hella items are like that.

Does anyone know where I can buy a Hella item?  Mine are broken and the
junkyard items are broken or long ago picked over.  If no one knows I'll
have to contact the vendors one by one as I believe they are still
available.
