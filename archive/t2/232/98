Subject: black smoke


Hey everyone,

     I have about 3000 miles on my 79 Westy's rebuilt 1800cc engine. It has 
a webber carb kit on it. My question is how do i get the black smoke to stop 
coming from my tailpipe. It is to the point where it stains my bumper, I 
don't know if it is the mixture on the carb or what. The idle seems to be 
set a bit to high as well. I have no clue which screws on the carb are for 
the mixture and which are for the idle. I have tried to look up stuff on the 
web to see if there is a diagram but I have had no luck.

    Could someone please give me a sugestion that may solve the black smoke 
problem.And possibly give me an idea as to which screws on the carb do what? 
Anyones help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
      Direwolf     79' Westy
                   possibly 71' square back....
