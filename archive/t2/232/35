List,
I am sure that most of you (if not all) are familiar
with the wonderful resource that is the type2.com
library/archive and technical articles.  But for those
of you that haven't used them, I would suggest taking
a look.  Last night I installed my Bosch VR-1 starter
relay with the help of the library.  What a wealth of
information.  My thanks go out to Sean and others who
have taken the time to provide the rest of us
(including relative greenhorns like myself) with the
resources necessary to work on our busses.  With the
help of this list and other type2.com resources I am
knocking off the items of my to do list one at a time.
 Thanks a ton.
