Subject: getting the elec. fuel pump running

point of clarification: the red wire from the 2Xrelay, according to the
wiring diagram is destined for the battery. however, the wire ends at the
starter and thus i hung it up with the other 4 wires that live there as
well. might it be best to run an extention so it is direct to the positive
battery terminal? not sure why the 2Xrelay would need such direct power, in
fact isn't it a good idea for it to shut off in case of an accident?  -
steve, you can imagine...
