Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Pulling Experience and Questions

In an earlier post, I mentioned using a cinderblock and 2x4 to support my
tranny.
Since that post, I have received several responses.
Most of which state that a cinderblock is not a very smart choice.

Here is how I see it:
If my home can set on them; then certainly a <100# tranny can be safely
supported using
said block when positioned correctly. (HOLES UP & board spanning holes.)

Lastly, when I transported my bus w/o engine, I supported the tranny with a
plastic coated steel cable. It was a lot easier than continually moving the
cinderblock. :-)
