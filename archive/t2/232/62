Subject: getting the elec. fuel pump running

before i tore down the engine i tested per bentley for power to the double
relay and i had the fuel pump running. now it is not. early in the year
before i pulled the engine i put a test light on 85 (gnd) and 88y & 88z
with success. today no dice: the test light only comes on with ignition.
full battery checked with volt meter; engine cranks strong enough to turn
over IF i had gas.

i wired up the starter as stated in the wiring diagram. 4 correct wires to
the solenoid nut (13mm) and the two tabs in place. the two tabs are red/blk
& red/wht. i even tried reversing them around but no luck. there are three
possible tab connections on the solenoid (one remains naked) and i admit
that is a weak link, but i did move them around enough. everything else
seems well in place, but i am missing something. suggestions appreciated in
a huge way.    - steve, with two previously working 2X relays.
