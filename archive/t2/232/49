Imagine a tire with very soft sidewalls. When you let the air out of the 
tire, the diameter shrinks until the tire tread is nearly the same 
circumference as the steel wheel and the sidewalls tuck towards the center 
of the space normally occupied by air.

So the tire "folds" up.

Look for the late baywindow owners manual online (vintage bus?) and there 
is a pic of this tire being inflated.

The vans which got these tires also got an air compressor that would pump 
up the tire when you needed it.

Never seen the VW version but I do recall a couple of domestic spare tires 
like this.
