I recently had the shifting problem of going from 3rd to 2nd and 2nd to =
1st.
It was super hard to find.Chris gave me the suggestions and I followed =
his words.
I greased the shifter shaft and replaced the shifting coupler.Now I can =
shift
oh so fine except one other thing....when I go to put it in reverse it =
dies out.
I can put it in reverse but the engine dies.even with my foot on the =
clutch it=20
and if its in reverse it won't start . I put it in any other gear with =
the clutch in
and it starts no problem.I just need to know how to remedy this problem.
Thanks
Darren
