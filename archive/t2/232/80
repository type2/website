Everything fails, it's a chance you take. I perfer my "whirly gig" just for
the plain fact that even with a well tuned ignition system with points my
van does not perform as well as it does with the "whirly gig" - plain and
simple. Plus if it EVER fails I carry points with me so I can reinstall them
to help me get home. To each his own I say.
