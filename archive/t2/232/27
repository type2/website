Subject: Setting dwell via continuity

Steve Dolan queried: "BTW, on a T1, you can
static time with the dwell meter... look for the dwell to flip from 0 to
90 (or is that 90 to 0?)"

Hey Steve,  Re is spark at closing of points or opening????  Here's my
logical mind at work; it's my high "spatial sense" IQ at work; anyone
feel free to correct me: Dizzy has 4 bumps on it; each one obviously
designed to open the points about near the peaks, then close them.  A
movable point is pushed up by the felt block as a peak nears, and then
it comes down and points close. When you time it, you simple rotate the
distributor to control when this cycle begins relative to top dead
center of each firing cylinder.  If the gap is too narrow (fixed point
set too close), the points stay closed longer, dwell increases (number
of degrees rotation until they open again), timing retards.  If timing
retards, then the crucual event triggering the spark is happening
LATER.  
     If the gap is too wide, the points  are closed for a very little
length of time (degrees rotation), dwell is small, and timing will
advance.  So the event triggering the spark is happening sooner (before
reaching top  DC)  Looking at the dizzy humps, this means it will rotate
further before opening the points, and close them SOONER than it
should.  Hence logic says that if they close sooner than they should 
(before ideal time as piston comes up), then the triggering event is the
points CLOSING.  This is why I timed my 71 by sticking one probe (meter
set to continuity-the beep) on ground and the other on the green wire
going to coil.  Rotate engine.  When points close, beep should sound,
you should be at correct rotation point to fire.  No beep?  Points
corroded over.  Variable beep (not every cylinder), points likely have a
tang that makes contact now and then.  Replace points or file like
crazy.  The length of the beep should be a measure of dwell, and if you
have a degree wheel, you can see the degrees rotated before the beep
stops.
   Now, if you had previously set the points perfectly at 50, and timing
set perfectly, you should be able to set gap (dwell) with nothing more
that the continuity tester and never bother to put the cap on and play
with running the engine to see the dwell meter and go through the bother
of rotating the distributor.  Stick meter probe on green wire, other to
ground (set to continuity or ohms if you ain't got it). Put in points,
set gap at thickness of my thumbnail, and rotate engine until a beep
starts or ohms go to no resistance.  Is the timing notch or mark near
the correct spot on the degree scale or relative to TDC?  If it's early
(like 12 before TDC instead of 7, narrow the gap a bit.  If it's late
like at TDC) widen the gap a bit.  Don't have a meter? juryrig a 12v
light bulb with 2 wires and put on bus ignition, and note when light
comes on, a` la St Muir.  When it comes on at your setting you got it. 
For those who normally need a strobe to time, you CAN determine the
right point statically first when dwell/timing is set perfect- and write
it down!
