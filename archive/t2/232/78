Reasonable sounding to me and I recently had a set of Corvair heads cleaned=

and I asked what the deluxe treatment costs. My local guy's prices were=20
similar.

I seem tor emember some Corvair experimental aircraft guy showing=20
instructions on installing guides yourself with commonly availble threaded=

rod, etc. Do a search for it. You takes your chances.

Don't go halfway - get the whole thing done.

Replace them if they are worn only. Unless you've got money to burn.

I think this can increase the compression ratio. Careful - ask someone more=

educated than me.

What's the difference? If the factory supplied a different spring then=20
maybe they knew something we don't. Lift can happen at lower speeds than=20
you think according to Mackerle's "Aircooled Engines".

Not a big deal I'll bet.

It's a pollution thing I think. Replace them.
