Hi Veedubbers,

I am wondering if anyone is going to the biggest European aircooled =
show.=20
This annual show is held in the southern part of the Netherlands in the =
small town of Panningen on september 13 - 15.=20
The show is organized as a common effort by several national aircooled =
VW clubs from Holland. For more info see http://www.vweuro.nl=20
The site is multilingual and also completely in english.

Many thousands are attending the show from all over Europe showing their =
finest vehicles and even oddities that makes it all so nice to look at.
I know that every year there are a few Americans that come over here, =
but it would be nice to meet up too.

So..... is anyone of the listees going?
