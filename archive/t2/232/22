Re wire frying when you opened engine lid-

I have a 78; the aux wiring typically does run as a positive through a
relay to the other battery.   Is the "square white thing" a relay? 
Typically the relay has to get power (usually to coil so it's on when
engine is on), and that power flips a contact so that wire pigtailed to
the main + now gets connected to the AUX.  So a wire should go from the
relay also to the spare battery.  Did someone try to get the ("power"
when on) from the regulator?  If this wire touches ground, you get
frying back to regulator.  If the pigtailed wire touches ground, you get
major frying back to battery.  The wire from the AUX battery should go
to the relay.  If the relay burned out, was it bypassed so someing was
looking for a + source like the regulator??   To properly bypass the
relay (I did it) just connect the pigtailed wire from main right to the
+ on the AUX.  Now they are in series and charge together.   Now when
camping, you will have a longer time to use stuff before you reach a low
voltage that typicaslly is 10.9-11 volts where I'd run the engine.  Just
keep a voltmater atached to a plus line to watch this.  You can buy
relayed extensions  that plug into a cig. outlet that automatically kill
the power (to my electric fridge) at 10.9 volts.
