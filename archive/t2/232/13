Even the current "winnebago/westfalia"  has variations with a basic add 
on package that i cant find the name for, and a weekender package, and 
the full camper package.  the vanagon series had variations also with 
weekender and full camper models.  At the motorworks  campout this 
weekend i saw the same theme in 70's buses.  FANTASTIC weekend.
