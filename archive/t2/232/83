Subject: RE: [T2] Dwell on this

I think the Igniter II goes for about $100-$120. If you're stepping up to
CDI then the Igniter I is all you need since dwell issues go away and all
you need is a simple trigger mechanism, which for all intensive purposes is
what the Igniter I really is. It just happens to give you the correct
"fixed" dwell if its hooked up to a coil. As a matter of fact, I wonder if
the Igniter II would act screwy since its expecting to "see" and control a
coil, not a CDI.
