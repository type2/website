Subject: Dwell on this

With all the discussion of how to set the point gap and dwell, I really have
to recommend saving up the funds, getting rid if the points, and going to a
Petronix type ignition system. And with the Igniter II, you get active
variable dwell to optimize your coil saturation at all engine speeds.
Modernize your ignition system. Your car will run much smoother.

I know some of you out there have had bad experiences with Petronix. I
haven't had that happen yet, so I'm still sold on them. I just know that I
like not having to deal with points issues.
