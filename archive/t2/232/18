Subject: Best shops

The SO and I are headed across the strait to pick up one of the kids in
Vancouver. She of course wants to visit friends in Washington. Needing a few
parts myself I figure on hitting some VW shops. Can anyone recommend shops
in the areas around Bellingham to Seattle? I need new floor pans at the very
least and some other odds and ends. While she plays in Bellingham, I'm
headed down to help a listee swap out engines in Seattle. I'm looking for
those little cheap shops if thats possible. ;-)
