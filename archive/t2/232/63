Subject: Valve guides

I asked a local machine shop how much they would charge for a valve job on a 
Nissan 240SX head.

They said:

$120 - refinish/resurface valves, cut valve seats, clean (dip & bead blast) 
head, disassemble and reassemble.  Parts extra, as needed.

$65 - Press in new valve guides (parts AND labor included in the price - 8 
valve engine)

$50 - resurface head, to remove any heat induced warpage

$40 - test for cracks by (1) die and (2) blocking off the bottom of the head 
and pressure fill the "unknown" cavities with "unknown".

To me, this sounds like a reasonable price to pay for top professional work.

Now I am embarrassed by my feeble efforts to 'rebuild' my extra two type 2 
2.0 liter heads. (from a '77, scheduled for a '78)

I thought I could
(1) elbow_grease_style clean the two heads (8-10 hours invested so far) and
(2) remove the valves (it's at a friends house for the past 4 months to 
remove the valves)
(3) have 4 + 4 valve guides pressed in.  Best price is at $6/valve guide, 
labor only.
(4) lap the valves (like I know what I am talking about, right !?!?!?)
(5) reassemble and be ready to slap it on my daily driver.  ((right¿¿))

Well, I ordered the valve guides and valves and I am ready to go.  However, 
some little bird (C&M Machine shop Alexandria VA) said that if I press in 
ANY valve guides, I MUST regrind the valve seats.  This is because the valve 
guides never go in like the old ones that came out, and will be off 
centered.  ( never go in - comments ??)

So, if the valve guides do NOT have to be replaced, then don't!!  Measure 
the lateral movement of the valves per Bentley, don't replace them 
automatically. I thought you would ALWAYS replace the valve guides, even if 
they were in spec.  Just to have a set of heads that were as new as 
possible.  ( always replace - comments ??)

Another piece of advice is to fly cut the type 2 heads (-at-) $35 each.  But I 
look at these heads and why can't I just use the $.99 head gaskets, properly 
RTV'ed onto the heads?? Won't this provide the proper seal, just as well as 
fly cutting?  ( don't fly cut - comments??)

And I am not, not, not going to replace the '77 solid lifter valve springs 
with '78 hydraulic lifter valve springs because I really do want to save 
some money, and I don't plan to rev the engine high enough to get float.  ( 
use solid lifter valve springs - comments??)

And not, not, not replace the valve keepers, only because I can't find them 
at Bus Depot ( valve keepers - comments??)

And yes, install those little valve seals because they are only $.44/ea at 
Bus Depot and I guess I can afford $3.52 ( little valve seals - comments??)

OK, take your time.  You don't have to comment at all, but I am sure there 
are a few of you out there that have strong opinions on at least one of my 
actions/non-actions.

Yes, I will gladly accept nasty comments, but please direct them to me 
off-line, out of respect for the list members who are interested in the 
technical responses.

And humorous comments are optional.
