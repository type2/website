Subject: Gene Berg

Who is Gene Berg, and why is his name stamped inside my engine under the
valve cover?

My other question, what would all the black "burned" stuff be around the
valve cover gasket, inside on the engine etc?  Smelled burnt when I took it
off, and I have much dirt (or probably engine particles) if I was to guess.

1600 DP I just bought and having my first looksee....
