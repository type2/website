Subject: Re: [T2] Side marker by Hella

My opinion is: If it is not marked, it is NOT Hella. Most part makers are
proud of their parts:-)  [All genuine Mercedes parts have the Mercedes star on
them] Just as VW parts will have the \X/ mark or the Audi rings.

I have an original in my hand. Both back and front are marked Hella.
Bolb side:
DOT
SMR 70
HELLA
4W
2cp

Terminal side:
DOT
HELLA SMR 70
\X/ 211 945 351A

Even the front backing plate behind the reflecter is Hella.
Back side:
HELLA
MR 70
\X/ 211 945 161
DOT
