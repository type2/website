Sounds like you are 90 degrees out John. If you had verified that the rotor
on the .009 was pointing to the #1 notch on the distributor before you
pulled it, then your 205 vac can distributor will be pointing there also.
Trust me on this, #1 is at the notch on all T-1 distributors for all upright
motors. I have been building these things for 28 years and it's still the
same. 205 is a good choice for all around driving in my opinion. H through R
cans are pretty much the same, some pull it all in a little earlier in RPM,
but not so much as you would notice.

Alright All, I have a 71 westy that has had the 009 dizzy on it since I got
it. I found what I thought was the stock vac dizzy at a swap meet, a 205Q
which is the first number listed for my bus on the oldvolokshome dizzy spec
page.  
So, I turn my engine to TDC and remove the 009.  Then when I install the
205Q,
the rotor does not line up with the notch on the lip of the dizzy, which
indicates where #1 should fire at TDC, it looks more like it is lined up
where
the #2 will fire, yet the engine is DEFINITELY at #1 TDC (i took out the #1
spark plug and felt with a pencil to confirm TDC)  So, what the hell is goin
on here? Is it just as simple as changing the plug wires around to match the
dizzy TDC mark?
