Subject: 12V Cooler in Westy Fridge?

I've been trying to figure a good way to improve on the fridge in my 71 =
westy.  I know there's been some talk about upgrading the insulation =
that surrounds the icebox insert, but I wonder if anyone's ever found a =
12 volt cooler/ice chest that would fit into the cabinet under the sink =
where the ice chest is?
