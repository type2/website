silly, i know there is a difference between 6 and 12... i was wondering
if the alt was compatible with both. sorry, misworded it. didn mean "does
it matter", i meant... uh... whatever i already said. oh well, that is
why i am an artist, not a poet.

ok, so my bus is a 70... that is 12v, right?

;^) thanks for humoring me,
chris
