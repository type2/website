Jeeze...rough crowd tonight!  I thought this was the VTEC forum.  :^P  It is 
late, and I am still at work. I was picturing the internals, not the dizzy 
itself.  Still, rotating the distributor body once it is seated, to align 
the rotor and notch should be sound advice...barring another brain-fade, or 
Honda dizzy reference.  I digress...
