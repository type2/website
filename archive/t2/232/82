Has anybody ever rewired their bus completely?  I am beginning to think =
that the stock wiring layout is not so good.  Twice I have had smoke =
coming from the wires.  Today after finally getting a rebuilt engine =
running something went wrong with the starter and the wires under the =
dash started smoking.  Now everything is wasted.   I am thinking about =
tearing all the wires out and redoing it all in a more repair-friendly =
fashion.  It looks to me like the main hot wire leading from the rear up =
to the dash is about 1/2 the size it should be.  Also it appears that =
there were no fusible links or anything on the wires.  Is there any =
reason why a guy couldn't just run the wires along the floor inside the =
cabin or along the ceiling in a pipe?  I notice the the wires are =
exposed at some points underneath, that can't be good.  I have the bus =
from Hell.  GW
