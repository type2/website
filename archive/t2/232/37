Subject: 70 speedo adjustment?

1970 westy
195/70R14
speedometer seems to be off by 10-15MPH at highway speed and closer to
5+MPH at low speed (neighborhood 25-30). considering it is off and people
drive differently at different times of day, it is hard to say exactly
what speed i am actually going. i have gotten a feel for what i think my
speed is.

35~30
50~40
75+~just under 65
80~i wont get run over in normal highway traffic, so it is probably
between 65-70.

i have even seen something i would never have seen if the speedo wasn't
off... i have hit nearly 90 (probably 75ish) going down hill with a
strong tailwind... but it was neat to see, none the less.

wavin and prayin for a tailwind,
chris
70 westy, usually gettin passed
