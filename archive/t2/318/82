Hello Rik,

    Thank you for reminding me of the rules, I seem to have lost it for a
moment, and had a brain fart. So please forgive my seeming mental breakdown,
I know better, and hopefully another shuttle wont blow up again any time
soon, as I would hate to have another!
    Wait, let me add the ambiguous Type 2 content, I don't want to waste
bandwidth.
    "I once met a Jerk driving a Volkswagen Bus"!
