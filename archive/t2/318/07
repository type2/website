Subject: I need a ride to Dead o' Winter

Lurch is dead in the water  :-(

One COLD weekend I went to start him up, he ran for a few seconds, then 
abruptly stopped.  Now I cannot get the engine to turn over by hand.  It's 
been too cold and I've been too busy to investigate.

I'm pissed for sure.  It has only 12,000 miles on it since the last rebuild.  
It never really ran right since then.  MPG was 14 average, down from 19, and 
it would never idle just right, as if a valve was sticking.  I'll see what I 
can work out with the rebuilder.

In the meantime, if anybody from East Tennessee is going and has room (I'll 
bring a backpack with tent and sleeping bag), maybe we can meet somewhere en 
route.
