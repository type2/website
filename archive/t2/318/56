220F oil temp does not directly relate to head temps where the failure was. 
Your heads could have been quite hot. The oil does not cool the heads a 
whole lot is what I have heard.

Who built the engine? Were the heads rebuilt or inspected? That rattling 
sound was the valve seat banging around I expect.
