Sorry, That Hoover quote relates to Type 1 engines only ...not type 4....
the reference is to a small square bit of tin that rests between the
cylinders in slots on the head.

If I were you, I would keep the "skid plate" tin because it redirects flow
of the air....think about the air pressure to each side or the engine..... I
would bet that the outflow aperature is different slightly to keep the amout
of air flowing over the cylinders equal.... this is just a hunch..I can't
back this up with fact. But, if I was in a hot climate where heating isn't
ever needed, I would still keep the shell of the heat exchangers and the
associated tin in place.

Remember that the VW engineers that designed these engines were under
enourmous pressure to keep costs low and profit margins high ...it's not
likely that there is anything "extra" about either type 1 or 4 engine
tinware.
