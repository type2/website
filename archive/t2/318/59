now this is interesting. That both the 3 & 4 cyls went south, but you
made no mention of the 1 & 2. This could be because of many things.
Such as it just happened to be a better head, or simply this head had
not built up enough heat heat to drop the valve seat. Either way be
sure you have the other head looked at (& probably replaced if it took
that much of a punishment)

very possible scenerio. A vacuum leak would do this.

I have run my bus for extended periods of time at much higher oil
temps than that. But then again my engine is very worn out (+230k
miles) & to be honest I kinda wanted it to die, so I could justify the
cost of a rebuild (you guys w/ wifes understand this logic). It didn't
sound like you were on the road very long though. Remember the oil
temp is simply an indicator of the engine temp. But does react slowly
& I use it simply for a general feel of the engine. Plus like someone
else mentioned, the oil temp should reflect some of what temp the
heads might be at, but it's not a direct measurement of that. Good
luck & keep us informed. Was it a GEX?
