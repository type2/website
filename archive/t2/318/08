Subject: weird bay camper

here is a partial answer to the weird baywindow transformed in a camper we all
saw on the gallery on vintagebus or Samba:

http://cgi.ebay.de/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=2401068335&category=14232

or item #2401068335
so its a karman imported to US from Europe!!

someone could drop the ebay picture in the gallery as well...
