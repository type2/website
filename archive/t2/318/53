Subject: Unusual but not weird bay campers - Karmann Gypsy, Jurgens

Just a bit of information on these vehicles. 

Jurgens is a South African company who started to make coach built bay window campers. The earlier ones look like a trailer caravan fixed onto the back of a bus - these were walk through so its likely that they were done on full bodied vehicles rather than pickups. 

Karmann (yes the same people who did the Ghia) acquired the rights to sale these in Europe. I'm not sure if they purchased complete vehicles and rebadged them or manufactured to design; I suspect the former as even the floral pattern on the cushion covers is the same! 

Later Jurgens made a Luton bodied version (with a bed over the cab), as far as I know these were never sold by Karmann who went their own way an produced an upmarket version Luton bodied coach built camper with much more modern styling and upmarket fittings. 

Both Jurgens Autovillas and Karmann Gypsies may also be found on Vanagon chassis. 

Kemperink was a Dutch company who did stretched versions of the split screen and bay window buses. These were based on pickups so were not walkthrough. After chassis lengthening a simple alluminium 'cargo box' with side door and tailgate was added. 
These were very suitable far use as delivery vans were bulky but light goods were to be delivered, so many Kemperink vans saw service as bakery vans. A large number were also used by the Dutch army. Today most surviving examples have been made into walk through campers and are very desirable. 

Pictures of Jurgens Autovillas, Karmann Gypsies, and Kemperinks (and a brief history of Kemperinks) my all be found at www.vwt2oc.org - look under "Members Rides", "Weird and Wonderful", and "The Kemperink Story"
