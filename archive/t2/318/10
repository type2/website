Subject: Re: [T2] removing "extra" bits?

Please don't don't trash (toss it) any of it, offer it to the list instead...

The duct work can be removed all over. The heater boxes can be replaced 
with simple pipes. You'll need to seal any holes in the tin that leads from 
the top of the engine to under the engine so you do recirculate heated air.

If you remove the heater boxes plug the air outlets on the bottom of the 
fan shroud.

All the flapper boxes can come off.

I think the flat plates between the heater boxes and block need to stay to 
keep road spray (wet roads) off of the engine.

What if you plan to drive to Montana? <grin>

Good luck.
