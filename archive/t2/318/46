Hiya All,

I need a little clarification from someone living down in the greater LA 
basin.  I have listings for TWO businesses using the name Rancho.  One is 
Rancho Transmission in Rancho Cucamonga.  The other is Rancho Performance in

Anaheim (the same outfit being mentioned in another current thread).  Are 
these two businesses, in fact, two branches of the same company?  Or 
completely unrelated?  Or what?
