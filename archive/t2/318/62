The hard-to-find ones are '71 and '72.  After this, VW responded to the
complaints of too-frequent pad replacment by designing thicker pads.
these required a thicker caliper.  This required more wheel clearance, so
the spindle was redesigned to move the caliper inward.  This changed the
centerline of the disk, so the disk is now different.

In short, you need the caliper, spindle, disk, and the backing plate to do
the conversion.  You will not feel any difference in braking ability, but
the pads will last longer.

Early pads will fit late calipers, but not the other way around.
