Hi Ray,

I have done the reverse swap, putting a 73 engine/tranny into a 79.

1. You had better think about putting in an access hatch over the 
engine compartment. I wouldn't want to try to work on an FI bus without 
access from above. I had a 72 camper and could barely manage to change 
spark plugs in the darn thing. I would recommend the hatch from a type 
III (squareback, fastback or notch) as these are significantly larger 
than the standard typeII hatch. There is a typeIII hatch in the 
Roadcow, and it looks like a big improvement

(disregard the toyota engine, that's not important right now).

2. There is a difference in the length of the nosecones of 72 and 78 
tranny's. My linkage wound up about 5/8" too short, which drastically 
affected the position of the shift lever. I was able to compensate for 
this by bending the shift lever backwards, but I am not so certain this 
option will work for you, you will probably have to rework the nosecone 
or shorten a component on the linkage. There is some info about this in 
the archives.

3. You will have to add a bracket to mount the air filter and AFM. Cut 
the bracket from the 79 and weld it into place on the 72.

Good luck with it!
