Subject: 74 Westy for sale near Dallas, Tx.

I saw an ad for a '74 Westy in the paper yesterday, "Needs work".  No price.  Called and got some information on it.  It is in Arlington (between Dallas and Ft. Worth).  Color is green and it's an Automatic.  FI has been replaced with a single Weber.  Transaxle and 1800 engine have both been rebuilt - supposedly runs very well.  Minor rust under the windshield but he says it's a solid bus.  Pop top canvas is new.  The "work" needed sounds pretty minor - he said something about the brakes needing a little work, and I think some minor interior work.  Sounds like it has been well taken care of.

Price was $2,400 but I think it is negotiable.
