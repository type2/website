Subject: Extra wire on Positive battery necessary '72?

I have a '72 Canadian Westy.

There is a fairly heavy gauge wire (red with white stripe) going from 
the positive terminal of the battery to the "dealer diagnosis wiring 
block thing" about 14 inches away from the battery mounted on top of 
the engine compartment.

The wire at the battery end is severely corroded.  Can I just remove 
this wire altogether?  It doesn't appear useful for anything other 
than the dealer wiring block.
