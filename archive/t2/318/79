You will need the lower pushrod tins from 72-74, the left front lower from a 72-74, and the right front lower
from a 79.
Go here: http://www.bus-boys.com/aircoolsystem.html#tin
And look at:
W. 021-119-356C Warm Air Duct, Lower Right, Used 1972 to 1974, 1980 to 1983 All
R. 021-119-355B Warm Air Duct, Lower Left, Used 1972 to 1974, 1979 to 1983 Federal Only
U. 022-119-362B Warm Air Duct, Front Right, Used 1974 w/EFI, 1979 to 1983 All
O. 021-119-361B Warm Air Duct, Front Left, Used 1972 to 1974 1979 Federal Only, 1980 to 1983 All
You also need the left and right heater tubes between the boxes and the flapper valves. 72-74 and 79 are
round. 75-78 are oval.
You also need the alternator support bracket. 72-74 and 79 bolt to the side of the heater box. 75-78 bolts to
the top of the exhaust pipe.
