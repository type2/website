Put her onto the list.....We'll give her 500 emails a day, teach her how
to rebuild
an engine on line, advise her as to superfluous pieces of the type 2
advise her of
the variant styles of buses, vans combis, kombis sambas, toasters,
clogs, vanagons,
splits, bays...everything except wasserboxers!  We'll sell her a van and
send her
on her way and repair it enroute if it breaks down.

This is all to say that I'm enjoying being on the list.
