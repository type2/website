Subject: inside the aluminum basket case

Craig's new first-generation aluminum T1 case engine 
 after a few break-in miles is a total disaster !
 Photos show abnormal bearing wear patterns.
 Prior to disassembly, the complaint was a
 bottom-end knock,in addition to a significant
 amount of metal in the oil. 
 Is there any wear on the cam gear teeth?
 Is the backlash the same as before ?
 Was a piston or rod installed wrong ?
 Did you plastigage ?
 The Schneider cam needs more than a shimmed stock spring.
 New lifters will rock heads when held to the light. Flat is bad.
 Might as well add a full set of bearings to the rebuild cost.
 Have a machinist mic the cam and crank bearing bores.
 Send the photos to Rimco and see if they still think the case 
 is good. They OK'd it with all that casting slag ?!
 Maybe you could sell it to GEX !

I had similar wear patterns on my main bearings after about 20 minutes of running a new engine.  And once my new engine warmed up, it started to pound bad, sounded like it was from the oil pump or distributor drive etc.  

When I pulled the engine apart, i found std bearings installed on a crank that had been turned .010 under.  I put new bearings and no problems yet. albeit I have driven only 120 miles so far!
