Subject: South wind gas heater

i am looking to buy a gas heater, and saw this one on ebay <A HREF="http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=6775&item=2401486675&rd=1">
http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=6775&
item=2401486675&rd=1</A>.  has anyone had any expirience with these heaters.  is 
seems like installation would be very simple, becuase there are no seemingly 
no safety switches or much of a wiring harness.  i really dont care at all 
about having to take up space in the car.  i would rather do that than cut 
holes for a BN4.  any comments are very welcome.  thanks
