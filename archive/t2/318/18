List, please comment on my conversation with randy about bulkheads in the 79 bus:

Me to Randy:
Are you serious? We're talking about the metal wall behing the seat connected at the bottom to the top of the wheelwell.
I was certain that they were gone by '77. My 79 has no bulkhead, only a triangular gusset of steel welded from the wall to the pedestal like on the passenger side. I will ask the list about this one. Either way, I don't know why it would affect the fit of the seat pedestal side wrap, maybe the top piece.
