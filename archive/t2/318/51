From what I have read, your mechanic is correct- use 30 wt for break in and definately do not use any castrol oil for the first 1000 miles or so.  No synthetics either- they are too slippery and do not alow for proper seating of bearings and such.  check the archives under break in and you will find a lot of information regarding this.

I am breaking in my 2.0 right now. I am on my 3rd oil change of straight Delo 30 weight.  120 miles and counting!  ; )
