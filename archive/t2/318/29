When me and two friend went up the Pacific Coast Highway for springbreak we
had an old oak desk chair in the bus behind the front seat so we could all
hear each other while rolling. Whoever was in it was the "Bombardier"

My friend had a vanagon and we were also carrying a large
chair but it was a big cushy, couch-like char, we had it right on
top of the engine.
What a view that was, you were much higher than the rest
of the passengers, like the Vanagon king on the Throne.
