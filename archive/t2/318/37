Subject: break in

Hi All

I'm having my '71 Westy 1600 DP rebuilt, moving up to 1641cc and dual
kadrons. I was talking break in procedures and was surprised to hear the
mechanic plans to put in straight 30 wt oil.
I'm inclined to drive it home, drain it and refill with Castrol 10-30. After
a few oil changes, convert to mobil one after about 1200 miles. I live in
Oregon.

I'm not starting an oil thread here, but would appreciate some comments or
experience of others break in procedures.

Thanks,

Pete
