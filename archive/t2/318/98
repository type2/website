I'll try to ID it tomorrow morning.  I picked up a Haynes Manual for the
bus, which is how I managed to notice the engine enigma after having been
out of bug/bus ownership for so long.

(Whatza "PO"?)

I'll probably have to stick with the existing carb setup until I can afford
to replace the carb and manifold with the twins.

Thanks.
