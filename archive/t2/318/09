Subject: Anyone have a 72-72 NOS German right heat exchanger?

I know I can get a left heat exchanger from Bus Depot, but I'd like to get a 
German right one also.  Anyone know where I can get one?  I'm converting a 77 
bus to the older heat exchangers.  My stock ones are full of holes.

Thanks
Neal
