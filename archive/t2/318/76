Subject: Re:Important cooling tin-the skid plates in a 74 exh system

When I had the 75 rebuilt, I used the exhaust system from a 74 bus, and
the skid plates from the 75 are not compatible, as there is no upipe
setup....don't have the 74 plates- any suggestions- like what do those
who go to 74 exhaust setups on later busses do??
