Well, I've learned a little bit more about my Baby...

Stats:
'77 VW Microbus
Manufactured: 11-76
VIN: 227205...
VIN Breakdown:
22 - Microbus
7 - 1977
205... - Serial Number
Engine Code (on block w/VW logo): W0111993
Engine Code (on plate pinned over original #): 5573 AP 422224

So, it's not a '72...

But, if it's a '76 it should have a fuel injected suitcase in it, right?

What it has is a single carb suitcase.  From the empty brackets scattered
around the engine compartment, I'm assuming that Baby has had her power
plant replaced some time in the past.

Would someone kindly explain to this aging rediscoverer of the joys of
beatlehood, what the two engine codes might signify?

I'm assuming that the "AP" on the brass plate pinned over the original #
indicates that it's an 1800cc, but that's as far as I can take it.  But the
1800cc is supposed to have twin Solex 34's on it, and this engine has just
one carb.

Help!
