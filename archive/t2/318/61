Subject: brake upgrade on a '72 westy

Hi all,

the '72 and I think '73 front brake calipers and rotors are becoming harder to find and the '74-'79 are everywhere and half price.  Can I switch to the larger calipers and rotors from the later buses without changing out the hub and backing plate that is currently on '72?

TIA,

Paul
