Okay, according to http://home.planet.nl/~koni1691/ecodes.html, an "AP" is:
Code   HP    Liter        Year             Car
  AP _ 068 _ 1,8 _ 08/73 - 07/75 _ Type 2

But, a "W" is:

   W _ 080 _ 1,7 _ 08/69 - 07/73 _ Type 4

Hmm...

>From http://www.type4.org/technology/enginecodes_html, I got:

Letter   Dates       Count   Displacement    Output       Remarks
   W   8/69-7/73  250,000         1.7         59kw/80hp   D-Jetronic

So, Baby's engine started out as a 1700cc in a Type 4, '69-'73, 411/412; but
she doesn't have the D-Jetronic fuel injection system, she has a single
carb.

Still need that help... :O)
