Subject: Thing Gas Heater in '69 Bus?

I have a choice of one of two gas heaters for Itch - a by-George used BN4 (I 
think that's the one that's right - my local VW Guru has a period correct 
one on the shelves), or a brand new-in-box Thing heater, which the mechanic 
said has the same physical dimensions (will fit on the drivers side engine 
compartment), but different mounting points (but still very do-able).

So, assuming I'm getting a killer price on the Thing heater, what's the way 
to go? Can anybody tell me what the model of the Thing heater is? The 
downsides?

I was going to install it using the existing ducting from somewhere close to 
the heater boxes, instead of worrying about drilling Big Holes in the 
passenger portion of the Westy. Any advice?

Thanks -

Mike & Itch
