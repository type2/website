The engine swap rules allow you to put in an engine only as old as the
chassis.  If you put in a younger engine you essentially "fountain of youth"
the whole car as far as smog is concerned because the chassis isn't
responsible for emissions.

With that 1979 engine, you'll be exempt at the same time an original 79
model would be: Jan 1st, 2008. Those are the rules; whether they follow them
correctly is another matter.

BTW, I recently found out that both Pertronix and Compufire have a CARB
exemption (executive order) so it's CA legal to put in any car that has
points.
