Subject: 68 only?

HI  !!   Everybody...
       I just purchased a 1968 SC. It is in great shape and my wife and I 
love it . We have been split bus folks for quite some time and we are a bit 
short on BAY knowledge. 
       Is our dash board a one year item? Also, can anyone please tell us 
which other items on our SC is specific to 1968 or 68-71? I plan to hit swap 
meets this spring and we need to know what to ask for. 
       Thanks a million.  

       Your VW Friends,   Patty & Paul
