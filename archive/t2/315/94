John,

You may have a leak in the exhaust system where there are gaskets 
between the bolt on connections. I have not worked on a 78 exhaust 
before but my recollection from the Bentley Manual is that it is a 
great deal more complex than the 72 to 74 that I have futzed with. A 
good test for an exhaust leak being the cause of popping is to go 
down a hill and let off the gas so that engine compression is 
breaking the vehicle speed. If you hear a pop pop pop sound then 
start looking at exhaust components. What is happening is air is 
being sucked in through leaks  in the hot exhaust system an causing 
combustion of uncombusted exhuast gasses in the exhaust system.

Tyoe 4 motors are not my field  of expertise but it seems like I 
remember there being metal gaskets between the cylinders and the 
heads on a type 4 motor that we tore down once. I cannot imagine what 
would cause these to need replacement except the excessive heat (read 
explosions instead of controlled ignition) in the combustion chambers 
charring them.

If you do need to remove the heads than anecdotal evidence suggests 
that it can be down with the motor in the bus but I would bet that 
taking the motor out would be just as easy.

Thanks
