Subject: spontaneous airs...

On the way home yesterday, I-95 rush hour. I saw a light blue convertible
beetle stopped on the side.
pulled over to see if I could help.
Turning over very slowly, but battery seemed ok.
Turned the engine by hand and it seemed very tight. :(
Asked the lady if the oil light had been on and she said it was yesterday
but she added oil. She said when it died it just made a sort of groaning
sound and started slowing down...
Not promising...
She had a phone and AAA. Made sure she got through and they were on the
way and gave her my email and told her Id be glad to give her advice if I
can so she doesnt get taken.
