I should have clarified this a little more:
Yes, the upper is one-year-only but so is the lower
and the connecting tube. 68 uses a metal tube. 69-70
uses a plastic tube. In 71, VW moved the upper to
behind the drivers seat. The material used in the
uppers from 68 to 70 sucked! It self-destructed with
age. The 71 stuff is a lot better....
68 was kidney shaped, 69-70 was round, 71 up was
square.
