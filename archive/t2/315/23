Mike,

I would urge you not try to feed into the existing heater ductwork.  It
might work.  I thought of doing it myself, but I'm glad that I didn't. The
quantity of air pushed by the Eberspacher heater is substantial. I'm not
sure the existing bus system would allow it to pass as freely as the
dedicated system.

John
