Here's are some diagrams:

I think in general the hose from the outer nipple on the vacuum can is the
advance side and goes into the throttle body and is tee'd at the EEC valve
on the air cleaner.

The inner one, the retard side, tees into right side of the air distribution
box between 3/4 cylinders where the hose goes to the pressure regulator.

This diagram is for the SVDA dizzy but you can see that there is a 3-way tee
(dist/air-cleaner/throttle). I understand on your model with the
non-mechanical EGR, the tee is 4 way and the other line goes to the EGR
valve.

The brake booster tees into the air distribution box and goes to the decel
valve in the firewall.

This is a temperature switch according to ETKA but I'm not sure where it
goes.  Anyone?
