Hey Robert S. Williams, MD:

AVP has been around for quite awhile and has, as far as I know, an
unblemished reputation for being very good rebuilders and *extremely*
responsive to any problems.  So:

Thoughts: Sounds like you have a problem with this engine.
Comments: It sounds like a bad valve.
Advice: Call AVP and ask for help.  I'll bet you get some.
