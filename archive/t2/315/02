Have you seen the groves made by the siping machine? They are miniscule. I

Has anyone actually represented the sipes in such a way as to allude that 
they have any 'aquachanneling' effects, or that they were actually intended 
to perform this function in the first place?  Asking the tire-jockey at your 
local Pep Boys what the engineered effects of siping are, is like asking 
Bo-Bo the astronaut chimpanzee what the escape velocity of his capsule was.  
I have a set of all-weather performance Dunlop tires on my Passat that are 
siped from the factory for improved traction in the ice and snow.  In effect 
giving me mini 'studs' on a studless tire.  I believe the Bridgestone 
Blizzaks also use this technology, and it is arguably the 'best' studless 
snow tire on the market.  If I was worried about cold-weather traction for 
my bus, I wouldn't hesitate to have my tires siped.
