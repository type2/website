Subject: Re: [T2] Soft Brakes?

"Low pedal" may be interpreted as Soft Pedal if on the first pump the
pedal goes farther than expected, but on further pumps, grabs right
away?  This would happen with very looose rear shoes- they have to
travel a ways to get to the drum, so the pedal will go further.  One the
next pumps, the shoes are on the drum and you get an instant hard pedal.
    The symptom of fluid coming out of of any hydraulic brake system, ie
around the pistons, is Not Good and should be remedied; likely bad
seals.
