EFI [electronic fuel injection] injectors wear at the
tip of pintle after opening and closing repeatedly.
The pintle is the tapered point that closes the hole
in the end. After a while, the nice taper gets a
groove in it. As the wear increases, so does fuel
volume. An EFI system controls the amount of fuel
going thru the injector by time. i.e. the injector
opens for a certain amount of time depending on load
and throttle position. The same X amount of time
whether you have brand new or worn injectors. As they
wear, the engine will run richer. You can adjust the
mixture at idle but not off-idle.

Starting in 79 on Calif buses, O2 sensors were
installed. These are good... they correct the mixture
as you drive.

Sure, you could possibly run cleaners thru the
injectors, but they are probably worn out. If you
think you have a plugged one, [rare], you should
replace the set with a matched new set. Rebuilt are
usually decent. I have seen more out-right failures
with the electrical part however. The windings give
up. Or the resister pack has a dead circuit.
