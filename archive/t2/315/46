As far as I know, the dash is the same is the same as
68-72. Some pieces are 68/69 only, such as the padded
edge.

That is a tall order!  Some things may have been
'upgraded' to later parts. Here are a few differences
off the top of my head: 

1) brake fluid upper reservoir, 68 only
2) wiper arms and shafts, 68 only. Resemble 67 and
back, the tapered splines started in 69.
3) front doors, 68 only. Inner lock knobs are on top
of the sill, 69 to 74? the lock knob next to the inner
handle. 75? up, the lock knob moved back to the sill
but the hinge bolts are different and the later doors
have vents in the front edge of them. 
4) front door handles are push button, like 67 and
back. Lever action started in 69.
5) front belly pan is 68/69 only, longer than 70 and
up

That is all I can think of on the spur of the
moment.....
