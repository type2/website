Sorry to say that all the evidence you have confirmed by sight alone says 
with no uncertainty that you need a complete reman long block. I predict, 
with the evidence you give, you have not more than a few hundred miles, and 
maybe but a few dozen more miles, before engine failure. You next drive 
should be to where the work will be done, then park it. Or drive to failure 
and pay the tow.

So, to answer your question, yes, your engine is foul. For best certainty 
of getting a REAL longblock, (real German metals in spec or better and 
built for todays fuels), see NW Con Rod, Seattle, regardless the shipping 
costs. Their machine craft and inspection and assembly procedures have been 
under constant refinement since the 50's and the earliest VW's to hit these 
shores. That's Northwest Connecting Rod, Seattle, WA. No connection to me 
except as my vendor for my clients VW's to insure their TIME/MONEY per MILE 
ratio is righteous.
