Volks,

I was wandering around Sams Club at lunch today and happened upon a "Generator" for $99.  This generator it turns out is really a battery/inverter combo on a little wheeled cart.  It has a built-in 600 watt inverter and (here's the great part) a 40 amp-hour AGM battery.  In addition it comes with a nice looking charger for the internal battery.  The battery of course is completely sealed and can be kept indoors without worry.  40 amp-hour is much bigger than what is in most of the little jump-start boxes that they sell these days.  I paid twice that much for just a 600-watt inverter a few years ago so this is a great deal.  Looks like it would fit easily under the seat, or hardwire it in.

Go get'em!
