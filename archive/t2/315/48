Subject: defrost vents

Listees,
    I have just rigged up my heater boxes to stay open, thanks to this extra
cold in Southeast NC. My control cables to them are shot. They are a future
project.
    Now I am trying to figure out what levers control what vents. I can't
seem to stop the cold air from blowing through 2 of the the 4 defrost vents
and also a little comes throught the round dash vents.
    My front flaps are closed and I even added a piece of vinyl behind the
"grill" in case they weren't sealing properly. I do have 3 holes on the nose
where a spare tire rack was once mounted, but I don't know why that would
allow air to flow through the vents.
    Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.
Later,
Jim
