Subject: Re: [T2] Charcoal Canister for '72 Bus

My computer decided it no longer wants to exist
anymore as of 2 weeks ago, so I am answering this
using my Webtv. I cannot access ETKA. If anyone is
waiting for a reply from previous messages, sorry.....
my computer mail is all gone. I cannot recover any of
it from the hard drive.

According to my 68 parts book, it shows part # 113 201
801A for M code M-26. M-26 is California vehicles. My
parts book covers 68 to 12/71 buses. So that includes
72 year models.
I looked up the bracket for the cannister and two part
numbers are listed. One # to chassis # 211 2300 000
and one # from 211 2000 001. But only 1 cannister.....

I don't think it will fit.
