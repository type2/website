Subject: A revision of a brief question...

Yesterday I asked about the time it would take for the head gaskets to 
be replaced on my '78 bus;  I  am greatful for the replies but several 
people asked the pertinent question, "why do you think this needs to be 
done anyway?"  Someone who professes to know VW busses told me my 'heads 
are popping" and that I need the gaskets replaced.  The symptom is that 
I do get a popping noise if  I rev the engine really hard (normally I 
don't hear this noise, and normally I don't rev my engine like that!)  I 
looked in my Muir book and found something about loose heads, but as I 
am pretty ignorant (obviously) I figured I would ask you guys. Thanks 
again.  Beth in NJ
