I laid out ALL the pieces needed for a 75-78 2.0. Counting the heater flap
valve pipes, the two plates to seal the heater boxes-to-fan housing, and the
muffler heat shield; the total is 22 pieces!
Here is a pic of all the pieces:

[yes, I have the full set as pictured]

If  you are putting a 2.0L into a 74. with the
72-74 style heater boxes?
If yes, then a 2.0L complete tin set will NOT work. You will need to replace 6
pieces with 1700-1800 pieces:
the front lower tin, L + R,
the lower pushrod cover tin, L + R,
the heater valve pipes, L + R,
[and the alternator adjuster/exhaust support is also different]
