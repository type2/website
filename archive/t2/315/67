Wow, great info Jamie.

Question: Anyone have an ideas on how **we** can "rate" gasolines from 
various manufacturers?  Maybe someone who has a cylinder temp gauge and 
a regular commute could report some values for us running different 
grades of fuel??

This summer I contacted PetroCanada (A nation-wide fuel reseller in 
Canada) asking about the temperature impact of their "clean burning" 
Tactrol additive, asking specifically if they had any info about the 
impact it had on combustion chamber temps. I waited several weeks for 
them to follow up their original response but nothing seemed to be 
happening.  It was 6 weeks later when I pressed them for  a reply that 
they sent me a nice 20-page .pdf with before/after pictures of clean 
valves and injectors, and a paragraph in the accompanying email that 
said:

IF THERE IS NO AVAILABLE DATA THEN HOW CAN THEY KNOW THAT THE HEADS 
WON'T BE AFFECTED?

According to the info from PetroCanada, the injectors and valves are 
being cleaned through solvent action of the additive. They have run 
100000-km tests of identical (**water-cooled**) FI engines running 
tactrol and non tactrol fuels and show the results side-by-side, and it 
does look impressive. They also show improvements in injectors and 
guides after 20000 km runnning, and they also look cleaner.  But they 
don't have *any* temperature data, or at least none that they are 
sharing.

I posted the 650K pdf online at 
http://www.pottsfamily.ca/PetroCanada/SuperClean.pdf if anyone is 
interested.

I no longer put Petro-Canada fuel in my bus, and I always by regular 
grade fuel. And there is a head-temp gauge in my near future, too.

As always, your milage may vary.
