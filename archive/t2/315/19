Subject: Charcoal Canister for '72 Bus

Anybody know the correct part # for the charcoal canister on a '72?  Trying
to find this part so I can complete the original setup on my bus.  Will p/n
175 201 801A (73-79) fit?  I have the original strap in the engine
compartment, just nothing to go in it...

						Thanks in advance,
