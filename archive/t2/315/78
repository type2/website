Indeed. Their statement is irrational. But they are right, no data is 
AVAILABLE to anyone outside their labs, not that such data does not exist. 
It's private data for their use only if they choose. Every single batch at 
the refinery has quick and simple though costly equipment set up for proof 
testing the combustion characteristics of each mix. See SAE for info on 
fuels and additives and access to some reported data from the few who will 
release data.

The cost of one batch out of spec could cost several thousands of engines 
or running problems, far beyond the cost of the test equipment and 
procedures. Do you think Shell or Exxon or BP would risk the harm to sales 
worldwide if a single outbreak of evidence from mechanics of foul fuel in 
any market region hit the headlines?????? The cost of good inspection 
process is but a fraction of the cost of such a scandal. It's just rational 
economics, 101. Note also their focus is upon current technology uses. Some 
of them care very little for the effects on a 20 year old vehicle. But a 
few refinements of specs on these older VW motors are required to insure 
compatibility with todays fuels.
