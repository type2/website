True CVs can make an ungodly thump. Good idea to check the boots and
maybe regrease them if its been a long time or never.
so many possiblilites for a noise.
-cvs
-loose axle nuts
-loose brake parts
-bearings
-not to forget the lug bolts

Ive had most of them at one time or another.
Start with checking the easy to get to stuff and work your way up to the
more difficult.

lug bolts
axle nuts
spin wheel bearing check
cv boots
brake inspection
etc
