I agree with Greg on this with an additional bit of info.  73-79 Bus
Steering Boxes generally never require a rebuild because VW finally got it
right on their redesign of the box's innards.  Buses up to 72 have what's
called a "worm and peg" design which because of wear between the worm and
the peg can get pretty sloppy.  The 73-79 design is of the "worm and
roller" style which is superior in long term reliability and wears less
frequently because of that design.  Beetles, Ghias and Type 3s went to
"worm and roller" in 1962 and I'm surprised that VW took so long to adapt
the design to the venerable Type 2.  And when the later steering box's
innards begin to go, you'll really know it, they're a real bear to steer
and the box should be replaced.
