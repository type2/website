So that explains why my 240,000 mi engine is running a bit rich (based
on tailpipe; plugs are not bad)- but I must ask after N. Palmer's post
on adjusting the AFM- Is he referring to the external mix screw or an
internal one?  I thought only the idle mix was adjustable, but Jon, the
local mechanic, said that the screw INSIDE the AFM controls the mix
overall, as does playing with the coil spring tightness?  BTW, I got new
injectors for the daughter's 75 bus (old ones were blocked).
