Do you still have the sticker on the engine lid?  Here are the specs:

Early 76 settings just before in that same list.

GD Engine:

All that info is nice but list advice says to set the gap so the dwell reads
50 degrees.

Spark plugs: use Bosch W8CC and set gap to 0.7mm

Valves: 0.006 in. on both intake and exhaust on stock 76 2L with solid
lifters.

A genuine VW one is $35 and of course there is the junkyard if you are
lucky? Why do you want a plastic one?
