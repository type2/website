Subject: timing settings? VW emblem?

My 1976 2 Ltr. bus needs urgent attention. Still waiting for my Bentley manual.

Could someone please post the timing settings (as on pulley) for this motor?

Also, where can I buy on-line a plastic reproduction of the front "VW" emblem?

Thanks for your reply.
