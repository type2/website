I had this happen once and I believe it was when I accidentally hit it with
one of my tools. There was a definite leak that ran down the inside of the
backing plate but I left it and a month later when I checked on the brakes
there was no leak and pushing on the seals didn't produce one either.

The wheel cylinder was pretty rusty so I decided to replace it anyway but it
seemed to stop leaking on me.

As far as brake adjustments go I've followed the Dolan method with great
success:
