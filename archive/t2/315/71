> Thus MOST owners never understand that the BOOK they
are tuning the engine to is LONG OUT OF DATE. The tune
up part of the book, does not take into account for
today's fuel. But the fuel has changed properties, the
engine has more air getting in. The book specs haven't
changed.

I agree, but......
Here in California, to pass the smog check test, the
timing must not be more than 3 degrees past specs. Not
sure about other states....
It would be nice if they just tested by the tailpipe
emissions, but no.... you have to pass the visual and
mechanical inspection 1st.
[not sure about the part about 'more air getting in'
though. A 34 pict carb flows the same amount of air
today as it did 30 years ago :)]
