Subject: 70 Wheel Knock

I had a similar problem. It was the bolt that connected the shock absorber to the bus on the left front. It doesn't have to be very loose to start making noise, and it will get looser very quickly.

Mine was making a very distracting clunk whenever I hit a bump. The washboarded roads out to Cholla Bay in Rocky Point Mexico were amazing and very scary. It was impossible to diagnose while the bus was stationary because we couldn't see it bouncing on the bolt until I talked my brother-in-law into running next to the bus as I drove it. This may not be your problem, but it was definitely mine. It is a cheap fix. When my right rear shock was loose, I had the same problem, but it was very hard to find because the noise flowed thoughout the chassis. It sounded like the battery was banging around the engine compartment. Only did it on bumps, though.

The thing about the noise going away on a turn depends on which way you are turning and which wheel has the problem. If you are making a right turn, the weight of the bus will shift OFF the right wheels and ON to the left wheels. So, if your problem is with your right wheel, right turns will make the sound go away and left turns will make it worse. I discovered this when my right rear axel stub was going south. It only made the noise when I made a left turn, because the weight shifted over and it was enough to aggravate the condition.

Good luck
