Subject: Re: [T2] Autohaus AZ

Bob-
I'm a big fan of Autohaus AZ for parts for later import vehicles (87 
GTI, 94 Subaru).  All I have in town is NAPA and Kragen, no local import 
shop.

Autohaus AZ ships fast and offers good customer service (changing 
internet orders etc.)  Like you said, can't beat the prices either.

For BUS or vanagon stuff I usually order from Bus-boys.com since they 
are nearby, or Bus Depot when I am in no hurry because they have all the 
special Bus stuff.  (Both price-competitive as well.)

PS.   Other folks might know the best for body parts.  Best and least 
expensive would be a friend parting out a junk or wrecked vehicle.  
Check with Bus-Boys or Bus Depot they are both invaluable sources.

>Also, has where is the best and least expensive place to buy body parts for a'78 Westy?
