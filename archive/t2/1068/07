Subject: Understanding '74 auto tranny shift points

Since the purchase of our '74 Westy, the automatic transmission has been
an adventure into uncharted territories for us, and while I've done some
reading in the Bentley and online in general, I'm having a hard time
understanding what sets the shift points.

To be specific, it is very noticeable that when applying full throttle,
the shift to second gear happens at a much lower rpm than the shift to
third gear. I don't have a tachometer installed to get specific, but it is
very certain that this is the case. I also don't have the numbers off the
tranny at this point, and it is not the original (I'm not sure how many
different versions of the automatic transmission VW made.) This leads me
to my first question...

Is this earlier shift for fist gear by design?

My initial thoughts lead me to believe that there wouldn't likely be any
additional safety in this setup.  I can't see how having 1st gear shift
earlier than second gear would provide any margin of stress reduction or
added drive train life.  Though, these are merely my non-specialist
ponderings which could be (and likely are) missing a few core bits of
understanding in the department of transmissions.  This leads me to my
second question...

Is the rpm at which first gear is shifted to second adjustable, or is
statically set by the design of the transmission?
