Although I have been lurking for quite
some time now, this is my first post. My son and I have a '74 Westy  which is
pretty well factory so far and is in good condition body wise.

A P.O. had
installed a single Weber Progressive carb. We rebuilt it and still had major
problems with it idling and staying running.

It had the single paper air
filter. When it did run, it was quite noisy. We were able to obtain a set of
dual Solex PDSIT's and put together the original installation of carbs,
balance tubes and throttle linkage. Although the air cleaner is bigger, the
engine is much quieter now. It also runs and idles a lot better now with the
dual solex's and the vaccum leaks fixed. BTW the biggest vacuum leak we had
was the brake booster line.
