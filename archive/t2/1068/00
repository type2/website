Subject: Re: [T2] '74 Westy rear brake shoes

Speaking of the C-Clip,

I just did new shoes on my '75 - the old brake shoes had a pin
connecting the lever that seemed peened/pressed on, so I had to drill
out the pin's heads in order to get the levers off - I then replaced
them with the pin/c-clip combination.

I found that in order to get the c-clip to stay attached to the the
pin I had to gently close up the opening a bit. Is this the common
practice or did I miss something? Also, I had to use a washer in order
to fill some of the gap between the clip and the shoe.

Interestingly I went and checked my '71 parts pile and found that a PO
had used a nut and bolt - and had welded the nut on for "safety".
