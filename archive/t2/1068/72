Subject: Re: [T2] Book called "How to Restore VW Bus" - Mark Paxton

Geez, wouldn't that be an awesome way to learn! Good point Terry. Hmmm, I 
can retire in 3 yrs, then maybe I'll start a second career. :-) At least 
learn the basics. I might check out our local college too, they might have 
bodywork courses. My biggest reason for wanting the book is to look at how 
all the panels assemble. Of course I'll find that out when I start removing 
the rockers. :-)

I think it would be very difficult to learn bodywork from a book.  And  when
your lacking in quality repair parts(panels).

 Mark had someone intern at his shop, that seems the best way to  learn.  I
 did that at a street rod shop.
