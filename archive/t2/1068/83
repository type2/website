Subject: Rear Apron Repair

Hey all,

My Westy is all pulled apart, and so far we have one front dogleg in
(waiting for the other to ship from Bus Depot, they accidentally sent two
passenger side ones, but they were kind enough to replace it a year later).
The dogleg/wheelarch was a great fit, and looks to be pretty seamless.

I dropped the engine and pulled the bumper. The rear apron is shot, which I
knew, as well as the battery tray corner, which I knew, but the structural
member below and behind has a lot of rot. The bumper bolt is completely
rusted away, the only thing holding the bumper on was habit. How have others
dealt with this repair? I find it very difficult to figure out what the
replacement panels from the various vendors include with the piece, and I
think it is just the skin. Is there a structural member replacement part
available? Has anyone done some custom fabrication to fix this area?


Thanks in advance.

Ned
