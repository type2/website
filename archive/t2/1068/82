Subject: Re: [T2] question about steering box adjustment on a 78

I've done mine while troubleshooting sloppy steering. It wasn't the
problem, but the adjustment was pretty easy. Loosen the big locknut,
use a big flathead screwdriver to adjust, tighten the big locknut.

Use the Bentley specs for how far to go. If you adjust it incorrectly
it will wear out faster.
