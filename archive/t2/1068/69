Subject: Re: [T2] Carpeting my Westy - archeological find?

My 71 Westy has the original floor in the passenger area.? It is some sort of very thin off-white textured vinyl material bonded to a thin (1/4" or so) masonite type of substrate.? Under that is plywood - the metric equivalent of 3/4" inch, I think.? All original.? Needing an update.?
