Subject: Rusted beam on my 77 ???

I just noticed that the very bottom of the shock tower sheetmetal on my passenger side has a small rust out area about the size of a quarter on it. I doubt there are repair pieces available for this, so what is the usual procedure for repair? Can I just clean it all up, rust treat it, and affect some type of repair with epoxy or fiberglass? It is right on a rounded corner, so welding sheetmetal would be a real trial of fitting etc etc. I checked the rest of the beam and it is solid. Strange one small place would rust?? The metal all around it is hammer solid.
