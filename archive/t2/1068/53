Subject: Removing ignition lock 68 westy

All,

 

Hello, I am trying to replace the ignition switch on my 68 westy.  I have
the everything disassembled down to just needing to unplug all the turn
signal wires, then I can remove the entire housing .  Now Bentley says that
you cannot remove the lock assembly from the housing, that you must replace
the whole housing with the lock.  Is this still true?  The reason I ask, is
because the VW key in the ignition has not worked since I have owned the
bus.  The PO had a generic starter switch wired up and just hanging there,
and I am trying to get it back to more of a stock set up.  

 

The vw key will turn the ignition switch sometimes, but those times are few
and far between.  The key is pretty worn down, and my first move is to get
some new keys made.  I was wanting to take my ignition lock to the locksmith
to see if it was the key making it unable to turn, or the lock itself.  But
if he cannot get the lock out of the housing, then probably it is no use.
Not sure where to go from here.  My new switch female part will not
interface with the male part on the ignition lock, it appears to be chewed
up a little (the lock), I may need to do some dressing in there to get
things to mesh.  But my biggest worry now is the key rarely being able to
turn the lock.  

 

Also, there was no ignition switch in there, so the little tiny screw that
holds the switch in is missing.  Any idea on what size that little guy is? 

 

Also, the lock does not appear to have anything protruding to lock the
wheel, in any key setting.   Is this normal for 68 bus, or has it been
mucked up as well?

 

Thanks for the input.

 

Mark
