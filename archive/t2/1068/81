Subject: ....steering box

I have a 1972 bay, and it had a sort of heavy click in the 
steering...tightening up the screw made it have a tight spot in the 
steering that I didn't really like...so i loosened it up until the click 
was back, then re-tightened it to where the click just barely went away, 
and that seems to work the best...it has let me put off replacing the 
steering box for a long time...
