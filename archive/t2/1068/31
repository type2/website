Hi Mark,

I don't know of any shops in your area; but I would strongly recommend 
you pick up a copy of the Wilson book on how to rebuild a VW engine. 
Even if you don't do the work yourself, it will still help you become 
more knowledgeable when shopping and talking to prospective mechanics.

Another detail: Have you priced out a longblock from Boston Engine or 
other vendors? You might find that buying a longblock from a reputable 
source to be cheaper than the cost of parts and machining to fully 
refurbish your engine.

Happy Trails,
