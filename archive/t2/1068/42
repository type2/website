if you get under a raised bus, redundancy redundancy redundancy.
when I raise my bus, I leave the jack, slightly backed off. Jack
stands and a crib of heavy timbers just in case.

I'm pretty strong but not strong enough to hold my bus up

I have an older (Harbor Freight) transmission jack that I have put a
seat on, great for working on the engine, has wheels and it can be
raised and lowered to get that "right" height.  RedGreen get it right
often.  although I will use bolts rather than duct tape to hold the
engine in.
