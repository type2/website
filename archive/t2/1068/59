Subject: Air Cleaners - Stock or Pod-Style?

Another thing people dont consider with the pod style air cleaners is that they do not have an inlet for the hose that comes from the charcoal canister, which in turn comes from the engine tin just behind the ignition coil. If you go with pod style air cleaners, you have to engineer some kind of adapter for the hose, if you go with the stock setup, everything you need has already been engineered. My vote, keep it stock. And remember, its YOUR bus, if you want the pods, use the pods :)
