Subject: Vanagon Exhaust Swiss Cheese- header? Looking for...

Hey Y'all.
The exhaust system on my 85 Vanagon is full of holes, I sound like a tank driving down the road.  The V-gon is getting tired and it is just a back-up driver so I don't want to spend a lot of bread (and as Mark Dearing will tell you, I am a cheap S.O.B.!!)  So does any one have suggestions for a cheap replacement.  I have holes everywhere (thanks to Ohio winter road salt), so it is not just one part needing replaced.  And we no longer have emissions testing here, so I don't need that pesky cat or anything like that (environmetalists, ignore that last part!) So, are there aftermarket headers or cheap replacements???

PEACE! 
John Baker
