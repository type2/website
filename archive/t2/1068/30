I designed the bracket, and we sell them for $29.95 plus shipping. Here is a link to the ad:

Or you can email me off-list for more details.

My cabinets were quite a job. On each one, the laminate was peeled off using an old clothes iron to melt the underlying glue.  From there, the remaining 5-ply was sanded down one level; so now it is 4-ply.  Everything was treated with wood conditioner, stained with Minwax Pickled Oak stain (2 coats) and cleared with Minwax Polycrylic (2 coats). Start to finish it took me a year to do.
