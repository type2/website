Subject: Re: [T2] Sudden loss of power

I had a Beetle do that one time. Turned out the fuel line was clogged. The 
little screen for the fuel outlet had disintergrated (rusted) around the base 
where water would settle. With the screen off little junk would get into the 
fuel line and then pile up anywhere there was a rough surface inside the fuel 
line. 

I took everything apart and run a broken e-brake cable in and out per Muir and 
all was well. Got alot of rust and junk out.
