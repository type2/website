I picked up 'The Complete Guide to Auto Body Repair' by Dennis W. Parks

http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Complete-Guide-to-Auto-Body-Repair/Dennis-W-Parks/e/9780760332788/?itm=1

In lieu of hands on learning from a pro, I found this book really helpful,
lots of pictures.

I'm in no way affiliated with the author/publisher and am not a paid
endorser ;)


Cheers,
