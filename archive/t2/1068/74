Hi Pat,

Thanks for the good info.  So in your case, are you going to install the
vinyl directly to the birch sub-floor?  I've seen some discussion on the
list about using baltic birch for the side panels, but didn't even
realize the sub-floor was wood.  *blush*  So if the sub-floor and the
side panels are the same material, I'm assuming the thickness is
different?  3.7mm for the side panels?  From neithammer's reply, it
sounds like the sub-floor is about 3/4"?  And they make 5x5 sheets of
this birch for both?

I've got a couple sections of the side panels that need some help as
well.  It's a good point you make about the hassles of vacuuming - under
the carpet was decades of dust and dirt.   I guess it's a preference
like either having carpeting or wood flooring in your house.  Dust
bunnies or dirt, take your pick.  :)  Though I might consider getting
vinyl now, since it does look pretty good.  How far towards the driver
compartment do you go with the vinyl?  They make a carpet kit that
covers the front area into the galleyway there between front and back -
rather than carpeting the whole bus.  I guess I could go with the rubber
mat in front and everything else vinyl.  Would that be the original
design?  No carpet anywhere?

Good luck finding that 4x8.  Heh.

Regards,

John

	The info I'm giving is coming from memory - my first 1971 bus -
when I purchased it in '71.  The flooring was a nondescript dark gray,
speckled material, perhaps linoleum,  As I remember, it had a cloth
backing much like a burlap material.  I've been looking for the last few
week for a similar material for my current '71 Westy and the best I have
located, and here I'm referring to online images, is something in the
Mannington Commercial
<http://www.mannington.com/commercial/resilient/style.asp?style_id=891&t
ype=1>  line

	Perhaps a bit darker but the idea of a "nondescript, speckled
material" is here.  As I recall the material was NOT slick-smooth but
had a small amount of texture so as to not be "slick when wet".  Unlike
most of the residential materials this does not have the tile like
appearance (with the huge grout lines) but is a uniform sheet.
Unfortunately I've had to purchase a piece of that residential material
until I can find something better.

	About sub-floors...I'd read several places about how easy it is
to find a 5x5 sheet of Baltic birch for the sub-floor.  DO NOT let any
of the retail outlets give you the 'never heard of anything that size'
story.  Find a distributor and inquire about the 5x5 and after they say
"Sure!" find out who in your area they supply (they probably won't do a
retail sale directly to you).  Now go to that retailer and make
arrangements to order it or if the distributor is close enough, pay for
it and go to the distributor for pick-up.

	Today I went to the distributor to get some 4x8 sheets of 3.7mm
luan to use for the wood panels on the cargo doors and "walls".  I asked
- do you have this size in Baltic Birch. His reply,  "Sorry, we have
Baltic Birch but it's only in 5x5 sheets."  :-)  Earlier in the day I
had call the distributor to ask about "real thin luan" since 1/8" was
the best I could do at several retail lumber yards - that's when I first
learned of this 3.7mm material.
