Subject: 71 T2 Front-Seat Side-Springs

Looking to get my hands on a funky, rusty seat and swipe good springs 
from it to replace the 2 broken springs on my bad seat.   These are the 
side 'funnel' springs of front driver seat.
Has anyone got a couple of old springs from a 71 T2? Preferably down 
here near Los Angeles?

  Dont need to replace the whole seat.

Thanks, John
