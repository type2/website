Subject: Book called "How to Restore VW Bus" - Mark Paxton

I'm considering buying this book, has anyone read it? I'm especially
interested in the bodywork section. Would appreciate any info. At 40 plus
dollars for a paperback, I would like some input first. My Bentley didn't cost
that! :-)
Thanks,
Courtney
