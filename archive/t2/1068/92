I would imagine that if you are running stock aircleaners with stock tuned
carbs you will have an increase in both performance and fuel mileage.



On my 1400 Suzuki (it is relavent, I swear) I went to K&N pods and had to
change the jetting considerably to make up for the increase in airflow, but
because the bus weighs 4000 pounds more than my Suzuki I would guess that a
change like this would mean poor take-off and low-end power, things very
essential to getting a bus at rest to be a bus in motion.



It's funny, when I was a kid I would have had the stock aircleaners in the
trash 5 minutes after buying my bus, now I am all about stock fuel delivery,
tuning,B gear ratio, tire size, what a geezer.
