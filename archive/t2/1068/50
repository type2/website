Subject: 10% OFF Bus Depot Orders

Just a quick note that I am running a 10% OFF pre-Spring sale, on orders
over $150. This is your chance to stock up for the spring. The referral code
on checkout is SAVE10 .

This offer will NOT be ongoing, and may be withdrawn at any time. Basically
I'm testing it to see how much it increases the average ticket price on a
Bus Depot order (one large order costs me less to fulfill than two small
ones). Exclusions are the same as for the usual 5% list discount (sale
items, made-to-order and special-order items, wheels/tires, engines/trans,
gift certificates, prior purchases). If your order is between $50 and $150
you can still get your 5% List Discount instead (referral code list1e), but
you cannot combine the two.
