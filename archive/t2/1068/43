I generally just release the jack until the bus settles onto the
stands, then lock it down. Also, no matter how secure you think your
bus is, chock the wheels BOTH SIDES. I use a set of proper chocks for
the direction I think the bus is most likely to roll, then a pair of
big rounded rocks for the other direction. The rocks can be driven
over or rolled up on if somehow the bus locks both sides down and
makes them impossible to remove.
