Yeah, I was leaning towards the stock setup, I figure (totally agree with
Martin) why question the wisdom of the engineers who put it there in the
first place. I wonder if the pods were more designed for lighter
applications for say, a beetle not a big old bus. I assume the PO went the
pod route because he was faced with replacing the whole air cleaner and this
was a quicker cheaper fix.

Oh well, quick and fix in the same sentence just doesn't do it for me :D


Thanks for the input guys,
