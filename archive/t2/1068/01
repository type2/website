Nut and bolt is bad. Order the pin and horseshoe clip - Busdepot has  
them. Nuts do come loose over time and then you get really funny  
brake behavior and scratched drum surfaces.

I tried loctite, peening, and other tricks to make the nut and bolt  
combo work (I am cheap and lazy ...), but I had to redo the arm way  
to often. Do yourself the favor and do it right the first time.
