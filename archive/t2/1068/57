I reckon individual filters are the "worst of both worlds" compared to
the stock filter. When the engine is cold they are sucking in cold air
and vice-versa. Just the opposite of what you want. This applies more so
to the single carb, but is still an issue on dual carbs. To use the old
fallback of "the German engineers", you just need to think "why would
they have bothered with the complicated stock arrangement when they
could have stuck a couple of dinky air filters on?"
