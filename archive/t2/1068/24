Hi all,

I've got my bus completely stripped and have a better handle on what needs
replacement. I purchased a complete right rear section from Bus Depot
because it was genuine. The guys who own the shop are friends of mine, and
one thinks we should cut the whole panel out and use the complete new one,
and the other thinks we should put a seam in. Also, is there an interior
skin for the battery tray? Thoughts on this?

Also, I've found my passenger door needs replacing, as well as the rear gate
and engine hatch. I am looking for good replacements, and currently waiting
for some responses from list members who may have a line on them. Any
thoughts on whether I should have these stripped before replacing or not?

There's not too much rot on the bus, other than the wheel arches (the step
is rotted but the wheel well is very solid) which I have also purchase
complete rockers for from Bus Depot. I've repaired the windshield in the
past, but it looks like it needs more attention again, and I have purchased
a repair kit from Bus Depot for that. The rear skirt under the engine hatch
is junk, and the metal under the vent window has a couple of small holes in
it (sure to enlarge once we grind it down).

Thanks for reading, and hopefully for responding....

Ned
