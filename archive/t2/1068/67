Subject: Carpeting my Westy - archeological find?

So I decided to finally replace the grungy household-grade carpet in my
71 Westy.  Underneath it in the passenger area are these thin yellow
colored squares (not having them on hand at the moment, I'm guessing
maybe 8" on a side) of some sort of polyester-weave material.  Does
anyone know if that would be the original carpeting or sound deadener
material, or maybe just something that the PO scrounged up?  I'm
purchasing a new carpet kit and am not sure if I should keep that stuff
in there for any reason other than posterity.

Thanks,

John
