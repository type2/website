Subject: Re: [T2] Carpeting my Westy - archeological find?

The info I'm giving is coming from memory - my first 1971 bus - when I 
purchased it in '71.  The flooring was a nondescript dark gray, speckled 
material, perhaps linoleum,  As I remember, it had a cloth backing much 
like a burlap material.  I've been looking for the last few week for a 
similar material for my current '71 Westy and the best I have located, 
and here I'm referring to online images, is something in the Mannington 
Commercial

line

Perhaps a bit darker but the idea of a "nondescript, speckled material" 
is here.  As I recall the material was NOT slick-smooth but had a small 
amount of texture so as to not be "slick when wet".  Unlike most of the 
residential materials this does not have the tile like appearance (with 
the huge grout lines) but is a uniform sheet.  Unfortunately I've had to 
purchase a piece of that residential material until I can find something 
better.

About sub-floors...I'd read several places about how easy it is to find 
a 5x5 sheet of Baltic birch for the sub-floor.  DO NOT let any of the 
retail outlets give you the 'never heard of anything that size' story.  
Find a distributor and inquire about the 5x5 and after they say "Sure!" 
find out who in your area they supply (they probably won't do a retail 
sale directly to you).  Now go to that retailer and make arrangements to 
order it or if the distributor is close enough, pay for it and go to the 
distributor for pick-up.

Today I went to the distributor to get some 4x8 sheets of 3.7mm luan to 
use for the wood panels on the cargo doors and "walls".  I asked - do 
you have this size in Baltic Birch. His reply,  "Sorry, we have Baltic 
Birch but it's only in 5x5 sheets."  :-)  Earlier in the day I had call 
the distributor to ask about "real thin luan" since 1/8" was the best I 
could do at several retail lumber yards - that's when I first learned of 
this 3.7mm material.

Now if I could get lucky on the vinyl/linoleum.  :-)

Oh, yes.  Carpet ...hmmmm?  Don't forget to take along your vacuum 
cleaner.  A small throw rug over the original floor was good enough to 
keep your bare feet from being too cold, and at the same time was sure 
easy to shake out.

Good luck,
Pat
