Subject: 77 Campmobile Engine Rebuild

Hey all,

 I am new to the list. I have a 1977 Campmobile (type 2) and have been ridi=
ng it hard since I was 15 years old in high school. I am now 10 years out o= f
high school and currently in the middle of a rebuild. I have taken the mo= tor
out of the bus and would like to find someone to rebuild the engine.

My question is does anybody know of a repair shop down here in south Florid=
a? I would like to have my engine completely rebuilt.  I would like to do a=
lot of the work but I don't really know how. I have all the books, which i= s
how I got it out of the chassis.=20

Any help will be appreciated.
