Hey, Mark:


Sorry to hear of your troubles.  Hope the coolant leak is not too serious.

Happy to report our '79 Aardvark has heat!  It fired right up tonight after
sitting in the barn since November (about the last time we saw the ground!)
and the heat fix worked!  Took a shakedown cruise of about 35 minutes and it
ran great.

We are packed up and ready to hit the road for Pokagon in the morning.  The
weather forecast for lovely Angola, Indiana is for a high of 31F and a low
of 15F.  This will be really manageable after last year's high of 12 and low
of 2 above.  Heard from Jeff Lincoln.  He and his boy Jack got there about
8:30 after a 3.5 hour drive.  I talked to Jack on the cell - he was about
out of his mind with excitement about the big toboggan ride.

So, we are sad about '87 Vanagon JoesVan, but it will live again after we
pull the engine.  Meanwhile, we'll hit the road with what passes for heat in
'79

See everybody tomorrow at Pokagon!  IMark, will be great to see you at Bus
Benefit in the Spring!

I'll post a trip report next week.
