Subject: Air Cleaners - Stock or Pod-Style?

Hello list,

When I bought my bus it had the pod-style air filter on each carb. I am
trying to determine whether to keep this setup or track down and install a
stock air-cleaner. Just wondered what you folks have to say (good, bad or
ugly) about either setup. I couldn't find anything in the archives...

Cheers,
Zach
