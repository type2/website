Subject: '74 Westy front wheel wheel stud carrier

I have been trying to decipher from my Bently, whether the front wheel lug
stud carrier, has a removable, clean, repack, replace bearing in it? Need to
remove both fronts tomorrow, and wanted to see, if unlike the rears, if you
can pry out old seal, take bearing out, repack and replace, or does it have to
be pressed in and out on a hydraulic press?  Cheers
Syd
