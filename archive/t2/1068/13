Subject: RE: [T2] Sudden loss of power

 Hey Mike



I have a dismantled 1980 Westfalia that did the same thing smoke no power and
backfire alot until it barely could move an inch.  I am not sure of the exact
cause I am still learning at this point but  the guys with the VW brains are
probably going to tell you its time for a rebuild.



Cheers,

Jan
