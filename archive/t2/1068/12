Hey, Volks:

Great time had by all the 5th Annual Bus BRR!  Temps were in the 30's and
the sun was shining as buses gathered at Pokagon State Park.  Many past
attendees were knocked out this year by mechanical failures or other
priorities.  I ended up working up couple night repairing the heating system
on the '79 Aardvark.  It worked really well as we sped down 80/90 at about
63 mph.  It is the first time I have  driven the Aardvark in the snow, so it
was great to have heat!

Those that were there rode the toboggans and enjoyed the fire and pot luck
chili dinners.  Sherrie Aoki, who came all the way form Alliance, Ohio, won
the "Kozy As A Baked Potato" bus award.  The award consisted of cool Idaho
potato stuffed doll and an authentic Buses of the World calendar donated by
Larry Chase.  Thanks, Larry.  We got a call from Kenny Rogers while we were
eating chili and he said the temp in Arizona was 72 degrees - kind of a
contrast to our 17!   Jeff Lincoln's Bus BRR Nut Brown Ale was big hit as we
hung out around the fire  and talked buses. Much discussion of my upcoming
transmission seal replacement on the '87 JoesVan.


Every bus started in the morning, no problems and we were off to brunch in
the Pottawatomie Inn for some great food and Veedub fellowship, then hit the
road with promises to meet again at Bus Benefit May 15 - 17th at Grand Rogue
in Rockford, MI.  Everyone agreed moving the date from the 1st week of
February to the last was the way to go.  The temps on the 1st weekend this
year were 0F!  32 and 17 were a lot easier to deal with!
