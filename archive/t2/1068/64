I got it. Good pictures of bodywork in various states - that's about
all I could recommend it for, it's not really much of a how-to-do
bodywork book as much as I was hoping it would be.

Given the choice of buying this book or two bentleys - buy two
Bentleys. Better yet buy the Bentley and the Wilson book.
