there are two versions.  the easiest way to tell which one you have is
which side of the tranny the shift linkage goes into.

the 003 early tranny has the linkage on the drivers side (lft hand
drive)
the 010 late tranny has the linkage on the passengers side of the
tranny.

the upshift is spec'ed for between 16-21mph at full throttle (1-2)
and the 2-3 shift at 41-45mph

downshift is 2-1   11-14
      3-2   25-30

I wouldn't mess with it until you are sure everything else is running
correctly
