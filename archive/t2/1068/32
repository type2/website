Marc,

I've had more than one type IV engine rebuilt by aircraft mechanics. Is
there a hobby airport near you? Look for a shop at the airport or ask
around. Lots of real aircraft have engines with similar designs that require
the same tools and equipment to work on, and some experimental aircraft
actually have type IV engines in them. The quality is outstanding if you get
a A&P mechanic, and I've found that the prices are not so bad if you make
sure they understand that the engine is going back in your bus and not in an
aircraft, especially if they are local and you don't have to ship engines
all over the place.

of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits acquired by it.'"
