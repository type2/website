This is something I've often pondered, but never acted upon.  I have a 
significant amount of surface rust in my scoops, the function of my bus 
living near the beach for many years...

I had considered dropping the engine, and then using a media blaster, 
possibly one of the hobby type, that has a sufficiently small nozzle to 
get through the grates.  This seemed like a pretty major PITA...

My other thought has been to use rust-converter via an HVLP sprayer, 
then follow-up with a couple coats of automotive enamel.  For me, it's 
not important to have it pretty (runs, drips, orange-peel...who cares in 
there?), but rather to stop the rust-monster. :D

I'd love to hear other opinions on this topic, as well.
