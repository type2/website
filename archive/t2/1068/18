Hi Bruce,

First off I'd recommend a "poor man's compression test", pulling the 
plug wires off one at a time with the engine at idle. If you find that 
one plug makes no difference at all to how the engine is running, then 
you have your culprit narrowed down a bit.

Secondly, I'd recommend checking the vacuum elbow fittings on the dual 
carbs (it is dual cabs, right?) on the sides and top. If they are 
cracked or misplaced then the bus will definitely be down on power.

Thirdly; check for spark at the plug on all 4 cylinders. It could be as 
simple as a bad spark plug wire.

finally, do a real compression check.

Happy Trails,
