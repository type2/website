Hello Ned, for fixing the bumper mounts: my 1977 Kombi had been hit in
the left rear, and the bolts / holes in the frame where the bumper
mounts were torn out. I beat the remaining metal back up to shape and
had a friend weld a strip of metal with two nuts welded to it, narrow
enough to fit in the frame rail above the holes, and longer than the
damaged area. It slides in through the hole in the side of the frame
rail. Since the bumper brackets themselves were bent and weakened, I
also took an earlier mount, cut off the bumper end, and bolted it up
inside the later (wider) mount. Still solid after many years.  Hope this
helps, Timo
