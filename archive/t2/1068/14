Check the fuel system, sometime lack of fuel will make the it backfire. Make
sure the fuel pump is working. I think that '72 is carb check the accelerator
pump injection pipe, i.e. see if it's spray fuel down the carb.
 
Hope this helps

Kinda wierd...

Okay, I know that statment goes wthout saying when we are seeking of our
beloved VW's, but anyway...

I was driving to work the other day. Work is at the top of an 8,000'
mountain...really. My trusty Gamera even handles the snow well...better than
some 4x4's. I drive her up the mountain in 2nd and 3rd (occasionally). My
leaking main seal provides an excellent smoke screen behind me for the person
who is trying to read the engraved sign which reads "If you're behind me you
will be late!".

Anyway, I get to the top of the grade, coast down the 1/4 mile downhill until
I get to the main driveway, turn to make the last 500' of the drive and put
her into 1st and floor it and I have no power at all. She barely crawls at 2
mph and I make it to work. After work its all downhill home except on small
hill which again I went up very slowly.

Today I adjusted the valves (onlt one seemed to need it), tightened the
exhaust man on the pass side, reset the timing, idle and cleaned wires,
plugs,
cap, ect. Still very little power and backfires a lot.

ANY IDEAS?!?
