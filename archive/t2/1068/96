There is a write up in the Type2 library for a vanagon. I don't know how
much difference there is between 74 and vanagon but I imagine the
general procedure is the same. You will be please to see that the
article suggests the old hammer and punch approach can be used to remove
and replace the races. I would suggest using a brass drift to do this to
avoid scoring the surface.
