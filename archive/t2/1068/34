Subject: Ohio Air Cooled Mechanics?

Hi, Volks:

Sherrie visits our Buses by the Beach campouts in her very nice '76 Orange
Westy,  it's a great little bus - automatic , nice shape.  She is in need of
a good air cooled mechanic to help keep it going.

Any recommendations for the Alliance, Ohio, area?  It's near Akron and
Youngstown.

Thanks.
