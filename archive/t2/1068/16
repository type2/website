Jan, on yours I would say one of the vacuum hoses came loose or the cold start injector is stuck on - or it could be the return fuel line is blocked giving way too much fuel rail pressure as the symptoms you are describing are common on an '80 Vanagon. His '72 doesn't have fuel injection, so the only thing that might be in common is that he may have a small vacuum line loose whereas yours would be a large vacuum hose. His is more likely a carb problem and I generally stay away from those questions as I stay away from carburetors!

 Hey Mike
 
 
 
 I have a dismantled 1980 Westfalia that did the same thing
 smoke no power and
 backfire alot until it barely could move an inch.  I am not
 sure of the exact
 cause I am still learning at this point but  the guys with
 the VW brains are
 probably going to tell you its time for a rebuild.
