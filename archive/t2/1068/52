Subject: Indicators wont stay on. 71 T2

I have to hold my Right-turn indicator on every time, the left 
occasionally. It is a nuisance, and dangerous because when it slips off 
people think I have changed my mind about turning, and you know how 
they try to slip around us slowpokes.

I  took it apart from steering column, cleaned etc, but cant find any 
one piece that seems worn or broken.  It is a 71 Type2.

any help much appreciated.
