Okay, Mike - I have never seen / heard of such a thing but it would be oh, so helpful... Where'd you get them? OEM?

 If I remember correctly from the last time I bought brake
 shoes, they already came with the parking brake lever
 attached to one of the shoes.  Plus, they use a similar type
 of pin, but it's compressed such that it can't be
 removed from the hole.
