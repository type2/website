My reason for asking was because I went to an alignment shop and they 
said that they can also adjust that screw.  I just put a "new" used 
steering box on there that seems pretty good, but I didn't want to break 
it with a poor adjustment.  They have worked on a bunch of VW buses, so 
I'm not horribly worried, just slightly worried ;)

The bus tends to wander a bit, but that could be either the toe-in or 
because I'm oversteering because of tight linkages.  I just had pretty 
much every front-end ball-joint replaced so it's kinda tight.  Granted, 
I put a good 4000 miles on it so it's loosened up since the front-end 
work, but I just wanted to take the right course of action.  I 
definitely do not want to ruin that steering box because it seemed like 
it was really good when I put it in there and they're not easy to come by!

Thanks,
Mike
