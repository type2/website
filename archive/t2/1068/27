Subject: RE: [T2] Sudden loss of power

The instant I opened your reply I knew there was one HUGE mistake I made and that is the color of the smoke! If the engine is running rich, it puts out black smoke. Your smoke was likely blue smoke! You already know the cause of blue smoke: a worn-out engine (basically!) 

Oil leaking at all those places does not mean an engine is shot, of course. My introduction into VW buses included having a "reputable" mechanic overhaul my 1st engine. I went through his recommended break-in procedures and brought it back in for the check-ups, but then I took a 1000 mile trip and I gotta tell you, there was oil leaking from every place oil could possibly get to! Apparently there was no "torquing sequence" adhered to while assembling the engine (among other shortcomings from having his young teen sons do the work - apparently unsupervised!) What resulted was that everywhere things settle in after a few heating / cooling cycles, I had major leaks. Once I pulled it apart enough to re-tighten everything, I got a lot of mileage out of that engine.

Push rod tube seals were like every spring when I drove the bus a lot! Never had a rear main seal go, but had some oil pump and front seal probs!

Yes, your engine may well be shot, but from the description, I wouldn't make a decision before doing a series of compression tests - cold, hot and with oil. From the symptoms (again assuming black smoke, as I did originally - shame on me!) the engine could be in excellent condition and just need a little tweaking. Easy for me to say, sitting here at my computer!
