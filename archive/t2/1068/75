Subject: question about steering box adjustment on a 78

Has anyone ever messed with the adjustment screw on the steering box on 
a late bay?  I was curious if it's possible to do any adjustment of the 
box while it's still on the car, or if you have to pull it off and use a 
torque gauge like the bentley recommends.

Thanks!
Mike
