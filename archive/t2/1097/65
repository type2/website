Subject: Re: [T2] '74 Westy Voltage regulator question

A bit of a correction here.

72-79 Buses all had alternators (both 55A and the 77-79 Optional 70A) with
an external regulator mounted on the right side bulkhead.  Alternators with
an Internal Voltage Regulator was not introduced until the 1980 Vanagon and
they are NOT interchangeable AFAIK.

The voltage regulator is the same from 72-79 and the latest
production "smaller" sized regulator Bosch provides will replace the
original "larger" regulator - same plug-in, no modifications needed.

I know this because I make the replacement harness for them.
