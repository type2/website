I too am in the process of doing this.  I've already installed the 
Xantrex Freedom HF converter / inverter.  The fridge is next.  Options 
are ...

truck fridge
Engel
Domestic
vitrifrigo

If you want info on any of these go over to thesamba and search the 
vanagon forums.  Those guys have some sweet setups.  You should look 
into a 2 way or even 3 way fridge setup adding an option to run it off 
propane.
