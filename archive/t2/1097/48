Subject: Re: [T2] Rear brake stuck

Hey Rob,

You don't say where you are, but tell me it's not freezing in your garage.
When I first owned my bus, I made the mistake (twice!) of driving in the
rain/slush and then parking with the parking brake on.  The water froze
overnight, and I couldn't release the parking brake.  Had to get some heat on
the wheel and brake line until it released.  But garages usually don't freeze,
do they.

Do we know it's the brake and not the tranny or something jammed in there?
And how do you know it's just the right that's stuck and not the left too?

I think I'd try to winch it out of the garage enough that you could get to
that wheel.  Then you can do the banging and such to release whatever it
stuck.  Interesting symptoms.  Good luck!

Best,
Jerry
