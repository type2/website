Subject: Re: [T2] FMBC SITE DOWN?

I've been having problems with the site for a while.  I was hopeing to  
post about another highway clean up. 
I admit I missed a lot of  bus camp outs but  I did do a great  amount of 
camping this last year.
 
Someone please tell Snoopy I think I have something cool for him.
