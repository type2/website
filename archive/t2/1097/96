Greetings list!
Anyone have a good resource for what size jets I might want to put in this
carb? it is currently on a 1600SP upright. We would sure like to go back to
stock, but the girl that owns this doesn't have the money to buy a new carb
and intake at the moment, so I am trying to just kluge her engine to last till
she can have it all done proper. I found a good article in the archives, and
some other resources that give sizes for more high performance applications,
but we are looking to actually downtune things a bit. her carb currently dumps
so much fuel at idle that I was sitting in the exhaust stream while fiddling
with some things and came out smelling more like gas then spent exhaust. High
performance isnt an issue for her since she only commutes about 4 miles a day
round trip.
thanks,
Gerry
