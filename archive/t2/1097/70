Subject: Re: [T2] '74 Westy Voltage regulator question

The original poster (Squid) is working on a STOCK setup, alternator is from
a 74 Westy, but I'm fairly sure he's gonna put it in a later 70s Bus which
still used the same Alternator as was standard thru 79.  He's buying an
Alternator Harness from me (I make them) to possibly repair or replace a
"butcher job" that he's encountered so he can have everything stock again.

Like you, for the past 40+ years I've encountered some real weird and
strange NON STOCK setups on all kinds of Buses.  Like my late father once
said: "If you have a big enough hammer, a hacksaw and a torch, you can
shoe-horn anything into the back of a Bus"  Truer words have never been
spoken.
