Subject: Re: [T2] Some thoughts on packing an early Bay Westy

Watch out with the heavy items up there. These may have a tendency to
come flying down on hard stops. You don't want a shovel or a hammer
flying down at you your passenger from behind. Especially considering
that those early bay front seats didn't have headrests.

When exploring in my '71 I found this to be the best place to store
USGS topo maps - they fit up there without the need for rolling or
folding, and its a nice, dry, safe, out of the way spot. My '75
doesn't have that space and I often miss it, but the double bed
upstairs is a reasonable trade off. Now I keep my maps stored upstairs
in the bed when I'm not using them.
