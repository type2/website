Subject: New Item - Air Cooled Vanagon Owners Rejoice!

Just in time for Christmas/Channuka/Kwanza, etc.

Air Intake Sleeve from the Air Flow Meter to the Throttle Body, 071-129-967
is now in stock ready to ship from Airhead Parts:

Time to replace that duct-taped, liquid-rubber repaired piece to eliminate
the vacuum leaks or just so you can actually drive yours again.  Made of
Viton to resist the engine room heat, a bit softer and more flexible than
the original.  A VWG/Airhead Reproduction.
