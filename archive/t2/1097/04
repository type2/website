I've had my windshield treated inside and out with something called 
"Aquapel" it is not cheap but lasts 2-3 years and works very well. it is 
generallly used on commercial vehicles (I get mine thru a bus company, the 
big transit type buses)  rarely even need to turn on the wipers as the 
rain and mousture just roll off and doesn't even form as haze or fog.
