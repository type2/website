Graphite grease must be what we call anti-seize compound up here in the 
North. I tend toward using it. I just wanted to highlight the advantage of 
lubricating the threads.

However, be careful on torque. Lubricated threads will tighten up to a 
higher level and you won't know it. Most torque specs are on dry threads.
