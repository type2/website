The Aquapel website says not to use below 30*. I wonder if it means
not to apply it below 30* or after application.

I need to send them an email...

(those of us without an auxiliary heater that is!) i looked around for
Aquapel. I agree its pretty expensive, but if it works for three months
without reapplication, I'm still winning the battle. I just picked up some
Aquapel on eBay for about $15 shipped.
