Hi Folks
            I don't post often but enjoy reading the current subjects. I'm 
surprised no one has mentioned the 1957 Type 2 just rescued from the depths 
of a fjord with a planned restoration ahead. Its featured in the December 
issue of Practical Classics mag on page six. Quite an amazing feat just to 
retrive the vehicle that has been in the water since 1974. Merry Christmas 
to everyone, my bus is stored in the barn for the winter here on Prince 
Edward Island, some photos on my blog.
                              Cheers  Ben.
