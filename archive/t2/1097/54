Subject: 73 bus, high/low beam switch

The other day I turned on my high beams and they got stuck on. I could hear
the relay working when using the switch, but they wouldn't turn off high beam.
I went ahead and replaced the relay, and now only the high beams work, but
when I switch to low beam the light just turn off. This really has me stumped.
Not sure where to go now.
Thanks
Steven
