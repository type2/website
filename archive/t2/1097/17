Dreike,Sounds to me like you don't get onto the samba web site very often. There'sbeen an extensive thread in the"split bus" forum about this. The guy from Norway, Morten Lund, has made alot of headwayon the bus and posted coments and many photo's. He intends to work throughthe winter and begin postingto the samba in the spring on his progress. A very interesting recovery andstory. Go to,http://www.thesamba.com/VW/forum/viewtopic.php?t=372048to see the rest of the story.Mike Turner
