Subject: Re: [T2] '74 Westy Voltage regulator question

I'm confused.  IF you have a "stock" '74, the OE setup
is an external regulator with the regulator mounted on the
right front (passenger side) bulkhead (fuel tank cover).
IF you want to put in the later (internal regulator) alternator,
just get the wiring harness with/for the later style* and bolt it
in.  The connection will just be a blue wire (exciter wire to battery light)
and the charging wire(s) that can go directly to the battery positive
terminal.
*NOTE:  I am talking about a late (78-79) BUS........ NOT Vanagon.
