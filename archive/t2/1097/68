Subject: Re: [T2] '74 Westy Voltage regulator question

This is still confusing because when someone says 
"ALL", there are always some exceptions.  When I first bought
my '79 Cal Bus (smashed in front very hard, now my 
parts donor) it had a bunch of weird stuff, like an
internal regulated (solid back, Rabbit style connector)
Alternator and NO REGULATOR on the bulkhead.  It also 
had the electronic ignition (factory) but it didn't still 
work, which is why the PO sold it (couldn't make it run).
In addition it had the Cal only exhaust including the Cat.

SO..... the confusing part is..... what alternator/regulator
is the original poster trying to put in?

I think it best to get as much information up front as possible to answer

technical questions.  There are a number of different parts that "can"
be used, but some will need some adaption.
