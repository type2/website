Fair enough. The best bet for you is a compressor style fridge as they use
much less electricity than absorption fridges (2.5 A compared with 7 A or more
when on 12V). When camping I turn the gas fridge off before going to bed b/c I
don't like the idea of the flame going, and everything stays cold overnight.

I'm NOT going propane because I don't want to cut a hole in the side of my
