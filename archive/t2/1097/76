Subject: Re-Awoke my 77 Westy today from hibernation :-}

My poor girl Rusty has been sleeping since July when I put the aftermarket
headers on her to replace the heater boxes etc. SO much simpler. In any case,
I gave her a two day charge/recondition with my spiffy new intelligent
charger. After that, I got in, gave her a ten second crank and she coughed to
life with a great cloud of blue. She sat there hacking a bit, then cleared her
throat when I revved her to 2K and the alternator kicked in with 14 volts. She
settled down to a nice idle, and I let her warm up for 10 minutes. Brought a
tear to my eye, she's so faithful. "sniff".
Thought I'd share.
