congratulations.

but, may I suggest that if you did not get the lug nuts off that you take 
them off and then put them back, if they are that tight it is likely you 
would not be able to get them off on the side of the road at night in the 
rain and out of cell range, which is when the tire will decide to go 
flat...and want that spare tire put on
