My Norcold chest fridge only draws 3.5 amps on 12V and it will freeze beers in 100 degree weather.  There is also a problem with the propane fridges - they do not work very well if you are even a few degrees off of level.  The compressor style electric fridges like the Norcold will work no matter what angle you are parked on.  Not saying the electric fridges are superior for everyone but sometimes they are the best solution.
