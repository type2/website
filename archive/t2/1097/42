Subject: Rear brake stuck

Hi,
After driving a day in the rain, and parking in the garage for a week,
I am unable to back out my 72 Bus.  It appears that the right rear
wheel will not move.  It feels like the brake is stuck.  Pedals seem
to feel fine and the e-brake appears to work fine as well.  It is in a
tight space with access only from the rear, no room on the sides and
about 2 feet in the front.  Any ideas?
thanks,
Rob Garretson b.
