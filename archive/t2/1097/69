Subject: I may get roasted for this!

At a time of "flying deer",  Ho Hos, and dark starry nights.,.
SomeVW people were sitting around a fire,
On a star filled moonless nite
All were filled with "cheer".
And everything seemed light.

Suddenly, a bright light broke above,
Like powerful Halogens, or other white lights
And since they were camped on a flat plain,
They were puzzled by the sight

They stoocked the fire to a higher burn,
Yet the Light was still as bright,
And now they 'closed' to the fire
Watching the approaching light

Then suddenly, it seemed to them,
they heard low, 'snuffling' sounds
And evrything around them
Seemed to rebound
With noises of animal hoves
And Jingling of Bells.

Suddenly a 'splitty' appeared overhead'
led by a deer with a red nose, and others who he led
Followed by a "fat" man in red VW overalls,
esconsed in the buses walls,
And as he passed over head he said
Save the "splittys, type 2s, maybe type3s, and others
And next year we will again meet at this time as brothers!
