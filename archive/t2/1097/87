venting of heat. The Puck's propane tank is inside, in a cabinet, with a

Propane is definitely the best solution if AC is not available. On the old
fridges like mine, the 12v DC was only to keep a cold fridge sort of cold
until you could use AC or propane. Several new model 3 way fridges I have seen
have the same power draw for both AC and DC which implies they will actually
work on DC! Mind you the power draw is still horrendous on DC (~7 Amps) but
easily achievable with solar power.
