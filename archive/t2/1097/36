That story sort of reminds me of Bill Bo0wman and Tom Niedernhoffer's  
"flood bus" that they found after the floods of the Mississippi  
receeded a bunch of years back.  They cleaned it up, resored it and  
then brought it to the BBTA event back in 98 I believe it was.

I remember on the way to the campground Tom was getting on the  
interstate, felt the bus sort of yank a bit and out of the corner of  
his eye saw the right rear tire and wheel pass him heading into the  
woods beside the highway.  He slowed the bus and gently pulled it off  
the road and it never even drug the ground.  He said the reason it  
happened was that he and Bill had painted the lug bolts along with the  
hubs.  Hmmmm....lesson learned I would say.
