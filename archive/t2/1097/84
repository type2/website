	I have this same problem with one rear wheel of the Meteor, 
and am therefore very interested.
	If the brake shoes have become stuck to the drum, 'pulling it 
all apart' is not trivial, is it?  How to get the drum off the brake??
	BTW I suspect it was before 'loosening of the nuts' was 
actually achieved that the 'the trick' was done: jumping on the 
wrench while the nut was still stuck achieved enough leverage to 
impart enough rotary force to unstick the drum from the shoe(s), no?
	In my corresponding jam I've played a pretty good LPG torch 
onto the drum to no effect.  I must now go and try jumping on a 
wrench  -  with extra length added in the form of a pipe overlapping 
the outer part of the 'wrench'  ...
