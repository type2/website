After watching the responses to the anti-fog problems every type 2 owner has (those of us without an auxiliary heater that is!) i looked around for Aquapel. I agree its pretty expensive, but if it works for three months without reapplication, I'm still winning the battle. I just picked up some Aquapel on eBay for about $15 shipped.
