Subject: The email archives are back (sort of)

Thanks to dradom for giving me a dose of motivation recently.  Because  
of it, the entire mail archive is now searchable.  Its not pretty yet,  
but the entire content of all the messages is now searchable, not just  
the subject.  I wouldn't waste any time messing with the date options  
etc.  Just put your search query in the box and hit enter.  Boolean  
queries are allowed and there is a 100 character limit at the moment.

Again, this is fresh out of the box.  We'll get it tweaked more in the  
near future, and get vintagebus indexed as well.  For now though, if  
your celebrating a holiday that involves gift giving, consider this  
email wrapped up with a bow on top.

Happy Holidays,

Troy Wical and family

oh yeah, the url to play with the search engine...
