 I tell my passengers not to breath too heavily until the heat comes up so
they won't fog up the windshield in the bug. I also ride with a towel
(defroster) on my lap.
Good luck draining the oil. What weight will you use now?

Heh.  I think the 20w50 in my bus' crankcase was frozen last week when it
was -16*F...been waiting for a semi-warm day to get that drained out. ;)
