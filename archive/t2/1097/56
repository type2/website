Subject: EMPI/CB Oil Sumps With Filters

Are there any issues with using EMPI or CB Performance sump extensions with 
oil filters on Type 1 engines (other than impact risk)?
  - EMPI #17-2871
  - CB #1756 or 1738

They state that these are "micron" filters, but no mention of the filter's 
actual micron rating. Any information on this?

Have emailed EMPI about this.

Thanks,
Mike
