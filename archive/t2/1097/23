Subject: latest project - xantrex freedom HF install in my '78 Westy

Over the last few days I installed my new Xantrex Freedom HF 
converter/inverter.  I used the existing westy electrical input on the 
outside of the bus for the AC in, and the existing westy internal outlet 
for the AC out.  The xantrex shuts off the inverter when AC shore power 
is connected and powers everything from shore power while also charging 
both of the batteries.  When there is no AC shore the 1000 watt inverter 
function kicks in.  This was mostly done to power my Espar during winter 
campouts without having to charge via the alternator.  Next I plan on 
adding a 2 way fridge / freezer and then solar power.  The goal is to be 
sustainable for many days on or off grid without having to start the bus 
to charge.

Here's the pics...
