Subject: Anti-Fog Solutions

It's cold and wet in the UK.
Ice is forming on all the windows.

I have no problem scraping that off.
The real problem is the interior surface of the windows and windscreen/windshield constantly fogging over.
This is regardless of me wiping them off.

I know I need to sort out the stock heating system first, but I was wondering what other, passive solutions folks have tried.

I remember using anti-fog inserts for helmets when I had my motorcycle.
Has anyone found a similar, larger solution for vehicle windows?
Has anyone had any success with anti-fog sprays such as Rain-X?

I also did a google search for heated Vw windscreens and windows, but couldn't find a vendor.
Does anyone have links for that as well?



Thanks,

Josh
