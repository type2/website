I take that as "Do not apply below 30*", otherwise it would seem a fools errand to warn someone about using it (i.e. just sitting there and letting it do its job :after: it was applied to the glass) below the prescribed temperature. Otherwise you would have to remove it from the windows if it fell below 30*, or tell the thin film on your windshield, "Here now, stop that" in of course a firm tone....who knows though, with these days of companies covering their assets and legal departments writing instruction manuals. I'd be interested in any clarification that the company provided as well.
