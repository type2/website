The Espars that are used in the boats up here in AK need a lot of extra
maintenance due to using diesel.  This is to a point where many folks rip them
out and go to Dickensen diesel heaters which run reliably on diesel and use no
electricity.They, Espars, do work well when properly maintained, and can be
fitted into odd spaces wiht teh heat ducted to where it is needed.  However,
they need non-trivial amounts of electrical power to run and greatly prefer
kerosene.  Typical installations here on yachts and small boats need two
annual servicing events.  Depending upon the fuel quality, owner/operator
preventative maintenance, and use hours, that can be a minor or major tear
down.  Kerosene is not nearly as widely available around the coastal villages
as diesel so most run on diesel.  Many of the oil fuel heaters, Toyotomi,
Monitor
 etc, seem to have recommendations from the manufacturers to use
kerosene. Here are some choices and info pages. Some of which may be of
interest, some i.e. the soapstone stove ;), less so, and some are dead links.
