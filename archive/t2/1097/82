Subject: brakes stuck

Hi, here is the story of the stuck 72 bus in my garage.  Many of you
asked to hear about the final results, so here goes.

Here is the original posting;

Hi,
After driving a day in the rain, and parking in the garage for a week,
I am unable to back out my 72 Bus.  It appears that the right rear
wheel will not move.  It feels like the brake is stuck.  Pedals seem
to feel fine and the e-brake appears to work fine as well.  It is in a
tight space with access only from the rear, no room on the sides and
about 2 feet in the front.  Any ideas?

Did the following today;

So I have been trying to rock it free, and use the transmission to
free the brake including burning rubber on the wheel that was turning
all with no luck.  A friend called right after the first posting and
offered a rolling jack.  He came over today and we tried again to get
the bus out of the garage with no luck.  So, we jacked it up, put a
wheel dolly under each of the rear wheels and rolled it out.  Tried
again to force the brake free and no luck.  Decided to jack it up
again and removed the wheel.  The lugs nuts were very tight and when I
stood on the wrench to help loosen with my weight, we heard a pop and
the wheel moved!  It was amazing, that we did not even get the wheel
off, just the loosening of the nuts did the trick.  So we all went for
a drive and everything is running fine now.

Thanks to all who offered suggestions and assistance.  Now I can go
back on the after Christmas diet :=)
