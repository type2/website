Subject: Amazing Type 2 Single Cab seen in Oak Park Sacramento

In the last month or so, I've seen a late 50's Splitty Single Cab 
driving around Sacramento.  Paint is faded red, it has a roof-mount spot 
light and faded German fire department logos on the doors. Full canvas 
frame cover with cargo rack and tire carrier on top.  Read LED bulbs and 
a new engine and wheels show it as a work in progress.  Likely a former 
ambulance or fire equipment truck.

Anybody on these lists own this?
