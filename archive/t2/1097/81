I disagree with this statement as it depends on the type of fridge you have.

If you are looking for a fridge that can run on propane, propane is probably
the most efficient way to run it (including in 3-way systems).  These fridges
are ammonia-based and use heat for the refridgeration cycle.

However, if you are looking for a fridge that you will be running primarily 
on electricity (i.e. solar), you are probably best off going for a DC-only 
(12v or 24v) fridge, not a 2-way (AC/DC) or 3-way (AC/DC/propane).  These 
fridges use a carnot refrigeration cycle by compressing and expanding gasses.  

The vitrifigio or engel fridges get rave reviews for their very efficient 
compressors.  

I'm not sure about "overall thermal efficiency" of either system, or the 
cost of running either system, it would depend on your set-up and where
you're getting your power (free at a campground or via an expensive solar
panel).

Cheers,
   Tom
