Subject: Need help wiring my 69 Bus Instrument Cluster

I have a 69 Bus with the 10 Fuse Panel.   Couple questions concerning  
how
the Instrument Cluster is wired.

If you open the JPG file - you will see the back side of the cluster.   
My
question is what goes on the 6 full size spade connectors (I'm showing  
them
as Black connectors on the back of the Gage Cluster.  2 near the top  
of the
gage marked + and G (in the area of the Fuel Gage, 2 at the bottom of  
the
gage which seem to be part of the metal casing (possibly grounds) and  
then
one on each side of the cluster (one in the Turn Signal/Generator light
area, and the other in the Turn Signal/Oil Pressure light area.  What
connects to all of these.

I have the Brown wire coming from the Fuel Sending Unit with a large  
clip -
so I assume it has to go to one of those large clips above the gage
(probably the +)?
I also have a Black lead from fuse  2 that goes to where exactly on  
the back
of the gage.

Is there a more simplified diagram than what is in the Bentley Guide -
difficult at best to understand (only in this area)

So, bottom line is what connects to those 6 black connectors on the  
back -
shown on my drawing?

One more question if I may - the Wiper Motor has a ground strap with a
series of 5 more connecters on it - any idea what all this goes to?

Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks
Joe Cooper
