Great point Chris, I go one further.  I pretty much antiseize all lug
nuts/bolts on all my vehicles, have for more than 15 years.  Reasonalbe thin
coat and properly torqued I've never had one loosen.  The frustration it can
save is amazing.  I also put a very thin coat on the hub to rotor joint and
hold down screw on rotors on FWD cars and drum to hub joint on drums, and I'm
talking micro thin that can't get onto shoes or linings here folks.  On alloy
wheels a layer between the wheel and drum/rotor, and the hub if it is
concentrically centered on on the hub with a tight fit is also good.  I've
worried about loosening, but never had it happen and in WV in the "salt belt"
the frustration these have saved is worth its weight in gold.  I'm still using
the same jar of (presumeably lead based) antizeize I got at NAPA 15 years ago
today, I like it better than the "copper" ones but YMMV.  Good for all kinds
of things of course, these are just a few
 points.
 
On the original topic, no reason to not use your e-brake, and I've had shoes
flash rust to even new drums just the same.  I'm amazed that presumeably 3-400
ft/lb on a breaker bar (average weight jumping a foot and a half out, though
with impact admittedly) would free a drum that full on rocking the bus in gear
wouldn't, but if ti worked, it worked.  I too would probably pull all apart
for a look, and have a carefull attention to the adjusters and brake
adjustment (another good place for antiseize) but it is all likely OK and will
probably end up dumb bad luck.

And put a drop of trans oil on the lug nut threads too. Prevent them from
rusting tight.
