I can only tell you how my Puck is set up. Propane is supposedly the most
efficent. 12v the least. Propane definately needs venting of gasses. All need
venting of heat. The Puck's propane tank is inside, in a cabinet, with a
perforated floor.

Whatever model you get, try for one with a thermostat. The Coleman type
chillers are based on ambient temps and can feeze foodstuffs.
