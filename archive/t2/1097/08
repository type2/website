Subject: Some thoughts on packing an early Bay Westy

I am getting ready for an extended trip in a '70 Westy and discovering how 
useful is the space between the rear roof and the inner ceiling for storing 
all sorts of things like spare parts, seldom used clothes and tools.  A real 
PITA to get to once they are in there, to be sure, but a gold mine of extra 
space for carrying seldom needed but occasionally useful items.

I don't know if later Bays have this space.

Cheers,

John
