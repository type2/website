This is very simple.

1. The B+ threaded post on the top of the Alternator is connected to the
Positive side of the battery.  Use at least a 12 gauge wire for this so it
can handle the charging amperage.

2.  The male push-on terminal is connected to the wire that transmits the
signal to the Generator Warning Light on your dash.

3.  Be sure the Alternator case has a ground wire attached to a screw that
should be visible on the outside case of the Alternator to Chassis Ground,
or even better to the Negative side of the battery.

And that's it.
