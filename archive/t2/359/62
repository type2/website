Subject: Re: [T2] ADMIN Re: [T2] Air Cooled Camping Shirts

Also just a pre-release note- I'm working on a camper/Westy shirt     
which will be done next time I do shirts...for those of you who have  
come to know and love my spam-free list & other bus shirts...         
Still have a few of the new Search & Rescue shirts left over from     
EveryBus also...check out TeamSpatula.com t-shirt page, drop me a line
if interested...                                                      
  For extra bus content, my bus loves me enough to wait until I'm     
driving her home the inspection station (she passed) before the brake 
lights shorted out somewhere...fuses blowing, no signals until I      
unplugged the brake wire. Thank goodness it's not in the              
flasher/signal circuit...fingers crossed that it's the switch gone    
bad...
