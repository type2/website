It's a truly delightful state in so many ways, environmentally diverse and
gifted, but politically hostile and repressive, in my opinion. It is not a
good state for industry, business owners, car buffs, inventors, animal
owners, property owners, and just anyone who wants to be free to live
without harrassment and excessive taxation. And this is why I'm working in
the direction of getting out. Having lived here all of my considerable
lifespan, I really see the changes, and they are sinister, in my opinion.
California is not entirely unique, as there is an agenda that's being pushed
everywhere at once, but the same can and will happen in other states, SOON,
unless EXTREME vigilance is practiced by the citizens.
I'd never want to go to a place that salts the roads or gets too much ice,
though. Too hard on the VWs! I'm thinking of somewhere east of the
Continental Divide and west of the Missouri River. Any suggestions?
