Exactly.

What Jamie wants to do is to achieve 60-65 MPH where the rear wheels 
hit the ground with the amount of airflow through the engine and number 
of RPMs that a stock engine would pull at 55-60 MPH. His new 1.9L T1 
engine makes gobs of torque -- he pulled up next to me when I was going 
up a hill on the way to EveryBus with my foot to the floor, then said 
"Watch this" and suddenly his bus ran off like I was standing still. 
Now I know I was overloaded with the trailer behind but he had a large 
and heavily loaded roofrack up top which didn't do a thing for his 
aerodynamics.

As Andy said, you don't have to use a freeway flyer tranny if you can 
run taller tires.

If Jamie does run taller tires, he will probably want to lower the rear 
suspension a bit to compensate. Every modification comes with a 
trade-off, doesn't it. Even if your canoe up top reduces your MPG, I 
can't imagine it does much for you're bus's cornering characteristics.

Happy trails,
