Subject: Re: [T2] Wiring HELP!

I have never seen a 1968 or 1969 bus, and I have had both and torn 
into others, that matched the wiring diagram. The Bentley wiring 
diagram shows a nine pin E-flasher similar to the 67 set up but I 
have yet to see one. All the e-flashers connections are built into 
the switch and run through the 4 prong flasher relay. Additionally, 
the brake lights are run through the e-flasher switch for reasons 
that become obvious when you really get into it. Try and follow the 
circuit numbers on the diagram and  look for the matching numbers on 
switches and bulb holders on your bus.


Good luck
Chris
