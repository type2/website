Okay.  Don't forget to check them with every oil change.

Not sure I understand what you mean by "not too much work".  Engine building is an art form and the "perfect motor" will take some research, and lots of money and time.  Yes increasing displacement with larger bore or stroke will give you more power, but it's not that simple.  Despite what the guy at Fast Auto told you, the camshaft is critical.

If you have a builder you trust, I'd leave this job to them.  On the other hand if you are proficient with a die grinder and have lots of time, you could do it yourself.

elgincams.com and webcamshafts.com are good places to start.  Tell them what you want and use what they recommend, not what the guy at Fast Auto tells you.
