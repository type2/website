Discount Tire and Tire Rack sell the same wheel at a fraction of the cost 
of Go Westy.

OEM versus fits Mercedes. Check the archives. I've commented before.

Do not tell the Tire Rack or Discount Tire what you intend on doing with 
the wheel. They would not discuss the VW application of these wheels. 
Basically you are making them liable for your actions if they knowingly 
sell you a wheel not for the intended application. It maybe that they think 
it is unsafe, maybe that they don't want additional customer service costs 
(returns) when it doesn't just bolt right on (I think you have to enlarge 
the center hole). Again this is all explained at length in the Type2 archives.

The wheel is about $35 each and prob twice that much from GoWesty. May or 
may not have enough weight capacity. Check for yourself.

I do know the big Mercedes weight the same or more than our busses and the 
cargo capacity is certainly NOT going to be any lower.

Doesn't mean the aftermarket replacements are as strong as the OEM versions 
though.

FWIW I plan to buy a set when i am $$$ ahead but right now I have new 14" 
tires and newly powdercoated 14" rims so I am not in a rush to upgrade on 
new tires. Prob will buy a set and put them back for later.
