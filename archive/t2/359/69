Subject: Re: [T2] window scraper replacement

I got mine from Bus Depot, very reasonable on the
price and they fit excellently. Incidentally, I have
an extra driver-side INSIDE scraper, so if you're
doing one part and want the other... lemme know.  =)

The installation is a PITA. Requires that you take
apart the door. Bentley manual and a lot of patience. 

Best of luck,
