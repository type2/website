Well, engines that leave Jake Raby's shop may or may not be
the final word in aircooled technology, but VW felt good
enough to go to them.

Correct in that they should still be adjusted, and that tight valves and other valve train symptoms can show you things by inspection. But sorry, there's lot's of folks who do not do valve adjustments every 3000 miles, and their engines would benefit from hydraulic valves.

But as we learn on this list almost daily, rarely is anything automotive an absolute. Everything has tradeoffs and people have 
different wants and needs.

I wonder if Jake asks his customers what they want or tells them...

Hydro valves MUST still be adjusted, just not every 3K. Valve adjustments can be the best indicators before a disaster.
