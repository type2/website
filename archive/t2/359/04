A good improvement for not much outlay is balancing.  You can get the crank
dynamically balanced along with the flywheel, clutch and fan as a unit.  You
can also balance the rods end for end and match the piston weights.  Then
there is volumetric balancing...

Solid lifters are probably 'better' as long as you keep them adjusted.
Hydraulics are low maintenance but give you increased wear on startup.

You shouldn't need to line bore a type 4 case.
