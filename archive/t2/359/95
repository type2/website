With all due respect that is a valve spring vs. rpm issue, not a hydraulic lifter issue.

Agreed, but what is "lower rpms"?  If hydraulics are only good to 6,000rpm vs. 7,000 for solids, does that mean you should use solids for the motor you're building with a 2000-5000rpm powerband?  Not in my world.  I've had VW solid and hydraulic lifters on the workbench side by side and while I will admit I didn't put them on a scale, the difference was not that great.  I've seen 5400rpm (once) with my hydraulic 2-liter and no valvetrain abnormalities were apparent.  Even with stock springs.

>I'd stay with hydraulics for the regular driver engines and consider solids for a major rpm machine.

Again I agree with you.  Maybe my only point of contention on this issue is the definition of "major rpm".  Before hydraulics would become a problem, my opinion is that you would have to have a very wild engine that would be unsuited to driving on the street.  I feel there are two groups of people that should be running solid lifters.  The first is professional drag racers and the second is '77 and older bus owners that want to keep their engines stock.  I don't fall into either group.
