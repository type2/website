So you mean that it is not possible to have a cam custom ground for hydraulic lifters with any lift/duration you want?  I haven't verified this, but it's hard to believe.  I can get wild cams for my hydraulic-lifter Mustang with as much as.580 lift and 300 duration.  I don't see why they couldn't be made for a type4 also.  Elgin cams says on their web page that they will grind any profile you want.

But off-the-shelf cams are available - the WebCam 91 for example.  If you need more cam than that you probably aren't using your bus for traveling/camping anyway.

There is NO INHERENT PERFORMANCE LIMITATION with hydraulic lifters.  At least not until you get into seriously hot cams for 8,000rpm motors.  Hydraulic lifters do not equal low performance.
