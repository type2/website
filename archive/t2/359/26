The original poster wanted to build an engine with more power than the stock
one, so I think any replies should take that into consideration.

If you opt for hydro lifters you will have a hard time building a hotter
motor. It all comes down to the cam. There are precious few options in a
performance camshaft for hydraulic lifters, while there are many choices for
solids. You want lots of lift? Go for it. You want a split duration cam? You
can have it. With hydro lifters, you can have a stock cam, and maybe one
mild performance grind.

So if you want more performance, use solid lifters matched to a performance
solid lift camshaft. Any rebuild needs a new cam and lifters, so a mild
performance cam is pretty much a free upgrade.

If you want less work, go for hydraulic lifters, but don't expect the motor
to outperform the stock one.

Balancing the motor to a high standard, including chamber volume, will help
a lot, regardless of hydro or solid. And using only top line parts will make
a difference as well.

Oh, and one more thing, the original post mentioned increasing the bore to
96mm, this is not recommended if you are using cast iron cylinders. The
reason is because a bus motor is already taxed in terms of cooling, and 96mm
bore size will make it even more difficult to keep the motor cool. You are
better off the increase the stroke, which will move the power band lower as
well as increasing displacement. Increasing the stroke is not for the feint
of heart, there are clearancing issues to deal with, non-stock rods and of
course a new crank. But I have heard that the results can be very good for a
bus motor.
