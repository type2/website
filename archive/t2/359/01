Subject: rebuild 2.0l

We are thinking about rebuilding our 2.0l, what can be done to make it 
better, cam, heads, using 96mm pistons. We have dual dellorto 36mm which we 
are looking to have rebuilt anyone know who does these. Should we use solid 
or hydro lifters. Is there anyone in the Buffalo area that has done one or 
can help. Do we need to line bore.

thanks in advance
