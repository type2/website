Everyone who he spammed should call numerous times and hang up when he
answers. You get charged Per CALL with an 800 number (anywhere from 10 cents
to 50 cents a call), run up his phone bill and he will regret ever spamming
the list

As another list admin, I'd like to make that stronger.  DO NOT patronize
any spammer!  The fact that he harvested the web site is particularly
nasty.  Here are people who have volunteered to help others and their
reward is spam.  That stinks.

He does have a toll-free number if you wish to express your opinion about
spammers and harvesters:  800.248.8535
