Subject: pull switch under drivers seat?

while cleaning up the surface rust on the inside of my 72 hi top westy
conversion last night i had the drivers seat out and noticed a pull switch
with a missing knob under the drivers seat on the right side of the
pedestal.  it pulls in and out and is pulling on something else under the
pedestal but what the heck is it supposed to operate?
