Subject: Emergency Starting 

 I have an RV with an "EMERGENCY START"   feature which lets me pull the
coach battery into the starting circuit if the main engine battery is
too low to crank the engine.

During the Spring Snow in Philly last week, my battery on my 75 Westy
gave me trouble. I tried to jump the battery directly from the coach
battery (I have the aux battery hookup from the PO).

It did not work. I think I have a loose cable and I seldom use and check
the aux batt. A mistake I suspect.

So, anybody savvy enough to diagram how this would work? I think we need
to isolate the charging circuit from the main battery when we add the
aux battery into the starting circuit, but I am not sure.

Any advice would be appreciated.
