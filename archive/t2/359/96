Wasn't this message originally posted by a list member (Russ?), not
delivered directly to the type2.com list by the vendor?  And even if it was
delivered directly to the list, could we really consider it to be "spam"?  I
tend to think of spam as unwanted mail from porn sites, sites promising to
increase the size of my manhood or the occasional get rich quick scheme.  It
is in no way directed toward me personally, or to any of my interests.

This mail appears to have originated from a guy who makes custom tie-dyes
for a living and is also into VW's.  I think maybe we are being a bit quick
to crucify someone for trying to promote his wares and share his hobbies
with other people who may share similar interests.  I think his products
look pretty cool personally and might even consider ordering one of the
Vanagon Westy / Steal Your Face shirts from him when I have some throwaway
money available.

I hate spam (no offense to Hormel intended) as much as the next guy, but I
am not about to chastize someone for trying to sell me stuff that interests
me regardless of how he obtained my email address...

Of course, that is just my oppinion and I could be wrong.  Your mileage may
vary etc...

						Happy Friday,
