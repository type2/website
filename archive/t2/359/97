Since no one asked my opinion I'll go ahead & put it out there ;)

Since I got my 79 2 years ago I have battled with a very worn out 230k
mile engine, so some of my thoughts come from dealing with this. I
drive it very moderately, but have burned 2 (perhaps 3) valves in this
engine. I attribute it to the worn out lifters, but can't actually say
100% that is the problem. I had one lifter that always bled down and
took a while to pump up. This is the same lifter that was on the #1
exhaust valve and it is this one that burned. Might not have caused
it, but it is suspect. 

A lot of this can most likely be attributed to a very worn out engine.
What bothered me is that during this time of odd valve things I wasn't
able to check my valve clearance. Sure I could count the # of turns
back out, but that sure wasn't a .004" accuracy. On my most recent
rebuild (which is on hold pending my 66 on the road) I chose to go
with solid lifters simply as a indicator for the engine. I don't mind
getting under there & checking the valves so for me the extra work in
maintenance is worth the piece of mind. I took the stance that since
VWs seem to have more valve problems than the other types of problems,
I would set it so I could keep an eye on what is happening with the
valves, instead of using a more refined lifter design.
