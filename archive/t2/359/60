I know which Hondas have hydraulic lifters - the VTEC engines.

FWIW check your Honda valve adjustments. I've heard there is a quiet 
service "suggestion" circulating that says Honda set the adjustment 
interval too long for the later model Hondas and some are burning valves. 
No official recalls yet that I know of.
