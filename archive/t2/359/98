no, it was not sent to the list, it was sent to individuals. this is
precisely what all the fuss is about. it is stictly prohibited in the
list charter. if he is in fact a list member, he should know better.

this person knowingly harvested email addresses, which is just plain
bad netiquette.

i think if this person would have posted to the list _instead_ of
sending to individuals, there would be no fuss at all!

i guess it depends on your definition of spam. to me, it is any unsolicited
email that is in regards of purchase of services or products that i didn't
ask for.
