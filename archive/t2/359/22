and I never said that hydraulics would result in a fiery death, I said it's
more likely that the owner of a hydrualic equipped flat-4 aircooled engine
would have that happen then one with solid lifters (that adjusts their
valves at regular intervals). That's a FAR cry from what you are mis-quoting
me on.

 and you're trying to tell us
 that the MILLION or so Type2's that were produced with hyd. lifters were
 intentionally intended to die a fiery death after an unnaturally short
 service life due to the stock cam causing an overheat condition?!!!!!
