the problem with T-4s is they only have a 1.3:1 rocker ratio, so the lift IS
limited on a hydraulic grind to some extent (what's the rocker ratio on the
ford?). You'll notice with VW hydraulic grinds the available lifts are much
lower then with solids, because they have to be so much milder on the on/off
valve seat events with hydraulic lifters, and then you only have 1.3:1 X at
the valve.
