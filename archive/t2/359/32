Subject: Wiring HELP!

I have downloaded the wiring diagrams from vintagebus.com for the 68-69 bus and 
several close years and it definately doesn't match what I've got. First of all 
the emergency flasher looks like it has too many wires going into it and also 
there are alot of those plastic connectors that don't show up. wires going to 
fuses where theres no more space. If somebody has any hints or can point me to 
a better diagram, which I doubt these are the same as in Bentley just color, 
please clue a me in.
