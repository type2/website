Now you did it... <grin>

Your engine may be working harder than you think. It is spinning slower but 
because the gear ratio is effectively higher it can be working harder.

Shift up from third to fourth too soon and you can see what I mean.

The listers have pointed out that the P185-R14 is too small a diameter. I 
believe the list pointed out 205/75-R14 is closer to the factory diameter.

You don't want to slow the engine too much because the fan is going to turn 
slower and thus cool less. Don't slow that fan down much more than the 
factory wanted it to. With too high a gear ratio (through transmission or 
tire changes) your engine will operate as if it was pushing the bus up a 
hill all the time. The higher the gear, the higher/steeper the imaginary 
hill. Another way to look at it is a strong head wind will cause the engine 
to work harder at highway speeds and sometimes run hot. Increasing the 
tranny ratio or tire diameter is going to be like pushing a head wind.

Small changes would prob be okay. Your bus, your right to change anything. 
Just wanted to give you something to consider.
