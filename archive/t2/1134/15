Have you done a compression test? To answer your question the amount of
fuel to the fuel injection is controlled by the air flow meter it sends
a resistance value to the computer. It sounds like it is your cold start
injector I know you said it was new but it is controlled by the thermo
time switch so it could be on all of the time. Get a small piece of hose
and bypass it.
