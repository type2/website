Subject: I saw a bus

Hi,

I am on PEI and I saw a bus intown that was interesting.

It had true bucket seats with faded tartan on them and a large headrest
supported by metal tubes going into the seat.

The bus had small rear tail lights and a small turnsignal lamp assy.

The engine made a racket (not relevant).

What year/model was I looking at and howcome the nice seats?

Alan
