Subject: ignition key code?

Hey, I just met a fellow VW enthusiast in my neck of the woods. I was trying
to get a dash, and turned out he had an ignition that I was looking for as
well! He had the whole steering column pod unit with the ignition in, and
the wires intact and in good shape. 

 

Unfortunately I do not think the key he gave me is the correct one. I know
it is an R-Profile, but it doesn't turn even when I push what I believe is
the ignition lock.

 

I know that on a splittie you can see the key code for the ignition clearly,
but I can't see it on this one. Is there a key code stamped in here
somewhere? Is there some way to get the key code? 

 

Ultimately I am trying to re-key my entire single cab to the same key-right
now I think I have 4 different keys. Based on my research, list feedback,
and talking to a few locksmiths-I need to start with the ignition-and then
get everything to match this, as it is near impossible, or a fragile
expedition to re-key an ignition. 

 

So do I need to send this thing to a one of the locksmiths on thesamba, or
is there a way to find a code somewhere on this thing?
