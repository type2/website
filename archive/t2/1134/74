Subject: Re: [T2] Smartphone Dyno for tuning?

As a matter of fact, I just got done trying out one, it's called "Car 
Performance" by Saad Alrawaf.  A very nice free app for Droid that 
measures all standard intervals up to 1/4 mile, and top speed.  I have a 
suction cup mount for my Droid 2 to attach it to the windshield so it is 
very convenient and easy to use.  I can't tell you how my bus performed 
yet but if you ask me tomorrow, I will have the numbers.  I'm expecting 
30+ seconds to get to 60mph.  :-/
