I put in an ECU from a 77 manual tranny bus and took it for a test drive. 
hard to tell if it made a change but doesn't "appear" to have the black 
smoke from the exhaust when I started it, seems to run fine so will need 
to drive it a bit to see what the fuel consumption looks like and weather 
or not this helped, if it has an effect then I know that is the problem or 
at least a part of the problem and then can do the fine tuning that I have 
probably messed up over the past couple months.   then will change the 
plugs and oil and maybe run some high test and a couple long high speed 
runs to help clean out the crap that I know has to be all over the tops of 
the pistons and maybe on the valves.
