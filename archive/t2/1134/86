Subject: seats

Hey Alan , you have a bus with buckets.. plaid material, and headrests
right?
did the seats look like them?

No, mine are the ones that only really go to your shoulder blades and
are flat.

The bucket ones had the old tartan on them and it was faded, so I guess
the y are the original seats. If you got into a VW Jetta they would be
the same form factor. They look alot safer.

as for the rear lights,, are you saying there were 4 lights.. 2 on each
side?

At the rear on each side there we on square red lens, one small white
lens. It was not anything like my bus.

Windshield was standard bay. Body was heavily rusted at the rocker
panels.

btw.. what did the windsheild look like?  round like yours,, or 2 flat
windows?

Thanks for asking Jamie.

Alan
