Subject: MPG falling ?????

78 automatic stock except for Crane optical trigger and high output coil.

was getting a stable 17mpg in city driving with heavy auto tranny bus. 
last year I drove to Busses of the corn in Toronto and got decent mileage 
up and back but ever since then MPG has been falling.  engine got rebuilt 
last spring but no change MPG is still falling, filled it up this morning 
and got 6mpg on this last fillup.

have gone thru the Fuel injection check list and flow chart and everything 
is by the numbers.  have reached the last line, says "replace ECU"  I've 
never known a control unit to fail..  I have a spare but it is not exact 
for my year and auto tranny.

????
it is definately running rich as plugs are carboned (all of them) so not a 
single injector.  can smell it is rich.   but why. and what.
starts easy and runs fine when warmed up but rough when cold.  everything 
I've tried appears to make it worse.


any suggestions that maybe I've missed.

is it better to use a wrong year auto tranny ECU
or
a correct year manual tranny ECU

thanks
Bob
