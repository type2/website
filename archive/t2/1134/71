Subject: Re: [T2] I saw a bus

I've just seen a bus,
I can't forget just where it was
That we'd just met, she's just the bus for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Na na na na na na

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
But I had never been aware
And as it is I dream of her tonight
Na na na na na na

CHORUS:
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling me back again
I have never known
The likes of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things and kept out of sight
But other cars were never quite like this
Na na na na na na
