?? have had the entire system apart (new long block) and checked it out 
while doing that, it was getting worse before new engine and continued 
after new engine.  and parts were stored indoors when off the engine.

was originally thinking it was early break in issues but 1500 miles on 
engine now and is getting worse. oil presure is high and temps low (have 
gauges)

only silver lining is the carbon has allowed me to find an elusive exhaust 
leak.
