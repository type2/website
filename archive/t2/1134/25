You can drive it without the cold start valve- my daughter had one 
disconnected for years before we realized the contacts were too short 
and I spliced in a true bus connector. (Vanagon one had been used by 
repairman).  just takes more cranking to get it going. Block off the 
hole and see if milage improves.  How about the air flow meter?  Did you 
check the resistance levels there?
