  Just replaced my W8CC plugs with Bosch Platinum WR8CP (new number

The difference is astonishing.  The engine now runs silky smooth and
seems much quieter.  If your engine running a bit rough, give the
platinum plugs a try.

Adrian,

**************************************************

My guess is you probably needed at least on new plug, platinum or no  ....

Recently almost on a whim I replaced my rotor and distributer cap.  The 
engine has always run well and I didnbt think I needed a tune-up, but the 
result was a noticeably smoother idle.  If just one plug is a little weak 
you will not get that smooth, even, contented cat-like purr so cherish in a 
happy air-cooled engine.

Cheers,
