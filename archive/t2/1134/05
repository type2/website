I got run over in Rome, Italy in 1992 in an 80s Autobianchi A112E in the 
same way. Me vs a taxi. I lost but drove away from it all 150 miles 
home. Scratch one very worn and rusty Autobianchi. You can't drive crazy 
in Rome quite the same way we did in Naples. I'd still like to have 
another A112 even here in the land of big SUVs and pickup trucks. (TN).

Did you crash your bus? Any pics? I am studying VW bus crashes when the 
opportunity arises. They hold up much better that I originally thought. 
Just keep the front out of the crash equation.
