Subject: Stub axle question

Is there anyone out there that can guarantee me an CORRECT answer to this
question:

Are all stub axles the same from 68 - 79 ?

Can you bond your answer with a $800 bond ? Here's why. Have to send my stub
axles to my 71 off for custom fabrication (the addition of 930 flanges on
them... raising my bus 4") If I pull mine out the shop cannot move my bus, so
I want to send a core set... BUT KEEP IN MIND... this core set, not from my
bus, will be used as a model to fabricate the 930 stubs... So they have to be
the correct units. Get my point ?
