I'll have to keep that in mind. I just changed to electronic, and
platinum (NGK) was the only plug available locally.

I've only been on a couple of 15 mile test drives, and so far plugs
are looking great.

I'll be down for paint prep for a long time, though, so I won't get to
put more miles on it to see.
