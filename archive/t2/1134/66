I agree with John on "any new plug", hope the goodness continues.  I've always
found the Bosch Platinums to be a poor long term choice in T4s (or any car
without a modern HEI system) as they foul very easily with that minute, minute
electrode tip, about any other brand platinum (or a regular ole Bosch Copper,
alas Indian made now of course) to me is a better choice.  If you ever run
rich (and hoping a 30-40 year old carbed, D-jet, or L-jet bus doesn't at some
point) in my experience they begin to start missing after 5-10k miles.  Will
certainly run nice though initially if your old plugs were dying.  Now 3
electrode silvers or the 2 or 4 electrode Bosch platinums all probably good
choices (bigger center electrode), but I stick to cheap ole copper myself
mostly.  Always look at your rotor, cap, points with a change as well of
course, stuff ain't what it used to be even when it has Bosch on it.

Recently almost on a whim I replaced my rotor and distributer cap.  The engine
has always run well and I didnbt think I needed a tune-up, but the result was
a noticeably smoother idle.  If just one plug is a little weak you will not
get that smooth, even, contented cat-like purr so cherish in a happy
air-cooled engine.
