That's a tough call on so little information. Small turn signals could
make it a splitty instead of a bay. Of course, late bay signals could
be thought of as relatively small, but late bays have large tail light
assemblies. Headrests would be normal on a late bay, but would
indicate a seat swap on a splitty.
