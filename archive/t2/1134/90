Subject: '72 Only...?

Has anyone run into any issue replacing a '72 battery tray? The  
replacement tray's sold are for '69-'72, but the replacement tray is  
too wide and too short as compared to the original. Is the '72 tray a  
One-Year-Only design?

I do not have a '73-'79 replacement battery tray for comparison  
purposes, so just wondering before I order. I am hoping I won't have  
to "marry" two trays together like a SC/DC battery tray.
