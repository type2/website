Subject: Actual burn times with Mr Buddy MH9B (Little Buddy)

Just hauled out my little Buddy Heater and it claims 6hrs on low with a 1 LB
cylinder. Has anyone actually ever timed one to see how realistic that is? I'm
doing it right now, but with a re-filled 1 LB cylinder which never seems to
refill completely. I'll see what I get.
