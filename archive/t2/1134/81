Subject: Re: [T2] Steering wheel

Scott may oddly be a problem not up top but down below, steering coupler comes
immediately to mind.  Assuming the wheel is correct for the year (and I'm
pretty sure if it isn't it won't fit at all,) that taper fit on the top always
puts the wheel in the correct location on the column, but if a cheap or well
aged coupler is kinking up, the whole column can be up in its bearings.  Now
the little plastic return tabbies have to be in good shape as well.  I haven't
rebuilt one in years, but those things were in pretty bad shape in most
buses 15 years ago, last time I went to the dealer and got a few (they used to
be like $0.50 each.)  I don't even know if still available, but the grease
gums up, combining with brass powder from the horn ring contact wear, and the
whole mess becomes solid and quits working.  It is pretty easy to dissasemble,
clean it all out and overhaul, using some modern silicone dielectric grease on
the slides and the horn contact
 (which you can bend a little to track in a new location) assuming the plastic
cancel tabs are still available.  One of the suppliers would know...

I have the same problem with self-canceling and wheel not fitting down
far enough for canceling ring to hit the tab.
