I have a couple spare ECUs and put one in yesterday, but the ECU I need 
for my van is the "AH" version for a 78 auto and my spares are all for 
manual tranny buses.   not sure how much difference there really is but 
the one in there now is an "S" from  a 77 manual.

seems to be working.  thanks for the offer. unless you have an AH and want 
to swap,
