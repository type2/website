Subject: Steering wheel

Have had a problem the last few weeks with the indicators not self-cancelling
after a turn.  Then found the horm didn't work

Took steering wheel off, checked everything was working & as it had started to
rain decided to put wheel back on & call mechanic who cares for the bus.

When wheel was put on I noticed that it was sitting about 6-7mm high, ie, not
contacting the horn contact nor going far enough down to allow the tab on the
steering wheel to actuate the cancelling switch on the indicators.

The wheel nut is in the same position ie with about 4 or 5 threads visible
above the nut.

Can the shaft move up in the column?

Bus is a 76 bay, 2-litre, dual carb
