Subject: Smartphone Dyno for tuning?

Hi Volks,

Anyone here tried out a dyno app for their smartphone? It seems pretty 
useful for tuning... kinda like adding an instrument that can verify the 
"seat of the pants" testing one would do after a tune-up or performance mod.

For $13 it'd be pretty useful to tell you if that $50 widget actually 
did make a difference or if it's just a placebo effect...

Even if I only use it to test the effectiveness of brake and tire 
upgrades, it'd still be pretty handy.

Happy Trails,
