Bob,
The cold start valve may be fine, but maybe it's still getting a
signal when it shouldn't.

Maybe disconnect the FI plug from the cold start valve, while the
engine is warm and running and measure the voltage at the connector.
Would use an analog voltmeter in case it's a pulse signal.

Or for a more messy approach, take a rag, unscrew the cold start valve
and see what it does on a warm running engine.
