Subject: Re: [T2] MPG falling ?????

Hi Bob,

6MPG is pretty hard to take. Are you driving a lot of short runs where 
the engine doesn't get time to warm up?

I think you may be on track with the ECU, but have you tested the wiring 
harness? I had a similar problem in 2008 with my baywindow and what 
cured it at the time was to swap out the ECU, harness and throttle body 
with components from another bus. I would have just swapped the harness 
but I had to use what was available at the time and that meant switching 
all three components at once.
