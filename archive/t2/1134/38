don't I know it, but the question is why? what is causing that much 
running rich. and I have turned the screw on the air flow meter to make it 
leaner without much affect, I suspect that is fine tuning anyway not this 
masive out of whack.

I am actually worried if I have a backfire or something the whole thing 
catching fire, am carrying two extinguisers and driving very sparingly, 
mostly to test changes or repairs I've made to see if it helped
