Has anyone run into any issue replacing a '72 battery tray? The B 
replacement tray's sold are for '69-'72, but the replacement tray is B 
too wide and too short as compared to the original. Is the '72 tray a B 
One-Year-Only design?

I do not have a '73-'79 replacement battery tray for comparison B 
purposes, so just wondering before I order. I am hoping I won't have B 
to "marry" two trays together like a SC/DC battery tray.
