And when you get your plasma it is a dirt easy piece to cut out of genuine
German sheetmetal left over from a side of a bus or a sliding door or
something.  I keep sides and roof sections of Vanagons for just this purpose.
 
I know, one toy at a time.  $60 air nibbler from H-F will cut it out nicely as
well BTW.
