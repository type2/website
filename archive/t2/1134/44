That is more because they are low-impedance injectors... wouldn't cause 
excessive fuel flow - would really cause the injectors to burn out or 
fail altogether.  Right now it seems like they're working as all 4 
cylinders are running rich.  I would check everything upstream 
(electronically) from the injectors.  What is controlling them and 
telling them to inject so much fuel (and/or like others suggested, the 
cold start)..
