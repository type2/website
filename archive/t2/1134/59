Assuming the L-Jet hardware is exactly the same between the two model 
years, my guess is that there might be minor changes in the fuel mixture 
at various loads.  How much different - that'd be a tough call.  You 
might try opening both of them up and take a look at the boards and the 
components.  Might be surprised to see the exact same setup...
