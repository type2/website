I don't know if you mentioned it or not, but what do the plugs look 
like?  Do they indicate an overly rich mixture?  In addition, your 
performance should definitely be affected if you're running that rich. 
You might try renting an AFR meter to see what your AFR is, as that will 
tell you right away if you're truly running that rich.
