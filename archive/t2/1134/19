The ECU calculates how long to keep the injectors open under any given
condition.

If your temp sensor is bad, you might be running under permanently
rich conditions. I've overridden this temporarily in the field by
disconnecting the harness pigtail and grounding it.

Also be sure your cold start valve is shutting off and not leaking.
