Bentley, chapter 10, page 16

I would also test the sensors through the cable to the ecu, that way you 
know it's a good signal through the cable and back to ground (if it's 
grounded on the other end).  I would also spray ProGold on every 
electrical connection in your bus.  I make a habit of doing that as much 
as possible to keep all the connections clean.
