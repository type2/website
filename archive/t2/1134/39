You don't need to adjust the screw on the AFM. That only affects idle,
so it wouldn't have a dramatic effect on your fuel economy.

You have pretty much gotten advice on all the possibilities. If you
think about the system design, there are limited possibilities.

The ECU calculates mixture. The ECU can go bad.

The ECU can receive bad information from one of the sensors.

Auxiliary components, like the cold start valve, can "disobey" the ECU.

Also, fuel injector opening is calculated to deliver a certain amount
of fuel for a certain duration of opening. This is based on a
presumption of the fuel pressure being in spec. Excessive pressure can
provide more fuel than desired.

Bosch injectors are considered pretty bullet proof, but failure is not
impossible. Failure of all 4 at the same time is highly unlikely. If
you had only one cylinder running rich, you might do the fuel delivery
and spray pattern tests.

Also be careful -- rich running can burn out a catalytic converter if
yours has one.

I got tired of that game too, so I only use "Buy It Now", even if it
means spending a few dollars more.
