Subject: Re: [T2] Bosch Platinum Plugs

it is true,, a drag race car will foul those plugs in the first 60ft...or
run grreat!

thing is , the capacitance of the stock points and cap are NOT tuned to work
with the platnun tip. it is way too small
the electronic ignition isn't much better from a theory point ofview... but
a testimonial will work great!
