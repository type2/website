Subject: Re: MPG falling ?????

Hi Bob,

It seems to me that at 6 mpg, the engine shouldn't even be running right.

When you say that mpg has been falling, you mean that it progressively
got worse over time, right? It's not a sudden thing?

Power and drivability are still the same?

Wheels turning freely?

Black exhaust smoke?

Since the cold start valve is new, that would be my first suspect...
