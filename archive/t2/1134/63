Subject: Bosch Platinum Plugs

  Just replaced my W8CC plugs with Bosch Platinum WR8CP (new number 
4035)   I have a '79 2.0 FI with Permatronix ignition.

The difference is astonishing.  The engine now runs silky smooth and 
seems much quieter.  If your engine running a bit rough, give the 
platinum plugs a try.
