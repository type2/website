the wiring harness is about 2 year old kyle brand new. the throttle body 
checks out.

the fuel presure is right on the money but wondering what actually 
triggers the injectors that maybe is holding them open a little too long??

cold start valve is new.
temp sensor checks out and it is only about 2 yrs old
timing is dead on, and it would have to be pretty bad to get that far off 
the mark fuel usage wise.

what do you think would be the better ECU to put in there a wrong year 
auto tranny ECU or the right year manual tranny ECU???

maybe should just swap and see

any one have a 78 auto tranny ECU and want to swap for another one??
