Bradley Spear tried on what he may well have thought a rhetorical question:

Brad then tried on an answer:

>Nobody I can think of


	Well lemme point out that numerous young drongos are slapping 
heat-releasing oil-coolers in just such a place on their 'hot' 
lowered cars  ...  the theory is presumably that you get rid of some 
heat from the oil, but ignores the fact that much of it is then going 
to lower the efficiency of the main water-cooling radiator.
	While I'm attacking this stupid decadence: most or all of 
them are unaware that the shiny 'mag' wheels they pay big money for 
are in many cases heavier than the humble stamped-steel wheels which 
work at least as well.
