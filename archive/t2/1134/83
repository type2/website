Subject: new T2 alleged

	I've just bought a glossy 'the world's best-selling VW Camper 
magazine',

<http://www.vwcamperandbus.com/news/current-issue/vw-camperbus-magazine-summer-2010/>

The whole-p. ad p.33 by Danbury Caravans asserts

		Our VW T2 Campervans are built brand new by 
Volkswagen and then lovingly converted by us  ... in Bristol.  ... 
modern water-cooled VW engine  ...  from {pounds} 23,000   ...


	The vehicle is of a T2 shape, but the 'spare wheel' drum on 
the front may for all I know be a novel radiator (tho' I wouldn't 
have thought such a large one necessary  -  just use finned copper 
tube to & from the engine to a small radiator under & fw of the front 
floor).
	That ad features also the URL 
<http://www.danburymotorcaravans.com/> which offers few statements & 
no pix of mechanical nature.

	Any Poms out there to cast light on this "T2" ?

	Elsewhere in the mag is advertised their companion pubn
