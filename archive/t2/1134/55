Do you have the correct fuel injectors in the bus? Didn't do any "upgrades"?

Pull the cold start injector hoses and add a short piece of fuel line 
bypassing it.

Check the fuel pressure regulator. Check for vacuum at the fuel pressure 
regulator. What happens if there is a vacuum leak there? Fuel pressure 
go up? If the pressure goes up the engine is going to consume more fuel. 
Check the fuel pressure at the rail while the engine is running.

Check the temp sensors I and II. Check them for correct resistance at 
cold and hot temps.

Look around for vacuum leaks. My bus ran terrible and had low mileage 
when I first got it. Bad injector seals and broken vacuum lines. had to 
block off the EGR valve because the pipe that connected it to the 
exhaust was rusted away and the valve was not stopping anything.

Pop the plastic cover on the AFM and see if the contact track is clean. 
See using a multimeter if it is delivering a clean signal as you move 
the flapper open and closed.

Basically I would start with the list wisdom, work through my list and 
then get out your Bentley manual and your fuel pressure gauge, your can 
of WD-40 for vacuum leak hunting (with the red spray straw), and your 
multimeter and check every component. Don't forget to do a full 
continuity test on the wiring harness.

My guess that it is something simple and rubber or electrical. I doubt 
it is the engine computer. I doubt it is the air flow meter. I doubt it 
is the cold start injector. Do the easy stuff first, the cheap stuff 
second and try hard to not succumb to throwing expensive parts at it. 
I've been there and done that only to find it was a broken or corroded 
wire at the temp sensor.
