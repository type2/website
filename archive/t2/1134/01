Subject: Re: [T2] Body metal

Any of the major suppliers like busdepot, cip1, or Oldvolks etc have this metal; heck even millsupply carries it. It will all probably be Danish made, some Brazil, or if you're REALLY lucky, you'll find some actual VW of Brazil or Mexico stuff out there. I haven't seen any real stuff for awhile now though.
HTH,
