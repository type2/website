Subject: RE: [T2] CV joints nocking sound

Sounds like a dirty cv joint to me...Clean, regrease, check for any damage
and put a new boot on it. The Muir book has a good procedure for this. 

Good luck,
Scott 



Yestarday I was driving my bus down hill and sundely a nocking or clacking
sound start in the driver's side rear wheel, I drove slowly for about two
miles and the sound where there continuosly unless the bus was roling in
neutral or with the cluth depress.
