To all those who unmericfully pick on the Bus Depot,
need to stop it.  I love the bus depot.  I buy almost
everything from the bus depot, because they sell
quality components and I don't want that to ever
change.  So if you don't like buying the good stuff,
then how about going to motorworks.com and leave Ron
alone.

Cheers to Ron and the Bus Depot
Blah to all those nah-sayers
