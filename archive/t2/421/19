Subject: UPATE ON GENERATOR REMOVAL

Hello,

I posted a message with regards to if you could change the generator on a 72
van
1800, without pulling the engine. The answer is "yes" and it was alot easier
than i imagined.
Weird thing is that i took the fried one out and i had the old spare from my
last 72 van
but the fried one had a round hole for the air and the old one had the D
shaped hole.
the fried one had a plug type of wired connection but the old one had the
wires right into the
generator. the fried one had small fan blades the old one did not.
anyways i ended up cutting the wires and re-attaching them and she works like
a charm.
it took about 2 hours to take out the old one and install the replacement.
sweet.

Darren
