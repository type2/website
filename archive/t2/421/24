Late bay bus heads are the same studs as aircooled vanagon. I think all type
IV bus heads use the same rocker studs, but I am not positive.

Try fat performance for new ones, but they are not stock, they are 8mm on
top, stock is 7mm.

A rebuilder like rimco could probably supply good used stock ones, as they
take in many core heads.
