Dual carbs. Fun!!! (I have dual Dells on a Type IV in my Beetle).

Check the linkage. Check it hot and cold. Make sure both carbs are closed 
totally. Make sure that when they are open, both are open all the way.

If that isn't right get it right because the rest of the exercise is 
useless unless the linkage is right.

Check the gas pedal too. I once found a few extra mph b/c my pedal was 
floored before the carbs were open all the way.

Make sure the gas pedal cable is not holding the carbs open at idle.

Check the timing at idle once you can get the engine into idling speeds.

With a can of WD-40 or carb cleaner or some similar flammable spray fluid 
check for vacuum leaks.

Check your timing with a timing light if you haven't.

I won't go into tuning the carbs (I'll leave that for other folks) b/c I 
suspect it is something simple that I mentioned above.

Search for and buy a carb book for Kadrons. CB Performance? I bought a 
Weber and Dellorto book from them that was pretty good long ago.
