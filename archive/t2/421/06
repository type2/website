Maybe 5 amps for the blower.
glow plug is more but it doesn't stay on very long.

You have the ambulance fans??  I don't know how much they draw, but I can't imagine it being that much.  A few amps perhaps.

The electrical system was designed to handle those loads already.

I don't see how.

Then something is very wrong with your system or batteries.  Even if your two batteries were only 100 amp-hours (they are likely more) you would have to draw 100 amps above your alternator output to wear them out in an hour.

I live in Texas and have A/C... let's see, 2 amps for the electric clutch, 8 amps for condenser fans and another 6 for evaporator fans, or about 16 amps over stock, continuous.  Yes, I use it at night also with the lights on - it doesn't cool off here until after midnight thanks to the humidity.  I have driven for hours on end without wearing out my batteries.  Yes they probably aren't charging much but they are not wearing down either.

Are you running the stock mechanical regulator?  If so, your stock alternator is probably not pulling its weight.  Have you checked how much it is actually putting out under those conditions?  I noticed a big improvement in charging when I switched to an electronic regulator.
