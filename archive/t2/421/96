What a load of BS.  I knew I wouldn't like GEICO after seeing how much they advertise.

I have Nationwide insurance and pay about an extra $35/month to insure my bus for $300k liability and everything else except for comp and collision.  The Mustang GT is about $55/month but it is listed as my primary vehicle and of course there is a premium for a V8.  Is the bus listed as your primary vehicle, i.e. the one that you drive to work and back?  That one will usually be more expensive to insure.
I'm over 25 (way over) and married, but my rates did not drop significantly from when I was single a few years ago.
