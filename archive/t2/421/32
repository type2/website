Subject: Re: [T2] Single Webber on a 1800

William-

I have that exact configuration in my 74.......1800cc with a Weber
progressive conversion from dual carbs. I also run the SVDA distributor from
John at aircooled.net. I have no complaints at all abut this set-up. I have
good power, reasonable gas mileage, and excellent reliability. Mileage is 15
in town and 20 on the highway. I know that going back to a good set of dual
carbs may help me make some small improvements, but I question the
cost/benefit aspect. (My bus came with the Weber installed so I'd have to
shell out for a complete dual carb set-up from the manifold up.)
Anyway, I've had good results with the Weber. By the way, this bus is my
daily driver as well as my long haul road tripper.

Regards,
Dave
