From what I gather the only benefit is the "classic" looking solid blue
plate with white letters.

Same cost, as far as I can tell, no other restrictions.  Surprisingly the
Florida HSMV seems a bit vague on these.

The only restriction appears to be that your vehicle must be 30 years old
or older from the date of manufacture.
