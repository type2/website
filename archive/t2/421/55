Subject: Insurance Questions

Hey guys,

	I was curious what some of you guys use to insure your VW
Transporters. I currently use Geico. Right now, it's costing me about $170
dollars a month to insure 3 cars, my 1997 GrandAm, my 87 Pontiac Fiero, and
my 73 VW Transporter. The Fiero only costs me an additional $30 dollars a
month, the GrandAm costs me only $55 dollars a month, but the VW Transporter
costs me $85 dollars a month. It seems a bit pricey. The lady on the phone
said that because my VW Transporter is soo unsafe, they charge a higher
insurance rate. I even told her I had front wheel disc brakes, but she said
it didn't matter because they didn't have ABS. My Fiero doesn't have ABS,
but Geico seems to think it's a safer car than my 4 cyl GrandAm Sedan? She
even went so far as to say.. "Are you SURE you want to insure it??"

Do any of you guys use separate car insurance companies to insure your VWs
or special cars? I'm just wondering if it might not be worth it for me to
switch.
