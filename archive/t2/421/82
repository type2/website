The last time I insured in BC through ICBC (the govt's insurance corp), it
cost me $947 CDN annually for $15M (that's not a typo) liability to/from
work up to 15 km. I've over 25 with 40% discount for good driving record. I
wonder how much the rates have changed since then. BC is divided into
driving zones with Vancouver being the most expensive, naturally.
