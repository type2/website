If they use thermocouples it will, period, unless they come from a universe
of bizarro physics. A thermocouple will generate its own voltage based on
the temperature differential between the probe and the cold junction. If
they use thermisters then it is correct that the ambient temperature at
the cold junction will not affect the reading.
In fact, there would not be a cold junction nor the bimetal wires. Just the
sender and the wire connector.  A thermister is a probe whose resistance
varies with temperature. I have a VDO CHT gauge and a sender for it, and that sender is a thermocouple.

I'd be interested in seeing why they claim that the cold junction temperature
does not affect readings of their gauges. I should mention that although I
have a VDO thermocouple and CHT gauge I've never installed them and have
not performed empirical tests with them.

Yes, that was the main point of my post. :)
