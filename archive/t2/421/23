Stephen,

I have studied up on this a bit, and I am still confoosed.

I read the page on the westach website which explains this phenomenon as it
pertains to their gauges.

I have also had some email exchanges with VDO technical support and they
insist that the temperature of the junction between the
sender(thermocopuple) and the gauge wire will NOT affect the reading on
their CHT gauges. I can send you the messages if you like.

I remain skeptical about this VDO reply, as I have empirical evidence that
in our cold toronto winters, my VDO CHT gauge seems to read higher than in
the warmer months. I am not certain that the tech staff are well versed in
the physics of how the gauges work, they are more like helping people on
installation issues.

At any rate, the gauge is just there to warn about dangerous or safe trends
anyhow.
