<< Hey Todd,

 >>

$650/year Liability with NJ Cure (non-profit only in NJ insurance) vs.
$1250 with whoever's left in NJ for insurance...NJ Cure is the only
affordable insurance in NJ...Two other companies refused to insure
anything over 15 years old...I found NJ Cure after my old (15 or so
years with them and no accidents or moving violations), insurance co.
doubled my premiums last year...Some requirements; three years with
a license, etc. There's an 800 # for those in NJ only and no agents, BTW.
If you live in NJ, check them out, but bring lunch, the first phone call is
to the machine...On line quotes, too. If dealing with a disembodied com-
puter is worth the bucks to you, try contacting them/it.
