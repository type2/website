Subject: AAARRRGH!! Please Help

    You guys (and gals) are my last hope. For the record, let me state, that I
don't know what I'm doing. There!!

    I have a 1970 westy w/ 1776, dual Kadrons, 009 dist. The damn thing won't
idle well. Here's the kicker, it did before I started dinking around. Let
sleeping dogs lie I guess. Last year at this time I had problems passing
emissions requirements and I dropped a bunch of cash for essentially a tune up
so it would pass. This year I thought, hey why not just tune her myself, learn
how, AND save some cash. I did and passed emissions with flying colors.

    The VERY next day, she started running crappy. Here's what she does. After
warming up for a few minutes, all seems well, purring along at around 900 RPM.
However, when I rev her a bit, the idle sticks at around 1200 RPM. After I
drive for about 5 min., she idles really high (1800 RPM). Then she settles
down. Sometimes when I'm coming to a stop at an intersection she'll die on
me.

    I just got back inside and here's what I noticed. Points need to be
replaced, but dwell sits at 49. Timing is right on at 30 deg at full advance.
I noticed that my gas pedal spring is busted, but I haven't had any problems
w/ it sticking. (I'm of course replacing it anyways.) When I changed plugs, I
noticed she was running rich, but I never had luck getting to the mixture
screws on these dumb carbs.

    Please, any suggestions would be appreciated. Nothing like having a good
running car and then killing it. Speaking of which my wife may kill me soon,
this is my daily and she's sick of dropping me off at work.

Thanks

Zach
