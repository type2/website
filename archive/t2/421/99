not necissarily, two companies are building true hybrid buses,

But in the meantime, who will be the first to put a Prius drivetrain in a bus?  Sounds like a good project for a highschool physics class.  :)

New York City has just placed orders for 230+ Orion VII hybrid buses,
these buses have a small diesel engine driving an alterantor and charging
a bank of batteries, there is a single electric motor driving the rear
axles thru a fairly standard drive train, which will drive the motor as a
generator when braking.

NJ transit also has some MCI hybrids which are the big over the road
coaches (Greyhound type) that have a really large battery pack but
operates similar to the NYC buses.

(Mandatory bus content) I have played with a similar concept for an older
bus I had with a blown engine,  was going to put electric engine onto the
rear of the standard tranny,  small generator above it in the engine
compartment, electronics on the side where the batterys are now and a
battery tray in the center with a raised floor.   $$$$ kept me from
bringing this to fruition but it was mostly designed...would still love to
actually build it...
