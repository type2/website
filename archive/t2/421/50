Why better horsepower?
You want vaporized fuel not condensed droplets that a cold inlet would
indicate. The type 1 engines (1600 uprights) have a heat riser pipe for
a reason...Racers (road course/drag) use various ways to cool the in-
take 'charge' (cold air ducting, fuel lines running thru' dry ice boxes)
to create a denser (more molecules to the cubic inch) mixture on the
intake side of the carb/FI...
