sodium filled exhaust valves were stock on some 1.8l bus motors (AW?). they
are still available, but they are very expensive, maybe four times the price
of normal valves. you might get lucky, i bought a set of 4 on ebay for
20.00, but they were listed by part number only and the vendor didn't know
what they were. i think the part# is 022 109 612A, but don't quote me. if
jamie rivers reads this he can pipe in, he has a set still in the box, so
he'll have the part number for sure.

you can only use these valves if you have the right heads, 1.8l, or if you
have head work done to other heads, as the sodium valves are 34mm head
diameter, which is larger than the 33mm valves used on most tIV heads.
another info tidbit is that they use a bigger valve clearance, 0.008".
