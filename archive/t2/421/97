Uh, the Honda has a "sandwich" motor/generator but I don't think the Prius does - I think it is a more conventional setup as it is a much larger motor (44hp).  I could not find any information on the web to confirm this though.

It's an amazing engine - wish I had one in my bus.  The Prius drivetrain is still much cleaner though, if you're into that.

Well, that is a wonderful concept, but the Prius/Insight are by definition Hybrids.

 From Dictionary.com: "A power plant having two kinds of components that produce the same or similar results".

I'm still praying that someday the technological challenges of this method will be overcome and we will get vehicles like this.  A 60hp electric motor at each wheel would be very interesting!  But in the meantime, who will be the first to put a Prius drivetrain in a bus?  Sounds like a good project for a highschool physics class.  :)
