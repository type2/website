Subject: Where do I get a refrigerator for my 78?  Anyone know?

Hey All,

I'm ripped out the old moldy refrigerator the PO had installed and wanted 
to replace it.  I have searched and searched and I keep getting these sites 
with prices in the mid $900... OUCH!  no way.  I spoke to the cool guys at 
"one of the cool VW bus part companies that frequent this list" about it 8 
months ago and they said a new refrigerator is ~$200 at Camper World.  I 
went to my local Camper World and the guy at the counter practically fell 
off his chair when I told him the refrigerator was for my bus (their price 
was ~$500).   Anyone know what website I can go to or business to get one?

My bus is a 78 ASI.  The old refrigerator was a Norcold (moldy and 
stinky).  I went to their site and the prices were CRAZY.

Thanks in advance!
