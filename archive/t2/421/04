You mean like this?

Been there, done that.  The smog pump pulley is not rated for much of a load.  My 1.5hp A/C compressor killed it easily - tearing up the rubber coupler.  A loaded 100-amp alternator would tear it up just as quickly.

If you can find a similar A/C pulley assembly from a Porsche 912, that would work, but they are extremely rare and I feel that both of these pulley assemblies block airflow into the cooling fan, making the engine run a little hotter.

I'm not saying it can't be done - there are ways.  I can say that none of the ways are without major drawbacks.
