Subject: Subject: Re: [T2] CV joints knocking sound

	One thing I discovered when My CV joints fell apart while taking the
engine out ( wire them up REALLY good) was that they will only go back on
the axle one way, not which side is out when you take them apart.   I used a
simple three arm puller with bolts through the CV and attached to the
puller.  They came off really easily and without violence.

	Same exact thing happened to me. The CVJ by the gear box had a
broken outer 
	race.
	Press would be nice, but, I just did it by hand. It'll be nice to
have a 
	socket like thing to fit over the axle when reinstalling past the
circlip groove. 
	Watch the splines!
