I'm up in Canada so its a different system,  but I get hit with quite 
the insurance bill, I pay $5,500.00 a year to insure my 2000 Subaru 
Impreza and my 1973 Bus. Adding the bus to my policy actually doubled 
my rate, my to my surprise.

I Have NO tickets and One claim for an accident in which I was not at 
fault, I am 24 so that may be the reason for such a steep rate, cant 
wait for 25.

My insurance is ING/Western Union, with Full coverage and they were 
able to give me a rate WAY lower than anyone else offered, believe it 
or not.

So, is it worth the money to insure my bus ? Well, I pay out a good 
2000.00 and odd a year and suck it up.
