Subject: Antique License Plate???

Hey guys,

	Anyone live here in Florida have an "Antique" license plate on their
car? I'm not sure exactly what the benefit is (if any) but my 1973 VW Bus
now qualifies for a "Regular" Antique license plate because it is now 30
years or older. 

Pre 1945 vehicles get registered as Horseless carriages. 

I was thinking about getting one. Just wondering if anyone had ever done
that before on here.
