Subject: Matchbox `62 Splittie

Picked up Matchbox's "Wings 'N Water" pack of 5 vehicles (#95313) on
Tuesday.

The contents include one `62 Sunroof Beetle (spelled that "Beatle" at first,
"We all live in a Yellow Submari..."), a jet ski on a trailer (for the
beetle), a racing hydroplane (go figure), and a rail (with a V8 in the
rear?!).  All have that sort of shark motif on them.

Oh, vehicle number 5 is a `62 splittie (dated 1999). :O)

Metallic blue with the shark motif.  Painted over the headlights, etc., but
it's neat.  Been trying to find this set for a couple of weeks.  Found it at
WalMart.
