Subject: rear hub nut...

what size is a 69 transporter rear drum hub nut? i seem to remember a specific tool you had to come up with...any good ideas/procedures for removing the rear drum? looks like i got a bad slave cylinder in the right rear, as i lossing fluid there....maybe a line too?

two weeks to go till i hit the road to kansas from california...the bus looks great with a brown and blue color scheme, and is running like a champ!
