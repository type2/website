Subject: Re: [T2] rear hub nut...

1-13/16" or 46mm - use a good  heavy duty 3/4" drive breaker bar (mine is a
40 yo Craftsman) with a 3 to 4 ft length of pipe that will slide over the
breaker bar - put on the emergency, put it in gear and have someone press on
the brake pedal while you wrench  - that should do it
