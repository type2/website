Mine was actually out in the open, not inside the engine tin at all. Maybe
it was aftermarket, but they mounted a small pulley between the fan housing
and case and ran a belt (yeah it was thin), to this bracket setup outside
the tin, near the aux battery tray, kinda wedged in there. It probably would
get a lot of air. I'm not going to reuse the AC setup anyway... Anyone need
a beat up compressor? LOL
