Subject: body panels

does anyone have a source for repair panels for the drivers rear window 
(the one rear of the jalousies) for a 79 camper?   Mine's rusted out about 
3 inches down and my body man wants me to find a complete panel or at least 
a good repair section.  I've checked Alan Schofield, and BusDepot and 
Busted VW but am coming up empty.  Any leads would be appreciated.  tx, Greg
