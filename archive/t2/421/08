Been there, done that.  The smog pump pulley is not rated for much of a
load.  My 1.5hp A/C compressor killed it easily - tearing up the rubber
coupler.  A loaded 100-amp alternator would tear it up just as quickly.

If you can find a similar A/C pulley assembly from a Porsche 912, that would
work, but they are extremely rare and I feel that both of these pulley
assemblies block airflow into the cooling fan, making the engine run a
little hotter.

I'm not saying it can't be done - there are ways.  I can say that none of
the ways are without major drawbacks.



How about using the pulley that is designed for the AC pump like on my 79
Westy that gets mounted further back, between the case and the fan housing?
If it can handle turning an AC Pump I bet it can handle an alternator,
though you'd have to design a mighty funky bracket to do it.
