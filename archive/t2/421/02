probably is, but I must be that 00.1% because it is getting to be a real
problem, I ski, it means I am in the mountains, it is cold, frequently the
weather is bad, and to get fresh powder means getting out there for

aux gas heater..
extra defrost blower fans
it means wipers
it means high beams and/or driving lights. even without the radio I am
well over the alt capacity and can drain two big 950CCA batteries in about
an hour or so....over and above the alt output....
