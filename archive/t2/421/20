Subject: exhaust leaks and burnt valves

Hey all,

During the replacement of my muffler and heater boxes last weekend I
discovered more exhaust leaks than I had suspected.  I am getting the small
backfires during decel, coasting and shifting. I didnt have time to pull the
whole system out and replace all the gaskets at the time but plan on doing it
this coming weekend. I couldn't see any holes or cracks in the manifolds or
afterburner elbows so I am assuming/hope that I just need new gaskets all
around and that it's not the heads themselves leaking. My question is, how
much of a risk of burnt exhaust valves is there if I don't get the leak solved
right away? This is my driver so its kind of hard to take it off the road,
but, if I should I can.

Suggestions, info?
Thanks
