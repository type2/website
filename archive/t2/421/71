Subject: Where To Send Heads For QUALITY Work?

Ok, the heads are coming off (this is on my 914 2.0, but type IV motors is
type IV motors).  Last time I had head work done I used a place called
Stephens out in California who was supposed to be the best at the time.  I
know their reputation went in the garbage 2-3 years ago so even if they're
still in business I figure they're not the right place.

So can anyone tell me where to send my heads to be re-worked?  I expect I'll
need a couple of valve seats, valve guides, exhaust and intake stud repair,
and whatever else they may find.  I don't like pulling motors so I want top
quality work done right the first time.  Period.  Who's the best?

Thanks.
