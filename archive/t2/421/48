Subject: Cooler Valves???

I was reading something, somewhere that said Porsche motors come with sodium
filled valves. Apparently they put some sort of sodium (I guess the straight
element?) into a hollow exhaust valve. It's then sealed up, so you basically
have a valve shaft that's filled with Sodium. As the valve goes back and
forth, the sodium helps transfer the heat from the valve seat to the
complete opposite side of the valve shaft.

Anyone know if they offer this for the Volkswagen?
