Mr. Ollom,

A while back I had the sad experience of "parting out" a mid-70s (74-75)
westfalia.  The interior was in good condition and very originl but the
frame was rusted beyond saving.  I did examine and salvage the floor
system and as I remember it was composed of two large and two small sheets
of a fiberboard that were aproximately 13mm (1/2") thick. These boards
were not plywood but rather softer and made of compressed fiber, possibly
coir from coconut husks. Over this was laid a sheet of masonite and then
the finish vinyl floor.

The fiberboard subfloor was cut to fill the "well" created by the raised
edges of the sliding door rails.  You could obtain a measure of the
thickness needed to fill this depression by laying a straightedge across
from door to wall and measuring to the top of one of the raised rails.  As
I remember the subfloor and floor did not extend under the bench seat but
I may be wrong on this as it has been some time.

                             OOK!
