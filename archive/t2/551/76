Subject: Upper Bed for early bay Westy

  I'm looking for pics of the rare bed option to replace the upper cot in the
early (up to 73)
Westfalia. I think it was Mike Benthin who sent me a pic years ago but I've
lost it.Could some one send me the pic or
better yet does anyone use one of these or have one for sale?

Thanks
