Subject: Re: [T2] Pitman Arm

A friend is looking for a pitman arm for a 71 and 72 bus.  Anyone know where
she can find one?  She can't find it by that name in the distributors she
has looked at.
<<

yo Snoop,

i think she can't find one b/c they don't exist. i suspect
she is looking for some part in the steerling linkage. could
it be the drag link?

of course i could be wrong. that has been known to happen. ;-)

good luck,
