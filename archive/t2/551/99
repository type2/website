Subject: RE: [VB] irc

I try to hit it up from time to time. I've only ever seen one live person in 
there...

But that's just the way it goes. I've got live chat on my site as well that 
hardly ever sees multiple visitors. We get the most turn-out when we 
schedule our "Virtual Happy Hour and Volkswagen Trivia" nights...

We're setting up an IRC server as well, and will be turning to an 
implementation of a Java IRC client. Perhaps making this same Java client 
available at Type2.com would be a good idea to get more volks on the 
channels...

Food for thought anyway...
