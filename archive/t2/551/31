Subject: 091 conversion requirements

Besides a 091 from 76 to 82 AC, what is required to mate this to a 1970
bus with an 1800 T1 as the desired engine?
I am interested and concered with mounting issues, if any, clutch group
requirements, flywheel and starter differences, and nosecone/clutch
cable/linkage issues, if any.
Thanks,
Al
