Subject: Re: [T2] Westy/Camper flooring questions

After seeing a EV MV Weekender, I'll be doing some seaing rearrangment on our '78 Westy. Out comes the stove/sink combo (stored in the barn) and in goes a psuedo Weekender setup. 

Still plenty of space for cargo between the seats, can carry the family and then some and we can still camp (sleep/eat). 

Don't need the sink, don't want the stove inside the bus.
