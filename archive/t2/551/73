I had the same problem as you(Greg), I sunk two
exhaust valves on a air-cooled 80 westy last year
going to Grandfather Mtn. I had the compression set
too high(150PSI) for the gas, next rebuild(The very
next week) I brought it down to 120 PSI, too handle
the low octane and bad mix of the fuel, I now run a
oil temp gage and try to keep it lower than 220
degrees, my next thing to add to the bus will be a
cylinder head temp gage. Knock on wood, keeping the
oil temp down has been working, running 50-60 MPH with
oil temp of 190-200.. Phil
