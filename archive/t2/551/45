Subject: Re: [T2] Rear facing seating

My Westy's rear-facing jumpseat has no seatbelt.  But on that note, I am
looking to install a pair of standard seats, rear-facing, to increase the
seating capacity of the bus.  Anyone ever done this, and how did it go?    I
have thought of fabbing up a riser and just installing Beetle seats back
there, but the idea of the folding jumpseats is very intriguing...

If I were you, I'd do two buckets instead of the bench, unless yours is a
non-walkthrough.

Did the factory rear facing seats have seat belts? How were they bolted to
the floor?

Considering a rear facing bench in my Westy instead of the stove/sink unit.

Don't know if the seatbelts would be worthwhile except in a rollover.
