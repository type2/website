After a thorough cleaning, I'll lay down a layer of bedliner, then fill in
the corrugated sections with that expando foam stuff.

Should provide extra insulation and protect the metal somewhat. There's
amazingly no rust on the floor pans that I've found so far, except in the
area where the sink was. For that I have some sheet aluminum I'm going to
rivet into place after cutting out the rust.
