Okay Problem #2 of the day.

Where would I find the VW part # on a Cam Shaft? Are the Gears numbered the 
same? I wouldn't believe that they are. Mine says 021 109 111C VW 10H? How 
do you tell if it is Hydraulic or not? I remember something about the angle 
of the lobes being different is this true?

I know, I know....who would be foolish enough to assemble an engine with a 
mixed set of lifters to a different cam(Hydr. Vs. Solid)? The PO of this 
beast has a lot of strange things going on. Rebuilt Heads, brand new spark 
plugs, New rings, honed cyllinders, the rest looks original maybe? 
Perplexing wish I could talk with the Genius and find out wht it was never 
fired after the work(or why it would never fire).

Thanks,

Michael Knight
