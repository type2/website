Subject: Where's the high beam switch?

Hello,

Where is the high beam switch on my 72 van? I would have it expected it to 
be on the floor to the left of the peddles or activated by pulling up on the 
turn signal lever. But I don't have a switch on the floor and it feels like 
pulling on the lever will break it.

Thanks in advance for your help, Phil.
