The Deutsches Institut fur Normung (DIN) is a standard-setting
organization in Germany much like the SAE and the ASME in the United
States.  The terminal numbers on German cars adhere *mostly* to a standard
published by that organization.  As you have found some become old friends
over time but the odder ones can be hard to come by.  I have never seen
the document that lists the numbering applications but do know that it
exists.
