Subject: newbie mistake

I have just recently finished my 1st engine rebuild took longer than I had
expected but thats ok because I'm new to VWs well after stabbing my engine
and hooking up my gas lines and what not I have some wires that I didn't
label when taking the engine out so here's my question dose any one have any
idea where the wires from the fire wall hook up to? is there any wiring
diagrams that i could be using? or is there any pics online that I could use
as a reference?

thanks for all the help keep on bus'n
