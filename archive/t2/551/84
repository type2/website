Subject: Re: [T2] Head problems again/911 engine?

I have seen lots recently,, [over 32] heads drop a valve seat.... none of those
drivers had a CHT gauge.

Remember we're dealing with at least 20 year old engines here. None of the heads are any newer than 20 years old - at least the OEM versions. Age isn't the main factor but the number of heat cycles are. I think alot of these heads are just finally getting old. Are the aftermarket replacement heads having the same problems?

FWIW the Corvair folks are having more dropped seats these days too. Their "experts" claim it is due to the number of heat cycles over the years. However, the newest Corvair (1969) is 10 years or so newer than the newest VW and we're all having the same problems... Hmmmmm....
