that might be a good flooring option?  I was thinking that it would look
pretty slick in there to have a laminate hardwood flooring look.  I will
probably end up going with something a little more conventional, like
linoleum, but I was just thinking of it and thought I'd ask.

jay, the plywood you're talking about is more like masonite on my 75er. it
is 3/16" thick and yes the carpet is stapled through the masonite. on top
of the bare cargo floor is the 3/8" carboard subfloor. lucky i had mine out
while installing a propane tank and improving the rear facing seat. as far
as what i think about laminate and linolium i say are they conventional,
conditional. or confrontational?  - steve
