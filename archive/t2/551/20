Subject: how does a compufire work?

As I understand the circuit with a Compufire or other 
points-replacement module, this module acts like a wire hanging in 
parallel with the primary of the coil,  and the lobes of the 
distributor shaft make/break this connecting wire as they sweep past 
the module.

Three questions:
First of all, is the above really the equivalent circuit?
Secondly, is there no ground in this primary circuit?
Thirdly, how does this generate a signal in the primary?

I'm trying to understand this because I just installed a CDI on an 
engine that has a compufire module in the distributor. The engine ran 
fine before the CDI. It won't start with the CDI. I am hoping that it 
is because the red wire from the compufire is just hanging, not 
connected to anything. It is hanging because I didn't find any 
mention of this wire in the CDI instructions.

Thanks, jack
