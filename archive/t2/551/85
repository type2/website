Subject: Re: [T2] Head problems again/911 engine?

I'll go along with the heat cycle--or just plain overheating the head's,
the valves and the seats --all caused by the crummy fuel with lack of
any lubricating qualities--

Like the elimination tetra ethyl lead.

Lead kept the valves and seats slippery--and warded off any premature
burning of them.

This is exactly the reason I run the Marvel in the gas.
To do what the lead was doing way back when.

It's totally a different animal, except for it's lubricating qualities,
and it'll help retard any valve / seat failure's.
