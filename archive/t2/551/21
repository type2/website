 It's quite easy to type the umlaut (if you're using a windows PC). Just
hold
down the ALT key and type 0252 (including the zero) on the number keypad
to
 get a |. The hard part is remembering the numbers for the special
characters.
See the Character Map application for other useful ALT + number
combinations.
cool-  Farvergn|gen!  Will it post that way?  As to why I drive a bus,
you can get a full sheet of plywood in the back with no cabinets in the
way!
