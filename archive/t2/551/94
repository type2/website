Subject: Type IV Thermostat Question

Since these guys seem to be near impossible to find these days and folks are using the type 1 thermostats with some mods I was wondering if anyone could give their opinion on how well the conversion has gone. I was thinking of getting one from Aircooled.net and just wanted to hear if anyone had anything bad to say about those thermostats. Also was the conversion a PITA??
 
TIA

P.S. Insatlled the crane electronic ignition last night. Piece of cake, should have done that years ago. It was very easy to do and runs great.
