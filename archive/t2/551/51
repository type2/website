You can get a decent rebuilt T4 for $1500 or less (I got one delivered to my house for $1100 in 2002). Install yourself (another $200 in misc parts) or have a shop do it. $6K is ridiculous.

$6K ought to get you pretty close to being into a Porsche 911 engine or one heck of a racing Corvair engine and custom 5 speed...
