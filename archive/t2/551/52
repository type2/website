Subject: Re: [T2] Rear facing seating

I'm thinking of pulling all of the Westy cabinets out and then creating a single cabinet that runs along the drivers side, very narrow - equal to the '78 Westy fridge width now. That will provde some storage and fill the space between the back seat and driver's side wall. 

The front rear facing seat will simply be a mirror image of the rear seat. Cabinets will conceal either the Westy fridge or simply act as storage and a surface to mount the table to. Firdge may migrate to under the rear seat or simply become a nice electric "cooler" as found at K-mart. 

Closet goes away and cabinet above the rear cargo area will be rebuild/redesigned to cover the same area but all the way from left to right.

Max people carrying capacity, still a mobile bedroom, and still picnic machine. New rear facing seal can prob still be removed in 20 minutes or so for cargo errands. I normally use our 5x8 utility trailer for that but sometimes inside cargo is better than outside cargo. 

As this van is formerly a Champagne Edition, I'll be keeping all the Westy equipment and drivetrain parts so I can dump the Corvair and "custom" interior at some future point if I want to return to stock everything ( I do appreciate the stock vehicle but I can't leave anything well enough alone!). Should I be lucky enough to buy a true Eurovan Weekender someday, I'd prob retire the Westy back to stock everything with a full detail oriented restore.
