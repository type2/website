Oil temp seems high... 

Is all the tin complete? Is the oil cooler clean (outside)? Perimeter seal there? All Heater hoses connected or at least properly blocked off?

I would consider synthetic oil if your oilt emps are going to run that high. 

The oil was hot, the heads may have been hotter. And of course it may just have been bad luck...
