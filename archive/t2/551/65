Subject: Distributor codes, strangest condenser in history?

I have a distributor, let's say it's a 113 905 205 AJ.  I love it, it works
great.  Nice unit in good condition.  But let's say you need a condenser.
Every time I order one based on the distributor code, I get the wrong thing.
What I should be getting is Bosch # 1 237 330 191, which has a round hole
and the condenser itself has an integral clamp.

Problem is, that no one can reliably supply this part for me.  Anyone got
any ideas?  Alternate parts codes?  Hare-brained solutions?

Thanks,

Blake
