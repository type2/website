Hi -

Has anyone had experience with someone contributing sugar to their fuel tank,
and if so, can they tell me what it would look like in terms of exhaust
emission?  In short, my 72 Campmobile (recently recovered from having been
stolen) ran fine yesterday, and this morning there is a great quantity of
steam coming from the exhaust.  I did wash it yesterday and it's possible some
water got into the fuel (homemade gasket on the tank lid), but unlikely.

Thanks,
