Subject: Metric tracer wire

I've been cleaning up the wiring in my engine bay and I finally located a source of tacer wire to keep the stock look and the color coding.

http://www.eagleday.com/neauwi.html

These wires are the correct metric sizes, available in 1m quantities and have a pair of straight OEM tracer wire stripes going down the length of the wire instead of in a spiral like the Waytek auto wire I found previously.

The wire comes directly from Europe and add 5 days to normal shipping.
