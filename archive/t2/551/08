Subject: Re: [T2] Anybody done the H-4 headlight conversion?

I converted my 74 Camper about 1990 to H-4 lights.  I made them into the euro style
3rd beam

I took a set of Bosch H4's and drilled a hole in the lens to install a parking lamp.

Now I have daytime [dim] headlights anytime the ignition is on,, and normal low/high
beam when the headlight switch is on.

I have done quite a number of 10hr drives all night long to attend shows like
Manassas.Driving thru Upstate NY and Pennsylvania are full of deer especially in the
spring, and I really enjoyed having the brighter lights.

I never joined the list till 98 or somewhere,, and that is when I learned the wiring
wouldn't be heavy enough.

I like the relay idea, but just never got around to installing one for the headlights.

Thankfully I have had No problems to date with the headlight switch.

I just looked at the lamps, and they are 60/55 watts.
