Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition switch or starter?

Hi Paul,

LOL... There is a  bus I am working on with these symptoms that needed 
a starter AND an ignition cylinder. I was referred to the owner by a 
well-known air-cooled VW shop about 80 miles away, and since he was 
close by I told him I'd have a look at it.

First off I tested the starter, which was very slow even when the 
solenoid was bypassed with a jumper cable. The PO had already installed 
a relay, and had it powered by a push-button on the dash. While taking 
the starter out of the bus the large positive terminal broke right out 
of the plastic casing. So we replaced the starter. Even after the 
starter was replaced I got no dash lights or starter action from the 
key. Sigh. I was able to get it running iwith it hotwired. I ordered an 
ignition switch from germansupply.com and went back a week later to 
pull the steering column apart and make things right.

But as it turned out it wasn't the switch, it was the ignition 
cylinder. The steering lock mechanism had twisted the prong on the end 
of the lock cylinder so that it wasn't turning far enough to engage the 
starter. Eventually it wouldn't even engage the dash lights. So I 
pulled the steering lock out of it and installed a new lock cylinder. 
It goes in tomorrow night... wish me luck!


Happy trails,
