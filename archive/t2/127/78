Subject: Paint

Hi list,

Made a new VW acquisition this weekend, and plan on starting to work on it
right away.
 As I clean up areas of surface rust, what paint should I use on these now
clean and bare areas.
 I plan on having the whole thing painted at a latter date, so I will be
doing final sanding and 
primering with a high build primer and block sanding then, before taking it
to the local MACO for the
 color coat. Am I correct in thinking that primer alone will not protect it
from rusting till then
 and using a good rattle can enamel will protect?

Thanks

Jeff.
