Hi Steve,

The bolt holding the fan on break off of my Westfakia's 1800cc engine last
year. I drilled out the remains of the bolt and reassembled with a fresh
bolt, new key and plenty of red loctite on the bolt and the pulley flange.
It held on fine for the 3 months before a much fresher 1800 became
available. It'll be a bear to dis-assemble when the time comes but the days
are numbered for that crank anyway. YMMV.

If you're worried about the accuracy of the timing you can manually
re-determine TDC using a dowel through the #1 plug hole and mark a new notch
in the pulley.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
