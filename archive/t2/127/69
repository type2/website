Subject: Fw: ticking Engine on full power & dropped valves

Thanks, I'll takje a look.

I hope it hasn't dropped a valve, because this'll be the second time in a
few thousand miles.

I've noticed a slight oil leak and the oil had got low, so I'm thinking that
the lack of power was
an overheating engine with low oil!

Does anyone know why these 2L engines drop valves so much?
