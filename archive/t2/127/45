Hello all,
Thanks to everyone for the input concerning our "upcoming trip". The =
trip is now completed and everything went off without a hitch. We drove =
our new '78 Westy south out of Denver on 287 to Amarillo and then east =
on I-40 to Memphis and then home on 55/57 to Chicago and 94 to US31 home =
to Michigan. Our new Westy came with lots of extra parts which we didn't =
need and about 50 pounds of books and manuals, which we also didn't =
need. After I go through them, I'll probably unload a few and let you =
all have first crack at 'em. We drove 500 miles the first day, 650 the =
second, 250 the third(spent the day at Graceland/Beale St.), and 550 =
miles on the last day. I can honestly say now that one can drive 500 =
miles per day in their Westy, but I wouldn't recommend it. My shoulders =
are still sore now two daze later. The only problem we had was heat, or =
lack of it. I looked underneath and everything seems to be there, it's =
just not working. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated and =
thanks for all the tips.
