ok! going the other direction building up a 1.8l in out of a 75 bus -
looking at the slot for the woodruff key before installing the crank to the
case makes me wonder if i'm not pissin' in the wind. the slot is kinda
munged up and the key would fit there on the loose side of tight. am i
asking for big, big trouble with timing down the road...   - steve
