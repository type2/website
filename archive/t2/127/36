This distributor has only the advance vacuum diaphragm, so thanks for the
reassurance on the 7.5 BTDC. I am the rebuilder so no warranty :(. I am using a
new VDO gauge and sender. I know this is no guarantee that it is accurate, and
I don't have any spares for comparison. I didn't realize 8 to 10 PSI at idle is
acceptable. The documentation for the pressure sender indicates the contact for
the pressure light closes at 8 PSI, so I guess I'm going to see it blink on at
idle now and then.

During the rebuild I tried to be meticulous on all measurements. All clearances
seemed well within tolerance. Not 100% sure on clearances of the oil pump
though didn't seem worn though. Hardly perceptible backlash on the gears and
end play in tolerance. Is there anything else I should have looked for?

I am thinking about checking the oil pressure relief valve. If the spring is
weak would that cause low pressure at idle? How can I check the strength of the
spring, should it exert x Lbs of pressure when compressed x distance?

Thanks so much for your opinion Doctor Tim,
Tom
