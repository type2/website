 I will no longer listen to "Click and Clack" since they have listed the Bus
 as the 10th worst car of all times.  I've heard them for years spouting the
 same, lame anecdotes about your legs being the first line of defense in a
 crash, too slow, ad nauseum.  Also, spewing crap like that, what else are
 they pawning off as credible information?

 BUS STUFF!!  Soon I will be embarking on swapping all the fuel injection
 stuff from my 79 to my 76.  Are there any parts that are year-specific and
 can't be used?  My thought is to pull the engine from the 79 and leave the
 engine in the 76.  Only because I have only room enough for one engine out
 at a time.

 By the way, I too like using engine braking down an incline.
