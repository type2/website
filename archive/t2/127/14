Thanks Chuck. I think my pump was running (the bus would run, it would =

I've been thinking more and I know what caused my AFM to die. In the =

couple of these blew off one of the large tubes that connects to the =
S-tube. I'm thinking that one of these also damaged something in the AFM. =
That is a lot of air pressure going the wrong way.

Thanks again,
