Subject: Re: [T2] Double relay resistor R1.

Matt
With out opening the relay can, I can only measure the resistor through the 
diode (my diode checks good). As you know resistance measurements thu a 
diode are OK for "less than" values. The measurement with my 3 volt driven 
ohm meter is 20 ohms. So it is less than 20 ohms my guess around 15 ohms.  
As to the wattage put the highest wattage that will fit inside the can but 
at least 1/2 watt.
