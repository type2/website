Subject: Eriba Puck--almost screwed!!


I started to replace the vinyl on our 1969 Eriba Puck--There are just 16
small Phillips screws holding all the vinyl trim--After fighting them for
about 3 days of trying to unscrew them and soaking them with penetrating
oil--just 5 remained on the Puck----- So I decided to drill them out using
my finest .99 cent store assortment of drill bits--no luck--would not even
scratch the head of the screw--So, off to Ace--Lowe's, and Home Depot, for
the hardest 5/64 bit I could find--Titanium and Carbon Steel==Again tried to
drill out the 5 screws  Zip--Nada- Zilch-Nothing  again cannot even scratch
these small Phillips screws that are just hold vinyl trim!--So a friend came
over with a small hand grinder and we put a Big Slot into them and backed
out three of them with a flat blade -  But two of them refused to yield--So
we just ground off the head slapped the vinyl trim over the flattened screw
head a drilled another mounting hole. Question? I know the Germans make good
stuff -- But what could these screws be made of the will Not give up to
Titaninm or Carbon Steel drill bits--?? TWWM, uj
