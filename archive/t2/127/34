Subject: brake drum measurement

Folks,

Still working on the brakes on my 78.  Looks like I'm gonna need some new 
front rotors as they mic out at .440...way under, even tho they look good.

Now, I am worried about the rears...

Has anyone got a clue for me about how to measure the rears with 
common workshop tools?

This is something that I have wondered about for several years now and I 
am ready to figure out how to do it.

The fancy calipers they use at the flaps to do this appear to be  very 
expensive....and no, I don't have a set of calipers that big.

Cheers, dave
