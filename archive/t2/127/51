230F is pretty warm isn't it?

I admit that I'm running a celcius guage & that it goes into the red over 125C, but before I got the Celcius guage, my mechanic, who built the 2.0l I run which has done just over 15,000kms, told me that 220F wasn't a real happy place to be for long engine life & that the engine was only likely to build up that sort of heat on hot days.

What sort of ambient temps are you driving in......80-90F or more?

I'm interested, because my engine seems to be on the edge of the red on long trips, even in temperate weather at speeds between 60 & 70mph, at around 3600rpm.

I never have had problems with oil pressure though, with the exception of cold starts, when the light winks a little until the engine's been running about a minute with generous pumps on the accelerator pedal.

I have noticed that the gearbox crunches in 1st when she's very cold though.

Any hints there?
