Uh, not to start a war or anything, but... "yes you will".  I was having a 
conversation offline with a listmember a couple of days ago who is putting 
a type4 in his home-built aircraft.  He provided me with references to 
others who have done the same.  And of course the type 1 engine is in many 
more.  If you want to bash the type 4, kindly do it on another list.
