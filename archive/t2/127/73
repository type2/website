Subject: Fag Bearings/India

  What's this world coming to. I just received a shipment of FAG wheel
bearings, assorted numbers and was shocked to find that they are also made
in INDIA, in a FAG box at German bearing prices. What's it going to take to
know where our parts are made?.  So out of 10 different numbers this is what
countries they are from, Malaysia, Korea, India, Mexico and believe it or
not, 1 number is from the U S of A.

I will be posting a list soon of bearing numbers and the countries they are
made. This will include FAG, SKF, INA all supposedly German bearings and we
all know that SNA are from France.
