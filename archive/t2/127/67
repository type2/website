Subject: RE: [T2] RE: PopTop Seal--Prices!!


Sorry Ron but your seal is exactly what is offered by McMaster. I have your
seal and have viewed the seal in their catalog and is an exact match, bulb
location and finish are the same, and it is available in non rusting
aluminum clips just like yours. I am happy with your seal although when I
ordered the kit (all three seals) someone forgot to include the flat seal
and it had to be re-shipped. No big deal as I am never in a hurry for these
things. I have always been satisfied with Bus Depot's parts and service,
and recommend you all the time to friends, so don't take this e-mail the
wrong way.

Yes, many VW parts suppliers sell "off the shelf" weatherstrip as poptop
seal.  But not us. Our poptop seal is custom made to my specs, and is not
available from McMaster Car or anybody else.  It is specifically designed
for the application, not generic.

There are small but important differences between off-the-shelf
weatherstrip
and our poptop seal. Such as the bulb location. Ours is correctly located
near the lower part of the seal, in the same location as the lip on the
original Westfalia seal, so that it seals as well as the stock seal did.
The
generic seal has a higher bulb location than either the OEM seal or ours.
Also (although perhaps less importantly), our seal has a smoother finish,
cosmetically closer to stock than the textured finish on the generic
weatherstrips.

I could make more profit selling an off-the-shelf weatherstrip as poptop
seal, like some other vendors do, but I feel that the difference in quality
is worth the added cost and effort of using a specially designed seal.
Since these don't rust out like the originals, the replacement seal you
install will probably be your last.  So it's worth using the best one,
especially given that in this case even the best is very inexpensive.
