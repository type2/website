Subject: Re: [T2] Tie Rods - Tips and Request for Tips

I work with suerglue a lot in makling MUTS, a support for wind instruments
for players with bad wrists or thumbs. - consider a clean to clean interface
that you apply superglue to, then do the hammer or clamp thing to pull it
together.  For a clamp, I envision a piece of 2x4 you notch out for the bolt
end of the tie rod end, then use a sliding clamp (Ace hardware, a foot long
one will do) to tighten it  together.  If you must separate this in the
future, superglue WILL GIVE if you heat it up to around or below below
soldering temperature.  MB
