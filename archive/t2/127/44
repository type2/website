Not on my new engine, thank you very much.

Is this the same engine you broke in about three weeks ago ?
At that time you had 65 psi start-up and 30 psi HIOP.
That would indicate good pump, pressure and relief valves.
So what has changed ? 20 miles later, bad pressure.
( 50 psi for 1/2 second means the pump works,
and probably the relief and pressure valves as well. )
I would be looking at bearings. Drain the oil and look for stuff.
Check the screen and oil filter. Was this a previously damaged engine ?
Did you get a new oil cooler ?
