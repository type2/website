Subject: Was First it got hot

I'm a little less worried now about no power in second gear. Found out I
wasn't getting it into 2nd gear. It was going into 4th! The linkage is
so sloppy I really have to pull the shifter HARD to the left and back to
get it into 2nd gear. Sounds like new bushings to me. (I hope that's
all).

Still worried about oil pressure though. Took it out for a 12 mile run
to try to get it broke in this evning. As long as I hit all 4 gears when
accelerating it had reasonable power. Oil temp got up around 200 degrees
while driving on moderately hilly road at 50 to 55 mph. As long as revs
were up oil pressure stayed around 20 to 25. but when I slowed down or
stopped the pressure would drop and wink the oil light. I have a VDO
pressure sender and gauge. I think the light contact closes at 8 psi.
I'm using Valvoline 30 wt oil. While rebuilding the engine I was
meticulous about checking all clearances. Everything seemed well within
specs. I am wondering about the oil pump though. I did my best to check
the clearance on it but to be honest I don't know if I did it right. But
I don't know what to think. When I first start the cold engine I get
about 50 psi within about 1/2 second of cranking. As the temps climb to
the operating range the pressure drops. Do you think 40 wt. is worth a
try? Should I buy a new oil pump? Don't know, Please help. I don't want
to fry this engine before it is broke in.
