I've used McMaster's Adhesive-Back Damping Sheets (part # 9709T21) in =
both my bus and in my old Saab 95 with amazing results.    In my bus =
(maybe yours) the front door skins had separated from the internal =
framework resulting in what was effectively a large vibrating drum.  =
These sheets made a HUGE difference in reducing the general noise level =
in the bus.  It's very similar to Dynamat or some of the other sound =
damping materials that are available.  I believe this is similar to the =
Q-Pads mentioned in the Bulley Hewitt page.  The shipping is really =
expensive but even so, the overall cost is still way less than any other =
product.  If you do a search on "sound damping" you will find a great =
article on noise control and sound insulation.  Also I believe somewhere =
in the archives there was talk of using a large clear vinyl sheet to =
separate the cockpit from the rest of the bus so that the heat could =
warm the space better.  They have the stuff like what you see covering =
the large roll up doors at the Home Depot.
