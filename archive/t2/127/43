Subject: Re: [T2] brake drum measurement


Dave

Don't laugh. I use a HARBOR FREIGHT 6" dial caliper to get a relative
measurement by extending the caliper tail to one side with the head on the 
other side. If you have a new comparison drum you can get the delta (wear) 
off the dial. Or the delta off a edge ridge that is not worn.
