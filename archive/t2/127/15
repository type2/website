Well I've just got back after an eventful trip from the Brecon =
Beacons,Wales.

The problem is that after the engine gets warmed up, I here a ticking =
noise from the engine bay - normally with the accelerator hard down.
Back to low revs again, the engine is fine.

Just hobbled back home for the last few miles at no more than 15 MPH =
with little power.

I bought the van when a dropped valve had just been repaired.

Could it be a leaking head gasket?

It's a 1980 2L flat engine.

Any  help would be much appreciated.

Dave, South wales
