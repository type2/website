Hello all,
Thanks to everyone for the input concerning our "upcoming trip". The trip is
now completed and everything went off without a hitch. We drove our new '78
Westy south out of Denver on 287 to Amarillo and then east on I-40 to
Memphis and then home on 55/57 to Chicago and 94 to US31 home to Michigan.
Our new Westy came with lots of extra parts which we didn't need and about
50 pounds of books and manuals, which we also didn't need. After I go
through them, I'll probably unload a few and let you all have first crack at
'em. We drove 500 miles the first day, 650 the second, 250 the third(spent
the day at Graceland/Beale St.), and 550 miles on the last day. I can
honestly say now that one can drive 500 miles per day in their Westy, but I
wouldn't recommend it. My shoulders are still sore now two daze later. The
only problem we had was heat, or lack of it. I looked underneath and
everything seems to be there, it's just not working. Any suggestions would
be greatly appreciated and thanks for all the tips.
Richard
'78 Westy (newly christened 'Elvis')
