Subject: Re: [T2] Fag Bearings/India

Verified a few weeks ago that Porsche is supplying Japanese bearings as 
original equipment. I have seen many Bosch parts manufactured in Spain as 
well. I am looking over this stuff with a high powered hand glass and so 
far have seen nothing detracting from the standpoint of quality. Parts from 
new manufacturing in 3rd world countries has increased tremendously in the 
last few years. My impression so far is the parts are meeting German 
inspection specs. I have had no incidence of a functional problem with any 
of these parts thus far, except for the trashy ext. door latch handles for 
Rabbit etal. The original German items lasted 10-20 years. The new stuff 
fails typically in 2 years.
