Subject: Re: [T2] braking with your engine?

Depends on when the 76 was built. The FI is totally different on buses built
up to the end of 12/75. 1/76 and up is the same to the end of 78. 79 makes a
difference between Fed and Cal versions.
Pull the plug off the 76 air flow meter and count the terminals. 12/75 and
back = 6 terminals    1/76 and up = 7 terminals
The ECU's are different for each year, 4 were made per year. One for Cal
version manual trans, one for Cal version auto trans, one for Fed version
manual trans, one for Fed version auto trans.
This only applies to USA buses....
