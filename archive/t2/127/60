Subject: Oil pressure adjuster - opinions?

I was talking my FLAPS dude about the low oil pressure in my '65 1500 and he suggested I try one of those gizmos that goes into the pressure relief location under 
the engine -- it lets you adjust the pressure rather than relying on a pre-set spring compression.  IIRC, these gizmos have been around for years -- I seem to recall 
one that went by the trade name "press-a-just" or something like that.

Snake oil?  Boon to mankind?  At $6, seems worth investigating before I replace the oil pump.  Opinions appreciated.
