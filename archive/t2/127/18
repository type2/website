Karl is talking about a situation I made a small webpage for..
http://www.globalserve.net/~jrivers/aux-batt.htm

It is interesting to learn the Westy has that black wire  ... 

I personally use the coil connection to connect my aux battery, but It is
connected to the main battery with a small gauge wire approx #12,,, this limits
[impedes] the current path to the aux battery, and allows most of the current to
go to the starter,,, so it works ... but if your aux battery is wired to the
relay/charging/main battery with a large gauge wire,, you should use that wire
that Karl refers to as shown in my diagram.. it is the same way Vw connected the
aux fan blower relay for the heater in the 74 era Bay,, so that the relay will
not close till the alt output is up to about 8 volts,, [depending on the coil
relay as a 12 volt relay coil usually cuts in about 8 volts]

On Battery selection,, get a battery with the CCA you need,, and lots of
reserve,, 400 CCA ,, group 24, rings a bell?  I know that is in the archives,, 
no need to have 1000 CCA and no reserve..
