Subject: westy stool

Well there I am being dragged from one thrift and antique store to the next
and loathing every minute of it, all the while trying to pretend to enjoy it
so as not to cause the so to find an attitude, when we drive up to an out of
the way salvation army store. Sitting outside the front door is some kind of
stool. Can't be I think as I run up to it. Ugly, orange plaid fabric, turn
it over and sure enough, made by westfalia. So now we own a perfect
condition westy stool, not even a rip in the fabric. Silly girl asked me why
I insisted on carrying it in the store. I could almost start to like
antiquing. =8- )
