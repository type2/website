Subject: Everybus Carabus From N. Virginia

Wow, Here it is, almost April 1st, and Everybus 2002 is just a few weeks =
away! As in years past, I guess a good place to meet will be the Sheetz =
gas station in Opal, Virginia, right on Route 29. We (and I'm not sure =
yet exactly how many or who "we" will consist of) will be leaving my =
place in Round Hill Virginia (zip code 20141, Loudoun County, in case =
you want to find it on Mapquest. Believe it or not, there are two towns =
named Round Hill in Virginia) between 8-10 AM Friday. We will nail down =
a more specific time as the date gets closer. From the Sheetz in Opal it =
is straight shot down 29 to Greensboro. If anyone needs help with =
directions or a place to camp Thursday night, let me know.    Jeff
