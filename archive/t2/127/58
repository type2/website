David,

It wasn't a bash at all.

Just my observations, they can be taken as they are,
my opinion, nothing more.  About the experimental
aircraft having the type 4, I will tell you, I am
scared to drive one down the road because of it
spontaneously disintegrating, I wouldn't want to trust
it several hunderd feet in the air.  Neat to hear that
some trust it enough.  I agree, type 1's are more
bulletproof than type 4's, more so than the ea-81, but
then there is the power issue.

Kindest Regards,

Mark
