Subject: GEX Engine (2)

Ref. the earlier post I made regarding the bus that my friend bought.

Forgot to mention something found:

The engine is a 1600 DP engine with the generator mount plate that bolts to 
the fan shroud being the one designed for the longer bus generator.

GEX (I presume) installed the shorter style generator.

Hence ............. The pulleys do not line up.

He will have to:
Change out the mounting plate so as to accommodate and align his installed 
shorter generator,
or
Install a proper and longer bus generator,
or
Plan to keep a stock of pulley belts always on hand.

This sort of wrong component installation should not occur.
Makes me worry about the mileage future.
