I agree under most circumstances, but it would be prudent to *not* use 
engine braking in low-traction situations such as rain and snow.  Engine 
braking means less traction at the rear wheels, and if the rear wheels 
break free the vehicle will spin.  Been there, done that, came way too 
close to losing my life.

Those who say they've never had a problem with brake fade in their bus just 
haven't been on any really steep grades.  I don't think the Smokey 
mountains qualify.  I experienced brake fade descending from a ski resort 
in Utah a couple of years ago.  The bus would accelerate to above redline 
when I lifted off of the brakes, even in first gear.  I basically had to 
ride the brakes the whole 10 miles or so down the hill, lifting only 
briefly until high rpms forced me to get back on the brakes.  I stopped 
once to let the brakes cool.  I've been on other roads like that in the 
Sierras and the Rockies.  2nd gear going up, brake fade going down.
