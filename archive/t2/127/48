This is the same engine! Had great pressures on 20 minute run in at high
rpms. Changed the oil immediately after this run and only saw faint
metallic sheen in the bottom of the oil drain pan. Did not see low
pressures until I got it out on the road for a few miles. I do plan on
changing the oil as soon as I can get to the FLAPS. Don't plan on putting
any more miles on 'til I change the oil. Not my daily driver. This engine
did have a bad head. Everything in the case checked out great though. That
50 psi gets generated within 1/2 second or so from when the engine starts
cranking. Once it is running for a few minutes the pressure slowly drops as
the temps rise. If I let it idle around 900 rpm the pressure will generally
get as low as 8~10 PSI at around 200 to 210 Deg F. Not the way I like it!
No new oil cooler but I cleaned it inside and out and pressure tested it.
No detectable leaks yet.
