Too many unfamilar with the facts think that because you can swap some VW 
parts and get a way with it, you can mix and match any assemblage of parts 
that might be at hand. Afterall, VW's are supposed to be cheap, so whatever 
process is cheapest is OK. That's the way GEX assembles engines and is why 
there are so many short milage problems with them.
