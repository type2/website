You have to set up an account and have a salesman come to you. I did  
this about two years ago.

Be advised that the salesman are assigned regions and if you aren't  
going to provide a lot of business they might not bother. In that  
case you might have better luck making friends with a vw foreign shop  
that does a lot of business with Wurth and see if they will add to  
their monthly order for you.
