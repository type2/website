Thanks Greg. looks like Greg is right.  pulled the plug wires starting with
3, she died, 4, she died, 2, she died, 1, bumpbumpbumpBA, no change.  pulled
plug #1 and put in a new one.  no change.  switched plug wires around. no
change.  switched injector electircal leads.  no change.  guess the next
step is pull the injector(s) and check spray pattern.  funfun.  nothing
better than the hot sun, humid air and gasoline.  yeah.  maybe i'll smoke
and run torn electrical cords through water while i check the spray pattern.

If you have:
tried a new plug on #1
swapped the plug wires on #1
swapped the injector wires from #1 to #2
and #1 is still dead......

Don't bother with the injector spray yet. 

Your next step is to test the compression on #1.....
