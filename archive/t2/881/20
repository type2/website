For whatever reason my bus has this solenoid and uses the extra terminal.

Hi John,

I missed the original post and already deleted it but on my 71 solenoid, the large stud type terminal has the black lead from the battery, a red/white lead going to the ignition switch, and a red lead going to the voltage regulator. The other smaller terminal is a twin spade terminal which has the red/black lead from the ignition switch and another red lead that disappears into a harness. According to the Bentley schematic, this red lead goes to a test connector which my bus no longer has or never had to start with. Let us know what you find.
