 Please verify that it does not emit black smoke when
shaking. If it does, it's rich and can be a couple
things. If it doesn't then Don's reply is likely - a
vacuum leak.

When checking for vacuum leaks - be aware that the
hoses are old and brittle and commonly get dislodged
by hitting a bump hard like a railroad crossing.
Usually one of the big hoses comes loose from the "S"
hose but just hangs there, looking like it's still
snugly attached. Take hold of each and every vacuum
hose in fact, every hose that doesn't have a clamp on
it, and physically confirm that it is plugged into
where it's supposed to. There are a couple just ahead
of the crankcase breather that get buried and they
need checking also. Those particular hoses have a
tendency to crumble from heat/age. If a vacuum leak,
it's a small one.

If black smoke - CHT sensor just ahead of #3 injector
should have about 2400 ohms resistance at somewhere
around 70 degrees. Just unplug the wire (Carefully!)
and test lead attaches to wire, other to ground.
If you have 2300 - 2500, you're okay. Outside of that,
if it has more resistance, it's the likely cause.
