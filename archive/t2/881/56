Subject: Re: [T2] Need generator help.

You might check and make sure the brushes are all the way down. Sometimes  
they get cocked and don't make the connection. Also if you removed the nuts off  
the top for the connectors the wires that connects to them sometimes break. 
So  make sure the brushes are all the way inserted in to holders and make sure 
the  wire that goes to the terminals are connected. You can shine a flash 
light in  there and see these are on the inside of generator but, you can see them 
through  the lagre slotted holes. Otherwise make sure that the fuse is good. 
and the  connectors to the regulator are good. Hope this makes sense.
 
Hope that helps.
