Subject: Re: [T2] heater box removal

The 411\412 had "type4" motors and they had heater boxes that did not have
the fins like the buses do...if you strip the sheilding off the 411 heater
boxes you are left with a the J-tubes you are looking for, complete with
flanges...

I have a pair on my '77 Sunroof bus....

Trouble is finding a pair...
