It sounds to me like you have a vacuum leak. Small enough that it smooths
out under load, but at idle you can feel it.

Check out Richard's page here:

Use one of the several methods to detect the leak: Carb cleaner (I don't
like this around rubber), water squirt bottle, and my favorite, an unlit
propane torch. Don't smoke!!! ;-)
