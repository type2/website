Subject: Re: [T2] right rear wheel stuck

It seems that Ray guessed right.  While waiting for responses (my sons
impatience got the better of me, and we went outside), I pulled the
drum off the hub and the binding stopped.  Hmm... Cleaned everything,
lightly scrubbed the drum, adjusted the brakes way out and popped the
drum back on.  Wheel turns without binding.  Hazah!  I still have to
adjust the brakes, but I was able to get the bus off the street tonight
at least.  Weird how a drum could bind in a few days without a
significant change in the weather to account for it.  I'll be looking
at it more thoroughly tomorrow, and I think I'll pull the drum on the
other side while I'm at it.  Can't be too careful. Besides, how else
would I spend a Sunday afternoon? hehehe...
