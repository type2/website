I'm sorry my memory isn't more perfect, as it's been
several years since I've done a similar stunt... It
seems to me, though, that the nut attaches to a stud
that you should be able to grab with vice grips and
simply unscrew. Replace it with a new stud, put a drop
of Loctite on the upper part before installing, let it
set if you have that luxury of time, then reassemble
using four hundred lb/feet of torque this time ;o). I
hope I'm right cuz I think it's an easy fix! -BaH
