Subject: Re: [T2] tubing to carry away exhaust gases

Hello Jack,

    Sorry I'm so late answering this I have been out of town.
    I offer an Garage Exhaust Evacuation Kit. It is complete with all needed
parts to carry exhaust gas's from the car to a wall outlet. The kit fits
either single or dual exhaust cars or trucks, with up to a 3 inch exhaust
pipe. I have one customer that even uses it in a motor cycle shop. These are
great for winter time use as well as for rainy days when you need to close
the doors and still run an engine.
    The hoses are crush proof, I have run over them from time to time, and
they snap right back into shape. They store easily, I use large hardware
store hooks and just hang them from the wall.

The kit includes the following:
2) 4 ft X 3 inch high heat hoses
1) 6 ft X 3 inch high heat hose
1) Y - high heat connector
2) F - 300 high heat Adapters
1) - high heat splice connector

The price is $250.00 plus $8.00 shipping anywhere is the lower 48.

    If anyone is interested, contact me off list, (-at-)
