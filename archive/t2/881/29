Subject: Complete set of beltline trim available, '72-'79

Hello folks,

I decided to eliminate the beltline trim on my restoration project  
and it is available to anyone who wants it.  I listed it on thesamba  
for $250 (ad # 320946).  In the interest of the preservation of  
capitalism, I think that I should sell it for a reasonable amount.  A  
new set is available at CIP1 for US $399.95.

If I were to use this set, I would have them powder coated.  My  
powder coater has a bunch of colors, including shiny silver.  That's  
a finish that would last a while.

Since the set is complete, I will only sell it as a set.

I also have about 1/2 of the clips that will be needed.  More are  
available from our vendors.

It fit a '72 and will fit a '72-'79, apparently.

Bob H.
