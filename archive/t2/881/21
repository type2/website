After reading Bill's message, I have a very slight
shadow of doubt about the colors I stated, but not
about how to solve your problem. If you hook your
continuity tester to the 3rd spade terminal on your
old solenoid, you'll see it is a direct connection to
the big starter terminal and is live when the starter
terminal is live - only. -BaH
