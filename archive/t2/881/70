Testing compression is actually one of the primary
diagnostic steps. It was wishful thinking on the part
of myself and others to suggest the easy stuff like
vacuum lines. That we would have done without
hesitation. The next step is compression testing and
is one of the easiest tests a novice can do, but
requires a small investment in a compression gauge -
for our use, one with a hose-type connection works
best. Mine is a Sears Craftsman and has given me good
service for probably twenty+ years.

If you want to get a gauge and learn to do the test,
we all will be happy to direct you. On the other hand,
what we expect you will discover is going to require
more tools and more knowledge. The step after the
compression check indicates low-to-no compression on
that cylinder is to remove the valve cover and inspect
the rockers that push the valves in.

If you are not going to be able to do the
follow-through after the compression check, then you
likely need to find someone who can do all of it for
you.

If you had tools you could pull the spark plug out and
see if there's a whoosh of air when somebody else
turns the engine over (with coil disabled so it won't
start and won't cause spark where there could be fuel
to ignite!)

The compression test checks how much compression force
is generated by the piston moving up and down in 4 or
5  cycles. What can be learned from this is piston and
piston ring condition, valve condition and overall
relative condition of the four cylinders. It can also
detect cracked heads, but that's in the advanced
section! If there is no compression, there is either a
massive hole somewhere that it's not s'posed to be or
the valves are not opening or not closing or both when
they are s'posed to (basically!)

Doing a spray pattern test is going to require some
disassembly of the high pressure fuel lines (fuel
rail) and to be quite frank, improper maintenance /
service of the fuel rail is probably responsible for
the loss of 99% of late buses that go up in smoke! If
you had the capability and knowledge required you
could swap the two injectors around, but to me that is
just about the last thing I want to do with the engine
in the vehicle. -BaH
