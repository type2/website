	From the difficulties finding RIPO in the HQ nation of the 
mfr, Altex Devoe, I infer their NZ subsidiary has been allowed some 
autonomy in development & deployment of this excellent product and 
the parent corporation has not absorbed the experience and begun 
making RIPO.
	If that is so, I can only suggest that those with any 
influence in the USA get onto Altex Devoe HQ and hammer the drongos. 
They should manufacture it (and it would likely be very profitable).
