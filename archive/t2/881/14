Subject: designing a colour scheme

	For any who've not seen it,
http://www.busselecta.com/bus/
  is a real help in designing a colour scheme!

You might think the drawings could be useful for other purposes too; 
but I fail to save any when I try.

Concepts for suspension modification on this page are overly 
influenced by Hollywood ;  ignore, except perhaps for the first one 
-  how easy is that to do, for those who can forego that much ground 
clearance?
