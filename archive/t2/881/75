Subject: Paint question

Hi All, 

Had an "incident" yesterday.  On my way to rent some movies, my bus got
shot.  Group of stupid idiot kids (11-13 years old, about 6 of 'em) shot
my bus with a  high-powered BB gun.  I called the cops.   The deputy at
once realized that the bus is a classic, that it's collectible, and that
it's in damn fine shape for a 28 year old vehicle.  

Long story short, the kid confessed, the gun was impounded and tagged
for destruction (to be crushed), and the kid's older sister (the mother
can't speak English) agreed they would pay for the repair work.  

The dent is no big deal.  A light touch of bondo (ugh) will fix it, or
it could be dollied out against a brass block.  

But the real pain-in-the-nether-regions is the paint.  The PO had the
bus painted a few years back, red, and I'm sure it's faded from it's
original shade.  And I refuse to have a big blotch of mis-matched color
on the sliding door of my bus.  I'm anal about that.  The bus isn't
perfect, but I despise to have *another* imperfection introduced.

This afternoon I'll consult my neighbor (body work guy) as to who does
quality paint work and can match the color so I won't see the
difference.  

Freakin' stupid idiot kids.  I wasn't stupid enough to do that when I
was a kid. I knew better.  But if I *Had* been dumb enough to do it, I
know beyond a shadow of a doubt my dad would have taken off his belt and
worked my butt over so much it'd sting for a week and I'd eat standing
up for a month.
