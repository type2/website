Subject: Re: [T2] Weird starter solenoid

Im just gonna have to go get dirty tommorrow and see if I cant figure out
what that wire goes to.If anyone knows or has a bus with the third terminal
on there solenoid could crawl under and check the right and left terminals
with a voltmeter while starting, running and when in the off posistion,then
I would know if I could just move that extra wire over to the other side.
