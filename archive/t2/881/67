Karl and everyone else,

forgive my ignorance,  why would i want to test compression?  couldn't the
injector just be bad, i hope, ihope that's all it is.  the plug electrode
was dry when i pulled it.  wouldn't this indicate no fuel being sprayed into
the chamber?  this speculation is mostly wishful on my part since i have no
tools with which to test the compression and can't afford a mechanic
presently.  anyway, thanks for your time and knowlegde.
