Subject: Re: [T2] New Carb Question

A follow up on the carb issue. I swapped the three jets out of my
working (but leaking) carb and put them into the newly rebuilt carb I
recently acquired. Same issue, idles very well with the choke closed
but once she warms up and the choke fully opens she dies. I did notice
the jets in the rebuilt carb seemed surprisingly worn.

The ad:
http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=64882

seems to imply that the jets would be replaced:

"All the individual brass pieces are cleaned and polished. We then
rebuild the carb using a high quality Solex specific rebuild kit
replacing the seals, gaskets, jets and washers"

I guess in this case "replacement" of the jets simply means
reinstalling heavily worn parts.

Sigh...

Any carb experts want to make a hypothesis on why this carb works fine
until the choke is fully open? All potential solutions welcome.

Well on the plus side I've got carb removal and reinstallation down to
a 5 minute science.
