Subject: refitting the fan housing end oil seal 

Hi volks,

Here is my problem , it looks like  my leak comes from the oil seal 
behind the cooling fan hub (Hayne call that seal "fan housing end oil 
seal and T. wilson call it crankshaft oil seal). In between this oil 
seal and the cooling fan hub , there is a O ring with No name (bentley 
and others) which look like the culprit guy for my big leak which spraid 
every where trough the fan  . Here are my questions.

1) Whats the name of this O ring ?  Where I can buy it ? do I need it ? 
( this last question seems to be a stupid , but some manual do no 
mention that O ring)
2) I assume that the oil seal and this uname O ring is responsible of 
the oil leak, Type2 archives ( Yes I went there !!! ), mention 2 main 
problems of oil leak blow by the fan , oil cooler seal and deep stick !! 
how often my leak type occurs ?
3) I want to change the O ring and oil seal without removing the engine. 
It looks like I can do so just by removing the fan , than the hub,  than 
replace the seal without removing the cooling fan housing , cover plates 
, exhaust .... Do I miss something ? what is the best way to do it ?
4) Well  I plan to check/test the seal by running the engine for a sort 
period of time without the fan ( with just the cooling fan hub on !!! ), 
can I do that  ? I don't see why not as long as the engine is not 
overheating, but who knows !!!
5) In the even that this crankshaft oil seal (and O ring) is not 
responsible for my leak but the oil cooler seals are, what would be the 
sequence of event to change them.

Sorry for all those questions, I need to get my vanagon camper 83 ready 
for yellow-stone ! :-))))

Thanks for any help.
