Subject: Vanagon A/C parts

I have a Vanagon CV engine installed in my '72 Bus.  I am installing some A/C, I'm in Florida, to be cooler this summer.

I am nearing the point where I am going to need some Vanagon hardware to mount my A/C compressor.  I have serveral people looking for me, but everyone is having trouble finding a complete set.

Does anyone have a set they would be willing to part with?
