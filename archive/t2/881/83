Subject: hydraulic lifters, Dell carb set up, and distributors...

Hi all,
I have a low mileage 2.0L engine, that has sat as a long block for, oh, six
or seven years, and I got around to getting it all suited back up and
installed.  I  fired it up and of course, the hydraulic lifters were
deflated and clattering.  I was anticipating this.  I know from before, the
valves were adjusted to 1 1/2 to 2 turns in, and I have not  touched them
since it has been sitting.  I looked thru the archives, and read over
Boston Bob's advice, and it seems the best route to take at this point,
short of pulling and priming them, would be to adjust the valves out to
just touching the lifter, run it for a while, check for soft lifters /
adjust in, etc .... Any thoughts on this?

I am also going to be tuning in a set of Dellorto carbs on this engine.
Once all the lifter noise goes away, I wouldn't think that not having the
valves adjusted in 2 turns would affect getting those set.  Any thoughts on
this?

And lastly, I have the 205S distributor with vacuum advance.  With the Dell
dual carb set up, it seems that I should run a vac line from both carbs to
a tee, and then to the vac can.  The problem is that the 3-4 side carb has
a vac port in the position shown in the Dell carb book I have (shown for
vac adv. dist) , but the 1-2 side carb is plugged in the carb body for that
port.  Any advice on this??

Thanks for all your help, in advance!

Have a great day!

Mark
