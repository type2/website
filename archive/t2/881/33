Subject: Re: [T2] right rear wheel stuck

It may still be your brake that is stuck.  If the retaining pin came loose 
and the brake was dragging, it may have stuck fast.  I have seen where a loosely 
adjusted brake was stuck to the drum and do exactly what you are saying.  I 
would loosen the adjusters and try to pry the brake loose through an inspection 
hole.  First though you should be able to see if the brake is stuck by moving 
the wheel those few degrees and look through the inspection holes and see if 
the brake shoe(s) move too.
