Chris

Here is a picture of the "assembly" 
http://www.globalserve.net/~jrivers/pictures/t4oilsumppickup.jpg

That stud your having trouble with is welded in... you can see the brass 
welding in the picture.. and it also has that ring welded to it... to hold 
the pickup into the case.

Usually,, when *THAT* nut is over torqued... it busts the case as well... 
and to determin that... you have to access the bolt that goes thru that 
ring... put a socket on it.. and try to tighten it slightly.... I suspect 
you will find it appears stripped... as the case boss it threads into will 
be cracked.

If I am not mistaken.. you must disassemble the case completely ,,,, to find 
out the extent of the damage.  If the case is ok, then you can install the 
"assembly" in my picture.


Hope that helps
