Subject: Weird starter solenoid

My starter solenoid recently self destructed.After trying to find a
replacement for several days I have come up empty.The problem...all the
replacement solenoids have two push on connectors on the right side of the
solenoid.(if you hold the terminal end of the solenoid facing you,with the
positive bolt up).Anyway mine has an extra plug on the left side,that gets
used in my bus.Im not sure what it is.The solenoid is a bosch and appears to
be stock if not original.Part #0331 302040-540
Is the signal or voltage coming out of the right side terminal the same as
whats coming from the left?Do i just combine all the wires and have them
plug to the terminals on the right side terminals or do I need to find an
apparently no longer available solenoid?I find it hard to believe that I
have a unique solenoid but no one seems to have heard of this one.Any
answers much appreciated.Thanks
