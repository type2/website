Subject: RE: [T2] CHT gauge testing

I just did some reading on the gauge and it is an ammeter and was expecting
some small current to run through it. I am sure the gauge was already bad, but
I will throw some current through it and see what happens... I have hooked the
wires up both ways in the bus when it was super hot and got nothing.
