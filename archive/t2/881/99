Subject: Crane XR700 location

I'm currently doing some prep for installing my new XR700.
As I mentioned earlier, I was going to attach the unit to
the firewall next to the series resistor. However, after
driving my bus around for awhile, I have realized that this
may not be the best place. I don't know where others have
placed their Crane/Pertronix/CompuFire points replacement
units, but at the firewall, there is a LOT of heat there.
It's almost right above #3 cylinder.  I felt around various
locations in the engine compartment for the least amount
of heat that would be away from water if it was raining.
I even considered a small conduit into the rear hatch
area. One place I did find was appeared to be a good place
was to the left of the engine hatch. This is near the
tail light cluster but closer to the hatch. It would be
out of the way and close to the distributor too. The attach
point is raised, so a small screw would not poke through
the back of the bus. Any problems mounting the unit there?
