Subject: right rear wheel stuck

Yesterday, I went to drive my bus to get my 4yr old from pre-school,
and it wouldn't budge.  Figuring it was the typical rear-brake-stuck
thing, I quick borrowed a neighbors car with a plan to get on it today.
 So, I identified the stuck wheel as the right-rear, but the brake has
nothing to do with it.  The wheel will turn a few degrees forward and
back before stopping.  I can see the axle turn, and when I have my son
step on the brake, I can't turn the wheel at all.  When I turn the
wheel, it stops with a clunk sound, if that helps.  To me, that implied
a CV thing, but it ran fine, without any clunking or clattering noises
just a few days ago.  Besides, the clunk could be getting amplified by
the heat exchangers, seeing that my head is in the wheelwell.

Possibly related: I noted that the pin in the cage holding the shift
mechanism together at the joint nearest the heat "Y" had worked itself
apart, and I fixed that since I last drove it.

I don't need to drive anywhere for a few days, so I have time, just no
way to get parts easily.  I'm more interesting in knowing what's wrong
at this point.  I couldn't find anything other than the stuck-brake
covered in the archives.  I'm sure the fixing of the problem is covered
in Bentley/Muir... or I'll be asking here :)

All ideas welcome.
