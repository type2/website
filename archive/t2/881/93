Subject: Re: [T2] Paint question

<<We have quite a few of those companies around here because of Denver's
wonderful hail storms. How much does something like that cost? It's
beautiful to watch them work. They massage the dents out from the
inside. >>

And with no paint repair needed depending on the kinda dent it is.

I've seen these guys take a basketball sized dent outa a driver's door
of a brand new , off the truck black Pontiac Bonneville.
Black is a tough color to remove everything-- 

Itw as perfect-I looked for an hour at all kinda angles--it was gone.


The price all depends on how deep,  where it is on the vehicle, and how
long it takes to get out.

However you look at it Don, it's a bunch cheaper, and a much better
repair than cavin' and pavin' the dents with bondo.

They take out door dings like they were just brushing their teeth---
