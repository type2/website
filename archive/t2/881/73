Subject: Re: [T2] broken oil strainer bolt?

there does appear to be a proper/consistent amount of space between the 
bottom of the bell at the sump bottom, but there is also a bit of 
up/down play when you touch this bell.

when I changed the oil via this opening last time around I also noticed 
this amount of up/down play, prior to ever taking this off and 
tightening it up (most likely much too far last time around as well.)

I have a list of 4 local shops and my AAA ready to go for tomorrow morning.
If this is what it sounds like, where the bottom part of the case has to 
be replaced, what all am I looking at having done anyway, and any random 
guesses as to the cost involved?

im guessing it's not as costly as a rebuild, but labor-wise its probably 
getting pretty close.

*fingers crossed and I don't even know why*

I dont see any possible favorable outcome at this point, just how 
incredibly effed is it.
