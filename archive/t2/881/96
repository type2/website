Also  Mark offered a solution to use a longer thru bolt,, and JB weld the pan 
in  place.....



hey Guys  What I have noticed on this breakage is that there is always  about 
1/4 inch more threads that the stock bolt doesn't use and is still  remaining 
when this break occurs.. By using a slightly longer bolt it will use  the 
remaining threads. Now you really need to be careful tightening the pan nut  and 
the fact that you do have a full flow oil filter means that you don't really  
need to remove the pan and screen so why not seal it up and leave it alone. 
Now  true the proper fix is to replace or repair the case as Jamie said, but  
sometimes we don't always have the time or money or both for the correct fix so  
we do what we have to do to make it work.  the choice is yours   later  Mark
