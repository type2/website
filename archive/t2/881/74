Hi Jeremiah,

Borrow or rent a compression tester if you can't afford to buy one. 
They aren't all that expensive. The compression test will tell you if 
your problem is with some parts you can't see without a complete 
teardown: Valves, rings, piston and cam.

I put the injector swap ahead of the compression test because it's not 
hard to do and doesn't cost anything. But the compression test should 
be done anyway... it's good benchmark data for the health of your 
engine.

Happy trails,
