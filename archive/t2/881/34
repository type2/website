Unbolt the CV from the wheel end. This will let you inspect the CV, regrease
it, and you can see if it's the bearing... If the wheel turns with the CV
disconnected it's either CVs, or trans. I don't think seeing if the axle
turns will do much because the bearing or CVs could still be binding at that
one spot.
