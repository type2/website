So what can be stopping it? One of the CV joint bolts
backed out far enough that it binds? Possible and a
prime suspect. Does your parking brake work? (Or did
it work prior to this incident? Was it really loose?
One thing that can happen is that the parking brake
mechanism and the regular brake adjustment become
loose and the parking brake mechanism jams against the
heads of the wheel lug bolts. Usually it's just a
clattering heard while turning, but I suppose it could
be a suspect.

I'd check those 6 inner and 6 outer CV joint bolts
first. If that isn't it, maybe pull the outer ones out
and let the axle drop free of the drive flange at the
wheel... See if you can turn the wheel now. Next step
would be to remove the brake drum.

Good luck & let us know what you find! -BaH
