Looks to be bad with even a small amount of voltage and current, so I am
tossing it. I will try to pick up one at a bug show this summer.

Are the mV's produced by the thermocouple large enough that I will be able to
read them with a normal multi meter? I would like to test the sending unit. I
am assuming that it will be almost a dead short with only the wire length
offering resistance if I tested it with an ohm meter?


Thanks,
Corbett
