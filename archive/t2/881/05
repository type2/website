That's what I've been preaching for several years now!
If you're going to install a CHT gauge, it might as
well be one that tells you something!
Aircraft Spruce & Specialty Co. has them for the best
price, so I've heard. The price is about $50 higher
than when I bought mine probably 8 years ago.

When I got mine it came with 48" stainless-wrapped
sensor leads which enabled me to put the connections
on top of the transaxle housing where it stayed warm
in winter and cool in summer.

Take a look at mine in my 2nd album. If you need any
more info, let me know. -BaH
