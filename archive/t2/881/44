Subject: really rough idle, shaking whole bus

well, adjusted the idle and the mixture.  both to no avail.  the stock 75 FI
setup has me confused.  she also sounds like she misses (-at-) idle but she
drives great, the shakes go away and power seems normal when accelerating.
when i come to a stop (-at-) say at stop sign or light the shaking starts again.
guess i'll check the plugs see what they look like.  the cap, rotor, plug
wires, petronix are all new(er), less than a year.
