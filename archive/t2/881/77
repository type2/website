Subject: heater box removal

Who sells pipes that I can replace my heater boxes with? I want to do away
with the stock heater system since I have a gas heater and would like to sell
the heater boxes that I have and just replace them with some kind of pipe
setup. They used to make a J pipe for bugs, do they make a similar setup for
buses?

Thanks,
Corbett
