Subject: Re: [T2] broken oil strainer bolt?

Hey Guys  I have done a temp fix on this problem by getting a bolt  that is a 
1/4 inch longer and putting some jb weld on the threads and be sure to  put 
the copper sealing ring on and re installing it being very careful not to  
tighten too much. Let it sit overnite and then put the oil plate back on   later
