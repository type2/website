Save yourself a bunch of time on the hammer and dollying, save the
Bondo.

Pick up the phone and get Dent Buster's over to the Bus.

They'll work ot the dents perfect --you won't even know they were there. 

A spectrometer at any local body shop supply store will be able to get a
match for the paint perfect if you need to touch up the once dinged
area's.
