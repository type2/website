Just this:

Those are the down pipes from a late bay exhaust. Stock, they point forward.
But they can be flipped around so the flanges are pointing rearward. However
you will have to have a muffler shop fabricate the muffler from there.

Another option is to find some junk 72-74 heat exchangers, remove the shells
and grind off the aluminum fins. The fins are cast onto the steel pipes.
Then you can use stock mufflers if you like.
