Subject: CHT gauge testing

I have a VDO CHT gauge that does not seem to work. I want to verify that the
gauge is working correctly, does anyone know that voltage range that the gauge
is expecting from the temp sensor? Also, any way to very that the temp sensor
under the spark plug is working correctly if the gauge seems fine?

Thanks,
Corbett
