Subject: Re: [T2] Weld in, or slip on inner rocker panels?

I am a bit skeptical about gluing the panels, I am skeptical of  
anyting easy. I am finding the shapes of the replacement body panels  
are not that close of a match to the original, leading to an  
unexpected need for fabrication.  I would expect that the glue in  
panels need to be pretty close to work well.  When you weld, you can  
weld a bit, bang into shape a bit, weld a bit, and so on.  The glue  
ins need to be a near perfect match.

In body shop class, we were shown a movie or two about the glue  
technology, which seems to be a good idea for clean, rust free,  
perfectly matching parts installed under ideal conditions.  Even  
holds up well in a big crash.  But, working on a bus is the  
opposite.  Dirty, nasty, rusty, nothing fitting all that well, 8  
layers of body putty, 10 layers of paint, dents that you did not know  
were there...

Welding is not that hard, but what do I know.  I have lucked out and  
all my welding is being done for me gratis.  I should say, it looks  
easy, and the two parts I welded it have not fallen off yet.
