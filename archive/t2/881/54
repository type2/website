Subject: Need generator help.

HELP my generator light is no.  
I have replaced the brushes on my generator, old ones were pretty crumbly.  
They came out in chunks. Any ideas what caused that?

However the light is still on,  I have replaced the regulator with one I know 
that works and checked the continuity of the wiring to battery, generator, 
and regulator.  Is there ant thing else simple I should check?  I replaced the 
generator the last engine was out (about two months ago). I hate replace it 
AGAIN!

OH, it a 69 with the original type I engine.  

HELP,

Brian Eney
