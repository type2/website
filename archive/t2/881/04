John -

The solenoid of which you speak of originally did not come with the extra
terminal on the left, as it was introduced on the SR15X starters in 1969 for
the manual transmission Bugs, Type 3s and of course the Type 2.  Later on,
as Fuel Injection was introduced on the Type 1 and Type 2 models in 1975,
the starter solenoid was upgraded by VW & Bosch to accomodate any activation
wires that might have been needed when the starter is activated.  The
0332302040 solenoid (sold as Bosch 31 073) from 1975 onwards had this extra
terminal.  If not needed on your application, just ignore it.

Applications for this solenoid:

VW Bug, K Ghia w/Manual Trans 69-79
VW Type 2 w/Manual Trans 69-82
VW Type 3 w/Manual Trans 69-73

Porsche 914 70-75
