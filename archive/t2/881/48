This is a realtively easy fix. Don't worry about it. It's a lesson to pay
extra careful attention to torque values. You'll never make that mistake
again!

That's a stud. You just need to somehow unscrew it from the case. Get
another one from Busted Bus or someone. Get the nut too. Unscrewing it will
be the fun part. But you'll get it.

Do you have a welder?
