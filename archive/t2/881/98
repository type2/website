Subject: Re: [T2] Paint question

Got a good look at the dent in good light today. 

There's about a 1/2" diameter dimple with a BB sized crater right in the
middle (about 1/8" deep).  Looks like there might be some bondo behind
it already.  :/  If it were a simple dent, I wouldn't be too bad off.
But it looks like that small area will have to be worked to do it. 

I'd like to have some surplus paint (that matches the existing paint) so
I can do some touch-up work and some minor repairs that are needed (back
quarter panel sections showing a spot or two of rust, and a tiny bit of
bubbling here and there).  

I don't expect perfection without a total tear down and restoration, but
I want that spot back to the way it was before the incident.  And
probably within 5-8 years, I'll end up stripping the bus down to bare
metal to do all the body work it wants and repaint it all at once.  I
positively hate having the odd primer spots all over the vehicle.
