Nope...  well... unless you want to use an oil pump engine mount adapter....
the normal engine for that bus has 3 drilled bosses on the block that the 
moustache bar bolts to.. and the transmission doesn't have a hanger... so 
without the moustache [rear engine hanger] bar.... the engine and the trans 
doesn't have any thing to hold it up..

a lot of folks frown on the oil pump adapter 
http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=0091480
it has a tendency to loosen up frequently,, creating a huge oil leak... I 
call it the 3 qt flush..
