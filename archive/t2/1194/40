Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injector Hose replacement

Zach, I must have told people at least 20 times how to do it, should be well
in the archives, and I'm not the only one, but here goes.
 
First thing
though, Autozone or Advanced (can't recall which) still has new injectors for
about $45.  Asian made, work just fine, used to be Lucas in Sorensen boxes,
still look the same no longer marked Lucas.  Improved nozzle design, modern
injector, comes with new mounting and sealing O-ring.  Chances are yours are
getting long in the tooth pattern wise, maybe leakey, so consider the $180
investment.
 
But hose and clamps are damn cheap.

Buy new set of seal O-rings
and mounting O-rings (Autozone used to have them as well seperate from
injectors, may not now.  If they don't list bus, try listing for '82 air
cooled Vanagon, some GM products also used these injectors and mounts but I
don't recall which.)
 
Remove injector.  Slit across the crimped ferrule with
a hacksaw or better a reinforced cutting wheel on dremel, just through the
ferrule, into the rubber, don't cut down into the barb metal, and you don't
need to get it all the way to the injector body, just close.  Take a set of
good pliers, or better even a set of good side (wire) cutters (dikes), peel
back the ferrule rolling it off toward the injector, it will snap apart, maybe
off.  Remove hose, ferrule if still there will slip off.  Cut EXACTLY same
length of good German FI rated hose.  Put it on with your choice of clamp,
good stainless German from BD is best, but whatever you like, I use good
stainless screw clamps if I got em just the same, just don't overtighten that
style.  Reinstall injector with new seals and mount rings.  Total cost under
$40 with seals, clamps, hose.
 
But again, particularly if running rough, or
if you test spray pattern, or if they drip, or if your ring main pressure
falls too fast in a test, or if it fails an rpm drop symmetry test when you
pull injector wires 1 by 1, I'd really consider popping the $180 if you think
you will have the bus a while.
 
Ooops, I just realized this is a '75 as I
went to delte the excess.  So the injectors are different (although the
mounting stuff is the same.)  Oh well ignore the new injector bit, replace
your hoses as I've detailed.
 
YMMV.
 
John

Subject: [T2] Fuel
Injector Hose replacement
  
I have replaced almost every single fuel line in
my bus over the last two
years, most recently the hose that connects the
injector to the fuel lines
has sprung a leak.

I have done a little digging
around but haven't really found what I am
looking for which is a writeup on
replacing that bit of hose.
