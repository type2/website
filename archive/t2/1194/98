Out here in California the mileage markers are commonly seen on the 
State Highways. The increments are not always even 1/10ths. I seem to 
remember them sometimes in 1/100ths too. However if you measure a mile 
by the markers, they are reported to be be about as accurate as a 
surveyor can make them considering they are stuck into the ground.
