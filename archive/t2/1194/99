Kevin, I have long checked my CR-V speed by digital speedometers I see 
in traffic and on the interstate. Also with the radar trailers the 
police set up to remind drivers to run the speedlimit. I can confirm my 
CR-V speedometer is 3 mph off. It shows 75 mph and the CR-V is running 
72 mph.

My Navigon 7200T GPS confirms the same story so I believe it to be 
accurate.
