I realized that was the wrong part after I posted.  But that's the right
idea.

Yes, they are NLA.
About a year or two ago, someone on the list posted that they found a few
rebuild kits available. They said they bought a couple of them and there was
one or two left.  I asked and I think some others asked where.  He group
posted where he found them so "first come" could get them.  I bought one.  I
don't remember where it was.

I bought it just in case I ever needed it.
