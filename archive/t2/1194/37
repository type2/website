Subject: Re: [T2] stiffening in the NW

her door locks and all are getting quite stiff. Been using a bit of bike
chain oil to keep them lubed but has anyone
> any advice on a bit of maintenance to keep her feeling like a teenager
in these conditions?

Nothing you squrit in the key slot will address this common problem.

The mechanism of the latchs get gunked up after several decades with lint
and dirt and old hard grease.

Pull the whole latch out of the door. Rinse and clean it off with just
mineral spirits. Blow dry, spray it with oil, dab of grease on the heavy
wear parts.

It's the mechanism that puts the heavy load on the key. I've restored many
to perfect function with just this maintenace. All the locks on my 72 are
original and function nominal including the lock cylinders and key.

Clean and lube the mechanism in the door, presto, more decades of function
nominal.
