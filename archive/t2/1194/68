It is interesting how many "hacks" are done on the Vw.... and some folks 
have issues.. and others do not..  but of course we hear a lot more from the 
folks with the failures, than with the folks who had no problems.
I am from the group that sees far more working hacks,, than the few that end 
up making scrap out of precious metals.
I have seen folks who just welded tabs on the existing oil pump cover... 
didn't even take pump cover off to weld the tabs on.... and used a stick 
welder.. very agricultural, but it works .... I have always wanted to write 
a book talking about those type of fixes... side of the road.. mcgiver ... 
some ingenious folks out there!
