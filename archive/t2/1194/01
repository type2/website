I am going to say ..No.... the galley that plug is in doesn't really have 
oil pressure in it... the relief plunger has oil pressure on one side,, and 
spring pressure,, case pressure on the other side... so your new location 
for an oil pressure switch would be on the spring side, and probably measure 
virtually ZERO pressure,,

i think the spin on oil filter adapter for cooler lines might work ...
