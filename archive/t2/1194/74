Don't some Type 3 cases have the 3 threaded bosses for their rear
hanger bar attachment?  I think a case code that would work is U, and
it's stamped on top of the case, instead of on the pedestal area.
You'd have to get one of the block off plates to make it work right.
I've seen some older universal cases in bugs, so hopefully you can
find one of those if you can't find a bus case.
