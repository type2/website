Depending on which "frame" you mean, didn't BD have them NOS some time ago? 
Someone did, just the frames, maybe somebody on samba, only ones I see now
there NOS are in Europe and pricey.  If you are talking about the actual frame
of the glass, a bit of a PITA to transfer glass though (but they do/did sell
the frame and not impossible.)  If you are talking about the outer frame in
the rubber, not as hard to install, couple rivets.  Probably find a nice set
on samba if you wait/look for a couple of months.  Sometimes they are more
salvageable than you think BTW, but admittedly often not.
 
Probably enough
here to make 2 with yours as well:

This one looks
solid as well:

Other thing to consider is deleting them.  I actually prefer to do that on
the slider myself as it always seems to get waggling around to me, though it
is nice to have a couple of them still back there if you actually have rear
passengers in the bus at times.  Regardless you can simply delete them if you
buy a used opposite side glass (should be dirt cheap) and appropriate seal
(should be $40-50) which might be cheaper at times then finding a good vent.
 
And while trying to find one on BD site I saw these (which I've missed) rear
factory SA I presume slider.

Which is
slicker than hell.  If I thought there was a snowballs chance and all of one
getting to AK intact for less than the cost of the window in shipping I'd be
all over one of those.   Though I'm not sure which way it slides, would be
pretty useless in my '77 Westy layout if the back slides forward unless I
wanted closet ventilation... Pricey but would make for some real ventillation
in a passenger bus, particularly if the back slides forward, but either way
would get nice flowthrough going.  I figure you'd be $150+ into a new vent
seal, new vent frame, and new rubber for the adjacent window anyway if you
were replacing all for a full window resto which makes 2x the price not
totally crazy...

I need to replace the metal frames for rear wing windows on slider and rear
drivers side.... Does anyone know where to purcase these?
