Nice picture; the bottom phase is the ethanol with water dissolved in 
it; I do not see 3 phases.  Discussion below it is lively.
As for pure-gas.org, it is self added to like gasbuddy.com.  Many of the 
stations shown cater to people who buy gas for small engines.  Alcohol 
fues are bad for chainsaws, as it's claimed the alcohol washes down the 
needed oil layer leading to wear.
