	check
	Nevertheless the pros & cons of E10 can be objectively 
examined; URLs please.
	One good source happens to be from my part of the world: 
http://www.biofuels.nsw.gov.au/biofuels_faq/e10_fuel_economy presents 
no dire image, and I take FAR more notice of that authoritative 
Australian summary than the rogue Australian's USA TV 'money 
commentatress'.


>Buzzwords = phase separation

	As the proportion of an alcohol (say, ethanol or methanol) 
dissolved in petrol gets increased past 15% the solution becomes more 
& more prone to damage from water, becoming less able to absorb water 
and tending more readily to separate into two phases (a 
water-rich/petrol/alcohol phase and an immiscible 
water-poorer/petrol/alcohol; that raucous harpie on Fox is wrong in 
claiming the phases are pure ethanol and pure petrol).  Carb or FI, 
you will probably get dud running, if you can start  ...  Keeping the 
water out of fuels, and filtering it when it has got in, are highly 
developed methods familiar in essence to diesel users.
	 The E30 alleged by Fox to be on sale (where?) will be much 
more prone to this phase separation.  Increase the E content much 
more than that and you have 'permanent phase separation' even if you 
rigorously exclude water: ethanol is immiscible with petrol in a 
considerable range (depending on temp) until you emerge into the 
sunny uplands of E85 (also displayed by Fox on the ?real pump)  - 
excellent octane, but needs much bigger jets or uprated FI.  The 
Brazilians of course have been running their home-grown T2 on E100 
for years, with CR up to 16:1 I hear.


>http://www.pure-gas.org/ list non alc. stations,

	This site has no author, no 'who are we' info.  It *assumes* 
E10 is bad  -  evidence not referenced.  'Pure-gas' may well be a PR 
front for some rival petrol-additive supplier.  (There are others; 
maybe I'll slip in the MTBE story some Friday.)


>  ethanol impacts performance negatively

	If anything, it improves performance slightly  -  if you tune 
to take advantage of the small increase in octane rating


>, makes you take a hit on mileage,

	yes -  but not a huge hit


>  can cause damage (over time) to various engine related parts

	evidence?


>, is very very destructive to smaller engines, like lawnmowers, tillers, etc

	Tending to dissolve, or at least weaken, some types of fuel 
hoses may be significant with E15  -  I've not heard of such effects 
with E10.  Dissolving the terne metal lining on some fuel tanks is a 
serious defect of M10 (10% methanol) but I've not seen proof of such 
harm from E10.

>{summary of the negative net energy of the corn-to-ethanol racket as

	correct; it's a nasty misuse of land, labour & energy.  But 
ethanol mixed to 10% in petrol (i.e.  E10) is not a terrible fuel. 
It does help to decrease emissions, esp if engines are carefully 
tuned to take full advantage.
	Whether E15 is as bad as Fox's image remains to be seen.
