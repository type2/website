put a temp sensor in the sump at least if the oil fails you will get a 
spike in temps and give you "Some" warning.

not a big deal they are different but not harder. (they are heavier than 
manual though)

so was I are you sure it is for the 003 tranny and not the newer and still 
avaliable parts kit for the 010 tranny

much easier to convert to the 010 later auto tranny.  two major changes 
would need to be done, neither very hard.   the 003 has the shift linkage 
on the left side, facing front while the 010 has the linkage on the right 
side.  you would need to find the NLA very hard to find flex cable for 
the right side (I am working to find acompany that will rebuild the cable 
so don't throw any away)
the other change is much easier, the detents to hold the shift linkage in 
gears are in the shifter in the 003 but inside the tranny on the 010 so 
the detent mechanism would need to be removed from the front shift lever. 
or get a newer one, readily avaliable which almost never wears out.

one other minor change the back up light is activated by the front shifter 
linkage rather than from the rear.  just run a wire to the front for the 
newer shifter. or find a small microswitch to put on the shifter up front.

the 010 tranny is much studier than the 003 but both are pretty reliable, 
make sure you regularly change the tranny fluid and clean the filter under 
the sump.,  Bentley shows you how to do this.

good luck
