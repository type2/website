Subject: Re: [T2] Avoid E-15 gas; issuses of ethanol in gas for our 

I was referring to E-15 gas, not E-10 sold since the 80's.
AAA decries E-15 gas, as do the auto manufactures of current vehicles 
currently made which are not flex-fuel.
The EPA, which doesn't require any fuel station to sell anything in 
particular, admits that E15 should only be used in model year 2001 and 
newer vehicles. In response to the sales approval, the Outdoor Power 
Equipment Institute released a statement calling E15 "dangerous" and 
that it might "destroy or damage generators, chain saws, utility 
vehicles, lawn mowers, boats and marine engines, snowmobiles, 
motorcycles, ATVs, and more." The EPA does not approve using E15 in 
these sorts of devices.

  "Older" car makers warrantees? You mean VW still covers the 71 buses?
  Ethanol isn't good but it's our reality.  This is a non-issue near as I
