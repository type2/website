Hi Tony,
There are a few things I found odd in the video. (1) When he measures
the angle, it's relative to ground level, not relative to the bus's
body; so that strikes me as rather meaningless. (2) He adjusts the
outer end only, the only with 52 splines; so one notch adds about 7
degrees; that's a big adjustment, although it looks like the bus
needed it. (3) He uses anti-seize on the bushing, whereas the VW shop
manual only recommends talcum powder.
Anyway, I'm sending you a scan of the 4 relevant pages per p-mail.
Cheers,
Sami
