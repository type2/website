Subject: rear torsion adjustment...;-(

Found the Volkswagen rear torsion adjustment (parts I & II) on
Youtube...Now before I go and
really screw everything up (or down) I've got a question...In the
second part, when the Southern
gentleman marks the torsion arm and bar with an indelible sharpie at
what looks to be about 12
and 6 o'clock, he then "seems" to only move the 6 o'clock point two
teeth over...My question is
(since I haven't opened the cover yet) do I move the 12 o'clock point
over two teeth too or what...
