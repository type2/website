Hi Volks,

OK, it's official, we're good to go for the 10th Annual True Canadian 
Winter Bus Campout... February 9th, 2013 at Valens Conservation Area in 
Valens Ontario, just north of Hamilton.

The website was just updated with all the pertinent info:

Years gone by, the campout has always been the weekend after Valentines. 
But a couple years ago the provincial government saw fit to give us a 
civic holiday that weekend, and attendance has withered over the past 
few years as a result. I can't really move it to a later date, as the 
weather is too unpredictable in late February, so I have decided that 
we'll have it in early February instead.

Did I mention it's on February 9th?

Valens Ontario is just 90 minutes from the US Border, and you don't have 
to be a Canadian citizen to enjoy TCWBC.

If anyone has any questions, please email and I'll be happy to help out 
any way possible.

Happy Trails,
