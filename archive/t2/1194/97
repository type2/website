Subject: Heater blower motor switch

I need some help on wiring of the heater blower motor switch on a 74 bus.


Actually don't know if it's called a switch or a relay.

I believe I've figured out most of the wires.

Brown/white - Ground from heat lever on dash.

Red - constant power

Black/yellow - power to blower with switch activated.

Blue - this is my question.  I believe it should be switched(ignition
on)power.

If I am correct.  I'm not getting power to that wire, with the ignition on and
off.
Where will that wire originate from?

What am I missing?

Thanks!
Richard Jack
