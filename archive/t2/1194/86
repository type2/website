that would be a "stud" or even "threaded rod"

I can't speak for the t4 pump specificly - but you want to measure the 
diameter of the threaded part of the bolt and the thread pitch. 
bolt/thread gauges are really good for this.

I'll be something like M6x1.0 or M8x1.25 or M8x1.5, or M10x1.25 etc etc

which is "metric, 6mm diameter, 1.0mm thread pitch"

one more important dimension would be overall length in mm.

most of us can ID these by eye eventually - M6x1.0 is the typical 10mm 
head bolts we have everywhere, and the cheese head (big thick flathead 
screwdriver machine screws) screws used for the tinwork.

M8x1.25 are everywhere - exhaust nuts/stud, intake manifolds, carb to 
manifold, etc - almost everywhere you put a 13mm wrench on a nut or bolt.
