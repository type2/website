good hardware stores (ACE and such) still sell graphite lock lube.  that's 
what you actually want in your locks....  not oil or grease.   you can get 
it as a powder or an aerosol with a tiny tube to make it easier to inject 
into the lock...

And a remove, tear down, clean up, reassemble, lube, isn't a bad idea 
either...
