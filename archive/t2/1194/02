wouldn't it be nice if you could just pull out a plug (with and allen key) 
...  but somehow , I doubt the original culprit put a nice plug in there,, 
who knows tho!
I would suspect it was boogered,, leaking oil,, and they just boogered it 
some more!

fingers crossed some degreaser shows up an easy fix!
