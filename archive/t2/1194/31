Subject: Fuel Injector Hose replacement

I have replaced almost every single fuel line in my bus over the last two
years, most recently the hose that connects the injector to the fuel lines
has sprung a leak.

I have done a little digging around but haven't really found what I am
looking for which is a writeup on replacing that bit of hose.

I suspect that it may be as simple as pulling the old bit and putting a new
bit on, but I am curious about the connector on the injector itself and
whether or not I need to be concerned about re-crimping it or putting a
hose clamp on it.

Toying with the idea of just buying a new set of injectors, but not sure I
need to go that far since the bus is running pretty good otherwise.

Thoughts?
