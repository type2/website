A mechanic friend in Reseda, CA in the past month got 4 kits from them
to rebuild a 003 Trans in a customer's Type 3, my buddy Cliff's 73 412
(he has a baker's dozen - everyone's gotta have a hobby) and in a
customer's 73 Bus.  He told me what's REAL hard to find are the Vacuum
Modulators new or good used.  Stuff is drying up.

But that's why I mentioned the link.  Better than NO lead at all. :)
