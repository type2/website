Must be a state thing - never seen'm in ga/fl/sc at least.   At most we 
get stretches of 1 mile mile markers (which do, indeed, usually say mile 
or miles on them...)

the mile markers -are- state specific, since they reflect the state border 
(or begining of road for sections that don't start in a different state) 
for the interstate (south to north, and east to west if I recall 
correctly)


So for I95, mile 0 is down in miami, then at the GA border, then at the SC 
border....
