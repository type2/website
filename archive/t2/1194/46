Subject: '74 rear 'window' and engine cover, 'rubber'

Hi, Happy New Year from Canada!  I want to replace those rubber'gaskets'
between the body metal and latch mechanism, on both the rear lift up glass
door, and the bottom engine compartment door.  Cip, does not list, and I have
lost contact with other VW suppliers in Canada.  There used to be a great VW
guy, in Canada, out towards Ontario, and since I am on Canadas' 'Best Coast",
was wondering if..(a) someone can turn me onto a Canadian site that has those
parts (sorry, 74 Westy), or (b) who else might have same.  I want to get
'closest to VW German as possible, and failing that, I will attempt to
'refurbish' ones I have.
Hug your Bus!
Scoggy
