generally the gps is going to be massively more accurate than the ancient 
VDO in your dash. ;)

4 mph (at what speed? 60ish? it can vary) is about right though for a 
reasonably accurate original though - typically speedos (in the pre 
digital days anyway) are calibrated to read high.  modern cars now tend to 
run spot on w/ a roughly apropos tire though.


4mph is nothing - my old '69 used to show 90 at a calibrated 60mph (and 
somewhere I have the ticket to prove it...).
