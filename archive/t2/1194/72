 From my watch of the video he did the following:

   1) Marked the initial position at 6 o'clock along with an L to note 
"left side"
   2) Moved the plate clockwise two teeth
   3) Marked the new position at 12 o'clock

The markings seem helpful when he removed the plate to check the inner 
bushing to ensure that it went back on correctly.

As he put tension on the spring plate he noticed that it was too much, 
so he released the tension, moved the plate back one tooth and remarked 
the 12 o'clock position.

My take away from the video was that the number of teeth to move depends 
on the strength of the torsion bars, so depending on the condition of 
yours it may or may not be two positions.

I've never done the procedure, just watched the video, so it maybe 
helpful to get other opinions before attempting.

Hope the above was a help,
Elliott
