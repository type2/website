Subject: Fixing Rust

Kevin,
Read your post about fixing the rust on your bus. I just had Randy 
Rollings in Mooresville, NC, 704-658-7654,
  to fix all the rust on mine.
He is excellent and very reasonable. He does this in the evenings so 
it might take a while for him to get to it but mine could not look 
better. Only does rust repair on buses.
He put a thread on The Samba showing the complete process including 
what he started with.

Check him out,
