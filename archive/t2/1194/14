Subject: Avoid E-15 gas; issuses of ethanol in gas for our older

We who have all that rubber and plain steel in our FI lines should notice.
I personally have noticed that E-10 gas (10% ethanol, shoved down our 
throats in winter) results in poor fuel milage.  pure-gas.org list non 
alc. stations, good luck finding one.
This came up on a RV board I am on, mostly for what this gas does to 
generators.  The link explains why all "older car" makers will not honor 
their warantees. Quoting a member response:

    It is difficult to address the ethanol mess without getting into 
politics. But the short part is ethanol, as used in the US and derived 
from corn, is a classic example of politicians selling out the public 
(once again??) in order to send money to favored "interests" under the 
guise of doing something for the environment while pocketing "favors" 
and "campaign contributions". You are correct that ethanol impacts 
performance negatively, makes you take a hit on mileage, can cause 
damage (over time) to various engine related parts, is very very 
destructive to smaller engines, like lawnmowers, tillers, etc and 
overall the impact on the use of energy and the impact on the 
environment is greater in that the chemical and energy cost of growing 
corn and making it into ethanol is greater than if it were not done. 
Oh, did I mention that the mandate also increases the cost of 
corn....which increases the cost of many corn based foods and of course 
the cost of raising livestock, so overall it also makes our food more 
expensive. Yup, and it is basically bad for you car...maybe not so much 
for the newest ones.
