Subject: Re: [T2] solar trickle chargers

I've been thinking about getting one just to keep the batteries topped up,
especially in the colder weather.

 

I installed a battery disconnect in my engine compartments on both VW's.
They are great, and super helpful whenever doing any work on them. It is
real easy to disconnect, and not worry about shorting anything out. 

 

I also use them when I know I'm going to be parking it for a while. The
thing is sometimes I may park it, thinking I'll be driving it again the next
day, but other life events get in the way, and it can go a week or four
without me using it, and the battery is a bit sluggish or sometimes just
dead. 

 

From the couple responses I got, it sounds like they work pretty good-but
only for keeping battery topped off. If I want to run off the grid for
extended periods of time I'll need bigger panels. Maybe I'll try one of
these trickle chargers on one of my VW's and see how much I actually end up
using it.

 

Thanks.
