Subject: Re: [T2] stiffening in the NW

Thanks all for suggestions much appreciated. Looks like a wee job awaits
me, thought it might be the weather but by the sounds of things it might
well be needing a bit of a breakdown and cleaning job.
Keep you posted as to how I get on.

As always many thanks,
Steve
