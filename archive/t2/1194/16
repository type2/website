Ethanol gas has been around for a long time, in Minnesota since the 
late 90's for sure. I came back to the west coast in '03 & as I 
recall we had ethanol in the gas then.
"Older" car makers warrantees? You mean VW still covers the 71 buses?
Ethanol isn't good but it's our reality.  This is a non-issue near as 
I can tell.
