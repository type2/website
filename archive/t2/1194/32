Subject: stiffening in the NW

Hello all,

I recently relocated to Oregon and my 76 bus is feeling a bit old age in
this damp and cold weather as her door locks and all are getting quite
stiff. Been using a bit of bike chain oil to keep them lubed but has anyone
any advice on a bit of maintenance to keep her feeling like a teenager in
these conditions?

Much appreciated and a happy new year to you all.

Steve
