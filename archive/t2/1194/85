Subject: Type IV oil pump o-ring, bolts

Hi All, and Happy New Year.

I'm on the hunt for one or two Type IV oil pump o-rings, VW 021 115 133,
black rubber, 60.8x2mm. Looks like the usual folks (Bus Depot, German
Supply, Aircooled, Easterm Imports) don't have it outside of an engine
gasket kit - anyone have any ideas? Just occurred to me that the early
aircooled vanagons might be the same pump...

I also have one pump with two stripped bolts but is otherwise solid; they
are threaded on both ends. If someone can help me learn the proper terms to
use to search for these (maybe (-at-)Grainger or McMaster-Carr), I would
appreciate the help.

Thanks, Mike
