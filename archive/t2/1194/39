I remember No Quarter.
He and some buddies showed up at the Classic in Irvine, CA when he was 
going hot and heavy on buses. I was running ads in Hot VW's at the 
time and had a pass to their tent for lunch so I invited the Boys to 
join me. Had a nice time. Nice guys.

Workin' on installing my FI.

I recall the strapping of a redux box housing to a tree in order to 
get
enough support behind it to get that backside nut off....so he had a 
split
at some point. ;)   I mostly remember him from the acvw list though.
