Here in the Twin Cities area the mile markers read in tenths, i.e. 4.0, 4.1,
4.2, etc.  They only have whole numbers on mile markers outside the Metro.
If I remember right, Indianapolis is like this, too.

Was writ -  "1/10th? really?  what do they look like?  they definitely don't
say 

 "100.1 miles" anyway"

 

Actually if my memory serves me correctly, they do say 35.0, 35.1 or
something like that. My memory is that they are green, small rectangular
things, about 4' off the ground?, typically on the right side of the
highway.

 

They don't say miles on them.

 

Now that I'm pressed to remember them, I can't remember exactly where I saw
them. I'll be on the lookout next time I'm on the highway.
