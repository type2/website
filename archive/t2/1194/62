Subject: Fuel hose filler

Where can you buy the rubber fuel filler pipe that goes from the gas tank to
the metal pipe on a 74 bus, or is this unavailable like every other
part..............

I found one from vwheritage.com  This is a cool
site......  They have a ton of original parts.  They are in the UK though.
