done a bunch of strange ones but some memorable come to mind.

fixed a broken accel linkage with a pair of vice grips on the throttle 
linkage and a string up thru the hatch and thru the grab handles above the 
window to the front to get me home from upstate NY about 500 miles.

auto tranny linkage broke.
bypassed start lockout.
got underneath and vice grips (don't leave home without em)
used them to put bus in drive.
got in and started it in gear and drove home...
