stiffening in the NW ?

hmmm,, I remember when No Quarter wrote about Fermenting in a vw bus ....... 
where is he now?

well LUBE of course!  The more the merrier! KROWN is good for rustproofing 
too.. if you have that product in your area..

Waxoyl is good too... but not inside the actual tumblers,, just on the other 
moving parts!
