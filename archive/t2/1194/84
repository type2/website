forgot to say:  this means your odo can be dead on (for factory tire 
size), while your speed is way off or a little off.   That '69 of mine was 
pretty close to spot on with the odo (as good as you can get w/o tenth 
digits on the odo using 1 mile mile markers).


Interestingly on the rebuilt and recalibrated unit I got for my '66 from 
OC the speed is only dead on when I'm running my 27x8.5 tires - with stock 
tires it's not.. but with the 27s it matches GPS perfectly at every speed 
(as accurately as you can eyeball when you only have gradations for 5mph 
sections! :)
