Hi Kevin,

 

I'm not sure how accurate GPS units are, but here are some thoughts on ways
to track your speedo and your GPS -

Your speedo runs off a cable from the front tire to the back of the speedo.
If your tire size changes your speedo will be off.

 

While driving on most interstate highways - you should be able to notice
little markers on the side of the road, every 1/10 of a mile. I believe
these are VERY accurate. Try to match these to your odometer (which I
believe is directly linked to your Speedometer). If they don't match-then
you have found your inaccuracy. Not sure if you already know all that or
not.
