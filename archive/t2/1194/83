1/10th? really?  what do they look like?  they definitely don't say "100.1 
miles" anyway. ;)

speedo and odo are not directly coupled - the speedo is driven by a magnet 
in a cup - the odo is driven by a gear.  (which is why you never reset a 
VDO trip odometer while moving!!)

Tons of excellent disassembly pics in here:

and here's an exploded picture.

See where the cable attaches?  then the shaft w/ magnet on the end? 
before the magnet is a black gear..   that drives the odo gear.


speedometer calibration is (I believe) managed generally by tweaking the 
strength of the magnet and tweaking the return spring.  Of course, gum 
dirt and bad bearings on the needle side of the assembly can impact how 
much force is needed to move the needle (causing it to read slow or stick) 
and a weak return spring can cause it to read high.  And it's not always a 
linear change (ie: it might be 4mph high at 60, but only 1 at 10.  and 20 
at 80)...
