From my standpoint as a chemist, if you have incompatible rubbers in
your fuel system, they are going to be damaged whether you run E5 or
E85. Since US regulations require all vehicles to be sold with
compatible rubbers, I would presume that any carb rebuild kits you buy
that have been made since 1990 will have the appropriate materials,
and if your local fuel source has any oxygenation of the fuel at all,
you have been running ethanol, and if your fuel system has been
holding together, you are probably fine. For VW bus owners, the real
problems are shift of the AFR in carburetors and for FI users,
shifting the AFR beyond the range of the systems compensation ability.
