I'll second this.

I installed a Corvair motor in my late bay window. The Transvair kit 
relied on early style mustache bar mounts/brackets.

Easy to install those early style brackets and mounts on a late model 
bus. Just cut them off and then grind out the old frame rail steel. 
Slide them over the late bay frame rail, tweak the fit and then MIG weld 
them in. Paint them to keep the rust away. In my case I bolted them in 
place initially and once I was certain everything fit right, I welded 
them in permanently. All you need is an early model junkyard donor or 
fab your own from raw steel. That would be easy too.

Remember the naturally tendency of the engine is to move downward during 
acceleration (transmission twisting the axles) so those late baywindow 
bellhousing mounts are going to be under alot of stress without a 
moustache bar.
