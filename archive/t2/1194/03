Jamie is this what you had in mind?

The story on this bus is  I got it for free. Very dry rust free bus.
We pulled it out of a field.  I gave it to a friend that pulled the motor and
went through it and
Put new heads and pistons and jugs on it.  He just didn't notice the oil
pressure switch location till after he installed it back in the bus
Engine runs great, and has been driven a few miles like it is.
The oil pressure light never worked.  Doesn't stay on but doesn't light at
all.  Probably bulb.
We traded and I got the bus back.  Now replacing a CV joint and putting on new
boots all the way around
This bus will be my daily driver in a week or two.
I don't want to drive it without the idiot lights working.  Bad plan!

I like the idea of the adapter plate with pressure and temp sensors.  Drilling
out the correct location at a later date.

I like it that it's a auto bus.  First one I've had.  It does make me alittle
nervous cause I don't know anything about auto trannys in a bus.
I know that the 74 auto tranny is a limited unit.  I bought a rebuild kit for
it, just in case it needs it.
If this tranny goes at some point could I easily replace it with a later model
auto tranny?  Or be better to convert to a manual?

Thanks!
