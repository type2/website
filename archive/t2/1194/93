I was suprized as to the cost of posting that many signs along the 
interstate... I didn't mean painted lines..

I used them to clock my GPS and speedometer, odometer..  turns out, my GPS 
and Speedometer are right on the money.. I had to convert miles driven to kM 
shown on the dash.. but over 10, then 100 mile test.. it was correct..
proved  my odometer is out by 1/10th... there is a tooth missing,,
