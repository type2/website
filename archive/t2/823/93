Subject: Re: [T2] POR-15 binstead of underseal

Phil, I've got an original Bosch replacement dizzy for a 356. I looked it up
on the registry and it says it was the factory replacement no. for the
original. Is it worth anything? It's complete and tight, but looks like it's
50 yrs old. :-) Sorta like me.

I did something similar on my old 356 Porsche race car. I took the area
above the engine down to bare metal. I then decided to paint it with a clear
coat so that the rust free condition could be clearly seen and I could
monitor any new rust. It would have been better if I had used POR-15 clear
(I think they offer a clear). One problem would be noise transmission but
not a problem with a race car.
