Funny line last night on The Simpsons.  They  go on an African vacation and the stewardess says, 'Welcome to New  Zamibia.  Wait, (listeneing in earpiece) No, Welcome to Pepsi  Brings You New Zamibia."    Maybe we can one day buy a  "Volkswagen/Anheiser Busch Bring You the New Type 2".  Just a  thought.  KR
