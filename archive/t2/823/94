Subject: 71 tail light bulb holder?

Has anyone replaced the actual bulb holder, not the complete 
reflector? One of the bayonets seems loose, and I thought I'd take it 
out and fix. I'd like to pop in a new bulb holder, but I cant seem to 
find a replacement other than the complete thing ;-((  (although 
Busdepot has a good price for that)

It seems to be held by 4 tabs, and I wondered if they are likely to break.
thanks

John
