Subject: Rare & Extra Seals

I have a set of OEM single-cab treasure chest seals that I found in a box
that came with my DC. Obviously the PO missed that they owned a DC not a SC.
So they are up for grabs for $30 for both or $20 a piece or make me an
offer.

Also anyone have a line on a DC 3rd door seal? Or has anyone found a way to
convert a splitty seal or other type to work? Yet another unobtainable part
for the wayward DC...

Btw y'all can check out the DC progress here
