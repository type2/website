Hey Raymond
long ago you posted what I believe your engine setup was:

72mm stroke and 88mm or
90.5mm with 041 heads and a E-100/110 cam. The stroke will give you the
torque, the cam will keep your the duration in line with your power
requirements and a center mount 32/36 progressive will give you the low and
upper ends for that displacement. If I was you I would keep a vac
distributor on it so that the advance and retard is smooth and even. I 
would
make it a dog house oil cooler and possibly add a slim line sump and 30mm
oil pump.

This was a couple years ago.  How did that engine hold up?  What did you 
encounter as
far as boojums and boogers, or was it as solid as it sounds?  I'm 
planning a build for
my 71 and am thinking along very similar lines.

Thanks in advance
