Hi Volks,

This morning the weather in Toronto was good and the new-fallen snow  
looked inviting, so I packed the camera and set off to get some pics  
of the westy. I was hoping to shoot something worthy of Larry Chase's  
2006 VW calendar:

I did get some nice pics, so  I'll let them tell the rest of the story.
