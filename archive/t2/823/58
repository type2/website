You've got me there.  The BMW rotor *looked* to be the same diameter 
as a Bus, but thicker/vented, so for the diameter there may be some
careful clearancing needed on the caliper .. but I haven't looked into it
much more so I'm really not sure.

The caliper I played with was an ATE, and had spacers between the 
caliper halves because of the thicker rotor.  I *think* removing the spacers 
(& using shorter bolts to hold the halves together) plus reaming out the 
holes would be all that's needed for the calipers.  Dust shield on the rotor 
would need to be modified for clearance as well. 

Of course, uprating the calipers would throw the entire brake balance
out of whack .. I don't wanna touch that can-O-worms.  :-)
