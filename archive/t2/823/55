Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for brake caliper

 How so Jon? I drive motorcycles on the street with crossdrilled AND plain
rotors and I've never noticed any difference and these are in big
performance bikes. What type of performance are you talking about? The only
advantage to crossdrilled rotors is lighter weight, and the ability to "cut"
the brake pads to keep them flat and not groove the rotors as much. They
usually give LESS braking because of the reduced surface area available to
the brake pad, although it would be negligible in our big Type2s. Did I
perhaps miss something on the original post?

FWIW, you can get any rotor cross-drilled through several aftermarket
companies (most are located at the back of Car Magazines like Road & Track
and Automobile). This would make a HUGE difference in performance for a
reasonable price.
