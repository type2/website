Subject: Re: [T2] Did a 71' Westphalia interior come with stove?

From Max:

I have looked through the archives, library, and numerous websites and
cannot find an answer. Did the 71' Westfalia camp interior come with a
stove? If it did, where was it located? I think this has been discussed
before so I apologize, I just cannot find an answer.

A 71 foot long Westfalia would have lots of room for a stove.
[when you put the ' after a number, it means feet]

But a '71 Westfalia, USA model did not.
[the ' abbreviates the 1971 down to '71]

The newest USA model Westfalia that came with a stove was the 1974 deluxe model.

Here is the '70 Campmobile owners manual [same as '71]:

Here is the '73 manual [same as '71, except cloth material]

Here is the 1st of the stoves, '74 deluxe:
