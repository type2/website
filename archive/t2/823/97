Looks like the CQ was called the CS at one point?  Mine say CS but looks
exactly like the CQ on their site.  Unless there is load range difference.

I ended up going with the Nokian Hakkapeliitta CS's on my 78 and in almost
all cases I will drive it before I drive out in icey/snow weather in the
SUV.  A great tire if it can be afforded.
