Don,

First of all(after coffe and morning cig) go back over the spark plug 
wires and make sure they absolutely go where they are supposed to...yes I 
know it sounds dumb, but don't ask me how I know.

Second, the only other thing I can think of is that you have a plugged
main jet(or jets).  Idle circuit will be ok for idle, and accel pump gas 
will cause it to rev up, but if no main jet flow, then no power.

Had this happen before with a piece of half floating rubber that would 
cause total lack of power on the interstate till I pulled over and shut 
the engine off for a little bit....it would get "un-sucked" from the main 
jet so I had power again till it floated around into that spot again.

Made it home, popped the top of the carb off and pulled it out and never 
had the problem again.

Big fat spark means coil ok, just make sure it goes where it is supposed 
to and the timing is where it is supposed to be....since you changed a 
bunch of other stuff.


Cheers, dave
