Subject: Re: [T2] oe tail pipe in seattle?

When my tailpipe got rusty, I took the bus to the stainless exhaust place. 
They cut the flange off the old tailpipe and made a new, larger diameter 
stainless tailpipe with the same bends and hanger for like $25. Stainless is 
forever...

Yeah, the three hole flanged type as indicated in picture 'B' of your link.
  I see it is $14.95 from California import parts (Cip1.com) and the are the 
closest to me: Blaine, Wahington.  I was wondering if anybody has one on the 
shelf locally in the Seattle to Everett area.

    72-74 or the replacement style muffler using the 3 hole flanged tailpipe 
on the right side of the muffler?  Makes a difference.
