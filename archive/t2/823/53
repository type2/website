Subject: POR-15 binstead of underseal

Has anyone ever painted the underside of thier van with POR-15 INSTEAD of
underseal.

I have a dream that one day I strip the bottom of my van of all mechanical
components, snadblast it and then paint on 2 or 3 coats of pale grey POR.
Then I clean and re-attach the bits so it all looks smart. The theory is
that the POR is smoother and so dirt will be easier to clean off than it is
from the rough and rubbery underseal. The greay will make it easier to see
down there and show rust up earlier.

Is this a daft idea ? I fancy trying it on the new half floor pan of my bug
as an experiment and then moving on to the van one day. I wonder about
resistance to stone chips - they should bounce off the underseal because it
is rubbery.
