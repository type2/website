Subject: distributor application

Hello,

There is some really great reference data at:

Distributor Interchange Bosch To VW Number

http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ovhignbo.htm


However, I have in my hand right now, except when I am typing, a distributor
that is not listed on that page.

It is true that people regularly install the incorrect distributors. 

I took this distributor off a 1700 cc (or 1800) Fuel Injected engine of
unknown origin. A friend bought a house and the engine was in the barn.

I swear on Porsche's grave that these are the correct numbers and correct
description from this distributor:

dual vacuum advance/retard ported vacuum tank
internal centrifugal advance mechanism

has fuel injection electrical data link three pronged port labeled 21 12 22

top number is Bosch  0 231 172 007
bottom number is VW    022 905 205E

So what does this distributor really fit?

Thanks

Gary G. Martin
