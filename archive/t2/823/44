Subject: Hankook Tires are back!

A quick note that the well-regarded Hankook RA08 all-season Bus tires are
back in stock, in both 185R14 and 195R14 sizes. (185R14 is recommended.)
All backorders have been shipped, and for once we actually have extra stock
for anyone who needs them!!  Get 'em while you can!  

I wish Hankook would "get it" that they'd sell more Bus tires if only they
would produce more. It's like pulling teeth to get these tires!   I even
talked to the U.S. sales manager at the SEMA auto trade show and he's as
frustrated about it as I am. Someone "upstairs" at Hankook apparantly
decided that VW Bus applications are supposed to be a poor seller in the
U.S., and he adamantly refuses to let the facts interfere with that
conclusion, so I'm lucky if they ship half as many as I order.
