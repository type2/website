Subject: Re: [T2] 78 2.0 transplant into a 74 westy

That is exactly  what happened in my case (early engine/tranny into  
late body) . I could get into first gear only with the knob removed  
from the shifter so that the stick would fit under the dash. Third  
gear was impossible due to the e-brake mechanism.

I bent the shift lever backwards about 10 degrees at the base to  
compensate, and it's worked fine ever since.

Happy trails,
