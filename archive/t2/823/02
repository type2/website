Subject: Re: [T2] Starter won't turn over with key

Tom is right with the wiring being the problem, the
older they get the harder they are to start with the
key, the cure is to replace the wire from the ignition
to the starter with new wire and connectors and you
won't need the hot start switch. The voltage just
can't get there to actavate the solonoid to spin the
starter. If the buses didn't get old we wouldn't have
these problems(Hehehe)Phil
