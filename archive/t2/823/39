Teri Hatcher update:

Teri Hatcher says she "absolutely
did not have a VW van parked in 
her backyard for the sole pur-
pose of hosting orgies..."

From "Jenny's Dish" (local
rag's gossip column) :

"We don't believe it either-
with the money she's mak-
ing, we figure Hatcher isn't
having orgies in anything
less bling than an Escalade."



Tony in NJ (Dear Teri, next time you're 
                  drivin' your VW thru' NJ... 8-)
