Hal, what about rotor clearance etc?  I've been researching some of the
European's solutions to this problem.  They seem to have more options
available, at least according to a book I bought last spring.  Sorry -- I'm
moving, the book is packed away, I don't recall the name although I wrote of
it here at the time.  A 4 piston or even plain old ventilated rotor would be
a huge step up.  Last time I took the Bus down to Pine Creek in north
central Pennsy, the front brakes were smoking on the incline.

I went looking a few months ago, just for gits&shiggles, and
what's available in the aftermarket world for the disc brake
Bays is (apparently) nothing.

OTOH, I was "messing around" at the junkyard and found that
early-to-mid '80s BMW 7 series has a 4-piston caliper that
could bolt to the late Bus spindle if the mounting holes were
opened up.
