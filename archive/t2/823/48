I went looking a few months ago, just for gits&shiggles, and 
what's available in the aftermarket world for the disc brake
Bays is (apparently) nothing.

OTOH, I was "messing around" at the junkyard and found that 
early-to-mid '80s BMW 7 series has a 4-piston caliper that 
could bolt to the late Bus spindle if the mounting holes were
opened up.
