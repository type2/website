> My biggest fear is that the cam gear slipped a couple teeth. Doesn't seem likely, but valve timing would do
what I'm experiencing. Though it should require drastic ignition timing changes, and I've got the 009 set to
9* btdc. And the idle does increase when I advance further.

Remove the 3/4 valve cover. Rotate the engine in the direction of rotation.
Watch the #3 valves. You will see the exhaust open and then close. Just as the exhaust closes the intake will
start to open. Stop turning the engine JUST as the exhaust closes and JUST at the point of the intake opening.
Look at your timing mark. It should be dead on zero.
