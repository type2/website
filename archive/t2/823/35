Subject: this, that, and the other - what a nice day!

I finally got around to removing the fresh air ducts on my doors and 
installing the other armrest on the captains seats I have...

...WOW.  It feels so nice having the other armrest there.  The fresh air 
duct was 3 or 4 inches lower and caused that unbalanced feeling.  
Hopefully I'll be getting new door panels soon and will recover them 
with some black vinyl type stuff.

After a trip to the car wash I tore the kids away from their bike riding 
and made them stand for some pics...

...It was such a nice day here (60 and sunny) I had to take a drive up 
into the foot hills.  No kids, no wife.  Just me and Vassar Clements (RIP).

Another glorious day in bus land.
