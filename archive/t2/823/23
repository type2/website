Subject: Connecting rod sizes?? Type 4

TGIF ! ! !  Time for dumb question number 1:

If I have a 1.7 type 4 engine, could I just open the heads to accept 2.0 
(94mm) Pistons/cylinders and have an improvement in performance??  (I have a 
porsche 914 1.7 engine I want to experiment with)

Would it run at all!!??

I thiink the 2.0 engine's conecting rods are 5.16" and the 1.7/1.8 are 5.00" 
  If true, what would be the impact of the difference in rod lengths to just 
opening the heads and adding the larger P&C??

Thanks.
