Yeah, both chokes are opening. I also verified there was a click on each
solenoid when I pulled the connectors off.

My biggest fear is that the cam gear slipped a couple teeth. Doesn't seem
likely, but valve timing would do what I'm experiencing. Though it should
require drastic ignition timing changes, and I've got the 009 set to 9*
btdc. And the idle does increase when I advance further.

The thing that gets me is the sudden onset. From cruising at 70 on the
freeway to a sudden drop in power (actually a complete loss).

One other thing I didn't do was check head torque. But with decent
compression numbers I doubt it's that bad, though it is possible.

This is actually heading toward a deal breaker for me. I don't have any $$
to tow it anywhere, and it's gonna get towed by the apartments here any day
now (they were supposed to do it on Friday according to the "ticket" I got,
but the wife talked the apartments into giving me this weekend to sort it
out. The reason is dead tags, but I can't smog it if it isn't running!
Arrrgghh!!)

My wife suggested maybe selling the GWB and taking what little $$ I get from
that and putting it into the 71 instead of letting the 71 go to Busted Bus.
I'm half tempted...
