Subject: Bay Window Westy interior into a split window?

Hello all,

I have someone who lives nearby interested in taking the interior of my 
'73 Westy parts bus. (If anyone needs parts, let me know) He wants to 
know if the westy cabinets and seats will fit into his '63 Panel.

I have never owned a splitty, and have only seen a handful in the past 
10 years here on Cape Cod (the rust is killer). No idea what the 
dimensions are. What modifications will he need to make to the bus 
and/or interior pieces to make this work?

Specifically, we're talking about the passenger side cabinet assembly 
that runs from the sliding door back, the rear zbed assembly, the 
ceiling cabinet that resides over the rear zbed(man, I wish my '74 had 
that), the rear hatch cushion and the rear facing seat behind the 
drivers seat.

I just want to make sure that the bay and split are close enough for 
this to work. I dont want to see him install the big cabinet and not be 
able to open his side doors.

thanks all,

Eddie Goodwin
'74 Westy
