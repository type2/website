Subject: Re: [T2] Gold leafing a bus.

I would suggest giving the restoration folks at the Circus World
Museum up in Baraboo Wisconsin a call.  They emphasized the gold
leafing when I was on a tour of their circus wagon restoration area.

Then hit the 'contact' link for phone and email lreferences.

I wonder if electroplating would be a pragmatic gold plating option.
