I'm no expert ... but I'd say $3,800.00 is reasonable. You could pay a lot
less or a lot more ... I'd want to have a look at cars the guy did 10 years
ago ... if they are still looking good then $3,800.00 sounds good to me (my
60 is just about out of the body shop ... bit of metal replaced ... and cost
much more than $3,800 - but I've seen cars he did 10 years ago so ....)

Some folks swear by zinc primer ... lots of folks actually ... other folks
swear by epoxy primer .... my body guy uses self-etching primer ... he
doesn't like epoxy as he says that if you chip it rust can move along under
the prmier .. he says that won't happen with self-etching primer ... I think
I'd prefer the zinc method if you can find the right zinc content ... but at
the end of the day it is probably preparation and application that is the
most important.

Maybe you ought to consider getting the underneath done first ... it would
suck to spend $3,800.00 and then find out you need to replace anything under
there.

Here in Eastern Canada they use tons and tons of salt on the roads .. rusts
out cars very fast  ... We have this company called Krown Rust Proofing (or
something like that) http://www.krown.com/ . They spray oil stuff under cars
and drill holes into panels and shoot in oil ... the 'oil' is some
combination of oil and maybe phosphoric acid and maybe parafin ... and other
stuff - the 'oil' treats rust to turn it black ... gets into cracks and
seams to displace water etc... or so they say ... but for sure the stuff
works ... I went to see a bus in Ottawa last year .. a 71 ... I looked at it
and thought I saw holes in the rockers .. so I went up to look and .. they
were drilled holes .. I guess at that time they drilled holes in the
exterior to shoot in oil .. now the holes would be drilled in places not
visible .. but the 71 was amazing for a Canadian bus ... surface rust .. but
inner outter rockers .. dog legs ..floors .. all totally solid.

Other folks use chain oil ... the oil that you put in a chain saw .. it is
cheap like maybe $8.00 Cdn/gallon and is a mix of oil and parafin and ...
maybe phosphoric acid ... it prevents chain saw chains and bars from
rusting.  I read a couple of write-ups about using it under buses and it
sounded great - I think it would be prety much as effective as the Krown
stuff .. so I got the oil and a thing to spray it with my compressor .. then
I put on some old clothes .. got under my bus (the 60) and sprayed the stuff
everywhere - I'm sure it is very effective - the type 2 library will have an
article http://www.type2.com/library/body/baroil.htm ... but I don't think I
would ever do it again as long as I can afford to have Krown do it ... it's
just too much work and too messy .. from now on I just take my cars to Krown
every fall.
