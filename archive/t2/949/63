Subject: Re: ballast resistors

 >To carry a spare coil for a given VW motor, one must know
whether a ballast resistor is required.  I have good recent Jap 12V
coils which I'm not too purist to use, and some are marked that they
require an external ballast resistor.  On the other hand many Bosch
VW coils include the resistor, one gathers from the archives.

The ignition parts list at OldVolksHome lists the Bosch blue coil as 
suitable for all bays except a few late model with electronic 
ignitions. On Ratwell's site the Bosch blue coil resistance is 3.0 - 
3.4 ohm. So for most bays choose an external resistor to make your 
non-stock coil up to 3 - 3.4 ohm!
