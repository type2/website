Subject: Re: [T2] Gold leafing a bus. 

My dad's bus, first one in north Georgia I'm fairly certain,
got me into this, ahem, vortex of a love affair with busses.
It was a 1963, with a "Texas kit" camper inside.

In any case, it was red.  He had me paint the V in the front
and the raised rim that leads from that all round the bus at
chest height -- you know what I mean -- in metallic brass and
while wet dust it with glass beads like they use on some kinds
of road stripes, etc.  I did an OK job, if I do say so.  It 
did eventually wear off, but it took some years.
