Im not even going to post the recent mileage difference between my bus and
the Durango.  Lead foot or not.  Let's leave it at this, once the BN4 is in
the bus, we'll be driving it more and more often.  The wife has shown
interest in dumping the Durango for a well kept Vanagon Weekender though ;)

Currently reporting a 20+ mpg average though in town on the fresh rebuild.
So far so good.
