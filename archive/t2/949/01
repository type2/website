Greetings!


This morning I took the 87 Westy to make a back-road trip to a local
coffee roaster to pick up a couple of pounds of fresh-roast. While
waiting for the coffee to grind, I noticed the car section of the
Providence Journal sitting on the table. On the front page was an
article about a restored 68 Camper. I snagged the paper and took it  
home.

The article talks about the$10K to $12K restoration of a van that
once belonged to an old friend, and was restored to honor the memory
of the friend, nice sentiment I thought. The owner goes on to say
that he uses it with his kids and when the urge strikes to go surfing
with his buddies!  Cool I thought, honoring a departed friend, having
fun with the camper, etc...

But then, for me the "bubble burst"....after reading all about the
restoration, departed friend, kids, and other stuff I read the
following: "He said he's only put on about 6,000 miles in the last
four years....'Now it's nice and clean and it's a great day trip
truck'.....he often takes his kids to the beach in the summer...."

Maybe I'm wrong, but 1,500 miles a year as a day trip
truck??  Gag!  I feel sad for the van, to be relegated as a day
tripper...I have much more respect for the couple who traveled for
three years through Central and South America and Africa with their
VW van, at least they are using the camper for the purpose it was  
made for...

Oh well....maybe its just me.
