I know this is probably not the case, but do you have your 1/15 (pos/neg)
wires to your coil reversed? It will still run reversed, but barely with a
magnetic pickup and sometimes will run fine on a stock setup. Don't ask me
how I know...

The voltage spike is worrisome though...

I'm trying Hot Spark but having issues getting it to work. The guys
there are trying to help me figure out my problem, even sent me a
second set, but it just doesn't agree with The Guac for some reason.
Anybody have similar problems with Pertronix or Compufire or HS? Poor
idle and opening the trottle does absolutely nothing. I've tried 3
distributors, 3 rotors, 2 caps, 2 coils, added a 2ohm ballast
resistor, etc etc etc... Coil resistances are 3.1 and 3.9 (original
stock black/orange Bosch, Bosch Blue, respectively).

Note this is NOT a dis against Hot Spark. I think the HS and The Guac
just don't want to get along.
