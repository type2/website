That isn't my bus, and in fact, it may not be a bus at all. It was forwarded
by a friend. The event happened in 2005 in a village on Lake Geneva in
Switzerland. What amazes me in the pic is there is no ice on the buildings
in the background, and very little on the sidewalk across the street. Also,
the waves must have hurled chunks of ice out of the water if you look at the
rounded blobs on the near sidewalk, so the vehicle must have took a pounding
from ice chunks as well. It really must have been a bad day for that driver.
And thank you on the panhead as well. It took a lot of work, but it was
worth it. I still have more to do on it though.
