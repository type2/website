Probably more of an economic decision than anything else...$10-
12,000 is a pretty big investment to risk on a daily driver...It makes
sense to conserve the vehicle to preserve its resale value...;-(

OTOH, it could just be practicality...Unless you're a VW aficionado,
it's just much easier/comfortable/safer/etc. to drive a modern car/
van on a day to day basis... ?-)
