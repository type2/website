Subject: Re: [T2] Z bed won't fold, then it wouldn't unfold

It is a '77 Westy.

I have been wondering from some of the replies I have been getting if it has started working correctly and I don't know how to operate it.

My wife has it full of recycling bins she promises to drop off tomorrow on her way to work, hopefully tomorrow night i will have a chance to try some of the advice I have received.

I did see springs on the side of the hinge, I flicked at them a bit trying to see if I could make something happen, and it did suddenly release the irst time I ran into the problem.

Thank you,
James in Portland, Oregon
