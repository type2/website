Subject: True Canadian Winter Bus Campout Update

Hi Volks,

2 weeks from now we'll be telling one another how we can't wait to do  
it again next year; but for now there are still some arrangements to  
be made.

If you're planning on attending the True Canadian Winter Bus Campout;  
please let me know ASAP. It looks like we're gonna need at least TWO  
turkeys for the deep-fryer this year, and I want to make sure there's  
enough to feed everyone. With the cost of veggie oil and sundry  
ingredients I would expect that a small per-person surcharge will be  
required to cover the cost of the meal.

If you or your bus are afraid to camp out in the winter, it's still  
OK to come and join us for the day. There are several motels in  
Cambridge only a short drive from Valens. A day pass to the park can  
be had for a mere $7CDN.

Additional details on the campout are available at:

Happy Trails,
