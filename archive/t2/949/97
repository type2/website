Subject: my "new" remanned heads

got my heads in the mail last week. the boxes had stickers that read
2.0.  imagine my surprise.  i had called in my order to avoid any
confusion and to insure that i would get my 1.8 heads w/ the temp
sensor hole for FI tapped.  i recieved neither.  no biggy on the temp
sensor hole.  i'll get it done here in stl.  now for my question which
some may all ready have anticipated.  will these heads fit my 1.8
engine?  when i emailed the list prevouisly w/ questions about my
engines head size some people responding said that the 1.8 and 2.0
heads were interchangable.  will the smaller intake have any effect on
how the engine opperates?  engine life?  head life?

anyway,  thanks for reading this.  the sooner i get the heads figured
out the sooner goethe and i can get back on the road.  she's been
sitting for four monthes.  the other day i climbed into the front seat
and grabbed the steering wheel.  should've seen the big, dumb grin on
my face.


thanks,
jeremiah
