Sounds like the wiring is ok...

The valves are leaking so much the cylinder can't build compression.

The compression numbers on that cylinder should be low. If not  
conclusive, also perform a leakdown test and see exactly how much air  
going out the ports.

Perform those tests then pull the head.

Resist the urge to re-adjust the valves and run the engine before the  
valve breaks and ruins the pistons, cylinder and head.
