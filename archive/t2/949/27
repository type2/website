a 'daily' driver but gets used 2 - 3 times a week and trips away on w/

and vacations -- 5-6,000 kms in 3 weeks then.
So we take care of it and hope that maybe one day if the time comes to
have to part with it (dire necesity only) we may get most of our  
'investment'
back.  For us, the 'investment' is free accommodation when we travel,  
the
freedom to camp where & when we wish (within legal bounds), the room
to sleep the 3 of us and enjoy the time on the road as a family.
Suddenly the money doesn't seem that important.
