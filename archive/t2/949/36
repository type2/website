Don,

I've had problems with the Hot Spark. The bus idled poorly until I
turned on my headlights, then she would idle great. Putting the bus in
reverse, activating the reverse lights also had the same effect. I
think it's a voltage issue and that until the alternator kicks on I'm
not getting enough voltage to produce a good spark. I haven't had a
chance to diagnose the issue properly, its just too cold out right now
to do so. When I put the points back in everything worked fine again.

Well that probably doesn't help you too much but it should give you
something else to check for.

peace
