Back when I used to make custom computer cases, I did one with craft
store gold leaf per the customer's request.

It scratches VERY easily. I ended up having the case gold chromed
instead. Expensive, but my customer was happy after I showed pics of
how delicate that stuff really is for something that's used and not a
decoration.
