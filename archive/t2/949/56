My v6 Explorer gets about the same mileage on the highway as the Guac.
Low 20's. Around town it does worse, mostly because of the taller
tires.

Of course, driving habits make a world of difference. There's a guy on
one of the Explorer boards got over 30mpg with a 2wd Explorer with
cat-back exhaust replacement and free flowing air filter. I suspect he
drives like the pedal is stronger than his leg...
