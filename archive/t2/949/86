Subject: Re: [T2] Z bed won't fold, then it wouldn't unfold

James- Back when I had my original Z-bed,it was so
badly worn that it did all sorts of strange things.
Eventually, I removed the cushions (a major job in
itself!) and then replaced all the bolts that were
bent and went to larger bolts if I remember correctly,
where the holes were stretched - drilling the holes
out as needed. I got a few more years out of it after
that before I built a replica of the mechanism and got
some years out of that system. Eventually yanked it
all out and put in a modified Westy version which gave
me a lot more storage room under the seat and is much
lighter overall. -BaH
PS- Careful with those spare tire covers! Many years
ago a friend and I were setting out on a week-long
trip and I had decided I needed a new spare tire
cover. We simply ran out of time before the trip, so
the decision was made to "...pick one up along the
way..." On the second leg of our trip, cruising along
the far left lane of the freeway, something akin to a
tent suddenly appeared in front of me, billowing up
and luckily drifting over my bus as I sped beneath. My
freind, following in his Aerostar camper was not so
lucky and had the thing nail him, inflicting several
scratches and small dents on his brand-new van. As it
turned out, it was a spare tire cover off a truck or
motorhome and was big enough to fit over the noses of
our vans! After that we often joke about picking
things up "on the way!"

 Last weekend while camping our Z bed didn't want to
 go back to being a seat when we were breaking down
 to go home.
 
 I tried poking around with my finger to see if I
 could get something unhooked in the hinge, it
 suddenly released and went into a seat.
 
 I forgot about it.
 
 This weekend we went to turn it into a bed and it
 was stuck as a seat.
 
 When you push the back down the bottom lifts up
 stuck in the angle that it is in while made into a
 seat.
 
 Can somebody please tell me what is wrong and how to
 fix it.
 
 Thank you,
 
 James in Portland, Oregon that still can't get his
 new tire cover to fit
