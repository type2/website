Subject: Re: [T2] Lighting the engine compartment

I use a diode light (ebay store guy Jack Ki from Hong Kong) that has 
like 20 diodes and takes 3 AAA batteries, just sized to fit my mouth and 
is bright!  Another one from same source fits over the head, good for 
tire changes and myh daughter has it for her bus. It has three 
brightness choices (uses different bulb combos) and has a flashing 
function.  These things seem to last for hours and hours.
