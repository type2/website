Subject: Gold leafing a bus.

I'm going to start sanding down the paint on my bus this week and  
fixing a few dents.   My wife thought that gold leafing a few of the  
rusted chrome pieces would be a nice look.   Does anyone have any  
experience doing this?  I am wondering if the gold leafing kits you  
can get at your local craft stores would stand up to the weather in  
Seattle.
