Subject: throttle cable

Well, I finally got around to it.  I didn't realize how much the cord I used to temporarily fix the cable had stretched.  I knew it had as I had trouble keeping up to speed on the freeways.  Now I feel like I've got a racing package.  Can you imagine taking a grossly underpowered vehicle like we drive and cutting acceleration by a third?  Big difference.  But it'll teach you patience.  And I changed out the oil pressure sender.  Solved the problem.  I was afraid it was wiring.  Now if I could fix the oil leak.  Can't have everything.  And thanks for all of the good advice on Megasquirt/FI/electronic ignition/etc.  I'm still thinking about it.  And very glad I don't live in California.  Cheers....KR
