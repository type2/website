I agree! But what?!?!?!

I even stuck a 2ohm ballast resistor on the coil and it had no effect.
Sock coil, blue coil, 3 different dizzys, caps, rotors, etc. Tried the
whole range of adjustments on the HS from almost touching the magnet
ring to all the way out. The ONLY things I haven't tried swapping out
are the plug wires. I'm going to buy some this coming weekend.

I can get it to idle for a minute or so, lumpy and missing, but
idling. Got the timing set around 8* (it bounces around so much under
those conditions it's hard to get precise) but it should be enough to
get it started.
