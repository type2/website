The first owner of my 78 put on 50,000 km between 78 and 80 - at that rate 
my bus would have 725,000 kms on it ... however, the second owner of my 78 
only put on 50,000 between 1980 and ... 2002 or so ... I really appreciate 
the fact that he did only drive it occasionally. I'm not sad for my bus at 
all ... I'm happy I was able to find such a low mileage bus .....
