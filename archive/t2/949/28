Subject: Oil pressure idiot light

Fellow bussers
Bus:	1976 2-litre dual carb, manual transmission.

Problem:	Just had front crankcase oil seal and gearbox nose cone  
seals replaced due to oil leaks
(obviously!!!) by AC mechanic -- same mechanic who rebuilt the motor  
2 1/2 yrs ago.

On the way home, my wife saw the oil pressure idiot light come on &  
pulled over.  Rang the mechanic
who talked her through checking the connection on the pressure switch  
-- all OK.  She confirmed that
it was attached and that she had around 40 PSI on the oil pressure  
gauge ( only recently installed by
myself).

After trolling the archives tonight, found info that said that if the  
ignition is turnted on (motor off), both
oil & ign lights are on.  Removing the wire from the sender unit  
should extinguish the oil light.  If it does
not go out then there is a short present.

Have I read this correctly?  As it stands, removing the wire from the  
sender does not make the light go
out.  Does this mean that I have a short in the wiring from the idiot  
light??  Or is there any other
explanation??
