On the tired 74 bed in daughter's bus, lifting the formed bed front will 
not latch the middle section into a seat- you must grab the back of the 
middle section and PULL IT UP as you lift the front and then push to 
form the seat.  This is much easier/less backbreaking  if you fasten  a 
cloth tab/loop to the back of the seat so it is visible when you make 
the bed and can grab this to reform the seat.
    If you have the opposite problem of it wanting to remain as a seat, 
try hyperflexing the front of the bed (the part that was sat on) so it 
nearly folds over the midsection, and then return it to become flat. 
Usually this problem never occurs unless you lift the seat up too far- 
lift it just enough as you pull back and it all pulls towards you.
