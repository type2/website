I couldn't get it to work on my 80 vanagon, so there is a problem. The
distributor is sending me a new unit and claims that a 2 ohm ballast
resistor attached to the + side of the coil will fix the problem. Maybe. I'm
really starting to have my doubts about this product, hearing your problems.
I too have a complete, new working ignition system.
