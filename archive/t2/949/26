Subject: Re: [T2] 72 vs 79 Brake Booster

The '72 booster does not provide as much boost as the '79 booster.  The 
'79 booster will make the brakes feel pretty much like a modern car 
whereas the '72 booster will make the brakes feel somewhat stiff. 
Although I was able to get used to the feel of the '72 booster, I liked 
the greater assist provided by the later model booster and eventually 
went back to it even though the slightly larger size causes it to 
contact the frame (on my '73, at least).
