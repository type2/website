I installed a BN4 several years ago and ran the exhaust out near the  
exhaust pipe from the muffler.

It took me a while to catch on that I had created a veritable fluegelhorn  
of a sound system for piping engine noise back into the bus through the  
BN4 ductwork.

I'd advise anyone installing a heater to take this inadvertent consequence  
of exhaust placement into consideration.
