Subject: ballast resistors

	To carry a spare coil for a given VW motor, one must know 
whether a ballast resistor is required.  I have good recent Jap 12V 
coils which I'm not too purist to use, and some are marked that they 
require an external ballast resistor.  On the other hand many Bosch 
VW coils include the resistor, one gathers from the archives.
	Could a new Article be posted, tabling info along lines such as

	motor type	1600 dp

	years		  -  73  -

	int BR?

	ext BR/ohm

Yes, it's true I want the column filled in first which I've started. 
But it may not be much harder for some Typ2 expert to compile the 
whole plurry table which could then be on the T2 website.

sorry not to be more help myself on this one
