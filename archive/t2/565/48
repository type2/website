Subject: Lighter vs Heater Knob?

Hello,

Why is when I have look at various 72 vans that some have lighters just 
below the glove box and the green heater knob closer to the driver?  While 
others (such as mine) has no lighter but the green heater knob in it's place 
by the glove box? Was this an option?

Thanks in advance, Phil.
