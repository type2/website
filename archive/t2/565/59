Well, the verdict is that it went pretty smoothly with the bus on the 
ground.  I did notice that the tranny was sloped down, so it looked like I 
needed to support it to match up with the engine.

I thought I would be slick and use my floor jack for the tranny, and rest 
the engine on some ramps.  That way I could align the two, and then slide 
the engine on the ramps (they are the type you drive up onto to lift a car 
w/o jacking it up).  Anyway, I forgot to put the engine mounts back on the 
rear support bar, so I ended up jacking up the engine with the floor jack, 
pulling them apart, installing the mounts, and then putting them back 
together.

All in all it took way too long (3 hours including putting the tin back 
on), but I managed to get it all together by myself, which I do feel pretty 
good about.  Although, I am a bit tired (and hungry).  It is 2:00am here, 
after all.

Again, thanks to all for your help.
