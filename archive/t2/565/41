You dont HAVE to on a FI bay either, tho it helps a lot.  If you decide
not to you do have to remove the bumper.  I always do lift the bus a bit
(~2-3") just to make life easier.

Interestingly, you also don't HAVE to jack up a bug.  if you drop the
engine, twist it 90 degrees, then you can pull the fan shroud thru the gap
for the pea-shooters (barely :-)

Very true!  also having the clutch plate and trans input shaft at the same
degree of rotation.  All this is easier out of the bus and then insert and
jack the pair.  This is why I prefer to remove the engine and trans as a
unit.

                             OOK!
