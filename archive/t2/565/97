Subject: Engine Block identification

I have an engine a neighbour wants installed in his '78 auto Camper.
The engine has a few issues..

Just for interest sake,, do you know what it was originally built for?
It has a engine case code CV serial number  with 071 101 371A vanagon heads <is this
a clue>  he is trying to source the left heater box for the square port heads

It appears to have a dipstick hole beside the oil breather tower, which shouldn't be
much trouble , I can tap it and install a plug and use the oil filler tube dipstick

The oil breather tower doesn't have a removable breather,, it is cast in the block.
I am leaning towards removing the steel tube in the block and fitting the stock
breather box plastic outlet that bolts on.
Seems like I could drill and tap the case for the 2 fastening bolts.
Or find a fitting that converts it to the hose size needed

The other problem is the head Temp Sensor hole is buggered,, so  I need to fix them.
I was thinking of sourcing a M10X1 tap.... but the hole is already too big. Sounds
like a heli coil job...
Has anyone used a putty like DevCon , liquid metal, that can be tapped after filling
the hole?
Is there an acceptable repair for this hole,,
