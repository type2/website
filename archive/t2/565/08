Subject: Orange Bus sighting, on the list?

On my way home Thursday evening I passed an Orange bay window bus traveling
south on Rt 29 in Madison county Virginia. It was headed towards
Charlottesville, VA. It looked to be in great shape. Just wondering if it
belongs to anyone on the list? I do not see many buses around these parts.
