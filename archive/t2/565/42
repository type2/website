earlier today Mark L. Hineline said....."I think Clara explained it
best: if you are going to increase horsepower by any _meaningful_
percentage, you'd better make comparable improvements to braking,
steering, and suspension. It would make more sense to stitch a bus
body onto a D*dge Hemi chassis"

I know someone who has done just that, sort of.  He's put a bus body
on the chassis of a Toyota van.  It looks a little odd but captures
the spirit of the bus.  He liked it well enough that he did it a
second time and made himself a pick-up truck.  Now keep in mind that
this guy is a starving artist who's quite creative.  In this case he's
just using a sawz-all and welder to exercise his creativity in metal.
And as he explains it, the best part is that he now has heat.
