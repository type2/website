Well, your title says you wanted one, and I got one I don't want, so...........

The key to getting the FI right is to make sure all the components are 
matched. You cannot mix and match various ECU's with various AFM's with 
various harnesses. For example, there are four different types of throttle 
switch setups for the t-bodies, from none to one (2 types of one switch) to 
a 2 switch system in the 5 years of production of T-II and several 
following years of Vanagon air cooled. Each harness is different and each 
ECU is different and each T-body is different. The combinations and 
permutations are just a fright.
