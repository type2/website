Hi Greg,

Just for some trivial information (next time) I don't believe you need 
to remove the engine to accomplish this task on the 1.7L through 2.0L.  
If you remove the tin plates and exhaust manifolds from underneath the 
bus, you can re-tap the exhaust studs in the heads from M8x1.25 to 
M10x1.5 while the heads are still in place.  If you search the hardware 
stores you can find metric studs with the M10x1.5 threading on one end 
and M8x1.25 on the other end.  The will need to be 46 to 50 mm long.

As for push rod tube seals, I believe the push rods simply slide out 
once you remove the keeper springs and the rocker arms.  You intended 
to adjust the valves anyway...

This may be one of those tasks where you get Fahrfenugen in your eyes 
but the job is not difficult and doesn't take much time.
