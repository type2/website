Subject: Leaky decel valve?

What does this device do for a manual transmissioned bus that doesn't 
need to be done for an automatic bus?  Is it just an extreamly small 
contributor to reducing emissions under deceleration for the more 
positive feed-back given by a manual vs. an automatic?  Has anyone 
removed it and passed CA emissions testing?
