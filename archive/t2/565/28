Subject: 76 alternator/regulator wiring questions

Greetings!

I am in the process of reinstalling my engine (2L, converted to Weber 
progressive). My markings for the alternator/ voltage regulator wirings 
seem to have vanished over the winter.

Problem 1: The wiring from the alternator has five parts: the large red 
wire that goes to the starter; the red (D+), brown (D-), and green 
(DF), which attach to the accompanying male plugs on the bottom of the 
voltage regulator (I got rid of the plastic plug for some not-so-great 
reason that I'm having trouble recalling, and just put female spade 
plugs on the wires); and a thin black wire.

Question 1: What does the thin black wire connect to?

Problem 2: The cable loom (if that's the right word for it) that goes 
from the area of the battery through the firewall to the right of the 
battery-starter cable has two wires I have questions about.

Question 2a: There is a thin black wire that looks like it's the same 
gauge as the thin black wire mentioned above. What does this thin black 
wire connect to?

Question 2b: There are two thin green wires that come out of this loom 
that join together in a single female spade plug. What do these wires, 
or more precisely, this plug, connect to?

Lesson learned: Find a better, more durable way of marking every wire 
when disconnecting them.

Thanks in advance for any help! I really don't want to fry the 
regulator, the alternator, or the starter as we're getting ready for a 
six-week trip from Wisconsin through South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, 
and North Dakota!
