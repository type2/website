Hi Jeff,

I removed the head so someone else could pull the studs. I was **way** 
too busy to look after this myself. The studs were stripped so I 
wouldn't  be able to remove them with a pair of nuts on the stud, and 
any removal more advanced than that requires tools I don't currently 
have. They wound up needing helicoils anyway, so I would have been 
pulling the head to send them out regardless. Or I suppose I could take 
the whole engine in, but I can't lift it into my station wagon 
alone....  I am not bad with regular maintenance, but I draw the line 
at machining. This is a case where paying a pro to do the work is 
cheaper than learning on my own engine. At least that's how I see it.

I did the pushrod tubes on the 3-4 side with the engine back in the 
bus, and you're right, it wasn't any harder than it was with the engine 
on the ground. The main reason the engine came down was to swap the 
5-rib tranny for a 3-rib. I wanted to get the top gear ratio down a bit 
to improve performance on long hills while pulling the westrailer, and 
the 4th gear on the 5-rib tranny was starting to whine a bit under 
load.

Fahrfenugen?? OMG, last night I thought I was going to have to dig out 
my right eye and rinse it in the sink. It feels a lot better today 
though.

Happy trails,
