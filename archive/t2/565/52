Subject: Thump and clunk in the front end

Hi,

I accidentally hit a speed bump to fast the other day, and today while I
was out, I started hearing clunking noises in the right front when ever
the suspension has to move ('74 T2). I won't have time to pull the wheel
and look until the morning, but I wanted to ask the group if they have
any ideas on what I should be looking for. It doesn't feel like anything
is disconnected, and I am thinking that I have lost a bushing, but these
are only assumptions at this point.

Thanks,

Mark
