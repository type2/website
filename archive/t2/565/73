Subject: re:Anyone have a spare weber single?? (FI reversion update)

Hi Bob,

NOTE: People can stop sending me offers weber singles. I am NOT 
interested in a weber single, I am interested in making the bus run on 
FI.

Sorry if I didn't make that clear enough. It was late at night and my 
irony meter may have been poorly calibrated.

I gotta mention here that I was really surprised when Doktor Tim's only 
response was to offer to sell me a non-stock part. But in this case DM 
makes assumptions about all parts being equal and I know that is not 
necessarily the case. Which is probably why the Doktor has opted out of 
FI reversion assistance. Sigh.

I went out this afternoon and swapped in the fuel pressure regulator 
from the sunroof bus. The I verified that I am getting a decent spray 
from injectors on 1,2 & 3. Last night I assumed that #4 was 
representative of all the others, but I now know that is not the case.  
Injector #4 refuses to fire, even when I use the wire from #3.  So I 
swapped in a different injector and it too refuses to fire.  I might 
just have a dud spare, but there are more where that came from, I'll 
update on that situation soon.

I called Dennis Jolliffe and verified the firing order from the 
distributor out. It turned out that I had 1-2 and 3-4 plug wires 
reversed. I also had the plugs to the thermo time switch and aux air 
intake reversed. When I assembled the engine I couldn't see the color 
codes on the plugs, so I guessed on their position based on the length 
of the leads. Wrongly.

After that I was able to get it to start.

It still won't idle though. It will light up  but will only run 
briefly. If I play with the throttle I can keep it running, but only at 
high revs. Adjusting the timing helps a little, but not much. The 
inability to idle can't be helped by a dead number 4 injector, so I 
will head back to the driveway now to try swapping in another spare. I 
am also going to get a fuel pressure gauge on it ASAP.

Feels better to know I am getting closer. It sure sounds a lot better 
now that the exhaust manifold is bolted up properly.

Happy trails,
