Subject: late bay exhaust parts needed

I am looking for exhaust parts for the 2 liter square port heads.
It is a 79 Bus, with a replacement engine.. no need for crossover pipes and cat
conv. etc

The right heater box I have has a 3 bolt trapezoidal? flange

I need a left heater box and a muffler

I have a header pipe system to replace the factory muffler, but it needs a muffler
also. So if I can't find the factory style of muffler, I could use the header style
that has the one VERY large triangle flange

Here is a photo of what I have... can you fix me up with something to complete the
picture?
