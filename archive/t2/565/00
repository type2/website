Subject: Re: [T2] Brake light switch?

Don,
Check the bakelite back panel on the emergency flasher switch.

If it has come loose and isn't making contact with the internals of the
switch--the stop lights won't work.

I figured this deal out up in South Dakota when I bought my 74 Westy 2
years ago--no brake lights--

Had the lights, the sockets, apart--then it was to the dash and the
fuses---

By total accident I was screwing around with the turn signals--and the
emergency flasher--and the back bakelite panel popped off--

I wire tied it back on to the switch for the ride back to the Windy--and
all was good until I replaced it--

See if your emergecy flashers' work--if nt look there.
