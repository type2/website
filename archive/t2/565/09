True true, but to compare addages, instead of looking at it as "I am
what I am, and that's all that I am." I prefer to look at it as "Be all
that you can be!" and of course "Theirs always room for improvement."

Heck, if VW believed good was good enough, we'd never have had the
Deisel Rabbit. Oh, wait, bad example. Lol  heh heh
