Subject: RE: [T2]  Great site for partnumbers

However, look at the part numbers carefully. For a long time Volksteile (VW
made them change their name recently to Wagenteile) changed VW part numbers
in a systematic fashion to "non-VW" part numbers. A VW part number like 211
xxx yyy would be turned into xxx yyy 211.

Apart from that, their catalog is the best one I have seen so far and these
guys really know their stuff. They sell new and used parts for any rear
engine VW (they used to be a strictly air-cooled place but have now added
waterleakers). Great prices, too - however, they are in Germany and do not
take credit cards ...
