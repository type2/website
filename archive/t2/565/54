Subject: Anyone have a spare weber single?? (FI reversion update)

Hi Volks,

I'm not gonna beg for a weber single, but my FI install on the 
westfakia does seem to be mocking me.

Some background info:

The engine was recently re-assembled after pulling the 1-2 head to have 
exhaust studs replaced. I also replaced all the push-rod tube seals, 
and adjusted the valves. The 5-rib transmission was replaced with a 
3-rib unit to reduce top-speed gearing slightly to improve performance 
on long hills when hauling the westrailer.

I have gathered and installed a complete group of FI components.  I 
have a 7-wire AFM. The ECU has an orange sticker on it. Everything is 
bolted up tight, and all the vacuum lines are present and accounted 
for.. I haven't put a fuel gauge on it but I have verified fuel flow. 
The EGR has been removed and capped off at the plenum. I am getting a 
nice juicy spark at the plugs. I am NOT getting fuel spray from the 
injectors.  There is 5 gallons of fresh fuel in the tank. The long 
single wire from the FI harness to the coil is firmly attached to the 
negative side.

Suggestions would be quite welcome.

Happy trails,
