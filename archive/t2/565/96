Hi Dylan
For a 3 terminal alterator.
Batt + with the red ring connects to Battery + positive <large #8 wire>
terminal 1 connects to the dash light
terminal 2 connects to batt +

Here is a photo, once you have the alternator wired like this,,terminal 2 jumpered
to Batt, terminal 1 ready for connection to your dash light then connect the white
wire <terminal 1> on the alt to the blue wire that is attached to your present
voltage regulator and put a #8 cu wire with extra loom over it from the B+ terminal
on the alternator to the Battery + positive post.

Just that easy.   Now you have to fab some mounting brackets,, to keep that
alternator away from the exhaust.... think 74 air pump mounting.

Keep in mind that alternator is designed to spin using a small crank pulley,, not
the large fan pulley that is on the T4 engine!

You'll have to engineer a pulley drive system to hold the HP and not over rev the alt.
