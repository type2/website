If you run it for just a minute or two, prob. not. It can cause the valves 
to run very hot though, so don't go overboard with it and dont try to drive 
it anywhere.

I have run busses and beetles with no muffler on a number of occasions. 
Mostly to move the vehicle across the yard, test an engine on the stand, 
etc. Again, usually a 30 second experience. That is all my ears could 
stand. Don't try it at 6:00 in the morning or your neighbors will bring 
over the torches and pitchforks to help you turn it off!
