Subject: FI Parts ID req'd.

Hi Volks,

OK, I think it would be wise for me to ID some of the parts I am 
working with.

Here are the part numbers for what I'm working with:

AFM:
0 280 200 020

ECU
0 280 000 149

Distributor
0 231 168 005
021905205P

I am not using this particular distributor. Right now I am still using 
the dual-vac unit previously associated with the dual solexes. But if 
it's a match to the FI components then I will switch over to it.


THANKS!


Happy trails,
