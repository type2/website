Subject: Engine removal/installation question

Do you need to jack up the back of the bus to remove/install the engine?  A 
friend of mine has a bug and his engine removal instructions included 
jacking up the engine, but when I removed the engine it didn't appear that 
this was necessary.  I'm getting ready to put the engine back in so I'm 
curious to know if I will need to put the bus back up on jack stands.

TIA
