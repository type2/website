Yes.  I'll check it in the morning to see if that's what it is.  I can't
seem to find my copy of the color wiring harnesses for my bus, or I'd try
tracing it that way.

Oh, for what it's worth.  My website is back up and I transferred most of my
personal website to a new location there at http://www.cfnson.com/melas

The "tear bus" gifs/jpegs are there along with pics of my bus. :O)
