Chris,

Most "usefull" changes are going to require either a dynamometer and/or
a full scale EPA type rolling road to test for *truly* increased mileage.

The rest is all hype and conjecture...and beliefs held by some of us for 
more than 35 years.LOL!

Muffler...need dyno to figure out if it "really" works.
Pertronix type "points replacement" ...no brainer...do it.

True electronic ignition...also a no brainer.

Split fire plugs in ACVW...never...never use platinum either.

John Connaly at aircooled will swear on a stack of bibles
that SVDA distrib is a perfromance enhancing mileage improving
guarantee.

The other stuff...on your list...don't know...

Cheers, dave
