Subject: Metalurgy Question

I'm currently in the process of cleaning/repairing all the external bits of my
81 Westy's engine before ordering a rebuilt engine, Been soaking sheet metal
in a dilute solution of muratic acid, followed by a water wash and soaking
with Phosphoric acid (Jasco prep & prime) to stop the rust on the virgin
metal. Typicaly after the water wash, I dry with a towel ASAP but still see
metal start to turn color from oxidation. The Phosphoric acid takes care of
the oxidation and leaves the surface etched for painting.

Last night I ran into a suprize. After soaking the cat converter in the first
acid bath, (converter lost its insides long ago) I water washed it. What a
nice shiny satin surface? I washed off some other parts before drying the
converter. When I got to drying the parts I saw the converter had not turned
color at all from the oxidation? I purposely left it till last before the
phosphoric acid, still no oxidation except on the triangle shaped flange. I
could swear this thing looked like a ball of rust before the first acid bath.

Does anyone know what kind of metal the outer case of the converter is made
of? Is it stainless? I'm concerned because I was planning on gas welding a
small hole caused by a loose clamp. I have little welding experience & think I
remember hearing you cant weld stainless with oxy/acetelene. If not, what is
the best method of closing a small hole in this thing?

Thanks,
Tom
