Yes, the light's working.  Comes on with the ignition, goes out when the
engine starts.

This wire is really heavy gauge, something like I'd expect would come off of
the starter.  I wasn't dressed for under the bus work, but from what I could
see from a quick look the wires in the sheaths go through the tin and over
towards the driver's side of the engine.

Thanks for the help.
