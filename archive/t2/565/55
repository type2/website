Subject: Re: [T2] Engine removal/installation question

Hey Greg,

I think you are right, that you had trouble pulling the engine off the
spline because the bus was lifted. You should not have to lift your '68 at
all. Theoretically you can put the engine on the jack, assuming the apron is
removed, and then just slide it onto the spline, kind of wheel it on in. I
check several times while they are mating to make sure it's lined up, but
all I have ever worked on is the pancake engine and it's a bear to line them
up (because the bus IS lifted. haha). It creates an angle is in a tight spot
and you have to kind of rock the engine to match it, sometime jacking the
bus up or down and it's a whole lot of fun.

At any rate you will have better luck this time around and congrats on your
first engine pull!!
