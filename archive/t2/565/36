is it a oem unit or a replacement unit?  the reason that 409 gets rusty
looking is because it has a higher iron content than 302,304, or 308 does.
but i have never had a magnet stick to 409.

Ran outside an put a magnet on the shell. It stuck, maybe not as strongly
as it did when I put it on the flange. Guess it's not 409 stainless
