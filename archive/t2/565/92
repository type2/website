Don't you do this part before you put them on the engine? Whoops, dumb
question.

That is 78-79.

This one is hard to reference because you are quoting the bosch number. The
bosch book I have is too new and the ECU's are not in it any more. I'll bet
Karl would have a reference for it. If you use the VW number, which should
be on the same sticker as the bosch number, it is easier to ID. Here is a
good listing of the VW ECU numbers and applications. Ignore the X's, they
only denote remanufactured units:

I would say that is a good distributor to use on your franken-motor. You
have no use for retard and no port to generate a retard signal, and the
motor you are trying to build is basically a 78-79 one with the exception of
the solid lifters.
