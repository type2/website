The retard signal should be from the throttle body, but that might not be
the case for an early FI engine, I am not sure. On later busses this is
certainly true. There were so many permutations it takes a mind like Karl to
keep it all straight. In any case, an injected engine without EGR has no use
for retarded timing.
