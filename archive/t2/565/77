Hi Doktor,

I see your point about the subject line being misleading. I guess that 
was where my "irony gauge" went wrong. You weren't alone -- I had a 
total of seven people respond that they had webers available.

The info about the throttle switch was helpful. The throttle body I am 
working with does not have a throttle switch. I will check the ECU part 
number soon to ensure the unit is compatible with this throttle body. 
There are no unused plugs on my wiring harness, so it would appear that 
I have the right harness for this throttle body.

You're right about the fright factor, but I am still fairly certain 
that I have the resources to get this bus back to FI. The finished 
engine is going to end up as unique as the rest of the westfakia... 2L 
displacement, solid lifters, 72-74 exhaust, and L-Jet FI without EGR. A 
215mm flywheel feeds power to a 3-rib tranny. Just because the factory 
has not built one this way does not mean it can't be made to work. I 
have to do my own maintenance anyway, so any problems with 
compatibility are destined to be mine regardless.... Very few of the 
"professional" mechanics in Ontario will touch an aircooled vehicle, 
and most of those that will are a long way from competent with them.

I do have a copy of the Bosch FI Pro Training manual and it has proven 
immensely useful as it includes a complete wiring diagram of the 
harness and the double relay.

Happy trails,
