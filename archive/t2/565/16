More power with less fuel use would require total re-engineering at the 
very least. There are simply no bolt on mods that will improve either 
without giving up drivability or longevity.

Lots and lots and lots have tried. None have empirical data to prove 
"improvement", at least not without significant re-engineering.

Will do nothing for you as you then must reset mixture to spec.

Expect big drop in MPG and problems with idle.

Difference will be virtually unmeasurable.

Expect reduced flow through the heads without re-engineering cam/valve specs.

>Install Electronic Ignition (i.e. pertronix)

Slight possible improvement but less reliable than stock.

Only time I ever saw split fires was when problems developed and cracked 
ceramics were noted. Big waste of money compared to good old Bosch Supers.

.009 is dead wrong curve for T-IV engine. Nothing matches stock curve 
better than stock dizzy, without re-engineering. The Brazillian 050 is 
close, the Porsche 912 is close. ANY year T-II/T-IV original is closer to 
correct.

Cheapest method for significant increased power without serious loss of 
longevity. Install Porsche 912 engine. Result will be $6000 plus labor to 
re-engineer mounts and cooling tin seal, overstressed tranny.

Bottom line, stock specs throughout will give efficiency and longevity 
contemplated by a team of engineers that know perhaps 100 times more about 
vehicle design and function than this whole list put together.

All German engines typically are highly refined to be specifically suitable 
for intended purpose. How does Porsche take a 130 HP 911 engine and pump it 
up to 220 HP without losing longevity and reliability?? Re-engineer 
everything in the system from the air cleaner to the muffler and everything 
in between. A new 67 2.0 liter would run about $10,000. A new 3.0 RSR might 
cost $35,000.
