Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap/Easy HP boosters?

Maybe this doesn't apply to the all-drum braked early baywindows, but I see no problem increasing performance enough to climb hills at modern vehicle speeds and cruise easier at the speed limit (or slightly below it). 

My stock '1978 bus is capable I think of being safe at 65mph-70mph in correct, good, stock condition. Drum brakes? Maybe not. They sure get hot fast. 

However passenger car tires, worn suspension, and poor braked busses need not apply. 

I've added a HUGE (to me) increase in HP/torque - maybe 75% more, but I don't plan on using this to go faster than 65-70 mph. I think keeping up is as important to highway safety as good tires or good brakes. Running 55 mph when the traffic is running 80 mph is flat scary to me! What's really scary is climbing the big hills on I-40 around here struggling at 50mph when the traffic is running 70mph+. I don't want to get rear-ended with a 25 mph speed differential. 

That said the bus will never be an Acura NSX. I hear an arguement often. Non motorcycle folks looking at motorcycles and recommending a 450cc over a 900cc b/c the bigger engine is unsafe... Well frankly I've been riding for years now and I'd have an 1800cc if I could afford it. It will only go as fast as far as you open the throttle. I can drive a Posche 911 slow just like a Geo Metro but it is good to have that extra getup and go when I need it - hills and on-ramps. I think 100 HP/150ft-lbs of toque is a good target number. The Corvair I'm using is 110HP(-at-)4400rpm and 160HPft-lbs T(-at-)2600rpm measured without the fanbelt according to the shop manual specs.

Add pistons and cylinders from a stock 2.0L to the Corvair and get a 3.1L. 

I still buy or build a Raby Special if I could afford it.

What is the old saying? Cheap, easy, fast - pick any two?
