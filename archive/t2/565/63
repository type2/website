I have seen many problems with these designed to be cheap fuel pressure 
regulators. Same with the el cheapo electric fuel pumps, the Facet being a 
perfect example of a short life item. You just have to search for higher 
quality parts. If you want a really nice electric pump for carbs, go to the 
bone yard and search for a mechanical fuel injected Mercedes, 60's to early 
70's. Look for 230/250/280 S and SL's. The pump that feeds the injection 
pump for this system would be ideal and have seen them 30+ years old and 
still in fine functional order, even when passing lots of crud from the 
tank to the filter. I would also be inclined to grab the filter off that 
system as well. Quickly replaceable insert type filters.

I do believe that the later FI T-IV blocks have the mechanical pump area 
cast in and could be milled, drilled and tapped for a stock carb pump. A 
good question for Jerry at NW Con Rod. If you are going to rebuild a 2.0 
for use with carbs that would be a great way to go.
