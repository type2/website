You don't have to remove anything. You can just use a vanagon breather
fitting. It will bolt up perfectly. I have a spare of you want it. It is
like a bus one without the sheet metal can, it is just a non-return valve
that plugs into the top flared tube in the case. The hose to the s-tube is
the same size and shape as on a bus.

I would stay away from any sort of putty, as it will certainly change the
temperature characteristics of the area that the sender is bolted into. I
have the taps if you need to borrow them, starting and plug. If the head is
off the engine, just have the area welded and re-tap it. It is not a
difficult area to weld. Helicoil will work but it is an odd size. I have a
complete helicoil master set but I don't recall m10 x 1.0 in there. I can
get timesert kit for the job, but I wouldn't invest in it for one hole of an
oddball size.
