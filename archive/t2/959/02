The underneath radiator has become quite popular and
is working well for a lot of people. Why not? If I had
the funds, I'd try each of the different setups. As it
is, I'm pretty much broke! I have a couple plans I
have devised for running underneath - my concern is
protecting the radiator from all that sand and small
gravel that gets thrown around down there (and I stay
on surfaced roads!) but this sytem has a great deal of
merit. It also totally disguises the fact that you've
got a water cooled engine, so that gives it even more
merit! -BaH

 same radiator but use an ac belly pan and try
 diffrent cfm fans?
