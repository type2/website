Yep, definitely a Riviera.  My best bud Cliff in North Hollywood has one of
these.  Dunno the actual model (Jim Arnott would know), but my nickname for
it is the "Trailways Riviera" because the roofline looks so much like the
old style Continental Trailways Buses that traversed across the USA many,
many years ago (in a galaxy far, far away).
