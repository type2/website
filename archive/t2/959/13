Subject: Friday Rookie Question about Valve Cover Gaskets

I have been a life long greaser and gear head but for some reason I can't get my valve cover gaskets installed correctly on my 1977 Westy.

A few months ago, lets say 6 months, I noticed the bottom of my valve covers were a little damp and the bottom of the motor was a little damp and every couple of weeks there would be a single drop of oil under my bus, I should have tried to be happy with this.

I had a pair of gaskets in the parts kit that came with my bus and my brother-in-law, who actually has a giant VW tattoo, jumped at the chance to change them one night while hanging out at his house.

We started home and I started smelling oil and then we looked like we were being shot down over Japan in WWII with a solid stream of smoke pouring out of one side.

I parked it in my driveway and left a pissy message for my B.I.L. to drop by and try again while I was out of town for the weekend, he had success on his second try, he jokes that all of my problems are my fault for buying "late model trash" and then asks me if I will help him put a 2 litre in his '69 Karmann Ghia.

A few weeks ago I noticed the other side was leaking more and more all the time, I picked up some new gaskets and replaced it, it seemed to be just fine, I could see that the old one had been in crooked and was only holding in oil by a hair, I had no reason to expect the new gasket to be a problem.

After one 14 mile round trip to work I will now say it is leaking twice as bad as before I replaced the gasket.

Will somebody please tell me how to replace my valve cover gaskets one time so I can forget about them for a very long time?

Thank you,

JM
