I don't quite see how this would damage a radiator.  If the radiator  
is capable of withstanding positive internal pressure it must be able  
to withstand some amount of negative pressure too.  I'm not sure how  
much vacuum he applies during this operation but I imagine it's only  
just enough to crush the hoses and no more.

My friend acts as if this is the way that filling Vanagons is always  
done and I don't think he's wrecked any radiators this way yet.

What do you think would be damaged n a radiator from this procedure?   
It's only out of curiosity that I ask.  I can certainly see how  
applying too much vacuum would be bad, just like too much internal  
pressure would be bad.

Sounds like a great way to damage a radiator!
