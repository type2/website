Very cool. A friend of mine out here in Albany drove out to Syracuse a
few weeks ago to look at that very same bus with his girlfriend. He
came back saying something about it being painted up as a day care
shuttle vehicle. I can't imagine its not the same vehicle.

Good luck finding a rear bumped. Seems impossible to find a good used
one anywhere in upstate New York.
