Can't contribute much on finding it, but might look some up soon. 

I remember the aroma. The first time I used it was to seal my brother's Honda Dream 305 crank case. Followed closely by a '67 beetle crank case, my first wheels. I'd think a cologne or aftershave made with WD40, Permatex and sawdust would go further than whatever they're selling nowadays.
