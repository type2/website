Okay, here are the numbers: #1-185psi but instant
bleed-down
#2-60psi and instant bleed-down
#3-120psi took a really long time to build up to but
held there and did not bleed down
#4-150psi and held there

#1 & #2 are opposite each other

My question is, what scenario would allow pressure
build-up but no hold?

What scenario would take a really long time to build
up but then hold well?

I have some ideas, but what do you think? I won't be
re-trying with oil or anything else cuz it's out and
"Next" is going in! -BaH
