Well, it depends.  With new gaskets, you only put it on the cover side 
with a thin layer of oil on the head side.. just like with a oil filter. 
  However, if you remove and replace the cover later down the road 
without changing the gasket, my mechanic recommended cleaning both 
surfaces and applying some to the gasket that mates with the head.  I 
tried this and it left no residue on the head upon removal and does a 
great job of sealing with a used gasket.
