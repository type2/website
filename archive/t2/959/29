Mike,

Since a valve adjustment is one of the first things I have to do to my
new Bus, I'm curious -- are we talking about a thin layer applied to the
 head side of the gasket, as well as the layer applied to the valve
cover side? 

I always thought the head side wasn't supposed to have sealant.

Awaiting enlightenment,
