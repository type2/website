Hi,

Without getting into a debate about what a hippie is or is not (not
appropriate for this list), I would like to inform you that there are
"hippies" on this list who work hard and can afford the "specialist
maintenance" of our beloved buses.

A shiftless hippie is one who drives his/her bus with a broken clutch.
