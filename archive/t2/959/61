Subject: Dumb Clutch Question.

I became hard to shift the other night, and my clutch pedal then went  
to the floor.  I pulled over, and after everything cooled down, I  
crawled underneath and adjusted the clutch.  It was a bit loose, but  
not enough to make it go to the floor.

Today  went for a short drive (three miles), and on the way back it  
happened again, the pedal went to the floor, and I was not able to  
get into or out of gear. I pulled over, shut the van down and noticed  
that suddenly I could shift into and out of gear.  Underneath the  
tension on the cable was where I had adjusted it to.  I took off and  
made it the 1/2 mile back home before it got hard to shift again.   
When I pulled into the garage, the clutch smelt like burning hair.

Is my van possessed?  Can the cable stretch, then shrink, then  
stretch enough to do this?  Am I in a bad VW nightmare and just need  
to wake up?
