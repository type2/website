I'm just speculating.

However, radiators are designed to handle internal pressure, not external
pressure.  Another example is a soda can.  It can handle 100PSI of
internal pressure, but it is easily crushed by atmospheric pressure if you
create a vacuum inside.

Here's a demo of this:

Now, this is an extreme case, but I wonder if the designers of radiators
intended for them to be evacuated?
