Hmmm... Are the motor and transmission mounts tight? If later than 1971, be
sure to check the bolts that hold the bearer bar to the frame. If the
motor/transmission assembly can move forward and back, it seems that would
alter the effective length of the cable. But all the way to the floor? I
dunno about that. Maybe the bushings on the throwout arm or the arm itself.
Loosen the cable up so there's no tension at rest and try moving the
throwout lever around to see if there's any play. It should be snug in all
directions. If there's play, pull the motor (and transmission) and have a
look. You might want to first check the ends of the cable at the pedal and
be sure that rotates freely. If it's binding there, it might cause this
problem. Check all entry and exit points of the cable to be sure it hasn't
worn any grooves, check the bowden tube for wear. When it went to the floor,
was the clutch still engaged, or was the engine revving freely?
That's all I can think of right now.
