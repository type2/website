I used to use weather strip cement to hold the gasket onto the cover, 
but per my mechanic's recommendation, I now use Permatex Aviation 
form-a-gasket.  It is much easier to clean off and doesn't stick to the 
metal like the weather strip cement.

Plus, if I ever take the cover off and don't replace the gasket, I use 
some of the gasket sealer on the sealing side and it keeps it from 
leaking.  When you pull it off, it doesn't leave any residue on the 
head, either.

Also, you might want to get new spring bails if they're not holding the 
covers on tight enough.
