Subject: Samba offensive responses

Tonight I had received a really offensive and racist classified email
response from a member of theSamba. Has this happened to any of you? How
serious is Everett about getting rid of these types of users? I did email
him the creep's email. Bizarre. It is always a shock that people still live
in this world with such hateful hearts.

 

I am glad that this VW community, while spirited at times, keeps respect for
others regardless of race, ethnicity or anything else for that matter.

 

Peace out, and I mean it!
