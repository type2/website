Subject: Dumb Question - Where's my M Code Plate?

Hi,
Sorry to bother the list with a dumb question, but I looked in the 
archives and in my 1978 bus and cannot locate the plate. I plan on 
repainting and want to confirm original colors.

The type2 site says the plate should be under the dash to the left 
side of the fresh air pipe, but I don't see it.
Can anyone guide me? Maybe send a pic of theirs so I can see if mine 
has been removed, by chance? Thanks in advance.
