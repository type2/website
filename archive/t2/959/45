"Thanks for tolerating the ramblings."  That sign-off brings back some
memories.  We not only tolerated your ramblings Charlie but relished them.
In a couple of weeks it will be 10 years since I got my bus and the
adventure started for me.  Still meaning to do that epic road trip some day
- always something getting in the way.

Great to hear from you again Charlie.
