I think that a pressurized swirl tank of about 2 liter capacity in-line
with the
engine water outlet with a pressure cap at the highest point prevents a
lot of problems.  Connect the overflow of the swirl tank with a
conventional overflow reservoir and you have a self-maintaining system.

Any air trapped in the system eventually ends up in the swirl tank.  When
the engine warms up and the coolent gets pressurized the air gets forced
out and bubbles up through the reservoir.  When the system cools, fluid
from the reservoir is pulled into the swirl tank, keeping the system full.

Since the swirl tank is the highest point in the system, the system is
under a bit of pressure all the time, preventing air from entering.

At least that's the way I see it working.
