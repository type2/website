Subject: '76 Bus Identification

Sorry to repost this, but I haven't hear any responses. I know one of you
encyclopedia-of-bus-knowledge-types knows what this sucker is! A little more
info, it was sold in '77 from a dealer in Yakima Washington as a "Volkswagen
Campmobile" if that helps.

Just trying to help her out a little and point her in the right direction.

Hopefully Chris can hook her up with an interior and a motor.

 

Thanks y'all.
