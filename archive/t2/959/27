Hi, everyone,

I hope this is an appropriate Friday post...

As a long-time lurker who finally has a Bus, I thought that by way of
introduction I'd let you all know that I live in cloudy Syracuse, NY, on
a 15-acre plot near the Thruway that we call Camp Swampy, which includes
a tumbledown barn that I call a garage. I am a lifelong car nut.

 MY wife & I drove VW's through the late 70's & the 80's, but haven't
had one in 20 years.

We're now the proud owners of our new "baby", a '71 station wagon that
I hope to have on the road as soon as salt season is over. The list
archives, Bus Depot, & thesamba have already been invaluable sources if
information & parts. As dear to my heart as my VW's have been (my first
car was a '70 Beetle) I wouldn't think of getting back into VW's without
these amazing resources.

I'l no doubt have questions later, but for now just wanted to make my
presence known & say "hi" & "TIA" to the list. 

We (wife & I) have a dream of heading West in 2017, following the track
of the total eclipse in August of that year, shooting for Denver, but
staying within 100 miles of the path of totality, in cade of
breakdowns.

That gives me 10 years to whip the Bus into shape!

Thanks for helping us with the dream,

Richard 
Syracuse,NY
