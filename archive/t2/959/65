Subject: Crane XR700 / SVDA

Well, I finally got around to installing my new SVDA (aircooled.net) and a
Crane XR700 points replacement this week. I've had the stuff since last
May.  Got everything in...no start. After some thought, I realized I had
to adjust the optical pickup sensor inside the distributor. Put engine at
7.5BTDC and slide the pickup around the bracket just until the diagnostic
light on the XR700 lights up. Still no start. I eventually realized the
engine was flooded due to my repeated attempts. Floored the accelerator
while cranking and it fired up....lots of blue smoke initially.

First thing I noticed was my tach was rock steady. I adjusted the timing
and it was spot on every revolution. Prior to this installation my timing
was all over the place and my tach was not steady. Not sure what was
causing that...points or the wobbly dogears at the bottom of the stock
distributor. I've never heard my idle so steady before. I know it doesnt
matter, but my dwell is 72!  I think this means my coil has longer to
charge up before discharging meaning a hotter spark. So far I'm very
pleased with the setup. I mounted my XR700 on the drivers side rear panel
just inside the engine compartment door. I chose this location because
last summer I checked temperatures at various places in the compartment.
Any place that was above the engine got real hot. The rear metal panel
just inside the engine compartment was always cool to the touch, even on
those 95+ degree days.  Now I need to see how my oil and CH temps do with
this new setup.
