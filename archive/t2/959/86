Interesting article, although I am distressed at the inevitable "hippy"
connotation the Bus always evokes.  My late mother drove Busses through the
1960s to the 1980s, when she was in her youthful prime.  It was not unusual
for a real hippie to flash the peace sign at her... But she was a housewife,
mother of three, and married to a ship-shape US Navy veteran.  Hippie
indeed!

(Not to mention that today, no shiftless hippie could possibly afford the
specialist maintenance required of our beloved "metal boxes"...)

However, be that as it may, I am delighted to see the notoriety and take it
as affirmation of my strange selection of a hobby.  I suspect more people
thought of themselves as "hippies in spirit" for the fantasy of dumping it
all for the freedom to chart one's own course.  And in that aspiration, I
guess I join them.

There is nothing better on God's green earth than the VW Type II to actually
visit, see and experience God's green earth.
