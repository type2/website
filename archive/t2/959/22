Subject: Now What... Idling troubles in a 78

Ok, I've been having battery problems, so I went and put a new battery in
the bus.  Stupid me, set the battery cables on backwards.. but just for a
"flash" ..  Well .. now the bus wont idle properly .. I tried to "reset" the
ECM by disconnecting it for a few seconds hoping that would make matters
better.. but alas, it did not.

 

So.. here's the situation..  Hector runs and drives fine.. Starts great..
but wont idle.

 

Suggestions?

 

Thanks guys.. 

 

Dave..
