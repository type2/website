Subject: Introducing ourselves and our latest Westfalia . . .

Greetings from Mesa, Arizona.  We are the proud new (but VERY old) owners of
an '82 Westfalia camper.  Bought it yesterday and will have pics available
soon.  We have named it "Lucky Seven," since this is our 7th Volkswagen
Camper.  It's been awhile since our last one, so we feel like we're starting
all over when it comes to finding all of the stuff we need to make it look
like new.  I'm sure we will have lots of questions within the next few months,
and it looks like we might have come to the right place for some of the
answers.
