Subject: Re: [T2] New Beam

OK, so I've got the "new" front beam outta the donor
bus an' on the bench (low bench...;-(
Everything seems OK (it was a "project" bus that was
left behind in a garage for some years) but the rubber
seals on the ball joints could be better...Anyone with
experience in replacing them wanna give me any tips?

Also, under the grease on one of the horns, was a let-
ter and number combo... Would this be original, or have
I got a replacement beam...The beam's at the shop so I
can't print it out at the moment...The beam was factory
black on a Mex-Beige Bus if that matters... 

Really a shame about the tree limb across the back of the
bus; else I'd've just swapped my engine into it and muoved
down the road... ;-(
