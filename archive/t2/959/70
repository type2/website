Dave, make sure the welds on the throw out bearing arms are intact. 
I've seen those break.  When you replace your clutch, have the clutch 
surface refaced on the flywheel it will make the new clutch engaged 
really smooth.

I would replace the throw out bearing while you're in there and also 
the input shaft seal in the tranny.  When you pull the flywheel 
replace those seals too.  Do it right while you have it apart.
