You are correct!  Don't put sealer on the head side of the gasket.

The cover side is a matter of debate.  I prefer not to use hardening
sealant on the covers, so I use Hylomar, which is hard to find these days
but can be purchased on the Internet or at savvy Harley dealers.  Makes
swapping gaskets a wipe-and-go operation.
