Your cable is broken.  You need to replace it.  Sometimes the cable breaks
a few strands, allowing you to adjust it back to function, then breaks all
the way the second time.

Use lots of grease while installing the new cable.  This keeps it working
easily and corrosion-proofs the tube through which it passes.
