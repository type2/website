Subject: RE: [T2] Dumb Question - Where's my M Code Plate?

From a thread on thesamba.com

"Mine on my 78 was on the air duct straight up from the clutch. It is hard
to see, but you can see the tip of the tag hanging over the air duct. It is
face up so you cant just read it. I used a dental mirror and could read it
real good that way. Keep looking, once you find it you will kick yourself. I
crawled around a bay floor for 30 mins until I found it. Good Luck!"

Hi,
Sorry to bother the list with a dumb question, but I looked in the 
archives and in my 1978 bus and cannot locate the plate. I plan on 
repainting and want to confirm original colors.
