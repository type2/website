Subject: Bus Identification

I just sold this bus to a very nice girl out here in CO. I am trying to ID
the bus as to the aftermarket modifier. I think it is a Riviera conversion,
but rare.

Just trying to help her out a little and point her in the right direction.
Hopefully Chris can hook her up with an interior and a motor.

 

Thanks y'all.
