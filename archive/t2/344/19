Sounds to me like a voltage regulator problem.  That's the only part that
has switches that can stick on.

IIRC, the GR-15 is a 30A bug generator.  A 12V bug voltage regulator is
what you need for replacement

If you switched from a 38A to a 30A generator did you change the tin and
the fan hub to match?  If you didn't, you may have belt misalignment
problems.
