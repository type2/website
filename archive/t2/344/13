Subject: save this splitty

Hi All,

I found a 66 split window pop-top bus for sale here in LaVergne, TN.  They 
want $400.  It has no engine or transmission  and probably missing some 
suspension in back and has quite a bit of rust underneith.  The nose is good, 
has both bumpers, interior, all glass.  The body does not look dented much - 
just rust near the bottom.  Too much work for me, but it is cute and should 
be saved.  I'd think they'd take less as it has sat there for a while.  
Anyway, although not a bay, it's a type 2.  email me and I'll send you 
directions to go look at it.

Take Care,
Jennifer
