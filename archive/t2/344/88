Subject: Re: [T2] top end update : rebuild?

Okay - maybe I'm missing something - it's happened before. <grin>

There is only oil in a couple of places in the top of the cylidner and head 
area: that's in the rocker cover area and in the push rod tubes.

If it is leaking between cylinders at the head end or the like I would have 
to wonder if the head was cracked and leaking from inside the rocker (valve 
cover) area - from inside.

If they did the push rod tubes and they are still leaking I'd demand some 
additional repairs or money back and then switch mechanics. (I'm just 
saying that a pushrod tube job is basic and shouldn't leak without much work).

There isn't hardly any oil (mostly a residue) on top of the piston (or 
shouldn't be) there should not be a leak between the top of the cylinder 
and head.

I'm with the listers and believe a leak down and compression test is in order.
