According to Those Who Know, honing cylinders and re-ringing is a Complete
and Utter Waste of Time.  Because of the horizontal layout of the engine the
cylinders tend to wear in an egg-shaped pattern and honing will NEVER get
them round again.  Besides, if you've only got 67K on the engine, unless its
been abused, it probably doesn't need it.  Have you had them do a
compression check yet?
