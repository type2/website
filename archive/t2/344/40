I would search the vintage Porsche/BMW/Mercedes sites. The 60's to early 
70's used Blaupunkts as stock and will fit the early VW dash, though only 
some of the cover plates will fit the Bus. Easy to make a nice plate from 
Lexan or wood, or cover with cloth of choice or fancy wood veneer. Lots of 
these sold on THE internet auction site.

Dont rule out a Becker if you find one, as good or better than Blue Dot. 
Just make sure the know spacing is correct and it will fit.

Wilford Wilkes can rebuild all Euro radios if you send him a good core.
