Type 1 engines and now I'm excited. Has anyone tried them?

Before you get too excited, consider that the cast aluminum valve covers
have to be precisely flat, and the head surface also has to be completely
flat to get a good seal.  The stamped valve cover has a bit of flex built
in so that it will even conform with a not-quite-flat head surface.  You
may be more leak prone with the cast covers!
