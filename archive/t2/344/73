$1140 is a lot of labor cost for swapping cylinder heads.

A "top end rebuild"?  No.

I thought his basic rebuilt engine was on the order of $2500.  That's not a whole lot more than what you are paying.

Are you talking about the cylinder head bolts?  These do not leak oil - they are not attached to anything that handles oil.  Oil leaks on the passenger side of the engine could only be from a few sources.  Base of the cylinders, pushrod tubes (either end), fuel pump, dipstick tube, thermostat cable pulley hole, valve cover gasket.  That's about it, assuming nothing is cracked.

Reality check - blowby will not be cured with a top-end rebuild!  Unless their idea of a top-end rebuild includes honing the cylinders and replacing the rings.

Now if they misspoke and really meant worn valve guides, then yes, that would be included in a top-end rebuild.

Why don't they do a proper diagnosis before asking you to make a decision?  Has anyone given this engine a COMPRESSION CHECK?  How about a leakdown test?  It should be a relatively simple matter to determine whether the smoke is the result of rings or valves and take the appropriate action.

Because it's "another grand", which is not exactly chump change, is it?  And would that be guaranteed to cure the nasty-blue-cloud problem?  Ask them.

I may get flamed for saying this, but if your existing heads have 50k miles or more on them, it is probably a good idea to have them rebuilt.  Aircooled motors run hot and exhaust valves can stretch and break.  But it sounds like they are using a different justification, if any.

Is there anything wrong with it?  If not, and it has been properly maintained... well I would leave it alone but you will have to make a judgement call on that one.  Some people just "feel better" knowing they have a fresh motor under the hood (or deck, in our case!).
