If the engine seems to be basically running soundly and with acceptable
power then I have to question whether it's worth $1,700 to deal with a
little puff of smoke in the morning and an oil leak.  That's a personal
judgment and different people will make different judgments based on their
own circumstances.  If you can afford to "lay up" the vehicle for a while,
and have the time and space and willingness, then I'd say try fixing it
yourself.  You could hardly end up spending any more money than $1,700.
