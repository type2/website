I think it was primered and painted then the caulk put in place.

A friend tells me that the original putty was made from cow's blood but it can no longer be imported because of BSE (mad cow disease).

The replacement he's using is Wurth's Fast Cure Flexible Seam Sealer. Like everything else Wurth, it's expensive to buy a lot of it.
