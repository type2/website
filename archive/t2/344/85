Who says this?  I have a friend that just did the hone/ring replacement dance and his engine runs like a top.  Great mileage and compression, no oil consumption.

If the cylinders are worn much at all, I wouldn't try and hone them.  People talk about "still seeing the hashmarks" in their high-mileage cylinders as if it was something special, but in my experience only engines that were seriously abused wear through the hash marks and become "oval".  I have several sets of 2-liter cylinders and they all show the hash marks clearly and uniformly.  I will of course check them for roundness before honing, but if the cylinders are in decent shape, I am convinced that it is okay to reuse them.  YMMV as always.

I agree with you there.
