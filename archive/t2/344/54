Again, thanks for the very many suggestions.

I did talk to Bugformance again and they hinted strongly that I should
call AVP.

They suspect a bearing that might be going bad.

I just dug up my warranty paper and will see if I can get to AVP
tomorrow. They don't have a habit of answering emails or messages left
on their 1800 number.
