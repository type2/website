Subject: Automatic choke question

Hey I am trying to get to the bottom of the problem I have with
acceleration and lack of power, and I forgot to mention that the previous
owner had the automatic choke disarmed because the connection to the right
carb broke off and he couldn't get it soldered on right.......
So, I double checked the disarming steps per Muir,   which is to loosen
the choke screws and turn until the butterfly valve is all the way open
and then tighten,  and then tape up the wire ends to prevent grounding
out.
Now I have no problems starting because it is not so cold here in Portland,
but someone mentioned wiring to be a possible problem leading poor
acceleration,  so is it ok to just leave the choke as is,  or could this
be a  part of the problem?
Oh yeah its a 73 stock engine dual solexes  etc.....
