I have to agree with the comments. This just sounds a little off to me.

Are you really sure about the job they are foing. It sounds like not
really.
Are we guessing they think the oil leak is being caused due to blowby?
If so maybe they should do a leakdown test to be sure before prescribing a
1700.00 remedy.

It looks from what you wrote that these heads were new 60,000 miles ago.
I think inspection before rebuilding. They very well could be fine.

If they just tightened the lower bolts and they were loose and then said
1700.00 next I think they are doing you a disservice. The engine really
should come out and be retorqued. The leak could be as simple as gaskets
or seals which would be cheap to do with the engine out.
Your compression is good so what besides the oil leak prompted you to
bring it in?

2L engines could fail early BUT many people get 200,000+ miles on them.

The bottom end is an unknown too. I would be hesitant to spend 1700 on
rebuilt heads and honed cylinders. You would be better served spending 3K
and having Raby rebuild it all. Ron sells AVP longblocks for 1100.00..
Food for thought.

Good Luck
