Subject: Re: [T2] blaupunkt (70 westy)

i put my radio on my scanner and scanned the side and front of it. it
came out of my 70 westy and has letters on it that i dont understand. i
think it is R, L and M, but i may be wrong. i believe it does say
blaupunkt, though (been over a month since i looked at it, so i forget),
but the 2 knobs have VW emblems on them. is this an american radio or
perhaps have i lucked into ANOTHER european car? i can e-mail these
images to anyone who might be able to help me...

thanks,
chris
