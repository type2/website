If you're going the paint stripper way, be sure to neutralize the stripper
after you're through stripping (Gypsy Rose...?-). I saw a Triumph that 
had been chemically stripped and all the seams were bubblin' and rustin'
from the inside...The heavy-bodied stripper may contain a waxy substance
that keeps it from evaporating too fast, but hides out in the seams and
prevents the new paint from adhering correctly...
