George,

I wanted to go into business at some ofths shows doing the gold plating 
thing....think about it.  You could have one of those machines that does
it on the fuse holder itself.

New ones that are gold plated sitting there ready to go....

A plating unit like the "detailers/dealerships" use to make "gold"
emblems and trim on your car.

We would all be finished with bad contacts on the fuse box after that!

Any enterprising souls out there that want to go into business for 
themselves?

What would you pay for a fuse box where all of it(except the plastic of 
course) was gold plated????

Cheers, dave
