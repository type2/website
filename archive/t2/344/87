Subject: Starter Wiring...

I have a 73 bus that blew a starter a couple weeks ago. I purchased a
replacement starter but I can't remember what wires go where... Do all
the big wires attach to the terminal on the solenoid? How can I tell
which push on connectors connect to what wire? Any help is always
appreciated!
