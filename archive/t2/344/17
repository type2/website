Subject: Generator Meltdown?

Hey now! I have a 69 bus with a 1600 single port with engine code AE.  I installed a new GR 15 generator and after a week my gen light came on and  orange plastic was melting out of the gen.   I have a warranty one to replace it but I don't want this to happen again.  At one point after turning my key off and pulling the key out my gen light stayed on!  I disconnected the Batt cable to get it to turn off.  Should I change my voltage reg and if so with what one, since the volt reg are different for the gr 15 and gr 17 generators.  Any help on this would be appreciated.  Peace Chris
