Looking at the cable end from the rear of the vehicle turn clockwise until 
there is about 3/16" of free play between the pedal all the way up and the 
pushing the pedal down where the cable gets tension on it.

Some cable ends have wing nuts on them and they can be adjusted with your 
hand, some have nuts. All will require a pair of vice grips to hold the 
cable to keep it from twisting.
