Subject: Re: [T2] Pep Boys

We've been going to Pep Boys for a long, long time and we've never had any
complaints with them. I don't go there for VW parts, but I don't think many
people would. About all they would have is a few items like bulbs and
rotors, dizzy caps, points. Still, if you need this kind of thing before AM
and you're regular parts house is closed, you will be glad that they are
there. And whatever they don't have they can usually get in a few hours. I
use a lot of different distributors for all different kinds of parts, and
experience has shown me that having a variety of sources is your best
guarantee to find the part you are looking for, and even getting it for a
better price.
If you just walk into a big auto parts store, all you see is polish, wiper
blades and those little scented things that hang from the rear view mirrors
of pimpmobiles. You have to go to the counter to get the goodies. I also
like NAPA and Trak.
Another good thing about Pep Boys, last I heard, was that they'll let you
dump your used oil there.
