What style is it? The early one is a long tube, the later one has an arm with a plastic float on the end that you can easily move by hand.

For the later bus style, set the VOM to read Ohms in the smallest range that covers 10-70 Ohms. Connect the VOM leads to the two connectors on top and slowly, sweep the float from one stop to the other while you watch the values change. If you don't get approx 10 on one end and 70 at the other, get no reading at all, or lose the reading at any point in the middle then the sender is bad. It works much like a light dimmer in concept.

It's much easier to see results on the old analog style of VOM that has a needle instead of a digital display. You can usually see the wear inside the sender where the wiper contacts the windings if you get erratic readings. You could try to spray electrical contact cleaner on it to get it work again but of the ones I've seen, they are usually worn not contaminated and require replacement.
