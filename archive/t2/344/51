You never know where you can find keys.  I tried all the regular places 
(locksmiths, etc.) for two years to find keys for my 71, then found a 
spare key when I took out the camper interior.  Then, while buying some 
paint at a tiny old hardware store 1 mile from my house, I noticed a 
key rack with some #'s that said vw, asked if they could make a key.  
They made 3 for a buck each.  They're out there.

  I've learned this is part of the fun of owning an old vw.  Parts pop 
up in the strangest places.  Best thing to do is let everyone you know 
at work and in your family and friends that you bought an old vw, and 
you'd be surprised at what kind of stuff comes to the surface.  Best of 
luck!
