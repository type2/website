Subject: Bugpack valve covers

 I finally got my hands on a bugpack catalog (#24) and noticed that shown on page 39 are Type 4 finned aluminum valve covers (4540) that bolt onto the rocker arms (no bails). I thought these were only available for Type 1 engines and now I'm excited. Has anyone tried them?
