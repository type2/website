Andy,

I am hurt...ya didn't even put a little smiley face after the statement.

You obviously haven't had the problems over the last 30 years with
corroded fuses holders that every time you want the windshield wipers
to work, you have to reach down and twist it a little so it makes good 
contact.

And I always clean mine with a wire brush dremel tool when restoring and 
try to bend them a little so they make *good* contact.

I'm just trying to think of a better way...that doesn't break the bank!

Cheers, dave
