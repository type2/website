The choke only provides extra fuel for the engine when it's cold. If it 
starts and runs okay then no damage done at all. On my '72 Italian spec 
Super Beetle I removed the choke plate and retained all the functional 
choke mechanism so I still had the fast idle mechanism. Worked great.

Could your carb be freezing? Do you have the stock air cleaner and heated 
air portion functional?
