Boy, that sure seems awfully expensive if you're only talking about
replacing heads.  For $1,275 you could get an entire rebuilt engine from Bus
Depot (I'm assuming a TypeIV engine here).  Figure $300 for freight and
consumables and you'd still have $125 left over if you could do the work
yourself.  Use the $125 to buy beer for your friends that help!  :-)

If we're only talking about doing the heads, then I'd expect on a job this
expensive that you'd get all new valve adjusting screws and all new pushrod
seals as well and the new valve cover gaskets, new fuel injector seals, new
boots for the connections to the air distribution box and new gaskets for
the head/air distribution tubes interface.  I'd want to know about the heads
themselves, i.e., new AVP heads (sounds like it) or, if rebuilt, rebuilt by
who?  And the warranty on these things?

I'm never quite sure what's included in a "top end rebuild" but at that
price I wouldn't be surprised if it included new P&C's.  If so, I'd want to
know if they will be doing a trial fit and measuring deck height or just
trusting that everything's OK and slapping the parts together.

Since this involves splitting the case, I'd think it would not be included
in any definition of a top end rebuild.

I'm confused here.  We're talking about some sort of air-cooled vehicle,
right?  As far as I know there's 4 top and 4 bottom nuts that hold the head
to the cylinders.  And the top 4 nuts/studs are outside the "innards" of
the engine so there's no way they could be leaking oil.  As far as I know,
most oil leaks from heads involves pushrod seals or valve cover gaskets.
Loose nuts on a head would result in poor compression and, I would think, a
characteristic noise.

Probably, that's were VW rebuilt the TypeIV engines for the American market.

Whole new engine.

I'd say you have a bottom end that has 67K on it.
