Subject: top end rebuild ?'s   dear lord... =(

I am having my top end rebuilt at the buslab in Berkeley this coming
Thursday and Friday. What are the questions I want to be sure and ask? 

Are you going to replace the ____ while your at it? 

Those types of questions. 

I don't know what should be included in that exactly, but the job is
going to run my about $1700 with rebuilt heads. The heads are supposed
to be a lot better than the AVP and the others I have found online, and
will run me about $280 a pop. 

Should this job include a new camshaft and matching lifters? 
I was just watching my Jake Raby video (ahh, if I could only afford one
of his lovely motors, dangit) and all of the stuff he has
redone/replaced, and not sure what I should be expecting out of my own
rebuilt guys. 

We decided on a top end rebuild because the oil leak I have right now
appears to be coming down from the passenger side head, but probably
from the top two bolts because we tightened the bottom two, cleaned it
up and ran it again, and again I had oil. Plus, the bottom ones weren't
out of spec when we checked. When I mentioned that when I fire it up I
get a pretty nasty blue cloud some days, that's when they said I had
blow-by, and while working on this one head might fix this, it could be
the other one, and a top end rebuilt would be the ideal fix for it,
although we could just work on this one head and see what happens when
were done. It would be about $700 for just repairing the one head,
replacing the gasket for it or whatever would stop that oil leak. 

So, its another grand to just do the whole thing, which is what I may
have to do anyway after the first thing mentioned is done, so why take
chances? 

After all of the talking, I am a little confused on why I would need new
heads when just needing to reseal it up nice, but I don't know jack
about these things, so ? 

The motor I have in it now has exactly 67,000 miles on it. It was sold
by VW of Canada as a new motor, but I suspect that perhaps it was an
official VW rebuild? 
I have the part number : 
VWA 039100031D/1 - NEW 2.0 75/79   - $747.29
VWA 039100031D/1 - NEW 2.0 75/79   - $747.29

For a total of 1599.20, and this was in 1988. 

It looks like he got $100 back on a core charge from this. 

Then, I found another receipt showing "install cust engine" for a cost
of $400 in labor, and $86 in parts. The parts are listed as 4 manifold
boots and a gasket set. 

Does this sound like it was a whole new engine being installed, or just
heads, given the prices, part numbers and parts listed? 

If the bottom end is actually the original original motors, and only the
heads were replaced last time, then the bottom end technically has about
195,000 miles on it, and I should probably be replacing it as well,
right? 

Thanks for any tips, thoughts, suggestions, or sympathy.
