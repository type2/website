Subject: Honing cylindars

Well now we have done it, started a new thread. Well
now I have been refurbishing cylinders for many a year
with nothing but excellent results, the only hard part
of the whole thing is to remove the ring land so as
not to break the top ring. Hone to a nice cross hatch,
install new rings, making sure the end gap is good,
clean, oil and install, most of them done right will
get over 100,000 miles the second time around. Phil
(O.K. I'm ready for the blasting)
