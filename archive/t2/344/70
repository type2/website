Subject: FUSES

 I never really took notice of the fuses that closely. Of the new ones I have, 16A and 25A are copper but the 8A look brass-colored. The 16A and 8A fuses seem to have the same thickness in the middle so I would guess that the different metals are required for different current ratings. Maybe a copper 8A fuse would be too fragile.
