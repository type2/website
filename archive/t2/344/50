I taught my wife to drive my bus when we only had 1 car.
I would drive it 50 Miles round trip for my day job and she would drive it 50 
Miles round trip for her night job.
She insisted if it would "go" 75 then why couldn't she drive it that fast all 
the time.
The engines didn't last as long in those days as they do now that I am the 
sole driver.
I never let her drive it anymore which is what she wanted in the first place!
