Subject: Re: [T2] Removing hubcaps

Use the hubcap puller Ron's talking about. It's just a bit of steel wire,
but as he said is indispensable.

What I do is stick that thing in the hubcap holes, then take whatever
screwdriver I have handy and stick it through until the blade end is on the
edge of the rim (not touching the rubber of the tire). Then pry. It pops the
cap right off. No muss, no fuss.

I bruised my finger trying to just pull on that thing. That was the first
and last time I did it without a screwdriver as a prybar.
