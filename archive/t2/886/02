I remember when I was driving my new-to-me bus home 400 miles from Reno to
SoCal.  I basically just kicked the tires and lit the fires!  I did have
a little safety factor along, in the form of my Dad driving behind in his
Chevy just in case something fell off.

Other than a rather wonky steering box, everything went smoothly.  I was
surprised at the peppy performance of the bus, cruising easily at 65 at
half throttle.

After an hour or so, my Dad comes on the radio and asks if we can
please drive a bit faster than 50MPH.  That was my first introduction to
the rather optomistic qualities of vintage VW speedometers!

Would I have done it solo?  Probably, but that was a trip that I knew very
well, with nowhere that was more than one AAA tow from an aircooled VW
garage.  It was a lot more comfy with another vehicle along.
