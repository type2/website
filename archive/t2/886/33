Man! I suck! I looked all over Bus Depot and could NOT find it!?
 

Don't feel bad, I often have that problem with their website. The other day
I was looking for the luggage rack seal with the bulb (my Westy is one of
the 1% that has the luggage rack vibration at highway speeds-funny how
every Westy I've owned has been in that 1%) Anyway, I couldn't find it in
with the regular pop top seals and had to call them to find out where it
was located. I plan to trim the bulb portion off the sides to allow for
drainage, but I can't stand the noise any more! An otherwise pleasant
cruise down Skyline Drive in Virginia last weekend was made miserable by
that damn luggage rack vibrating. I've tried everything I can think of to
stop it and can't. This was NOT a slam on Bus Depot, you guys are great!

(Another problem is I am using a s-l-o-w dial up connection)
