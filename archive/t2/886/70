Subject: &*%^$#$$  Heater Boxes, U-Pipes and exhaust leaks. Gotta be

Ok I'm fed up with rusted, crap heater boxes, U-pipes with corroded rusty
crumbling flanges and numerous exhaust leaks. Screw this! I just spent 6 hrs
cutting off rusted bolts and nuts and installing a new muffler. Now the &*^%$$
U-pipe on the other end is leaking around a crumbling gasket, probably because
I flexed the system too much while trying to fit on the crap muffler that
didn't line up well. I could buy all brand new stuff, but let's get real, 1000
plus bucks???

So what are my options? Do we have J-tubes available to replace the whole
stinking heater box system? I don't care about heat anymore, I have Mr. Heater
etc. I want a DEAD SIMPLE exhaust system !!! What's out there to fit my 77
Westy that won't hang down too low etc? and might actually NOT leak!!!????
Disgustedly yours,
Courtney
