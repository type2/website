Replace your brake hoses first! If you had your rear brakes lock up and you
cannot release the front caliper, there is a very good chance that your old
ruber hoses are swollen shut. They may look good from the outside, but if
they are 10 years old or the bus has been sitting for a few years - replace
them right now. They are cheap and can solve a lot of "caliper" or "master
cylinder" problems.

Rust on the rotors is no big deal - your pads will machine it off for you.
If one side is shiny and the other is rusted, then you do have a caliper
problem ...
