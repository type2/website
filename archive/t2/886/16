	But what does it cost compared with the solution I've found 
fine?  As mentioned to youse within this past fortnight,

		Stopping leaks from that engine compartment is 
essential to good cooling of the engine.  But the official gasket is 
needlessly expensive compared with a yard or so of Armathane 
(Armstrong corp of Canada) closed-cell foam crammed in all around the 
gap.  This material is sold as exterior thermal insulation for 
hot-water pipes.
