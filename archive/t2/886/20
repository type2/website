I certainly won't argue with Richard ;-)) , but if the foam model is

http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=411813225 and goes around a vanagon 83 type 4 engine, I did not have to crawl even once.
I gently insert the seal in the gap from the engine top, I  inserted the tins (side 1)  first trying to keep the other side (side 2) above the tins, than    I insert downright the road side (side 2) of the seal with my finger, and then put the engine side (side 2) upright. 

Here what I did , this is a cross section of the seal.

      1       =====    2
              =====
        =================
              road side


Once installed I had
