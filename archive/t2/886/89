I can help you with the crumbling gasket / messed up
gasket surfaces part of it all. A few weeks back I mad
this recommendation to somebody else. I have used it
for years and won't leave home without a tube of
Vicotr Muffler Mender. It's in a primarily orange tube
at many FLAPS. Don't get the Permatex stuff - it's
tar-like substance that I can't figure out how to
use... The Victor stuff is the consistency of
toothpaste and you just smear it on the surface(s) to
be joined, tighten them up, wait for it to cure (I
prefer to let it set overnight when I can) and your
leak is no longer leaking. It looks like a weak
ceramic type product. If you're "just getting by" and
don't much care what it looks like, if you have to
pull it apart again you can clean the stuff all off,
back down to clean metal, or you can just smear some
more on there, but eventually you'll need longer
bolts! The stuff works. It's great! Try it and you
won't fret nearly as much over all that "stuff!" -BaH
