I have on my 78 used J tubes (made from a 72-74 heater box). and the Bus
Depot sold stainless muffler for the 72-74 bus. it has worked reliably for
over 5 years and except for a place where one of the J tubes cracked and
needed welding I have not had any trouble with the system.

as far as I know all parts are still avaliable.
