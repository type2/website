You ought to seal the holes and the cutaway - I agree
with Don, except I like pop rivets! His way is more
easily reversible. Consider also that cooling air
comes out of the bottom left and right sides of the
fan housing into the heat exchangers. If the heat
exchangers are beyond repair / never going to be used
then you might consider duct taping those trap doors
shut also (Not the main flaps!) This will provide
better cooling to the engine. -BaH
