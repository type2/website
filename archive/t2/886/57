Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof in a Bay westy bus

Hello Greg, you asked about putting a sunroof in a Westfalia. I have
done this in my 1971 ex- westfalia. The early bay westfalias had the
track for the sliding metal sunroofs, so I found one at one of the used
parts places and mounted it up.  Problem was, it leaked, and since the
bus didn't have the sunroof from the factory, it lacked all the drain
tubes, etc. to make it work right. What I did was slide the sunroof back
in it's slot and mounted a smaller fibergass pop top over the hole with
bungee cords and jeep hood hold downs. No more leaks on the rainy days,
and if it's sunny, I pull off the pop top and cruise. If you go this
route, make sure you get two good sunroof cables (left and right are
different), as they are unobtainium. On the later bays, there was no
track for a sunroof. Someone on this list has done a hatch arrangement,
like some of the splitty campers had, or you could get a piece of
plexiglass slightly larger than the hole and reinforce the edges with
aluminum strips. Marine supply houses carry the hinges and hold downs
you would need to make this work. Have fun and good luck! Aloha, Timo
