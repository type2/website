Follow-up.  My T2 is a 78 Federal 2.0 Liter.  I don't
find the `down pipes` available anywhere.  They have
been referred-to as the `J Tubes.`  Have not looked
extensively.  Adam Cox took his 78 T2 to a mechanic
some months ago, and the mechanic stated there was
still a supplier for this item.
   
Where?  Part Number?
