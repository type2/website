  in the mean time take the one you got and have someone barely touch it with a welder til busdepot gets you a new one.....it will hold for a bit or should jus make sure that they dont make it thick and keep the weld small if its not to bad crumbly to even weld...?
   
   
   
  good luck and dont forget to read the bentley on this subject....
  the bentley tells you exactly what to do here....

  Hey guys,

I just removed the stick shift column in my Bus to clean up that area and
try to adjust the shifter based on some information I got from this list. But,
after removing the shifter, I discovered that the plate that goes between the
shifter and the floor, is actually broken. It looks REALLY worn out, and it's
actually cracked in one corner. The sides look really worn down as well. Does
anyone know where I might be able to get a new one?


Thanks!

Todd
