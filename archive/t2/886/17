when my wife wanted a new car we had a number of specs, and one of the
things was that if it was possible to get it without being automated we
would, she didn't want power windows even when they tried to give it to
us free.  the knobs are a lot more reliable to crank that window up and
down.  we did get auto tranny and all the things that have given us
trouble is these "electronic" stuff.  her Tack vibrates even after the
engine is off,  not hard but it is electronic flutter, every time it has
failed it was electronic,.  (bus content) knock on wood but I have had to
rescue her in the 99 more times than she has rescued me in my 78 bus

I bought the manual for her's and it has more places than I can count that
say, skilled factory service required.   even changing the rear brake
shoes takes a special tool to reset the antilock system.
