	The Brazilian experience amounts to more than all the rest of 
the world put together.  Have we no Brazilian correspondents?
	Here in NZ we had limited research on ethanol, and methanol, 
in various admixtures with petrol, during the late 1970s.
	The straight fuels E100 & M100 are not normally called 
'leaner-running', but that may be one way to put the fact that in 
order to achieve proper mixtures the jets must be much bigger on 
these neat alcohols.
	As for blends, often E10 or M10, differences in carburetion 
are minimal if significant at all.

	E10 or E15 is widely available in N. Amer.  Some CHT fans 
could do some measurements while plugging across them prairies.
