Subject: Sunroof in a Bay westy top

Hi Volks,

has anyone put a sunroof in a bay west top? I'm thinking of a  
smaller, flush-mounted hatch with a clear glass cover. The Vanagon  
westy's had a webasto runroof option from the dealer and I am  
thinking it would be a nice addition to a bay in order to improve  
ventilation when parked or in transit. Sure works well in the vanagon!

Happy trails,
