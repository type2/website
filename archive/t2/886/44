Subject: hot air tubes

i am having trouble finding the oval shaped tube on the passenger side of
the van from the heater fan.  i have a 78, fuel injected.   do i really need
this peace if i dont plan on having heat?  i am actually missing all of the
hoses and connectors on the passenger side of the hot air blower.   the
control flaps, and the heat exchangers are both rusted and the controll
flaps are just hanging there.  i am gonna remove these completely and block
of those hoses going into the cabin of my bus.  do i need to do anything to
the rusted ends of the heat exchangers, remove the heat exchangers all
together or leave them on and just leave the open hole? i live in georgia
and heat isnt really an issue with me at all. i never use the heat in my
toyota, and i never use the heat in my home either.  i need some advice.
