No, but you need to seal the hole in the heat exchanger. And the heat will
work fine on the freeway, just not at idle.

Use aluminum flashing and silicone, or aluminum "bumper repair" tape. I've
got the tape on the Guac right now.

If the other tube is sticking up into the engine compartment you need to
seal that as well.
