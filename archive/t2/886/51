I wouldn't do any welding unless you're going for a perfect resto. Aluminum
roofing flashing is amazing stuff. Make a cardboard template of the right
shape and size, transfer it to the aluminum, use your most beat up pair of
scissors and cut. Make sure you leave a lip of around an inch. Apply some
RTV to the edges of the opening (hence the lip on the aluminum) and put it
in place.

I find a couple large magnets work to hold it while the RTV cures to be
handy, but tape works too.

The nice thing about this method is it's completely reversable. Scrape the
RTV off and you're right back where you were.

I seriously doubt any busses were sold without heat. At least not in the
past several decades. But I honestly don't know. VW has done some strange
things...
