Hi Richard
Yes , you install (insert) it from the top of the engine (don't need to 
go underneath), you may have to move a few stuff on your way to ease the 
seal passage, like the air filter and wires.
remember when you install it to "elongate" the seal , so that you won't 
be short to join the two ends.
