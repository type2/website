If you're never going to use the heat, seal off any
holes into / out of the engine compartment. This will
improve the cooling of the engine.

Closing off the passages that I mentioned earlier,
from the bottom of the fan housing (T4 motor) to the
heat exchangers will increase the pressure / flow to
the engine cooling as none will be wasted going to the
heat exchangers.

If the engine tin is for an AC version, I think the
bottom plate is different also and there may be a
gaping hole where the compressor was. You may need to
shop for one or two pieces of "normal" tin to keep the
pressure of cooling air up where it needs to be. I
simply do not remember which pieces were different on
the AC version or how different they were. Hope this
helps. -BaH
