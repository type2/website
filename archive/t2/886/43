Okay my bushing part numbers are 211.405.317 B (weird SK thing) Fd

I'm also one of those well I'm gonna try it anyways and see kind of people.
After seeing the busboys tool, I think that allthread is the way to do it.
Especially if I have most of the parts I need already here.

thanks for all the info, if the weather holds I should be doing the work
tomorrow.
