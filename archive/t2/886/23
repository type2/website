Hi Mark,

Your posts will be missed. But from the gist of them I am pretty sure  
another bus will find you eventually.

One question: Does the guy who got Peregrine for free know that it  
will cost him $5,000???


Happy trails,

To all on the type 2 list:

This list has been a major part of my life for almost ten years.  
Sometimes I posted far too often, and other times I just lurked. But  
always I shared with most of you the cantankerous pleasure of owning  
and maintaining a hunk of iron from another era.

In the end, though, it became a liability that I had to jettison.  
Yesterday, I gave Peregrine away and in a couple of days I will  
unsubscribe from the list for the foreseeable future (I won't say  
"for good," because who knows?).

But the finest thing that happens on this list, year in and year out  
-- the thing that happened to me and happened to many of you too --  
is that moment when, with lots of help from lots of people, someone  
gets their bus to start, and then to run, and finally to go out for a  
drive. Over and over again, that has happened.

And that's the best thing. Everything else is a footnote

Mark
