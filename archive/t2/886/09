Subject: RE: [T2] engine seal how to

Your talking the foam part that goes around the engine?

No, you really do not need to remove the engine, you just need to lower it a
bit and then put it on.

One tip that helped me was find the middle of the foam and the place that at
the middle of the engine in the back and work your way around to the front.
That way the two ends are at the front and it helps you know that it's on
correctly.

This was on my 2.0l 78 Bus.
