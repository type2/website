Subject: Pround & Broke

Most of you on these lists have know me for a number of years either in
person or through the net. Most of you know Kelly Irene Aka Punk my daughter
from shows or pics of her working in the shop. Well I'm proud to say last
nite she graduated from ECPI College Of Technology in Greensboro. Certified
Medical Assistant was what she took. Thats why she had been missing some
shows and not helping out in the shop much. Hopefully now she can do her own
thing and not take the road I did with my line of work. Also she might take
care of my butt when I'm old and grouchier,LMAO. Sorry for the wasted
bandwidth, Grin.
