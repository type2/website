Subject: Re: [T2] hot air tubes

Hey Don, I have a similar situation with my Bus. The engine compartment 
seems to have a lot of holes in a few places. I have these two large open 
holes which I assume are for the heat. I don't have a fan motor in there 
either (didn't come with the car). It also appears as thoug my Bus might 
have had A/C at one point because part of the sheet metal on the drivers 
side of the rear most part of the engine compartment was cut away (right 
next to the vin that's stamped there, although, that is still there). I 
wasn't aware of just how important it is to get a perfect seal in the engine 
compartment. I'm probably going to try to weld something in there before I 
try to start the bus for the first time.

Are there any other ways to seal up those holes in the tin? Did they ever 
offer a Bus without heat? I live in South Florida so it's unlikely that I 
would ever need it. I wonder if anyone makes a rubber grommet or something 
that'll snap right in those holes?

Do I actually have to seal up the part that comes right off the heat 
exchanger? I don't have a tube coming through the tin or anything...

By the way, I just read the story about your trip last month... pretty 
interesting stuff!


Thanks!

Todd
