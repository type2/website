Thanks George, I'll check out McMaster-Carr... I always forget that they 
exist but they seem to have everything like that.  Good news and bad news, 
the good news is that I didn't see any new Volkswagen Busses in the 
junkyard. The bad news is that there were no new Volkswagen Busses in the 
junkyard.

I was hoping to get a few things... oh well... maybe next week.
