Unless you can find some all-thread with very fine thread, I don't think
your puller idea will work. The bushes are really in there tight and I
cannot see getting them out with an "all-thread and washers" home-made
puller. The dimensions of the needed tool will work against you, the larger
a piece of all-thread, the coarser the thread, and the nuts will not fit
into the bore. A useful (and free) home-made tool can be made by grinding
most of the head off the old pin, so there is a step on the pin slightly
smaller that the OD of the bushing. Then you can wallop this driver with a
giant punch made from heavy steel rod. Getting the bushes out is definitely
not easy and the bus-boys tool is probably well worth the rental cost and
wait. The last time I did this job without a tool it was about one solid
hour of hammering to get the bushes in and out, and you are upside down,
hammering against gravity with a heavy hammer.  On top of that, unless you
have a hoist or super-high jack stands, there is very little room to swing
the hammer so you can't offer up much force to the blows.
