Subject: 1982 Vanagon Westy for Sale, $6,000CDN Certified.

Location: Toronto, Ontario.

This vanagon has been in my family since 1997. My parents owned from  
then through spring 2005, selling it to the brother of my wife's  
friend last June in order to trade up to a 1985 auto westy. The new  
owners took it to the Yukon for a 4-month expedition, and have asked  
my help to find it a new home this year as they have just acquired a  
new house. It shows some wear and tear from its 195,000 miles, but is  
in good repair and ready to travel anywhere.

It's originally from California, and has not been winter driven. It  
has been carefully attended to, and has many helpful upgrades like  
the 1972-74 exhaust install, a 6-speaker stereo, and rear shoulder  
belts with child seat anchor points. The air-cooled 2L fuel-injected  
engine was rebuilt at 95,000 miles and has had both cylinder heads  
replaced within the last 50,000 miles. It starts easily in all  
weather, it makes good heat. There's also a CB radio, cup holders, a  
custom dash console and there are brackets on the roof to support a  
yakima gutter-mounted roof rack. It has a 4-speed standard transmission.

Potential American buyers will note that the speedometer is in miles,  
so importing the vehicle into the US will be no problem.

The factory camping equipment is in good repair. It still has the  
original one-window canvas with no tears. Up top there's also a  
dealer installed webasto runroof to let extra light and air into the  
vehicle. The tires are Kumho 185R14 in the correct load rating. They  
are well-worn, but there is sufficient tread to pass safety  
inspection easily. The alternator is less than a year old, and the  
fuel tank was replaced 2 years ago. It's a good solid everyday driver  
looking for the right new family to go camping with.

I'm giving the lists first crack at this. If not sold beforehand it  
will be shown at the June Jitterbug car show in Niagara Falls next  
weekend. If it's still unsold after that I'll place it on TheSamba.com.

Happy trails,
