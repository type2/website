Oh! I see, so there are really quite a few more items than they have listed. 
Man, I should have checked to see if he had the entire shifter assembly. 
Although, what I have is ok I suppose.

Bus Boys has a pretty decent parts listing, but their ordering process is 
somewhat of a hassle. I still like ordering from them. I've found CIP1 to be 
pretty good too. Like I had mentioned to someone else on here, it seems that 
each of these places shines in their own area. Like, I got a really nice 
exhaust system from Bus Depot, a nice wiring harness from Bus Boys, lots and 
lots of good stuff from Busted Bus, and a lot of little things from CIP1. 
Plus, all my rubber seals, and chrome trim is from West Coast Metric.
