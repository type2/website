	Have I stumbled on an exotic failure, or is it relatively well known?

	At 5 am in pouring rain, the wipers on my '73 Devon failed. 
In what seemed at first merely a cruel coincidence, the headlights 
also failed: sidelights were available, but no headlights except the 
full beams by holding the dip/turn lever up continuously.  My 
quartz-halogen full beams offpissed quite a few drivers coming the 
other way, so I let go of the lever when they flashed their full 
beams at me.
	Then I noticed that the wipers would come back on every 
*second* haul on the dip/turn lever.  Still no dipped beams  ...
	It's as if the dip control works thru a relay that has 
somehow become connected to the wiper control circuit.
	I'm not particularly wanting to earn the title 'most exotic 
T2 electrical failure'.  Has anyone experienced this peculiar 
wiper/lights interaction, and found a fix?
