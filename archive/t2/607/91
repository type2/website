Subject: Re: [T2] Tire fart for Don

The book at Pep Boys said: Load C, reinforced sidewalls, max weight
1975 (-at-) 52psi. The book unfortunately didn't state the ply rating.

They're Daewoo's and all the printing on the tires is in Chinese. They
were $35 each (!) and the last 2 they had. The guy wasn't sure if he
was going to get any more.

There was a signifigant difference in the handling of my bus once they
were installed.

They certainly weren't my first choice, but it was an emergency since
I had a blowout and no spare, but I was across the street from PepBoys
when it happened. I had about $100 on me at the time and was able to
get 2 tires for that amount. Much better than getting one good one on
the same axle as a tired old car tire.

When I can afford it I'll get all 4 matching name brand tires. But
that worked for now, and they'll remain my spares.
