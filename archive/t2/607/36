Subject: I need a VW mechanic in Oakland, CA

Hi volks,
Proud to say I just purchased a 72 Westy over the www.

The bus is in Oakland, near the Coloseum, and I will
be flying up there and driving it back here to Los
Angeles.
I bought it through a reseller, and while the car is a
driver, he says it needs a tune up.
So, I need a good ACVW shop to give it a tune and a
front-to-back inspection/safety check before I get in
and drive it 500 miles.

Does anyone have a shop in Oakland they can recommend
I take it to? One I can trust?

Much Appreciation.
Jason
