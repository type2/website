Subject: Cushion measurements?

I can't seem to find any measurements to work with for the fold out
bed in my 73 Westy. I have the seat itself, but not the rear cushion
that goes over the engine compartment. Can anybody help?

Here's the measurements I got off the seat:
Bottom: 46" x 22"
Back: 46" x 19"

Do those sound right? Thickness on both should be 6" IIRC. But what
about the rear? 5" thick?

Thanks!
