Subject: Jammed starter?

One solution that worked for me was to swap the starter from another bus
that had a starter made for automatic transmission (without the nose on the
gear).

>> While the behavior indeed sounds like it could have been the hot-start
solenoid problem, we have noticed one piece of contrary evidence: whenever
we pushed the bus (in any gear) there was a repetitive "clunking" (and
correspondingly a repetitive "resistance" of the car to being pushed). This
seems to be good evidence for the starter being jammed against the teeth of
the flywheel, rather than having anything to do with the solenoid. Muir
suggests that this has to do with the mounting of the starter motor itself.

>> Has anyone else had this specific problem? What's the recommended fix?
Can
the starter be removed without dropping the motor?
