Subject: Confirm my carb diagnosis ?

Pict 3 carb on a 1600 type1 in my 1971 van.

The engine is new (700 miles) but running hot - 100 Degrees C - according
to my oil VDO temp gauge.

I have re-built the carb with a new set of seals and am happy it is bolted
down correctly. All cooling flaps are in and functioning. Timing is
correct. Brakes aren't dragging. Idle is nice and the van runs well.

I think the problem is that I am running lean but when I tweek the mix
screw (the little one below the idle screw) to tune it as in Bentley, it
makes no difference. I can turn that screw untill it falls out to no
effect. The screw does have a new O-ring on it. The idle speed screw works
fine.

Does this mean that the bushings in the carb are likely to be worn and
letting air in ? I'm looking at replacing it but if anyone has any other
suggestions, let me know. I'd appreciate a copy of your reply to my home
address phil(-at-)pagenumberone.co.uk as weill as I'm not in the office
tomorrow.

UK Listees - Any experience with the carb sold by German, Swedish & French
car parts ? I know my local branch has one on the shelf so if I need it, I
can get it.
