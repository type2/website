Subject: Re: [T2] Fire Extinguishers, engine fires

I have had two engine fires in my Sunbeam Tiger, never one in my bus. The 
first was caused
by a pinhole in the carb float. The float filled with gas,sank and so the gas 
never shut off,
the electric fuel pump kept pumping and the gas overflowed onto the engine 
and caught
fire. When the smoke started coming out around the edge of the hood, I turned 
the key off,
grabbed the little 1/2 lb. Halon extinguisher from the glove box, jumped out 
of the car and
raised the hood. When I did that all hell broke out, the flames jumped up 
about 6 feet high.
But 2 quick puffs of that Halon aimed at the top of the engine and that fire 
was out
immediately. Halon is amazing stuff. The great part about it is absolutely no 
mess to
clean up. I was lucky I  put it out quickly with minimal damage. A new float 
and new
sparkplug wires and she ran great.
   About 3 years later the second fire was similar to the first.  The car has 
sat without
being started for many months. The carb bowl went dry, the float sank to the 
bottom of the bowl and I think the needle valve got stuck in the open 
position. When I fired it up and
went for a drive the bowl soon overflowed onto the engine and the fire 
started. I stopped,
grapped the extinguisher, and raised the hood. The fire lept up and I sprayed 
 and it was soon out.  The big problem was I used one of those white powder 
extinguishers. What a
mess!! White powder everywhere. It took forever to clean that stuff up.
   No more white powder extinguishers for me. I carry a small 1 1/4 lb. Halon 
in my bus.
It's kind of expensive but believe me, you will be a much happier person if 
you have one
when you fire breaks out........
