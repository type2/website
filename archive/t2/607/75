Subject: Re: [T2] BayWindow Toys ever made?

I have 2 larger Bay Window bus models- about 6" long- a CKO REPLICA bus
(looks like 68-71) and an AVON cologne bus (late bay, red, with flame
decals on side) with cologne still in it- the screwtop is a rear
motorbike on a carrier. Also have a made in England Matchbox series #23 
poptop bus "Volkswagen Camper" that looks like early bay- worth
anything?
