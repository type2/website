Subject: 71 Blown Engine?!?!?

>> I had this same thing happen to my beetle while
driving it.....the oil light came on ......loss of
power and then quit........got out and oil was
everywhere..........dripping from under it and all
over the deck lid..........if you find out what it was
or happen or the fix i would appreciate knowing.

On the other hand, my wife's 71 Super did this when #2 cylinder blew.
Rebuilder forgot the forget-me-nots. With no compression, blowby pressure
spattered oil ALL over the engine comparment.
