Late model Bay:

Brekina, 1/87 (kombi, panel, highroof, singlecab)
AWM, 1/87 (singlecab only)
Siku, ca 1/64 but too wide (kombi, crewcab)
Majorette, ca 1/64 (kombi, panel)

Early model Bay:

Wiking, 1/160 (kombi, panel)
Wiking, 1/87 (discontinued, kombi, panel, singlecab)
Cursor, 1/40 (kombi, panel, highroof, singlecab, crewcab)
