Subject: Late Bay Fridge

I'm trying to get the camping electronics on my 76 working again including the
fridge.  I found this helpful article in the library
http://type2.com/bartnik/fridgediag.htm but have an additional question.
On the top of the converter there is a large white switch that says BATT /
CONV.
I'm assuming this switch is not intended to be used on a daily basis since it
is burried under the wooden cover secured by screws.
Anyone know what this switch is and the standard position?
The article refers to a breaker but I wasn't sure if it meant this switch or
the one outlet face.
Thanks,
Mike
