Subject: Alternator Interchange?

Ok, I finally got some cash together so tomorrow I'm ripping my tin off to get down to my dead alternator, then I'm going to Napa to get a new one. But I'm not that silly. I just KNOW their not gonna have it. So what all other Alternators can be made to fit into a 1976 FI bus? EASILY! I'm not trying to restore to factory condition or anything. It's my daily driver and I just want it back up and being dependable. :) 

TIA 
Chris
