yes.

we sell a very good repair kit for the stud bosses in the event you have to
drill out and re-thread. it is the same type of insert used by most machine
shops.

i use these inserts myself and they are bulletproof. they will not back out
like a helicoil will due to an ingenious design. an exhaust stud boss
repaired properly with these inserts is better than new.

it is rare to be able to get a broken stud out with an ez-out. ez-out is a
total misnomer, they don't work at all on busted studs.
