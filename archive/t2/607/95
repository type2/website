Subject: Brakes applied?

Vincent:

I had this exact thing happen about 5 years back on my 73 Porsche.  The 
flexible rubber lines began to break down internally so that the liner 
material would flake off and act as a check valve for the brake fluid.  
When I applied the brakes, they would work fine, but when I let up, the 
liner material would not allow the brake fluid to retract, causing the 
brakes to bind.  It was an easy fix, installing new flex lines.  The 
hard part was paying for them since they were for a Porsche.

Good luck
