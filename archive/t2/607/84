Subject: Brakes applied?

Odd thing, I am driving happily along when suddenly I feel the Bus under a  
slight load, as if the brake is being applied slightly. Rarely happens, but is  
happening more often. I am concerned. I want to take it to my favorite 
mechanic,  but it may be nothing. I just had the brakes redone all around in May. 
Could it  be that the brake fluid hoses need to be replaced?
 Any advice will be appreciated
