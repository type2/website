Subject: Charging a battery in situ

Barry ---
           Generally speaking, you run the risk of transients when connecting a 
charger or jumping.  I'm not talking about people who move from place to place 
frequently, but short-lived voltages well above the nominal voltage of your 
system.  In the days before computers, the system could tolerate higher 
voltages for a short time; but if you have a fuel injection system -- and 
remember the Type III circa 1969 was fuel injected -- you can damage the 
semiconductors inside the control system.  These are very efficient at what 
they do, but they are not generally tolerant of transient high voltages.

Play it safe: Pull the ground off the battery before you connect a charger to 
it.  Or, if you frequently charge the battery, go to your FLAPS and get the 
kind of disconnect switch that fits on a battery terminal.

Regarding your question about the second battery, the most likely case is that 
the connection limits the current.  The second battery is probably not 
installed with large cables, or perhaps the terminals are corroded.... anything 
that offers resistance to current flow would account for what you describe.

Battery DEAD - 8 months old.  Probably some amperage drain caused this. 
(DEAD = reading LESS THAN 1 Volt!!).

Question:  What might be wrong/bad/danger of  attaching a 10 amp Battery 
Charger to the starting battery while the battery is still connected to the 
system.       That is, just putting the BC positive cable to the battery's 
positive post/cable(s) and the BC negative cable to the battery's negative 
ground post/cable??

Also, I have a newish 2 month old deep cycle battery on the driver side that 
reads over 12 volts.  For some reason, this is not helping to start the VW.  
Should the deep cycle battery kick in to take over from the passenger side 
battery??

Also, should I disconnect the fully charged deep cycle battery while I am 
charging the passenger side battery?? (Yes/No - vote now!!)

Thanks.
