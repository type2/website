I can make molds and cast in fiberglass if someone has some originals
I can use to make the molds with...

The fiberglass stuff isn't really cheap, the shark I made in the
following pic cost about $7 worth of materials. That pic was taken
before I cleaned it up.

I have latex rubber to make molds with, and can look into different
materials (ceramics? cheaper plastics?) to use with it...
