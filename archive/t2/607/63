Very true although it's quite a drive from Oakland compared to Buslab. I think Buslab is the way to go.

Volks Authority primarily restores vintage beetles. They hardly have any Type 4 parts in stock and if you call ahead to book an appointment I would bet you'll get refered to BugFormance in Sunnyvale or Peninsula Automotive in Campbell.
