Johnny Lightning has been threatening to cast Bay's for a couple of years
now -- but just hasn't come through with it. Bays are in their current
"Casting Call" list (though they seem to think Bays are only a '70 - '79
vehicle).

The only Bay Window toys I have are N scale (1:160) vehicles that I found
on Ebay a year or two ago (at about $8.00 for a model the size of my pinky
finger).
