Scott Lyons got me wise about aftermarket exhaust studs since they are not the same as the ones the dealer sells. The threads aren't the right size despite being advertised as 8x9x56. I measured some genuine studs recently:

Your stud should measure up to the 6 studs on the left. The ones on the rights aren't 8x9 so ignore those in the photo.
