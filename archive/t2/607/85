Subject: Re: [T2] Brakes applied?

From Vincent:

> Odd thing, I am driving happily along when suddenly I feel the Bus under a  
 slight load, as if the brake is being applied slightly. Rarely happens, but is  
happening more often. I am concerned. I want to take it to my favorite 
 mechanic,  but it may be nothing. I just had the brakes redone all around in May. 
Could it  be that the brake fluid hoses need to be replaced?
Any advice will be appreciated

The 1st thing I would do is adjust more play in the actuating rod between the pedal and the
master cylinder. Numbers 80 and 81 in this pic:

Brake fluid expands in the heat and without enough free play, the master cylinder will apply the brakes.
