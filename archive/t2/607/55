Subject: Re: [T2] BayWindow Toys ever made?

"I've been looking for models and stuff of that scale of a 76'ish bus".

Well there aren't that many Baywindow toys in general...and the ones that
have been made are typically the 68-72 early Bays. Brekina makes a good
rendition of the late Baywindow bus, but this is HO scale (small).

I know you are looking for a line on a plastic model kit you could paint for
ideas, but I have only seen one, by Hasagawa?, and it is a small
snap-together bay. Even if you found this one you would want to preserve it.
I think your best bet is to find an image online and then open it in
Photoshop or Paint or a similar graphics program. You can use the paint
bucket tool to cover a large area and then save the file with each color you
are thinking about. I used to have a link on my old site for a page where
you could paint the bus they offered and submit it...haven't seen this link
in a while.

Anyway here are a few pics of  Bay toys I have found on the internet if you
are interested:
