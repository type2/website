I follow the VWVortex.com group for my projects involving my '97 Cabrio (Gabby). 

They often will use photoeditors (like Photoshop) to take photos of their cars and modify the body or change the colors or whatever you liek with very real looking results (reflections and all). 

I do not have any first hand experience doing this but it is so common there it must be reasonably easy.
