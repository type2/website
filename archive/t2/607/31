Hey Mike.....Can? Yes.    Should? I wouldn't.  Why not skip all the risks 
and modifications and extra equipment and just drive both vehicles 
separately to the camp site?

Let me support that suggestion: You will need a tow bar and a hitch and 
electrical connections for the running lights, blinkers and brake lights. 
It would be good to have the bug brakes working as well as the bus brakes. 
That takes some connection and control equipment.

A tow bar set-up raises the risk of an accident due to occasional 
uncontrolled whipping and yawing of the towed vehicle. And the bus steering 
and braking is negatively affected. Add rain and wind gusts, and you have 
serious risks.

RULE about towing with any vehicle: When the towed vehicle is half the 
weight of the towing vehicle, unless the towed vehicle should have brakes 
that can be controlled from the tow vehicle.

Summary....there are risks and costs associated with towing the bug. 
Incurring these risks is not necessary, since both vehicles are capable of 
independent operation.

You and you wife can easily drive both vehicles to the camp site, without 
the problems and extra costs and extra stresses of towing.

That way, all the well-engineered properties of each vehicle will operate 
independently to expedite and insure your safe arrival. No need to double 
the load on the bus brakes, or slow down to avoid overheating, or risk 
getting whipsawed into a ditch by a sudden gust of wind. I find my bus 
being pushed out of its normal track by at least a foot every now and then 
when some truck goes by, or a blast of wind appears unexpectedly. Finally, 
I think I'd prefer not to have a nearly one ton pendulum attached to my 
rear bumper when that happens. Don't even think about the problems of an 
emergency stop on wet roads, or brake failure on long downhills runs.

Just skip it and drive separately a few times, and see if you don't like 
the simplicity of not towing anything.
