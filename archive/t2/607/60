Subject: 2.0 L engine exhaust issues

Oh what a pain but I got my exhaust system off in the hopes of killing my
catalytic converter and cleaning things up a bit.  Ended up breaking a stud
in the process, can I get new ones?  I want to have the whole unit
sandblasted and remove the catalytic converter.  Problem is the flange from
the pipe that goes into the converter doesn9t match the flange from the
other side of the converter that goes into the muffler.  So I9m thinking
about just getting it welded (the pipe to the muffler or silencer9), but
I9ve heard welding places aren9t allowed to participate in the death of a
catalytic converter?  A buddy said I could just hollow it out and leave it
in place, but I think it may be easier said than done.  I priced new exhaust
systems and it doesn9t really sound worth the price but I can tell my system
is impeding my idle- it runs so much better with no pipes or anything.  Any
ideas?
