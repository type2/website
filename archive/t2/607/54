Subject: Hearye, hearye! Bill Moon is a great guy.

Let it be known far and wide in the Bus-driving world:

I would like to take this occasion to nominate Bill Moon of Colonial Beach, 
VA as an honorary "Elf of the Black Forest" for helping me find a good vent 
wing window for my bus. He went above and beyond in finding, retrieving, 
packing and shipping the window, just because I mentioned on a previous 
post that I needed one. Thanks again, Bill.
