Subject: Fire Extinguishers,

Well today my Bustinguisher came in handy, not to put out a bus, but to 
put out a trade-mans truck ! I have always had vision of saving some 
other bus, but this is almost as cool.

My Roomate and I were just heading home and were stopped at a light on 
the highway, on the other side of the lights there was a HUGE plume of 
white smoke and a truck pulling into the shoulder, flames started 
flaring out,  looked bad. My roomate, a well trained bus-copilot, 
grabbed the extinguisher from the mount beside my seat and ran across 
the highway to the guys truck ... where he extinguished the burning 
oil, glue, rags and .... propane tank. We dragged all the debris out 
onto the shoulder and stomped out the embers.

Needless to say the guy with the truck was HAPPY as all getup, I think 
he was sacred he was going to see his livelyhood go up in smoke. He 
seemed a little startled at us running up and putting it all out 
though.

Don't know what started it but he definitely had way too much crap 
crammed between his welder and the storage box. Too much FLAMMABLE 
stuff.

So, I will be getting her refilled tomorrow and getting another LARGER 
on to go under the back bench I think. Maybe a real nice chrome one 
<grin>.
I feel like this justified a larger expense somehow.

Anyone else gotten some use out of theirs ?

Steve
