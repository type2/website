Subject: Compression test... Good news!

Hi Volks,

I set the valves and tested compression, and the results were 
120/130/130/130. I was surprised to see that the results were better 
than the last test, back in February. Since the bus wasn't a daily 
driver back then perhaps it had minor issues with the rings that have 
been resolved now that it's a daily driver. Whatever... I just know I 
like these number better than the last set.

So my next mission for the evening is to inspect the filler tube gasket 
and if it's OK I'll just rig up a supplemental case breather from the 
filler cap. If the problem does turn out to be in the dipstick gasket I 
guess I'll need to fix that hole I drilled in the filler cap. ;-)

Happy trails,
