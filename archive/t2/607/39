WISHES it were swiss cheese. Anyway, can you make plastics as well as
lead/pewter? Ever think of making VW models? Might be a market in it for ya.
:)

I make them, mostly gaming minis, but the occasional odd off, too.  I do
only plastics (polyurethane resins).

This is a link (temporary until my website's back up) to a pic of two
N-Scale splitties I tried my hand at.  They're done in clear red resin, the
idea was sort of an earring/bracelet charm sort of thing.  Could have done a
number of colors, but held it off at red for now.

Found a 1999 Matchbox bay, "VW Delivery Van", 1:58 scale.  Shark motif.  Not
much else in bays, though.  Thought about doing an HO scale slot car bay at
one time.

Sorry the pic is a bit poor.  Still need to get a digital camera.
