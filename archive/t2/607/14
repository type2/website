Subject: Re: [T2] Jammed starter?

Jld.....I had the same problem.  It started out being easily fixed by just 
pushing it forward or back while in gear, a foot or so. The problem just gets 
worse as time goes by.  I ended up buying a mint flywheel at Bug-orama in 
Sacramento, installed it and 
that was the end of the problem. It's been fine for the past 10 years or so. 
A little bit
of work but will give you the opportunity to put on a fresh clutch plate 
while you
are at it.......
