 >>Odd thing, I am driving happily along when suddenly I feel the Bus under 
a slight load, as if the brake is being applied slightly. Rarely happens, 
but is happening more often. I am concerned. I want to take it to my 
favorite mechanic,  but it may be nothing. I just had the brakes redone all 
around in May.

 >>Could it be that the brake fluid hoses need to be replaced?

Hi Vincent,

It is rare for this to happen, but it is possible for the flexible brake 
lines to deteriorate internally, with the result that letting up on the 
brake pedal doesn't allow all of the hydraulic fluid that was pushed toward 
the wheel cylinders or calipers to return toward the master 
cylinder.  Conversely, internal clogging could prevent the brakes from 
being fully applied in the first place.

The first time I encountered this type of problem was many years ago on the 
hydraulic clutch system of a 1950s Mercedes sedan.  The clutch kept on 
slipping, despite having been replaced and correctly adjusted.  It was very 
frustrating & time consuming to troubleshoot, but once the correct 
diagnosis was made, it was a very straightforward repair.

While the flexible brake lines can clog up on the inside, it is far more 
common for them to become cracked & brittle on the outside, which may lead 
to leaks.

There are also other, more common things that could cause the brakes to be 
partially applied, such as broken brake shoe return springs, sticking wheel 
cylinder pistons, etc.

Cheers, Bill
