Subject: Different "official" tire size?

From: http://wetwesties.tripod.com/Journeys1/07.htm
"Technical Recommendation: Journeys Under Difficult Conditions"

The recommended tire size is listed as 205 - 70 - 14. But I put that
size on the front of my 73 and they rub when getting close to the
stops in either direction.  They're working fine on the back, however.
I got them because that size was MUCH cheaper in the higher load
ranges than a 185R14.

Any comments? Where did that # come from? Maybe they work ok on different years?
