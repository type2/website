Subject: Re: [T2] BayWindow Toys ever made?

I have one bay window toy. It was made by KOVAP and is labeled as a 1969 Vw
Clipper.

I bought it at Peddlers Village in Pennsylvania and it can be seen here (at
the back):

I have several bay windows that are matchbox\hotwheels size. I dont recall
the name of the company but they resemble majorette in stampings and fit.

I bought about 8 of them at a toy show in Virginia Beach a few years back
for a dollar a piece.

Two of them can be seen in the back row here:
