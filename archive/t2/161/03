Build a bigger engine.  Counterbalanced crankshaft.  Have the whole she-bang
balanced.  Run a temp. gauge--when it gets too hot, pull over and idle until it
isn't.  Get your tranny re-geared to "Freeway Flyer."  Put more money each week
in the "Engine Rebuild Fund Jar" than you otherwise would.  You don't *have* to
switch to an Astro Mommyvan(tm), even though it might be cheaper if you did.
