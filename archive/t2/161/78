Well..... in the spirit of the day..... UP!!!  the shiny side goes
*UP*!!!!  :-)

In large part, it makes little difference, as the whole idea of the seal
is to block air.  as long as the air is blocked, the rest is cosmetics and
the shiny side up looks better, don't you think?

Actually, of course, Karl and Bob are correct, the purpose of the "shiny
side" is to keep oil from the engine from impregnating the seal and it
*ought* to go toward the more likely oil source (that is, down)

For many years, tho (before the list), I did install them shiny side up
for appearances sake, and they never gave me a problem :-)

These days, I have not seen a seal with an actual "shiny side" in the OEM
sense in many years.  Most are extruded "H" sections and it makes no
difference which side goes up or down.
