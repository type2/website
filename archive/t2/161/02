Subject: Re: [T2] Acceptable speeds

You need disc brakes for those speeds in addition to suspension and engine 
upgrades.

Porsche, Subbieroo, Corvair - all sort of engine options. Big $$$ either way.

You'll either have to get comfortable with those 55 mph speeds or buy a 
waterpumper like a GTi for the commute.

Nice $1200 '84 200K rabbit here locally with recent service, all the 
records, new tires and new axles.

For the price of a big conversion or a car payment you could be running 
down the road with a/c.

Save the bus for the weekends.

I'm going for a Corvair engine but I know it still won't be up to modern 
speeds and standards.
