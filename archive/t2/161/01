Used Hondas and water pumper Rabbits.

There is a nice silver '84 GTi available locally, fully serviced, new tires 
and axles.

If only I had the $1200. My '84 convertible Rabbit that I had in Italy 
would cruise at 100 mph for hours and that was at 190K miles.

I have a car payment for a couple more years on our present Honda - my 
first and last car payment.

The zero miles new car is nice but way too expensive for my budget long 
term. You could keep that rust free Rabbit alive for many, many years for 
$20K.

At least I know my CR-V will last 200K+ because I'll have to keep it that 
long to make it feel worthwhile.

Stay away from payment cars - they make everyone rich but you.
