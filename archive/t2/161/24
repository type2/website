stop by my place on a Fri or Sat night the locals have decided the road in
front of my house is the place to cruise and see who's radio/cd is the
loudest....danged if I could tell you what any of the songs are though.

me I prefer the sound of my engine and my own thoughts, a wire on my radio
broke oh 5-6 years ago and I still haven't bothered to fix it, still
haven't put the antenna back on either.

well I would like to up to a 75 amp alternator, I ski in the winter and at
night in bad weather my BA-4, windshield wipers, headlights, and heated
wiper blades will flatten my batteries (twin 125ah) in a couple hours,
usually have to turn the heater off for 15minutes of every hour to keep
from running dry.   I usually carry a charger for when parked at night, I
run an extension out and run the charger and block dipstick heater to make
starting in those sub 0F mornings just a little easier.
