Subject: My feedback to http://vwlicense.ipprotector.com/

Here is my feedback that I provided to http://vwlicense.ipprotector.com/:

"I think that excluding commercial sites from trademark licencing is a very
bad idea.  VWOA dose nothing to support owners of aircooled VW vehicles.  We
depend, very much depend, on our wonderful vendors to provide us parts and
service that VWOA either cannot or will not provide.  I think that this
stinks and until I see an improvement in this situation, I will NEVER
purchase any vehicle from VW, nor will I EVER allow my vintage vw to be used
for any purpose by VWOA.

"Our household has owned 8 vw vehicles in our lifetimes.  But, we draw the
line here.  We have had more vw's than any other vehicles.  We love the
products of VWag, but we are not accepting any policy of VWOA that in the
slightest way affects our ability to maintain our vintage VW.  It is hard
enough to keep these wonderful old vehicles healthy without having the
salesmen and lawyers making it more difficult."
