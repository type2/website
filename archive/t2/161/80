Subject: thanks, and a bus $$$ estimate value (digest mode)

howdy volks...

i'm back on the road again...just thought i would
thank everyone for their kind words of support.

also, when i return to the east coast, i will most
likely be putting my beloved bus up for sale. my final
destination will either be at high altitude or city
life, where a second vehicle will be impractical for
me.

so, i thought i might as everyone's honest opinion of
the value of my bus. i didn't pay a dime to get the
title, but i have put $7000 into it. here is a list of
things done and things needed.

thanks again everyone!

1975 Westy deluxe (rear hinge) Orange
slider door step
2000cc engine with weber progressive carb
electronic ignition
A/C (DPD)--needs compressor and recharge
full camper interior-minus trash bin (front table,
stove, fridge 2 way, sink and rear table...table top
aftermarket, but arm and such original)--all working
automatic 3-speed tranny
173,000 total, but engine was replaced 2 owners ago
with 2000cc. i have owned since 156,000

needed...
new windshield (small crack, won't pass VA inspection
w/crack,)
some rust around windows, but nothing through or
causing any leaks. just visual.
rusty battery tray (i currently have a molded wood
piece with the battery attached to it, which works
fine...it doesn't slide around or fall out)
below the battery tray at the right rear wheel well,
the panel is rusty. these are the only two items that
i know of that need body work.


this bus needs a paint job to be a perfect bus, which
means the windows need to come out and have their
seals replaced when the bus gets painted. i would also
have the rims powder coated as well. also, since the
heat is not so hot in the busses, i would put a
straight exhaust on it and get rid of the heat
exhanger concept...since the sport cat by coleman that
i have works just fine.


interior...
VDO gauges, oil temp, pressure (dual sender,)
voltmeter
JVC 45wx4 channel CD head unit (w/remote,) w/10 disc
changer and 6 speaker system with sony amp.
new plastic moulded glove box insert

new window seals in front doors
VDO in dash analog clock
new gray 3 windowed canvas
double layered wall insulation with vapor barrier
floor isulation with new carpet
new insulation at ceiling at front of bus
new black kick panels and door panels (up front)
new front seats (from 1988 Mitusbishi Montero..comfy!)
new pedestal stand mats
stove converted to use 1lb coleman propane tanks
new sink pump
upper rear cabinet added (from 1978 camper)
full set of curtains
all seats and bed in awesome shape...no tears!
original bilstein jack
new rubber step pads at front
new brake pedal cover

exterior...
all new ball joints, tie rods w/ends, steering
dampener, steering bushing, front and rear shocks,
front and rear bearings, front rotors, rear drums and
brakes and adjusting stars, 2 new cv joints and 2

fairly recently painted poptop and luggage rack
new master cylinder
new rubber bumpers at front suspension (arms)
new rubber for sway bar mounts
original hubcaps
4 yokohama super van load class d tires
tinted windows

engine/tranny...
rebuilt automatic tranny (finally!)
new front, rear main seals
new alternator mounting brackets
new flexplate and torque converter
new pushrod tube seals, valve cover gaskets
good compression...all from 110-120
new cap, rotor, plugs, wires
new engine compartment seal

other...
added new spare tire mount to front (original was
missing)
2 new battery with relay hookup for dual charge
"newer" and working power inverter for fridge.

i love this bus and it drives awesome. i did all of
the work for my year long cross-country trip and soon
i will have to relinquish him to another loving owner.
he still has lots of life in him and just want to make
sure that price that i ask for is reasonable.

thanks again everyone. i'm looking forward to your
input!

missy:)
