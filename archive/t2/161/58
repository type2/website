OK, let's see if I can explain this? I bought a 1000lb capacity Engine =
stand, meant for V8's, and a VW Bench Mount Engine Stand. How are folks =
cutting these to make a VW Stand? I thought I could cut the 3/4 of the =
tube off of the V8 Stand, leaving a the bottom of the tube in place. The =
cut the flat plate from the VW Stand and lay the tube in the Cup, sort =
of, left on the V8 stand and Mig away. Sound about right?=20
