I've seen a lot of people "walk-on" these stereos with a moderately powered
CB.  You have to be at close range, but it will do it.  The down side is,
you'll in-advertanly annoy your neighbors by talking over a few of their
electronics as well...  stereos, sometimes TV and stuff.  Used to happen to
us all of the time when I lived very close to a freeway here in TX.

I'd love to create some radio transmitter that would overcome the stereo in
the next thumper car that came along and help them appear to tell the world
all their inner secrets at top volume. Some sort of Buck Rogers transmitter
ray gun...

I'll never forget a large truck in Italy that had such a high power
transmitter on his radio (would it still be a CB in Italy?) that he broke
into what I was listening to on the tape deck in my car.

Sounded like an Italian speaking devil - all deep and rumbling. I did not
know what it was at first and it scared the hell out of me!!!
