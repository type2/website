Subject: Jetting info for Solex on 1.8L???

Type2folx,

Does anyone have starting jetting info for dual Solex 32-34PDSIT on a 
big-valve 1.8L engine?

We don't know the original source for the Solexes, but are pretty sure they 
are from a 1.7L T4 engine.

We are putting them on a 1.8L that had been poorly retrofitted with a Weber 
progressive, thinking that we would have better performance out of the duals.

If someone could tell us how we need to configure them for the 1.8L, we would 
mightily appreciate it.

Thanks/Don Carron
