Start by verify your timing.  Incorrect timing can lead to backfiring,
hard-starting, and power loss.  Get a timing light on there, check
Bentley and make sure it is to spec.  If not, time it correctly.  

Check and double-check that the distributor drive clamp is tight.  If it
isn't, the distributor may inadvertently turn and throw off your
timing.  Post again with what you find.

Hope this helps
