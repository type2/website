Subject: timing light suggestions

I'm thinking of finally entering the 21st century and buying a digital 
strobe timing light with advance, tach, dwell etc. built in.  I've never 
used one before because I have always timed my bus with a static light.  Can 
anyone recommend a good quality unit that they like?  I saw a couple at the 
local Kragen/Checker parts place for $70-$130.  Any input would be helpful. 
Thanks.
