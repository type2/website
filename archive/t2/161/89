I already have such a device in my bus that I carry with me all the time,
and it's conveniently situated near the master cyl reservoir.  It's called
the windscreen washer.  I have the Eezi-bleed kit that comes with the
correct size mc cap for a very reasonable price.  You just fill it with
fluid, connect up and bleed away.
For all you who have replaced your washer with an electric one, hard luck,
you'll have to use the front tyre instead :-)
