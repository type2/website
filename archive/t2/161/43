Subject:  Re: What is the toughest climb you ever drove?

Hi All.

the biggest hill I have been on was last year driving around North Adams MA
at 
Transporters by the Tunnel, up RT2 around the hairpin turn and further. 
I had just got the bus a few weeks before and this was my first real trip as
a bus pilot.
The grades were not as steep as some you have been mentioning but it sure
seemed 
steep as I went up in second gear, remembering list wisdom and trying not to
lug the
engine. I thought it was gonna go POP, but all was well. I was really glad I
had done
a good job on the Brakes, because going down is always more of a concern
with me
than going up.
