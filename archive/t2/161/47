Subject: Starter circlip removal


Could someone please enlighten me on how to remove the circlip and stop ring 
next to the drive pinion. I've tried using a paper clip to remove the 
circlip but it didn't budge. All of my other tools seem to big to fit. Any 
ideas tips how to get this thing removed so I can clean up the insides?  Its 
a Bosch starter

thanks in advance
