Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Compartment Seal

Rubber down, foam up. If you put the foam down....you will have a LONG sponge!

Hello List,
Just bought a new engine compartment seal for my 1979 Riviera Camper with a
2.0 liter Type 4 engine. My question is - does the "rubberized" side of the
seal go on the inside of the engine compartment or does it face down towards
the ground?
