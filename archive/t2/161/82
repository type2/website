Subject: Horns Again

Hiya All,

Thanks in large part to Greg down in Florida I got the disconnected ground in 
my horn reconnected.  And I've got a "beep-beep" now.  

While I was crawling around under the Bus I thought it might be nice to have 
another horn over on the passenger side of the Bus.  A dual horn set-up.  I 
figure a little louder, a little safer.  It seems to me that the wiring for 
this would be dirt-simple.  I'd just have to splice into the existing hot 
lead and ground for the horn.  Does that sound like a do-able proposition to 
everybody?

And then I thought about the Karmann Ghia dual horn relay.  Do I need to go 
that way?  Seems to me that the draw for the horn is so small and infrequent 
that a relay would not be needed.  Thoughts?
