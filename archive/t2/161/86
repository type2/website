Hi,
Well for what it's worth, I never take my bus over 60 mph - unless I'm in a
passing situation around a semi or something and need that extra push if
it's there - but I am content sitting back and watching all the impatient
people doing 80 in their SUVs. I prefer to keep my stress level below theirs
and it works. :-)
