Compared to the other poweradders (turbo, blower) I think nitrous is 
well-suited to an aircooled vw since it cools the intake charge rather than 
heats it and is only used in short bursts.  It's something I would like to 
try someday when I have time to do frivolous things (well, substantial 
frivolous things).
