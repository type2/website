List agrees?

Engine is an AVP 1800 w/ good compression.  DVDA
dizzy and stock solexes.  I have no evidence that
they are leaking- at least with the spray wd40
around the bases as and throttle method.  

It doesn't run hot--at least using the "grab the
dipstick method."  Maybe I should read my plugs
today?  

I haven't adjusted the carbs (other than
adjusting the idle with the big screw-whatever
that is named) any since I switched from the
hated 009.  Maybe the last guy had it leaned to
compensate for the 009's flat spot?
