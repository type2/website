Subject: Re: rusted battery boxes

Both of my battery boxes are in brutal shape. I just installed a large, side
terminal battery under the Z-Bed in the back of the bus, it was pretty easy.
Something occured to me, to put up for comment. Since I don't need the
battery boxes anymore, and they need replacement, what would be the effect
of cutting them out and leaving them open?  Sure would provide lots of
cooling air, wouldn't it? Would this affect the body rigidity, and/or would
it be a good or bad idea? I don't drive in the winter, so salt wouldn't be
splashing up inside.
