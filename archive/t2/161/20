      David and List.

    The poor running turned out to be a number of snags.
I pulled the distributor and found the ground wire was unsoldered from the
breaker plate. This has happened before so this time was an easy solder job.
I re timed to 10degrees atdc It was a wayyy retarded:)
I reset the carb screws on the base of each carb to about 3 turns out and re
set the linkage for evenness. This has done wonders but I'm still getting a
small backfire through the R/H carb when I'm accelerating i.e.. giving her
the gas:)
What s the proper procedure to rectify this snag?

Thanks again David and others whom replied.
