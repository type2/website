I know you are upset about your engine, so I'll
ignore that.  

It's real hard to assimilate all that your
saying.  It is not financially feasible for you
to buy a later bus w/ 2.0 as someone else
suggested.  It is not financially feasible for
you to buy another vehicle so you can drive like
you used to in your Buick Grand National.  You
also mention that your other car is dead.  I
assume not financially feasible means don't have
the dough.  Nothing wrong with that.  It happens
to us all.  And unfortunately for you, it is
happening at the same time you bus is busted.  

You have an engine that won't turn and you
suspect a dropped valve.  If you don't have the
dough for a later model bus, then you don't have
the dough for a Jake Raby engine (remember you
still have to by lots of stuff to add to his
engine, weber 40's, clutch, exhaust etc. and
adapt the thing if you don't buy type 1).  

So what is your budget? It sounds like not much.
I'd spin balance everything (flywheel, crank
preferably counterweighted, rods, cyl's, fan,
what am I forgetting?).  If I had more cash, I'd
buy a new case and new heads, etc.  I assume LN
pistons and any other nonstock enhancements are
probably out of your budget.

Please don't take any of it personnally.  If you
can buy a Jake Raby engine, then do so.  It's
just that your earlier posts suggested that you
cannot afford it.

Then you need to tell us what your budget is now
if you expect us to tell you what our OPINION is
as to how to enhance your engine while you
rebuild it.

Please, take there advice.  And I will gladly
await your results.  Let us know how long your
new bus lasts.

High horse?  I tell you I've toasted a few
engines and learned to take it easy on them?  I'm
not sure how this is uppity.  

I will watch the list for your posts.  I
excitedly await your efforts to make a type 1
cruise like your Grand National on the interstate
in the Texas heat.  

I would buy an oil temp and cyl head temp guage
no matter how you rebuild the engine.  

Good luck, Ray
