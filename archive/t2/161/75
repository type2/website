Jamie,

Without disagreeing (extra brakes are *always* a good idea, if you can
figure out how to get them :-), there is really no difference between left
and right coast slopes!  The numbers tend to be much more impressive out
west, but the start altitude makes up for it most of the time.  A pass at
9,000 feet sounds worse than a pass at 4,000 feet, until you realize that
in Denver you are already at 5,000 feet and you have to climb exactly the
same amount to reach either pass!

Certainly, leaving the west coast is always going to be a traumatic
experience because you *are* starting at sea level, but otherwise, I have
not had any more problems in the Rockies than in the Appalachians.
*Both* contain "unexpected pleasures" and paying attention to the "grain"
of the mountains pays big dividends unless you are deeply into driving in
first/second gear for extended periods of time :-)
