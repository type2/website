 << I have three kids at home >>

See---

If you had avoided the connubial cunnilingis and stayed on the Bus--you
wouldn't be having this problem--: )


<<Actually, I am using PPG epoxy primer and PPG filler primer>>

If you have epoxy on top of the metal your in good shape.

The paint with reducer and hardener is going to cost more than $300.00
Unless your thinking of using some Farm & Barn equipment enamel on it---
Be prepared for some sticker shock.
 
<<Rent a Storage area. 
Buy a cheap blue plastic tarp and cover it up. 
Is this going to be effective? I had considered that option but, I don't
really like it. >>

What's wrong with inside storage?

The plastic tarp isn't a good idea--but if your short--your short---no
way around it---
