This would be my first check. $6 at NAPA. Just swap it out. The filter
can suddenly work fine for a little bit after setting because the
pressure of fuel against the filter media is relieved when the engine
is shut off. Anything clogging the filter has a chance to slough off
and settle to the bottom of the filter.
