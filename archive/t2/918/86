Subject: I cheated - body work + windshield sill

I did some makeshift body work.
I had a couple holes from rust :) around the wheels and
the windshield sill was looking pretty bad with holes.
I had previously coated the metal around the
holes in the body with the POR 15 and it hadn't gotten
any worse over the years so I figured something
over the holes would be better than nothing.

I POR15'd over the metal, used that tin/aluminum
tape to cover the hole. Used POR-Patch over the
tin to make it super hard and strong

(It wasn't quite what I was thinking it was but it worked good)
Also built up the sides of the lip for the windshield and
filled in the holes there. Then re-POR15'd over everything again.
The SprayBomb paint can I got from (cant think of the name
of the place at the moment) was an amazing match for color
and it sprayed really really good. Im thinking I may do a full
paint job with the stuff (yah I know thats crazy). The color
is great and goes on sooo even. Technology is great.
Much better than the silly cans from Canadian tire.
And it's not like the old paint was clearcoated either.

So today I do the final coat of paint to the lower lip of the
windshield (3 coats in 15 minutes as per spec :) and see if
Speedy class will put the windshield back in today.

I forgot to take pics at the beginning but I will before
I paint today and afterwards too.
