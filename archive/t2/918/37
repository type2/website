Subject: replacing door lock cores? 

Folks,
I am new to the type2 world, but was onceupatime
familar with the type1s; am also well versed in
vanagon jargon.

I have a 72. It has 4 different keys for the doors and
rear hatch and ignition.  I just had to replace the
ignition core (ask me how- it is CAKE!) and happen
across  my stash of matched lock cores from my
vanagons. The vanaogn ignition core and lock is the
same as the type-2  btw.  Anybody have any luck with
replaing their door hanndle lock cores with ones from
a vanagon? (gosh, are they the same?)

i looked in the archives and came up blank.

Thanks
matthew
