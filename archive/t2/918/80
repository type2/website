Subject: Scratching sound on acceleration

Weird.  Only hear at night when everything is louder, or in light 
traffic. When I just barely touch the accelerator, this constant 
sound like  sandpaper scratching (gets louder the more you listen!). 
I thought it must be the cable, but I tried pressing the accelerator 
while in neutral, and no sound.  Could it be the clutch?

anyone with ideas of what it could be, or how I can isolate it to 
find the cause? And how bad it is?

thank you
