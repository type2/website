3M makes a GREY mounting tape for auto trim attachment- "Scotch Mount 
Super Strength Moulding Tape" part # 03615 - It sticks VERY WELL and 
leaves NO residue upon peeling it off.  I use it to attach a pivot to 
musical instruments for a support I make for people with wrist/hand 
problems -see sig-(written up in 2 hand surgury books!)Scotch makes a 
4x5" version for attaching reflectors that should work well for mirrors.
To pull a 1" square piece off an instrument requires all my strength, 
like 50 lbs of pull!  COMMAND (home depot) works very well if you need a 
mount in your vehicle that can be removed by pulling a tab- it stretches 
thin and lets the item mounted pop off- no residue-good for hooks on 
your cabinetry.
