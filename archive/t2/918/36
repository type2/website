whenever you do something to the auto tranny you need to put handbrake on
start engine in neutral.
shift slowly  N, D, 2, 1, 2, D, N, R, P, R, N.  shut engine down.

then check fluid and correct if problem.

sounds like you blew a torque converter seal.. gotta drop engine to change
under $20 for the seal.

if you staarted the engine with water in the tranny it has gotten into the
Torque converter and it is pretty dern hard to clean, you have to take
engine out to put in new tranny seal, so folloow the drain instructions in
Bentley and refill.

you may have damaged the tranny but no real way to know until you get it
cleaned out real good and try it.   sounds like maybe your reverse/1st
gear plates may be burned.  this is a major rebuild or new tranny

good luck
