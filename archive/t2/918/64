Re why spraying pet ether on the non working fuel pump made it work
1. It always started fine after bus cooled down an hour. So pump worked 
then.
2.  Pump did not turn over when hot.  So I cooled it to prove it was the 
pump not working only when hot- and to test a "get you going in less 
than an hour" scenario.
3.  This is a lot like the hot starter that won't crank- the solenoid 
sticks due to either it being hot/expanded and there is not enough 
current to free it and start the starter.  Next time I find someone with 
the hot start problem, we'll try the ether approach- but I don't wan't 
to be under there jumping the solenoid if it does not work!
