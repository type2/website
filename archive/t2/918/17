Subject: Re: [T2] short in dash / brake warning circuit?: resolved

Thank you Jamie Rivers for your p-mailed assistance.  If you hadn't
pointed me in the right general direction, this cause would have taken
much longer to identify.

Cause:
While investigating the grounds on the dashpod, I discovered that the
electrical tape that the PO had on one of the wires for the turn
indicator had shorted against the body.  It was pressed against the
body be the weight of the fuse box (which is not affixed properly), so
vehicle movement could cause the wire to not short, and then short
again.

Resolution:
retaped the wire, start considering how to un-rat's nest the PO wiring
job at the fuse box.  Without knowing what its supposed to look like,
I'm leery of that, regardless of how necessary it is.

Thanks volks (especially Jamie today),
