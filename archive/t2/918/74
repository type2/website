Yeah, ours is a little less about "civilizing indians"
and "indians & pilgrams sitting down together"

I found this on the Almighty Inter Net:

In Canada Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second
Monday in October. Unlike the American tradition of
remembering Pilgrims and settling in the New World,
Canadians give thanks for a successful harvest. The
harvest season falls earlier in Canada compared to the
United States due to the simple fact that Canada is
further north.

The history of Thanksgiving in Canada goes back to an
English explorer, Martin Frobisher, who had been
trying to find a northern passage to the Orient. He
did not succeed but he did establish a settlement in
Northern America. In the year 1578, he held a formal
ceremony, in what is now called Newfoundland, to give
thanks for surviving the long journey. This is
considered the first Canadian Thanksgiving. Other
settlers arrived and continued these ceremonies. He
was later knighted and had an inlet of the Atlantic
Ocean in northern Canada named after him - Frobisher
Bay. 

At the same time, French settlers, having crossed the
ocean and arrived in Canada with explorer Samuel de
Champlain, also held huge feasts of thanks. They even
formed 'he Order of Good Cheer' and gladly shared
their food with their Indian neighbours.

After the Seven Year's War ended in 1763, the citizens
of Halifax held a special day of Thanksgiving.

During the American Revolution, Americans who remained
loyal to England moved to Canada where they brought
the customs and practices of the American Thanksgiving
to Canada. There are many similarities between the two
Thanksgivings such as the cornucopia and the pumpkin
pie.

Eventually in 1879, Parliament declared November 6th a
day of Thanksgiving and a national holiday. Over the
years many dates were used for Thanksgiving, the most
popular was the 3rd Monday in October. After World War
I, both Armistice Day and Thanksgiving were celebrated
on the Monday of the week in which November 11th
occurred. Ten years later, in 1931, the two days
became separate holidays and Armistice Day was renamed
Remembrance Day.

Finally, on January 31st, 1957, Parliament
proclaimed...

"A Day of General Thanksgiving to Almighty God for the
bountiful harvest with which Canada has been blessed 
... to be observed on the 2nd Monday in October.
