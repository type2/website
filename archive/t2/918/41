Robt, The better? stuff than hylomar for that is called "copper" 
gasket...looks/works  about the same as the hylomar, but you can use it
for really hot exhaust stuff if you want(as long as you have good square 
metal flanges).  It works great on the inlet and outlet side of a turbo on 
a 68 bug.

I haven't had stellar results with hylomar...even tho it cost about $25/ 
tube here and my aircraft buddy claims it is *the* hots.
