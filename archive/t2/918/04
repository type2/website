I wish it was that simple.  If I had simply procrastinated, I would
just go buy the topcoat and seals finish it.  I have three kids at
home - finding the time to go to the bathroom uninterupted is not
always an easy task.  Keeping a $5 bill in my pocket for more than a
day ain't the simplest of chores either!

Actually, I am using PPG epoxy primer and PPG filler primer that were
recommended together from the local paint shop.  I'm not sure what the
filler primer is but.... I haven't taken the cheapest route at all -
not all of us out are swimmin' in disposable income.  I still need to
come up with another $250-300 to replace the seals and buy the
topcoat.  By the time that happens the weather is going to be cold
around here.  Unless you have a paintbooth in or near Lancaster
County, PA that you're inclined to let me use come October.

Is this going to be effective?  I had considered that option but, I
don't really like it.

Later,
