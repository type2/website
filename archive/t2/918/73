I like industrial double-stick foam tape.  It'll hold 5 pounds maximum.  
Less cleanup than with that OTHER method... Scotch/3M part number 4011T.  
Completely weather-resistant and available at your local Wally World.  :^D

This may be a dumb question.  What did VW use to stick outside rear mirrors
in their frames?  What do you guys use now?
