Easy.  But you need to run a wire from the coil all
the way forward to the cab.  But first things first...
try this VDO brand tach in black or white....

Note the diameter of this tach exactly matches the big
gauge holes in your 77 panel.
    
Second, connect to www.bus-boys.com, go to
accessories, and see the part number 220-09101 trim
ring which will allow you to install the vdo tach into
that unused hole in your dash, right of your
speedometer.  That stupid metal slug plate gets
replaced by your Tach.  Use these 2 items and your
Tach installation will look almost original equipment.
   
(You also need to flip a couple of switches on the
back of the VDO Tach, and then connect-up some wires. 
But its not hard.)
