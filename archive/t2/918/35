Subject: 78 westy...auto tranny...stumped!

---------------------------------
      o.k....I'll do my best to explain this and see if anyone out there can help  I have a automatic 78 westy with a weber progressive carburetor. Transmission has worked great since I've owned her. Just had to have engine rebuilt and when I was cleaning the engine compartment I accidentally got water in the transmission fluid (aaahhh!!!) I've had the fluid changed out twice now and I'm still having major problems, here they are..... Drive works great! "D2" works great! "D1" and Reverse....help! When I put the bus in reverse it makes a "clunk" sound and if I put my foot on the gas it will go backwards, but feels as though a really strong e-brake is on...like it's straining against itself...it does the same thing in "D1". Like I said, it works in drive, however, I drove it about 15 miles, it started smoking like crazy and I smelled tranny fluid and when I parked her, tranny fluid was coming out in a stream from what appeared to be where the torque converter is...tranny
 fluid was basically sprayed everywhere and dripping from a lot of places...not good  Could this all be caused by water in the fluid??? Is there any way to fix this or am I looking at swapping out my transmission? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! 
Thanks!
