Subject: Re: [T2] removing catalytic converter from 77 bus

There is no O2 Sensor on the Bay Window before 1979.  On the Bay Window,
they are on 1979 California models only and even then, the removal of the
Catalytic Converter has no effect on the sensor's function, because it is
mounted ahead of the converter.

On the 86-91 Vanagons, the O2 Sensor is installed on the Catalytic
Converter, so in that case it might make a difference and require some
engineering.

There will be higher pollution levels without the converter, but the expense
of replacing one due to having to possibly use leaded gasoline (not
necessarily "bad gas", but harmful to the catalysts,) in Central America may
be perhaps worth the effort during the journey.  Unleaded gas of most any
quality doesn't usually harm the converter though.  The overall running of
the engine will not be affected and there might be a minor increase in
performance due to the slight reduction in back pressure.  I know this
because I temporarily ran without a converter for several weeks after it
cracked apart at the mounting flange on my 84 Westfalia 7 years ago while on
the road back east.  Of course, I installed a new Bus Depot supplied
converter when I returned to California and have run with it since.
