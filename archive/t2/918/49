Subject: SOLVED ! (cranks after running ok but won't restart)

Finally had time to check out the 246K Westy and figure out why it won't 
restart after being warmed up to over 200 deg oil temp. and stopped. 
BTW, it's not ready to die yet- compression test when warm( on a diff 
gauge that may read 5-10 lbs higher than old one) was 115, 128, 132, 
135- about same differences as old gauge readings about 20K ago, but 
then #1 was 105.
     I warmed it up to 204 deg, turned it off, and then tried it-indeed, 
no start. Temp sensor 55 ohms (hot)-ok.  Decided to dig out the fuel 
gauge and verify pressure- some ran out of the spigot so there was 
pressure- but not as much as I've seen with previous loosening of the 
gauge port.  Hooked up the gauge, had SO crank it, and.......NaDa!  WTF? 
  So it's pump or whatever sends juice to the pump.  I got underneath 
and felt the pump- it was hot. Then took the trusty 4ft jumper wire that 
has an alligator clip on one end and a much bigger one at the other end 
and clipped the former to the pump + and touched the other to the 
starter (+) connection- fairly big sparks but no pump whirring! Ah Ha! 
Just to verify voltage, I again had SO crank while I watched the 
voltmeter from ground to pump + and it was getting 9V (I presume it was 
shorting and thus lost voltage). Now for the final "How can you get 
going when stuck at a rest area scenario"....I got out the spray starter 
fluid, which we all know is Pet Ether that evaporates VERY QUICKLY and 
sprayed it over the pump liberally.  Let it dry, and then went to start 
it- Voila!
Pressure was proper 28-30, 35 with regulator vac hose off.  Tomorrow I 
put the used spare on and Ron, looks like I'll need a new pump. See you
