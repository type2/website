Subject: Well, another 'runs 3 seconds' bus

Patient: '77 ASI Riv. 2 liter and stock FI

Okay, here are the symptoms:

starts, runs three seconds, dies. (more below)

Have replaced with new:

Temp sensor 2
Plugs
Points
Condensor
Cap
Rev limit rotor
Fuel filter

Have replaced with assumed good used:

Double relay (have 3)
AFM (have 3)
Computer (yeah, three of these too.)

Have run the entire suite of Bosch checks. All within spec. Fuel  
pressure, resistance, voltage.

Oddity:

It will start and run just fine (including rev'ing to 3k+, sustained  
at 2,500 of so for a full minute) with the AFM unplugged. This is  
shouldn't do.

Now I AM baffled.

What now, m'love?

Jim
