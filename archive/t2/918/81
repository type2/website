Subject: Clicking sound up front when applying brakes

Hey Volks,

I have a 1974 High Top that is in most excellent shape, but has some  
idiosyncrasies.

The main one I am concerned about is the clicking up front I hear  
when applying the brakes. It seems to be coming from almost directly  
below the shifter.

Any thoughts?
