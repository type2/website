Subject: Adjusting FI mixture without an EGA

I thought this was going to be an easy thing to find but, none of my
local shops still have an EGA.  That said, is there any way to
determine and adjust fuel/air mixture without an EGA?  I picked up a
used but recently rebuilt AFM at a swapmeet this past weekend and
while it seems to smoothly out my engine, it seems a make the engine
run a bit sluggish.  Any suggestions where to try to track one down?

Also, I saw air/fuel ratio gauges at the local FLAPS, could one make
use of such a gauge to dial in the AFM?  The display is very simple -
Rich, Lean and Stoich are the choices you get.

Thanks in advance,
Ken
