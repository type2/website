Subject: Re: [T2] Turbo Bus update

A couple months ago I had a look at a 71 bus
which had a new subaru motor in it. The guy
got it off an imprezza that was rolled or something.
He's pretty handy and fabbed the mechanical
gizzmos and such. He had simply cut a hole
in the rear engine door to allow the radiator
to be mounted there. Said it worked great.

Too bad the bus body he put it into was a bucket
of rust. Literally starting to fall apart. Although I
guess it's best to start with something you can
tear into before putting it into something nice
and making a mess.

That said, I chickened out and added a front mount
radiator cuz I simply did not have enough time for R&D
for the rear mount. The Aussies are using radiators
mounted underneath successfully.
