Hi JJ,

With FI issues you will waste a LOT of time and $$$ if you don't  
follow the manufacturers procedures for troubleshooting.

They can be found in the FI manuals online at www.ratwell.com. Start  
with a tune-up and valve adjustment, and verify that you have correct  
vacuum at idle.

If it's a CA-spec 79 engine then it could be a failure of the O2  
sensorr. If not I would suggest you verify operation of the fuel  
pressure regulator and the head temp sensor.

Happy Trails,
