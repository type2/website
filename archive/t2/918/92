Subject: 78 cutting out

Hi, I need some advice...

My daughter calls from college, on her way to camping on the coast in 
our 78 westy, " dad, the bus is chugging" 

She pulled over and shut it off and waited for AAA to tow her.   
However, she is a bit impatient and they didn't show up right away.  So 
she decides to head back to town on her own.   She is pulling hills with 
the bus and it is now running fine???? 

She turns back around and is able to get to her camping site about 75 
miles of hills and valleys by "keeping the rpms low"  .  however even 
that didn't work near the end of the trip.   They stopped and got 
groceries and had 16 miles to go.  She said it got "real weird "  and 
almost didn't go at all.   They parked and took off again and it ran ok...

So what are the possible problems?    Bus has 3000 miles on a rebuilt 
engine, it has had zero problems up till now.  good power, no 
hesitation... ran like a dream and now this?   Replaced with the 
rebuild, gas filter, plugs, points, condenser, air filter, CO adjusted.... 

Any ideas on where to start?

thanks
