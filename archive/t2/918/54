Subject: Canadian Thanksgiving at John Brown's Buses next weekend.

Hi Volks,

I don't know if anybody noticed, but this year JBB falls on the same  
weekend as Canadian Thanksgiving. For those not in the know, we  
Canucks do Thanksgiving pretty much the same as those south of the  
border, except that we skip the retail extravaganza and we have to  
celebrate earlier to beat the frost.

For those interested in participating, I have decided to deep-fry a  
turkey and celebrate Thanksgiving  in Brunswick, MD with my bus  
friends. Attendance isn't mandatory for JBB attendees, but you're  
welcome to join us if you' like to.

If you are planning on joining us for dinner, please let me know.  
There will be a nominal charge to cover the cost of the bird and oil,  
and it would be nice if you could bring along a dessert or side dish.

If you're interested, email Greg(-at-)pottsfamily.ca and let me know how  
many to expect for dinner, and what you can bring.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
