If you're putting the radiator in the engine bay, it might be a good idea
to have two separate fans and fan thermostats.  The reasoning being that
if one fan fails you won't be completely stranded.  Electric fans aren't
designed for continuous use because most of the time water-cooled cars
have sufficient frontal air to the radiator.  Fan failure is why you see
so many "modern" cars boiling over in summer traffic jams.

In an engine
bay installation, those fans will pretty much run all the time because
the ram-air effect through the vents is small.
