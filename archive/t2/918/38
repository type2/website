Subject: RE:Replacing locks

The vanagon door lock cylinders and bay window door cylinders are not 
interchangeable, as the tailpiece attachment is totally different.  The 
ignition is not the same, either, as the keyway is different.  If you don't 
care what key you use, a vanagon ignition will interchange.  To be CORRECT, 
though, only a 71-79 ignition is correct.
