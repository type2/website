Given the limited info, and the fact that it seems to
get gradually worse....

Fuel Filter (dirty gas)
Points adjustment
Timing (dizzy loose)
Loose FI harness/ignition connection
Fuel Pump failing slowly
Coil
Plug Wires
Valve screw loose

It kind of sounds like it improves after the engine
cools off...a bad coil, fuel pump, or injector might
misbehave more when hot.
