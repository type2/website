Subject: RE: [T2] removing catalytic converter from 77 bus

Yeah you can do it. It'll pollute more and if you have the 02 sensor on
it (not sure if you do) you might have to figure out some sort of way to
ground that out, but it'll run. But honestly, I doubt the cat will clog
up. If the engine is tuned well and you tune it up and make sure it's
not running rich, no reason the cat should clog.
