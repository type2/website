Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky cold start valve?

Did you try disconnecting the power to it first? Yes
you can bypass it no problem, but if you are going to
insert a short rigid line, I suggest you use a double
endded barbed nipple so it won't slip under pressure.
If you are going to pull the existing short pieces of
flexible line off and replace them with a longer line,
be sure to use high pressure fuel injection hose and
non-pinching clamps. That pump is capable of pressures
over 100psi and there are lots of burned up buses to
show what happens.

Did you ever check your fuel pressure? It's kinda
important in diagnosing a rich condition such as you
have.

I have had the coldstart injector come on during
normal driving and the black smoke blinded drivers
behind! I could barely keep the engine running.

You might also consider checking the wiring between
the CHT sensor and the computer... I've had problems
with brittle wires in the harness. I beleive it is pin
#13 - check for continuity between the CHT sensor and
the pin, wiggle the wires around over by the sensor
and see if the continuity checker blinks or tone
changes - whichever you use. Also check the resistance
at pin #13 to confirm it is the same as at the CHT
sensor.

The odd connector that the CHT sensor plugs into can
have oil film on the contact surfaces and it is
possible ti plug the wire in such that it does not
correctly contact.

Once again, if you block off (pinch shut the flexible
line)) the vacuum line to the pressure regulator, what
does the engine do? -BaH
