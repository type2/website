In terms of other VW models, you can find this out by looking up the part on
our site.

For example, if you go to the brake pads for your year ...

<http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=D195A>

and then scroll down on the page, it shows you all other VW years/models
that take the same part.  (In this case, just Bus and Vanagon thru '85.)
