Thank God for shops that like torque wrenches. I had a local franchise shop do some work on my '87 Accord. 

Installed tires from Tire Rack for me, alignment, etc. The got the alignment dangerously off - dialed out all of the camber (I think or was it caster?) causing the car to not pull to any side but it wandered terribly. 

The also tighted the wheel nuts down to 9000 ft-lbs. It took a cheater pipe to get them loosened again... 

Warped the hubs, rotors, and I think the wheels. Had a terrible vibration not related to balance or wheel roundness. Never checked the hubs with a dial indicator as I was pretty basic back then. 

Now I take a torque wrench with me and I get them to put the wheels on to a bit more than finger tightness and I do the final torque. They think I'm crazy but I don't care. One guy bragged he could get it just right. He ran thoise nuts down to 130 lbs. My Honda (most recent tire recipient) requires 85 ft-lbs I think... 

The best tire install I ever got was Sam's Wholesale. Antiseize, torque wrench, etc... 

Chris
