Subject: Disappearing Brake Fluid

I have a '71 VW camper van (hard top, not a pop top) and I have noticed that
while it has been sitting in my garage for the last 6 months, the brake fluid
in the reservoir behind the drivers seat, as gone from full to almost empty.
This happened without the brakes being used at all.  There are no brake fluid
stains on the floor under the van.  Is this the old 'brake fluid drains into
the brake vacuum booster' problem?  Is it new master cylinder time?  What
about the brake booster?   Can I just hold it up and drain the disapperaring
brake fluid out of it?  All comment, ideas, etc appreciated.
