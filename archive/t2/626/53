Flood the cable pipe with light oil. Pull the cable out until it gets stuck and push it back in. Pull again. Etc. 

You've prob got rust or gravel or muddy grease in the line. I had this prob with my Beetle and my bus. Had a Beetle fuel line with this prob. Consider cleaning ALL of the lines, and make sure the grommets at both ends of the tubes are in good shape...
