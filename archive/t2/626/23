Subject: Re: [T2]letting others fill the gas tank (NJ)

I live in NJ and NEVER let them fill the tank in our 78 and 75 busses,
and never get a hassle about it when I tell them either I do it or if
they don't hold it the whole time they will get gas all over the floor
when it falls out or wrecks the rubber inlet.  It's the *&#($ sprung
vapor recovery hose on most of the fillers; check Hess stations as ours
has the only nozzle I trust them with, although you must NEVER let them
top it up either.

 Over in N.J. everything is full-serve and so these guys go to fill out
 my tank. They can't quite get the nozzle into the filler hole and so
 decide to jam it in which winds up ripping the rubber filler elbow. Gas
 everywhere.
