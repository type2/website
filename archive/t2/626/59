Subject: Rear Turn Signals

Now that you guys have helped me fix my engine, I need assistance with the rear turn signals.  I have a '71 bus in which I am having problems figuring out the turn signals.  When I flip the switch for a left turn, the front turn signals work but both back lights come on as if the flashers were on.  Same thing happens when I move the switch for a right turn-----the front signal works fine but both rear lights flash at the same time.  Also if I push in the brake pedal while the turn signal is in either the left or right position, the red brake light on the dash comes on and nothing works!--  No signals up front or back.  I think I have a short someplace but can anyone tell me where to start?  I don't think it's the relay on the fuse box since I just replaced that with one from my local salvage yard and I had this problem prior to replacing the relay.  Any thoughts??
