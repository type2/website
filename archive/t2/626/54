I'll second the Sam's Club recommendation. I got my tires for my Volvo
there. They were dirt cheap ($35 each installed) and they checked a
book to make sure the tires were rated for my heavy Volvo. Then they
used anti-sieze and a torque wrench.

I still checked them myself (I'm anal like that) but I was very impressed.
