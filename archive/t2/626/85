Subject: Emission Control Continued....

I'm in the process of getting my emissions straightened out.  Thanks to some
good responses I got the charcoal canister figured out, now on to the EGR...
Too bad I don't have another 76 sitting at the neighbor's house for
reference...
Anyway, here is a picture of my new muffler and at the top you can see where
the connection is supposed to enter the engine bay is blocked off.  Anyone
have a picture of what is supposed to bridge the connection between the
muffler and the entry point or a part #?  It looks like the angle of the
connection on the muffler should point more upwards instead of parallel to the
heater box.

Meanwhile on the inside... I'm assuming the small thing in the front of the
engine bay in this picture is the EGR since it has a pipe that goes to the
outside (the part blocked off in the first picture).  The arm comming out of
what I'm assuming is the EGR has a hole in it.  Is a spring or something else
supposed to connect to this?

Thanks for your help.  I'm kind of in the dark since I can't find a visual in
Bently.
