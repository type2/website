Subject: Posting an ebay ad to the list

Dear Sir: A couple of days ago I posted an ad from ebay for a 1971 bay
window crewcab pickup parts car thinking that these are fairly rare and
somebody on the list might be interested. This was not my ad and I do
not stand to make any money on it. I received an email with the words
"banned from the list" in it. Are such listings Verboten ( forbidden)
on the list, or was the sender out of line? Thanks,
Tim "hawaii-bus-boy"   In my fleet:
