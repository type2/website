I bought a Tie Rod puller from AutoZone when I replaced my tie rods.
Instead of pulling the rods, the thing just bent and warped. I ended
up using a ball joint fork and a 5 lb sledge. Not kidding.

Luckily I was replacing so didn't need to save the things. 

BTW: Autozone did refund my money when I took the useless tie rod puller back.
