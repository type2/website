Subject: 1600cc vs 1776cc - What carbs/exhaust to use?

Hi List,

Is anyone running a 1776cc with heat exchangers and a
stock exhaust? Or with exhangers and a quiet pack?

What carburetion are you running, and what climate are
you in? Cold climates particulary of interest.

Trying to decide on a new motor, 1600cc vs. 1776cc..

Pmail me, or post to the list for the archives..

Thanks,
