Subject: Free doors and interior ect...

I have a early vanagon slider door and rear hatch. In beige color. No handles ,but good glass. In ok shape. Free to pick up.

I also have an interior from a 78 Westy. It is from the basic Westy with the cooler and sink combo. Didn't have the stove that was in the deluxe.
Also free for pick up.

Set of rear three point seat belts from a 91 GL pass van. Make your earlier van safe for the kids. Need the receivers from later 87(?) up vans. Includes most hardware $50.00 for the set. Will ship at cost.

I have one more gray jumpseat with bracket and seat belt. I am not sure what side it is for. Also have the two round lugs cut from the floor. Shipping the last one was a real pain. Would prefer not to ship this one.
$50.00 picked up.

All located in Mystic,CT. Free stuff must be picked up by this weekend. This time it really has to go to the dump.
