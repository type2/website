Sam's Club... 

Oh yeah. I went from 205/65-R15 (stock size) on my CR-V to 205/75-R15 and had to debate it with the manager... He was SURE they would not fit. They did and they corected the speedo error. 

Normally, the tire stores I have dealt with will just throw tires at a car, never looking at the stock size or weight limits. Had this happen at 3 tires stores when I was shopping for my bus. My friend who did not know better still has floppy Cooper car tires on her bus. Very busy in the wind.
