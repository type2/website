Subject: RE: [T2] Brake booster failure? (Yes, another person with this

Even if the diapram has a crack/hole in it it still helps you stop but will 
kill the engine. I've yet to perfect that heel to toe stopping technique. 
(heel on brake, toes on gas pedal).

Yea, it's probably the booster, it's been my experience twice now that if 
braking kills the engine the booster is toast. Seems if the hose was leaking 
it would be more of like a vacuum leak senerio. Maybe plug the hose as the 
booster and see if you have a vacuum leak. Experts feel free to pitch in 
here.

I'm not sure where the one way check valve is supposed to be. Mine just 
arrived in the mail today with my new master (thanks Bus Depot) and I'll be 
installing the master and the booster I picked up for $25 that "is known to 
be good". We'll see. I'm putting mine in the engine compartment. Both my 
71's didn't have one at all that I could find and it seems dumb to not have 
it really close to the manifold (or where it hooks up to on that type4 
beast).

And be careful driving boosterless, I've done it alot but hopefull that will 
stop in the next couple days. 2nd gear actually makes for pretty good 
stopping power.
