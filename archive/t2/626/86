Subject: In Which Changeable Tire Names Lead to Difficulty

Last time I purchased tires the information in the Library was very useful,
and I bought a great set of Bridgestones I have been very happy with.

This time I started with the Library again, but all the tire names seem to
have changed in the two years since I last bought tires.

Has anyone bought tires recently, and can you tell me what brand and what
model name you bought?

I have been looking for Michelin MXT, Bridgestone RD-603, and several others
mentioned in the library or the archives, but the company websites say they
are now discontinued.

What "C" rate tires have people been able to find recently?

Thanks in advance for your help.
