Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Turn Signals

Hiya Phil,

Sounds like someplace along the line your PO (or somebody) has cross-wired the rear lights.  In other words, you should have two separate dedicated leads going back to the rear turn signals.  It appears as if that has been reduced to one lead producing turn signals in both housings when only one was signaled from the switch.
And it sounds like the brake and taillights might be improperly hooked up.  That might well result in the brake warning light coming on when you hit the brakes with turn signal engaged.
In any event, do yourself a big favor and access the wiring diagrams at www.vintagebus.com and trace each of the wires going back to the turn signals.  Make doubly sure that every connection on the taillight housing confirms to the specs in the wiring diagram.  That should do it!
