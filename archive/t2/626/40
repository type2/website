Mark,

    You said...So I've been thinking about buying a full longblock
from Boston Bob. Even though the price makes me gnash my teeth, I am
sure that it's worth it in terms of peace of mind (and several people
on the list have assured me that this is so"...

    If my experience with Boston Bob is any indication, you'll get
great customer service, an even better engine, and peace of mind that
is priceless.  Before buying from Bob I made 2 long phone calls to
him.  I described our bus, how we drive, and what I wanted in an
engine.  He took the time to explain to me what he'd build, how I
should treat it, and the kind of support he'd provide to me for the
life of the engine.  Never once did he try to rush the call or cut me
short.  Keep in mind this is before I even spent any money with him.
After installing the 1600DP I bought from him I'm more than happy.
About a 18 months after buying the engine I did have a small problem.
After a routine valve adjustment I couldn't get the driver side valve
cover to stop leaking.  After changing gaskets a couple of times and
trying to tighten up the bale the leak persisted.  I gave Bob a call
and explained the problem.  He said not to worry, that he's send me
what I needed to fix it.  The next day (yes, overnight) a package
shows up with a valve cover, bale, and gaskets, all at no cost to me.
I put on the new parts and the leak was fixed.
    Since I was able to drive to his shop to pick up my engine he
spent about quite some time with me.  My wife and I got a tour of his
shop, a synopsis of his history with VWs, and an expalination of why
he does what he does.  While I can't garuntee you'd have the same
experience with him, I bet you would.
