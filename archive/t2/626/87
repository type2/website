Subject: Vanagon Throttle Cable Installation Questions

Volks,

My throttle cable snapped last night.  No sweat, just a really slow drive
home for the last couple blocks :-)  I got a new one today and am about to
crawl under the bus and thread it in there but wamted to ask if anyone had
any tips/tricks for installation on a V'gon?
