Subject: Help!  Starter problems with 81 CA emmisions

Hello - 
 
I'm desperate and grateful for any help you can give me.  
 
I have an 81 Vanagon with CA emissions.  Over the past year I've 
rebuilt the engine, replaced a whole lot of stuff, and had the starter and 
alternator professionally rebuilt.
 
I finished putting everything back together.  I purchased a new 
high-capacity battery and cleaned all the connections around the battery and 
around the starter.
 
When I hit the start button, I just get a click from the starter, as if 
the starter's not getting enough juice.  However, when I "jump" the 
solenoid with a screwdriver, I hear a high-pitched spinning noise, but the 
engine doesn't turn over.  I removed the starter and had it tested, and 
it works fine!
 
I've also run a jumper cable right from each terminal on the solenoid 
directly to the battery - it's not the battery cable.
 
There's also a weird assembly mounted on the undercarriage above and 
behind the starter.  It appears that the starter switch current goes 
through it on its way to the starter.  I can't find what this assembly is 
in any reference books.  I wonder if it could be the problem?
 
I greatly, greatly appreciate any help you can give.
