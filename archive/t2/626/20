Bill back in hosp with similiar problem he first went there for. Jerry
thanks for posting...some of the comments are worth an attorney looking into
all this. Have had 2 sleepless nights and don't know what's keeping me
going...but, hey, what else have I to do!!! Becca and family coming down to
help me out. Ely keeping the Colorado fires burning until later. Will not be
at B & B this weekend...too bad. Feeling out selling Melvan, and the '69 PU.
Don't all jump at once, want some decent dollars for both. And will sell
parts Bill has in stock as well. In time...and when we have more energy.
Love to you all.
Janet
