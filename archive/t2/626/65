According to this site
(http://www.funchords.com/favorite/noselfserve/), the fine is $500.
Between the questionable quality and the high price, getting gas in
Oregon is hardly the highlight of anyone's day. Getting the rubber torn
would make it a hat trick, I guess.

I have the same problem in Oregon. I just tell them it will spill and
they let me pump it. Once time a gas jockey told me he'd have to pump
it or risk getting fined $400 by the police. Anyone in Oregon know the
law?
