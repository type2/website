This seems to be the case and I will have a complete write up for it soon in 
refference to our buses. Mine is deffinately a '77 (Manufacture date Nov. 
'76). The fuse inplicated in full confusion to the problem at hand, 
previously. Difference between late models and Autou late models. I hope 
that it will get posted to the archives for all. Now if I can get my 
accelerator pedal connected to the throttle body I will be on my next phase. 
Stuck at the specific linkage from lever behind firewall to the throttle 
body.

I you have any pics of your linkage to the throttle body they would be very 
helpful,

Thanks,

Michael Knight
'77 Westy Deluxe, "el Verde"
