6th Annual CVA Foliage Cruise
October 3,2004
10:00 am till ???
Meet at VW of Old Saybrook  319 Middlesex Turnpike (route 154)

The cruise will end at local resaurant and all are welcome to stick around for dinner afterwards. There will be a handout with directions 
and eat locations available the morning of the cruise. May be a preview available on www.ctvwa.com this week. Rumor has it Clydes Cider Mill who host the Buses By the Mill campout will be heading up a hot cider/cold cider break for anyone in the cruise. Free of course!!
NOW THE IMPORTANT PART!!! WE NEED BUSES TO ATTEND THE CRUISE! I will be setting up the cider stop and can't make it till I am done there. Don't let me be the only bay or vanagon(not sure what we'll take). Lets show the bug people that buses are vw's too. Need directions let me know.
