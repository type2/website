OTOH, sometimes the liability concerns go too far...My buddy and I went
to a chain store to get a couple of "on special" tires for his trailer...All
we wanted was the tires put on the empty rims, but the clerk said he
"had" to know the make, the model, and the year to make sure the tires
were correct for the car... :-(
