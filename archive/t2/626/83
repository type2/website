Subject: 74 Westy Stool and veggie bus update

Does anyone know if the original bucket in a 74 Westy was a trash can or a
toilet?

I always thought they were trash cans but I have been told by many 74 owners
that they are toilets.  I now have one of the stools and it is shorter than
the later ones.  Complete with bucket.

Just wondered what the book said.

 For those that wanted to know....  My Petunia Bus drove under veggie oil
power for the first time last night.  :) She took the oil like she used it her
whole life.
