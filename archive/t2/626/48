Subject: Bus broken into last night.

Arrrgghhh!!!!

Bus, parked right in front of my apartment, was broken into. They
busted the sliding door handle to get it open, got in and tried to
steal my stereo. It's a $98 Pioneer bought at WalMart 4 years ago.
They couldn't get it out of the dash, so they smashed it, broke the
front off, and shoved it into the dash. It might be hanging from the
wiring in the dash now.

They also dumped my tools and stuff all over the back. Apparently they
were so pissed they couldn't have my stereo that they decided to do
what damage they could.

So now I need to figure out what needs replaced in the sliding door
mechanism, and dig the pieces of my stereo out of my dash.

Good times.
