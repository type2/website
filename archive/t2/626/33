About a year ago, a woman called the show wanting advice about what 
kind of vehicle to get for an extended road trip. She was going to 
travel around the country for six months or more. After batting ideas 
around for a while, Tom and Ray both agreed that she should get a VW 
bus, a camper. That way, they said, she would have plenty of stories to 
tell.  But they were sincere in making the recommendation.

So the advice included a dig against buses (buses break down, providing 
the meat for stories). But if they really think that a VW bus is one of 
the ten worst vehicles of all time, would they recommend it to a woman 
traveling alone for an extended road trip? Something is wrong with this 
picture.

My guess is that they have a really good friend who has a bus and 
thinks it's great, and the Tappet Brothers have put the VW bus on the 
list -- with certain justifications -- just to needle this guy.

Anyway, their idea of the perfect car is a 60s vintage Dodge Dart. So 
we need to get over our hurt feelings about this.
