Subject: Re: [T2] Battery won't hold a charge

Charge the battery outside of the bus and see if it holds a charge out of the bus. Then you know if the bus or the battery is bad. 

Clean the cables, clamps, and batt terminals. Also the cable to clamp connections. Cable to starter, etc. 

Use one of those $5 wire brush tools. Coat the connections with the spray can stuff or vaseline to seal them. 

The alternator kit is good if you are using more power than the generator makes. Also the generator does not charge much until the engine is at about 2250 rpm or higher. The alternator charges at full tilt at a much lower rpm like 1500 rpm or so. The generator charges more at higher rpms. 

I find that the generator works just fine under most conditions - just know it might not charge much idling around town. Keep the bus in 2nd and 3rd gear instead of shifting into 4th too early and it will keep the battery charged. 

In short, fix what you've got.
