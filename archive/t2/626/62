They are neither Nader prodigies nor are they narrow minded.  
Everything they say is true.  They have been sued enough over the past 
25 years that their legal advisors (the real ones) make them err on the 
cautious side.  Look at it like you did a bazillion years ago when your 
mom told you she didn't want you to play high school football because 
you would get hurt.  Most of us ignored Mom, played football, got hurt, 
had a great time, and have great memories.  Despite Tom's and Ray's 
"good advice", I choose to take the risk and have fun.  Isn't life 
good?
