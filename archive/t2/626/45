Mark,

Ecellent points!  I go to the same tire place all the time..why?...cause 
there is a "kid" there that has VW and knows how to shift.  There is also 
the same manager there from about 5 years ago and he *knows* who I am and 
how much business I do there(5 vw's + wife's cars...etc.).  I *still* ask 
if they want me to pull it in or out..

And what is most important...they are *not* a chain, and they appreciate
the cars(at least mine) that they do alignments and tire changes on.

The guys there too one look at my bus and wouldn't get into it(new 
upholstery, new paint and all else...yet they though nothing of hopping 
into a fairly new cadilac and pulling it in<grin>.

Cheers, dave
