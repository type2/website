I'd need the tripod and scope...

Come on, man.  I have old eyes and I can still do
that with open sights from the prone.  You need
more practice.  :)  Or you guys can chip in for a
plane ticket and I'll fly to Maaaaaaaaaaaas.  :)

Funny, those clowns think Caravans are excellent
vehicles.  I guess if I had a garage full of
Caravans with blown trannies worth a few thousand
net for me each, I'd like them too.
