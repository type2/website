Subject: ADMIN: BELAY More Clap & Trap

Volks,

I'm gonna have to put my admin hat on here.

This "Car Talk"/"Tappet Brothers"/"Clap & Trap" thread is really a 
Friday or weekend topic.

Please hold off on further postings until then.

Failure to do so will result in consequences that no one wants.

thanks,
