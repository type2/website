Hello Richard    Only number 2&3  are correct.   First off the large chain 
stores cause more problems and rip offs. This is mostly true with tire and 
brake,muffler places.  Shop recommendations mean everything coming from the right 
source.  Bug people and bus people are two different breeds and their thought 
process is totally different , I would much rather have a bus person tell me 
what shop works than a bug person. Now this doesn't mean that there aren't A**  
holes driving buses cause there are and it doesn't mean that all bug drivers 
are either .  Just my thoughts from running a small business for over 25 years. 
  The BBB    Bigger Bullsh*t Bunch  Did you know that if you are a member 
then they wont post a bad report against you???    Also any tool that does the 
job correctly is worht its weight   later and have fun  Mark Dearing    Salem
