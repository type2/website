Subject: Brake booster failure? (Yes, another person with this problem)

Ok, once I got my idle dialed in, I found that pressing on the brake
pedal will kill the engine.

So tonight, in the dark, I crawled around under the bus (which was
parked in the only available space in my complex which just happens to
be over a puddle..grrrrr) to find the leak. The hoses are all nasty
and brittle, so I'm prolly looking at replacing. When I pulled the
rear hose off a cloud of dust came down into my eyes. Ahhh, being one
with my bus once again.

But the brake booster did provide good assistance in stopping. So is
it a hose? The booster? The valve (that I can't find)? Where exactly
*is* the one way valve? Don't tell me it's up by the fuel tank
please... ;-)

At the moment the hose between the pipe to the carbs and the pipe to
the front of the bus is disconnected with a bolt in it. I'd rather be
able to idle since I'm often in traffic. I've driven boosterless brake
vehicles before, so I can just build up my muscles again. ;-)
