Subject: NJ Emission Help

Kevin:
The NJ Dept of Motor Vehicles has been screwed up for years and with the
present system you may end up taking it back 9 more times before you pass. I
have found it a waste of time to attempt to pass NJ emissions at any of the
state run facilities for any car over 10 years of age. Many of the listee's
may not know but in NJ you have the option of taking it to the NJ state
inspection, at no cost other than the annual registration, or taking it to an
approved garage at a cost of approx. $75.00 for a two year sticker. My
recommendation is either to find a "flexible" NJ approved private garage or to
take it to a small Air Cooled specialist who will push the car through the
process. The private garages are far more creative when it comes to the
inspection process and if its a non dealer VW specialist you may want to "take
care" of your new found friend. Let me know where you are located in NJ and
maybe I can recommend someone.
