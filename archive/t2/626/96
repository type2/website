Then your booster diaphram is torn and the booster needs rebuilding. The
test procedure is at:
http://www.type2.com/library/brakes/vacboo.htm
or search the type2 archives for "brake booster rebuild" for a longer
explanation but if applying the brakes kills the engine, then you have a
big leak and it's 99% sure to be in the booster.  From the archives, if
the booster is bad, see:

" A while back someone recommended H&R Booster (actually it's H&R
Automotive Parts) in Dallas to rebuild brake boosters.  I sent one to Ron
over night, he sent it out today.  Total cost including COD and overnight?
$105. H&R: 972-286-5516"

In the line from the balance tube to the booster.  As I remember on Dual
carb endines it is closer to the firewall but after 30+ years, it could be
anywhere or nowhere.  It is *not* in the gas tank compartment, but mey be
on top of the trans.  Run your hand along the vacuum line for the booster,
it's there somewhere!

OOK!
