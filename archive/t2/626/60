Subject: re Pitman arm puller and drag link boot

I managed to rip the boot on my drag link while trying unsuccessfully to get
it off the pitman arm on my bus. I suppose I should do something about it.
Does anyone sell just the boot for the drag link? There's no reason to assume
the link is bad, and I will grease it up nicely. Is the boot replaceable if
the link is pulled out?
Does anyone have a tie rod end/pitman arm end puller for sale for a reasonable
price? These puppies are expensive.
