It's important for car buyers to know what to expect.  Ambitious
buyers will buy anyway, and compensate with heaters, cautious driving,
and maybe even replacing their fuel lines and packing a fire
extinguisher.

This kind of propoganda is annoying and a pride hit, but it's not near
the obnoxious crap that get's slathered in with the "hippy"
stereotypes.

I've found most folks approach me in humor like this when asking about
the bus, and it's safety and reliability.  Glad for the tapit
brother's to set the stage.  It's fun to tell them it met car safety
ratings when could've been classified with truck ratings, and then
follow-up that it is 30 years old and I drive in full awareness of
today's driver's careening in their sound-proofed false sense of
security.  Like the man (Muir, I think) said (to paraphrase): There's
nothing reminding you of safety like being strapped to the hood of a
car going umteen MPH...
