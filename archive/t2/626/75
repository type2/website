What teh heck do those guys know anyhow... 

According to their list I am a stupid hippy chick who freezes in the winter how likes to go to music festivals and who needs to feel powerful on the morning commute... 

Let me translate: stupid (bus) Hippy (bus/Beetle) chick (Cabrio) who freezes in the winter (bus/beetle) who likes to go to music festivals (bus/Beetle) and who needs to feel powerful on the morning commute (CR-V)... 

This is slightly wrong...
