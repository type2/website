Here's the problem with not reading correctly:

NO, he's not. He said that when he put his gas adjusts on, it raised the bus 1/2". He didn't say he re-engineered the suspension to be carried by the shocks. He changed a part and made an observation.

>When the shock or the load leveller spring starts >fagging out---your right back a square one.

Fine, but that's not what was intended by replacing his shocks, merely an unexpected outcome.

>A load leveller devise was intended to supplement >the factory suspension unit--not be the main carrier >of the load.

The above paragraph is then repeated 4 times in case we missed anything.

People, read the posts for content and context before calling somebody on their sh*t, m'kay?  David Schwarze didn't join the bus community yesterday.
