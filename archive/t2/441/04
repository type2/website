Hi,

I am looking at this picture and was wondering what I am missing and
where to find it. The pic is at:

http://homepage.mac.com/ratwell/78_Westy/PhotoAlbum35.html it is "engine
right".

I have an opening~ where here it is covered. Just above the oil filler
tube and below the heater tube. The oblong black cap but what is it?

Peace

Meg
