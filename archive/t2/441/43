Ok, I don't think it's the calipers.  I think it's just that the end-play
is out of adjustment.  I'm waiting for some new caliper bolts to arrive so I
can pull the rotors and inspect/re-pack the bearings, but in the mean time I
think I'll just try and adjust the end-play back to normal.

However, I'm stuck.  Or, rather, the spindle cover is stuck.  I've pried,
banged on it with a dull chisel, and heaved on it with a wrench.  So far,
I have only managed to scratch it.

Can anyone share with me the procedure they use for pulling the spindle
cover on a '76?
