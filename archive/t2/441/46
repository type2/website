I went to my messages sent and found it---

Tis first mesage by Joel is key--and he is more than correct---

Shock absorbers have NOTHING to do to with the correct factory ride
height.
They will do nothing more than temporairily suppliment the current ride
height---
And from that point on--it's all down hill.

This is what I based my message upon.

First correct the initial factory torsion bar position--then add the
shocks of your choice---to assist the correct torsion bar height in
causibg the suspension to work properly--

This is what I was responding too--

Yes, the new shocks will temporaily raise the ride height--but not for
long with fagged out torsion bars---

This is a known fact.

David never mentioned the postion of his suspesion units--just he saw a
rise in the position of the rear of his Bus with the addition of the new
shocks--which is  common occurance--not permanent--but true. 

Later,

Can't agree with you 100% Joel. When I swapped out my dead rear shocks
for KYB Gas-Adjusts a few years ago, the rear of the bus did come up a
little. I think it was 1/2", or about half the amount that the Monroe
coilover shocks raised it. Oil filled shocks will not affect ride height
but gas charged shocks do have a bit of lift associated with them. And
1/2" is more than you think.
