Subject: tuned exhaust

What do readers recommend for a tuned exhaust/muffler combination. I like an
extractor style, but they are too loud to enjoy my radio. A stock exhaust
strangles the engine and sounds tinny. I also like the look and sound of the
4 tip Monza, but they seem to wear out quickly and don't do much for
performance. What free flow exhaust and muffler combination are available
that give you the performance boost without the extreme noise? Is there such
a thing?
