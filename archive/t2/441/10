Subject: re replacing ignition electrical switch

I just received a new electrical part of my ignition switch.
I had a look in the Library and my Bentley. My question for those who have
done it is, what is the easy way to replace just the electrical portion of the
switch, for a 1970 bus?
I know about the very easy to lose tiny grub screw, I'm putting a pail under
that sucker.
Is there a way to do it without pulling the steering wheel off? I ask because
the threads on my steering shaft are buggered and I am not hoping to have to
install the replacement steering shaft I got from Busted VW just yet.
Also, the new switch has wires attached, but no terminals on them or
instructions. How hard is it to route them, is it a dash dissassembly job or
fairly easy?
My existing switch works fine, I'm just doing this as a routine maintenance
item, my 33 year old switch could be corroded internally and have internal
resistance.
Any advice from those that know welcomed.
