Hi Paul,

How about laminate flooring?

OK, it won't look stock but it will be cost-effective and will insulate 
well and look great.

Last summer I refinished the floor of my camper with interlocking 
laminate flooring. I put it down over a layer of 1/4" masonite.  For 
additonal sound and heat insulation I'd suggest you use a layer of 1/8" 
foam on top of thinner masonite. It was easy to install and I bought a 
bundle on sale for only $35CDN.
