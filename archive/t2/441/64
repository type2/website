If your looking to raise your vehicles ride height because your
suspension is worn out--which it seems is where your going, the shocks
are the cheap shot and defiantly not the correct solution.
Credentials?
GM apprenticeship 67, journeyman to 72      ( Cadillac / Chevy, coils
air ride, leafs )
72 to present Mack Truck, air ride, multi leaf, torsion bar )

Shock absorber's will temporarily raise ride height, but I guess you
want to be  changing shocks every six months--

The gas doesn't necessarily have to dissipate--the o-rings and seals are
the wear out factor here--they don't hold the factory set pressures
after awhile.

I had a problem with a guys Mack out of Canada once---he was down to
O'hare field twice a week--his front tires were cupping--I did the front
end alignment---replaced everything.
Balanced the tires twice----still cupping.
It turns out he was running such a light load on the 20,000 lbs front
end, that the front end had tendency to bounce just enough to cause
this--unknown to the owner of the truck.
There was a shock place downtown Chicago that custom built shocks---ride
height, rebound, stroke, load--whatever.
They built me a set of shocks to my specs to correct this problem--

And the shocks worked great--raised the ride height 1/ 16th of an
inch---cured the cupping.
For 7 months---

The ultimate permanent cure was to have the owner of the Mack to alter
his loading procedures in the trailer---load the nose heavier--
He was a rocked headed Canadian--and didn't want to do this--but I just
told him flat out that unless he wants to be doing this shock change
twice a year he best do this.

End of story---

 Now I don't know what you qualify as an expert David---
But I've been at this longer than most, and at best takes no nuclear
physicist to know supplementing shocks for springs / torsion bars isn't
the correct solution to the problem. 
 
I have said plenty--and don't really want to debate this any longer on
the list---

P-Mail me if you want if you need any help---or if you have any more
mfg. propaganda you'd like me to see.


Have Fun--

Terry
