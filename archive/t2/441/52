Again I say that certain gas shocks can raise ride height.  KYB Gas-Adjusts are an example of this type.  Here is a quote from someone else on VintageVW who put it more eloquently than I did:

"High pressure (called DeCarbon, after the inventor) gas shocks have this type design. The most common makes are Bilstien and KYB Gas-A-Just. These shocks take about 50-75 lbs to compress, and will raise your car slightly if it was not fitted with these type shocks from the factory."

My gas-adjusts came tied up and when I cut the strap they expanded with a good deal of force.  I had to compress them to install them.  Same with the Bilsteins I recently put on our Expedition.

They will continue to boost ride height until they lose pressure... at which point they need to be replaced because they are shot.

Here are some other references:

3. Gas shocks raise your car's ride height.
Yes and no. Because of the design of gas shocks, nearly all of them do affect the car's ride height somewhat. Some gas shocks raise the car more than others. All of our suspension systems are designed with gas shocks in mind. AUTOTECH Springs, for example, are designed with compensation for a small amount of gas shock lift.

From  http://www.monroe.com/tech_support/tec_shockabsorbers.asp
"An additional benefit of gas charging is that it creates a mild boost in spring rate to the vehicle." 

 From http://www.n2speed.com/shocks.html
"The gas reactive force in Bilstein shocks may raise your car's ride height slightly."

 From http://www.proshocks.com/rshocks/FAQ/FAQ1.htm
"The High gas pressure thus raises ride height and also makes scaling the race car difficult due to the gas pressure acting as a false spring."

 From http://64.226.197.185/Paragon/Info/ask_dr_koni.htm
"High pressure gas shocks (like the rears on a 911) can tend to raise the ride height of a car a bit."

Seems a few retailers/manufacturers agree with me.  Would you care to support your argument with something other than, "I am a suspension expert" and "It's a known fact"?
