David,
I bail on this--and only simply because I erased all my previous E-Mails
Last night---

BUT--it seems to me the subject matter of having a torsion bar
adjustment was precluded by your suggestion of adding new shocks which
would vacate the need of an inital factory level height adjustment.

Is this correct-? 
And I am sorry, if in fact I misread your responce to the original
message---

It seems to me you suggested that in fact a new set of shocks would
renew the ride height of a Bus--  alone.

If I mis-read this post --I apologize---  

Later,
