Subject: LIST BASHING

Hi James,

Welcome to the list. Unfortunately you just happened to see some of the
listees on an
"off day". It was probably never intended to become a bashing session, but
that's the way life goes
sometimes, ya take the good and the bad....but just ignore the bad stuff.
This list is here to help and it is very helpfull to be part of.
I am so glad to be apart of this list because every time I have a question
there is alot of
helpfull insight that others have gone through.
I am willing to help out as much as I can but I don't have all the answers and
I can only say
what has worked for me.
Don't let those people in the world stop you from being part of something
good.

Cheers,
Darren
