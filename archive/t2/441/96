A good (digital) volt-ohm meter should have an amp scale on it; mine
goes to 10 amps.  Usually if you have this, their is an extra port to
switch the red lead to.  Just pull the PLUS wire to the device you are
testing and place the meter in line with it and the plus wire.  Radip
Shack sells a nifty plug in meter that shows the actual wattage/amps of
a 120 volt device you can use with the power supply to see the actual
draw of the device.  We use it in a campground to determine draw when we
share a connection.
