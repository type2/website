Subject: '78 decel valve

I have a Federal '78 manual trans Westy.  It looks like the decel valve I 
would need is...

  022-133-551B  Decelerator Valve Bus MT 1976 to 1978


Can I use either of the following??

039-133-551B  Decelerator Valve Bus Federal MT 1979

071-133-551  Decelerator Valve Vanagon Federal MT 1980 to 1983

BTW, how would my Westy react, driving wise, if the decel valve has gone 
'bad'?

Thanks
