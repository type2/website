Subject: Still on about the Oil Pump

I am sorry to keep beating this one to death but I am still in the dark on
this one.

Background:
I am running a type IV 2.0 in my 78' Westy. Engine is stock w/FI and has a
Web-cam grind 75 with solid lifters and a bolted on cam gear. I want to
replace my oil pump with a new pump. The motor has 12k since rebuild. I
never replaced the pump at the rebuild and oil pressures are ok but could
be better especially on hot days. I am looking at the Schadek 30mm from Air
cooled.net and a melling form Bus depot. I have consulted John at A/C.net
and he has mentioned that I will need to make some mods to the Schadek to
get it to fit as well as use a type 1 cover plate since its a type 1 pump.
I just got word form Jake Raby that I will need a modified cam gear to run
this pump. I was checking with him to see if maybe he had some of these
pumps already modified and ready to install. So I am not splitting this
engine to replace the oil pump.
Now the questions:

1. What is the size in of the stock pump? 26mm?
2. Can I run the melling? Remember the cam gear has bolts.
3. Will it need mods as well?
4. Will blueprinting the pump I have now make it perform any better?

I am hoping to have all of my ducks in a row when I go to my old shop to
drop the motor and do this pump along with the cooler intall I am planning.
I don't want to get stuck with the motor out and my new pump not being able
to install. I have access to some machining equipment and a friend who is
pretty handy with that stuff but I don't want to have to reinvent the wheel
just to replace my oil pump. Any help is always appreciated.
