Paul,

How about marine plywood with some grooves cut in it to let air circulate
and then go overboard by painting it with por-15.

I started painting the tops of my fence posts with my left over por-15(I 
always pour out way too much for some reason)..and it works great.

Think about it!


Cheers, dave

I had been thinking about what kind of insulation to use under the linoleum.
