Subject: Distributor timing and stalling solved

Thanks to those who supplied the timing info.
while installing one of those electronic point replements I decided to make 
sure the vacuum plate was still free to move. I sucked on the retard connection 
and could not get a suction and of course the plate did not move.  hole in 
diagphram
VACUUM LEAK!  replaced the diagpram with spare installed and no more stalling.
