Subject: Vans in the Artic

So here I sit, idly wondering about my new (old) van
wondering how good of a transporter it's going to be this winter.

It's a 78' van with some camper goodies inside. New(er) all season
tires on it, 2 batteries, supposibly in good mechanical condition with
a block heater.

Winter's get pretty cold here in Saskatchewan (Canada) and I was
wanting some input on if I can expect this thing to drive ok this fall.
Good oil and... ?  You would think an air cooled machine would love
the cold.

For day to day travel I have a beater of a car but every 3-4 weeks
I have some long distance travel and it would be nice to use the VW.
(ie 7-8 hours one way)

Am I being unreasonable and overdemanding like my ex was?

:-)
