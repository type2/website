Hey Jeff,
My grandpa taught me that one back in 69 when he and my uncle were building
and racing sprint cars. I haven't heard anyone mention that method in years!

From the sounds of his description it looks like he had a valve seat sucking
up though.

Get a   length of 3/8" nylon rope...

Rent a valve spring compressor that goes under the rocker arm stud at local
Autozone or similar.  Remove the spark plug and turn the engine so the
piston is down in the cylinder.  Tie a knot in the end of the rope and feed
the other end into the spark plug hole - the knot is so you don't lose the
whole thing!

When you have a bunch of rope in there, turn the engine back so the piston
presses on the rope, and the rope presses on the valve...then you can use
the spring compressor on the valve to replace the missing spring without
dismantling the engine...
