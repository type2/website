Subject: RE: [T2] Ebay quote of the day...

Man, I must have a real potty head.... I was beside myself, I thought it was
soo funny.  The entire time I thought we were talking about a NEW OLD STOCK
"Stool" as in... ahem... waste. One from a Camper mind you...
 
And then when you said "Used, but it's the nicest one I've ever seen" that
was just the icing on the cake.

The headline title reads "NOS Camper Stool!"

Open the ad and it reveals that the stool is "Used,

but its the nicest one I've ever seen"

NOS = Not Overly Sat (on)... ?-(
