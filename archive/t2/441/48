 The only stat I know for sure is
 that I left my laptop charging from the inverter by accident overnight
 and the "house" battery was still charging it in the morning, the
 laptop draws a puny 65w but its an indicator.

65w?  In a 12 volt system that is over 5 amps!  Gotta be lower than
that!  A 12 v TV is only about 13 watts.
My electric fridge draws 4 amps (48 watts).
