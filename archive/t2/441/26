Hi James,

Your bus won't mind the cold. I drove a 73 camper through 3 cold 
Toronto winters. OK, these are nothing to a Sask. winter, but it was 
pretty cold for a long stretch in 2000/2001.  You will have more 
trouble with the cold than the bus will. Air-cooled VW's have a bad 
reputation for poor heating.

If your bus has a functional gas furnace, you will be OK. Without it 
you will be pretty cold.

Before winter comes, you will want to make sure that the heater boxes 
and furnace are working. Be sure the defroster vents blow freely, and 
that you get warm air when the controls are requesting it. Also make 
sure your door and window seals are intact and seal up any drafts. If 
you have time to insulate the bus, it will be time well spent.

In extreme conditions it might be advisable to create a partition 
behind the drivers seat so that you don't have to heat a full 150 cubic 
feet of bus if not entirely necessary.But i you're hauling passengers 
they won't like it much.

Forget about those little 12V heaters, they won't make any difference. 
If you're looking for an electrical solution, try an electric vest like 
the motorcyclists and snowmobilers use. But don't rely 100% on an 
electric solution for a long trip, if you break down you could freeze 
to death.

Happy trails,
