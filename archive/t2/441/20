Subject: simple head replacement

 I'd like to replace a head (another bus), and I was wondering what is required beyond the obvious remove all and replace all. According to the technote...

...a shim goes in if it's not already there. VW still has the shims at 7.88 each but what is used for adhesive D 000 400?

How do I apply the adhesive?

Is there a cheaper source for the shim?

Anything else I need to know?
