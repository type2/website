Paul,

I'm in the same boat, looking for insulation/noise proofing, I had some 
samples sent to me from b-quiet.com who have a few insulation/noise 
proof materials and they look like they would do the trick.  A few of 
the samples have a noise proofer with foam and aluminum on top and they 
say its used for engine bays and stuff, so it must prevent heat 
transfer.

Anyways, the url is http://www.b-quiet.com if you wanted to look too.
Steve
