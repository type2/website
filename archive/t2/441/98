Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding Windows

> Does anyone know if the sliding windows from a 78/79 Bus or even A vanangon
 fit nicely into a 74 Bus. I hate replacing those nasty popup windows that love
 to rust out at the bottom. Alternative suggestions are most welcome !!!

The late bay sliders will fit all bay window buses from 68 to 79.

Vanagon sliders will not fit in a bay bus.
