Subject: 75 electrical situation

I have a 75 Bus that when use the turn signal, the alternator light on the dash glows lightly. And if I step on the brakes, the light gets a little brighter. And the situation even gets worst at night when the lights are on. Now when I am just using the brakes, the Alt light never comes on period. The Alt is putting out 14 volts and I have replaced the regulator. I have replaced the turn signal switch also to see if that was the problem and the situation remains the same. The neat part is, that when I use the 4-way, I get no Alt light glow. Any ideas??
