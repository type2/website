single quiet pack and I must say that this is the biggest piece of sh*t muffler 
set up I have ever used.  ('72-'74 style)I am on my second muffler in 
3500miles.  The welds broke on the first one in less than a 1000 miles, the second now 
has come apart on the muffler seam where it is tack welded.  So what ever you 
do, stay away from Empi.  Actually, every EMPI product that I have used in 
the last couple of years has worn out or broken in a VERY short time making 
their products worthless in my book!I have heard that BugPack has purchased S&S 
headers, or maybe the other way around...and I think they have a stronger 
product.So, I too, am thinking of going back to stock.Pablo >>

Any idea where the stuff was made...?-( Not that it "should" matter, but from
this list (and three other semi-orphan car lists that I'm on) the consensus 
seems
to be a general decline in product quality even from previously dependable 
"brand
names"...
