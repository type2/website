Subject: Re: [T2] Still on about the Oil Pump

IMO, melling pumps are junk for several reasons. A good aluminum pump will
outperform the melling UNLESS you full flow the melling pump. Since you have
a T-4 and will not be doing this, run an aluminum pump. I recommend a 30mm
pump on T4s. You must shorten the drive snout approximately .095". You can
do this as nicely as a mill in a machine shop, or as not-so-nice as a hack
saw and/or grinder (make sure it's straight, and only take off as much as
you have to).

A T-1 pump will require a T-1 pump cover (flat). The stock T-4 pump is a
PITA to work on, and they are expensive and the T-1 pumps are better too.
The "hot ticket" in 914 racing for over 20 years has been to use a T-1 pump.

during installation, make sure the pump body clears the cam and cam gear
(this is why you have shortened the snout). Also, as with ANY pump, you must
check the drive gear depth, adjusting within the range of .225-.275". Push
the gear off or on the drive shaft with a press or vice (I use a vice), with
a couple appropriately sized sockets. We tell you more details when you buy
a pump from us, if this isn't enough information.

Consider resurfacing the pressure relief bore for more low RPM pressure.
this has the advantage of not using different oil or a different pump to get
more pressure. We usually see an increase in idle pressure of 5psi, though
customers have reported 10psi increase after the procedure, which can be
done on an engine in the vehicle if you use our tool (which we sell or
rent).
