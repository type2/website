Sounds like you did the correct thing.  You have to be careful not to get
the ignition hot wire on the same terminal as the points wire, or you will
get no start and smoke pouring out of the distributor as the points wire
fries!  The hookup is ignition hot, backup lights, auto choke, and
anti-dieseling solenoid on one side of the coil and the points all by
themselves on the other.
