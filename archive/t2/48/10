Subject: Vaccum and air hose connections

I am assembling my first vw engine and have actually gotten it to start and
stay running.  I would like some details on where to connect all the air and
vaccuum hoses.  I have complicated things a little by installing Fuel
injection on a 73 1700 engine.
My questions in particular as as follows.
Where is the  Vacuum source for the distributor advance (and what to do with
2 connections on dist) I thought I would leave out the vacuum cutout switch?
Where to connect the fuel pressure regulator
where to connect the fuel vapor recovery valve on air cleaner 
where to connect the 2 large and one small connection on the charcoal
cannister
where to connect all 3 ports on the decel valve.
where to connect the vacuum servo for the brakes
where to connect the auto transmission vacccum solenoid.

I have 2 large and 1 small port on the intake air distribution box. 1 large
is hooked to the aux air regulator and on to the goose neck. 
I have the crankcase breather hooked to the really large port on the goose
neck.
The throtttle valve has one snall port ( doesent feel like much vaccum
there?)
The EGR valve was mechanically operated so no vacuum source needed.
