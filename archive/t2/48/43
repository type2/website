Subject: Re: [T2] front beam replace (-at-)#$%*#

OK it is Friday and just need to blow off a little steam!

in the process of replacing the front beam on my 78 auto tranny (thanks
BustedBus) I have spent all day getting just 3 bolts loose!  this has got
to be one of the dangest jobs I have undertaken,   can't get the pin out
of the brake pedal clevis, can't get the auto tranny linkage apart at the
front, just one dang thing after another.  And this is my daily driver,
gotta go back to work next Fri!!!  
heck I had to cut the heat ducts out with a sawzall cuz  it sure wasn't
comming apart...thought I had all the tools I needed, and I don't even
have to press out or in the ball joints!  got new ones already pressed
into new front torsion arms....

any ideas!
any beer!

sheesh!
