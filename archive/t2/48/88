PURRRRRRRRRRRRR!

She's running and she's beautiful!

Took a little bit to work the gunk out, but she runs
great.  Took her for a spin around the block and
everything works.

It took a little more checking: 

Fuel Pressure: Check
Replace Fuel Filter: Check
Inspect all hoses: Check
New Air Filter: Check

Install Head Temp Sensor: Check (what a pain!)

Thanks to all who responded to my questions and for
bearing with me.

Sam
