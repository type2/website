Subject: Re: [T2] oil pump removal

Couple of things. Buy a pump puller, they're so cheap you'll kick yourself
for doing it any other way. Second, did you loosen the case bolts, remember
its a tight fit. Too late now, but most of the time that flickering light is
the oil pressure sending unit, not the pump. Lastly, if you add a proper
full flow filter, remember you have to tap the case, so it needs to be done
with plenty of grease to pick up the shaveings.
