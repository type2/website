Subject: Re: [T2] Anti-Spam Blacklists

The primary reason this list continues successful is because of the good
efforts of the administrators. It's no big deal finding a bunch of
enthusiasts for any subject, but making a web/email forun/list successful
through the years requires much more. Without the good and thorough work of
the administrators of this list through the years, it would never have
grown into a very effective and sustainable entity.
