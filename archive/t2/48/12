>Advance doesn't have Rotella.


When I worked at Advance we carried Rotella.

Ask the manager on duty if they can get it for you because I suspect they 
have it in the system but their area manager chooses not to stock it.

Usually stuff in the system that they order for you costs the same as if 
they had it in the system.

Came in gallons and 5 gallons.

And oil and filters and stuff like that is about all I by at Advance 
anymore. But that's another discussion....  <grin>
