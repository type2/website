The cap is Bosch part number  9 231 081 413, which I have for $9.95.  The
rotor is  9 231 061 628, currently out of stock but not discontinued.  (My
memory tells me that a more common rotor also works but I don't recall
which.)

This is a good example of how you can use my website as a reference tool...
typing in 050 in the keyword search box pulls up the cap part number (but
not the rotor, at the moment, as it is temporarily unavailable).
