Nah, it is more part of the engine tin, sorta. (part# 022-119-281) I
think you are thinking of where the fan blows air into the alt. I have
that one. I take full responsibilty for my pitiful description:)

if it's the rubber boot that carries air, mine is fine. this little
piece (if it exists) would fit in an oval shaped opening w/ a seal for
the small round shaft the dipstick fits in mabey at a 45 degree angle
up. I haven't seen anything here to make me think there is such a piece,
just that it might be a good thing to have there.

thanks for the info.
