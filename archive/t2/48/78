Subject: SS Headers

I just installed an S and S header/muffler system on my 83 Aircooled
Westfalia.
Here's the skinny:
#1. They moved the tail pipe from the passenger side to the drivers side.
I don't particularly like this but it could keep me from breathing my own
exhaust fumes through the heater system.
#2. It is a close fit to the rearmost body sheet metal but it does clear.
#3. It has a lot on ventilation around the header pipes so it will
possibly not heat the sheet metal below the engine intake cooling fan
quite as much.
#4. The muffler is not totally silent but is very quiet when the engine
is idling, The sound picks up slightly as you accelerate but I don't find
it offensive like glass packs or a hole in a muffler.
My goal in installing the SS header/muffler system was to improve engine
breathing and possibly have the two benefits of a cooler running engine
and a slightly better acceleration in third gear between 2000 and 4000
rpm for freeway entry ramps.
Bus Boys was the vendor on this system, should you want to explore it
farther. The system they sell for a 79 model 2000cc will not fit the
80-83 because of clearance problems and the 80-83 system is not a
standard catalog item.
