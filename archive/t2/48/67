If you haunt wrecking yards, the front belts out of 80's era VWs and Audis
will work fine.  The buckles are usually riveted together in a harness, so
you drill the rivet out so you can install them individually to the seat
pedistals.  The inertia reels come with a bracket that can be turned 90
degrees for the bus application.  Some of them have a locating pin that
has to be unscrewed for the bus application.

Get the right side belts out of two different cars if you can.  Much less
wear and tear on the right side belts.
