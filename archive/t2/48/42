the gas tank on the 78 is above the rear axle, so it is in front of the
gas fill,  just inside the opening the pipe takes a hard right and down at
about a 30-45 degree angle. at this turn is a rubber fitting, stuffing the
nozzle in there the wrong way can tear that rubber.=20

so take your finger and put it into the gas tank fill and feel around in
there, use a flash light (but not a match!) to look.  I would suspect you
have a leak there.  now until you can fix it make sure you get the nozzle
in past the tear and you should be able to fill up alright.

that rubber part is very hard to find (I think Bus Depot has found a
few) I got one from someone in Australia of all things, shipping was more
than the fitting.

now unfortunately changing this part is one of the hardest jobs I have
ever done on my 78, it is in an absolutely awkward place with very little
manuvering room.  wait until your engine is out for something else to make
it a little easier.

on the other side of the bus is the vent line for the gas tank and it can
leak too, check the archives for instructions on how to fix this, it is
fairly easy

good luck
Bob
