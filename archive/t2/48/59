Subject: head temp sensor follow-up


Hello Listers,
I sent out an email about my friend's 2.0 FI '78 westy, which has the 
problem with the drilled out head sensor hole. i spent a bunch of time on it 
yesterday, and found out a few things. it looks like someone drilled out the 
sensor hole to about 19mm bolt size, maybe to put a head sensor off 
something else in there? the "spring" that was loosely wrapped around the 
sensor threads, is probably a home helicoil. my illustrious neighbor tried 
to use tin foil around the sensor to make it work. of course the mixture was 
awful and the exhaust was white. we tried to remove the number 2 screw and 
just extend the wire to the opposite spot of the head sensor, but the 
phillips is stuck.. even with penetrating oil and liquid wrench... 2 days 
soaking. so, i was now thinking about doing a (very) temporary repair of 
using solder in the hole. does the engine get too hot for that? would it be 
better to try to re-helicoil? should we instead pull the motor and replace 
the head?
help, i need to get the bus out of my driveway soon, and i would hate for 
her to think i am incompetent, since i only am sometimes!
anyway, any more ideas?
-jeremy
