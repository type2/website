Subject: my bus for sale

I've been dragging my feet about selling my '71 Westy, because i 
really hate to see it go. but now i've decided that i really do need 
to sell it soon.

There's a full description, with pictures, at 
http://www.nofrillsdvd.com/perry/bus.html

I've lowered the asking price, too. This bus is in Boston, MA and is 
in fantastic shape [there are not many like it in New England, that's 
for sure!]. see the pictures and descriptions at the link above to 
see what i mean.

right now i could use the money more than the bus, but i'll 
eventually get another one when my living situation is more suited to 
keeping one of these rust-free [ie: when i have a garage!]

i miss it already.
