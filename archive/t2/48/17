Subject: FWD: "The Great Bus Tour" and Hubcap... 

Posted to the Vintagebus list. Crossposting 'cause it might be of
interest to some of us baywindow drivers. Looks like the hubcap is
headed back east (again??).

Happy Friday

Good morning all,

This morning the infamous "Hubcap" and it's travelling trunk full of
wonderful goodies was placed into the bed of the only known fully and
freshly restored Binz Double Cab.  It will now continue it's journey
to many points elsewhere.  It's been in the St. Louis area since the
"Busses Nowhere Near The Arch" event on Labor Day.  Dan Kinsey just
picked up his 1958 Binz from the restoration shop in Grand Junction,
Colorado and is currently driving it across the USA towards his home
near Orlando, FL.  He swung by last night to rest and overnight with
us here in the suburbs of St. Louis, MO.  Man, is that Dove Blue
paint job beautiful!!!  They did a nice job on this Binz.  

Anyway, we had the formal Hubcap "Handoff" ceremony in my driveway,
complete with the required photographs, and they I hopped into my
1959
Double Door Panel and Dan into his Binz and we went off to enjoy
breakfast before he hopped onto the highway bound for Atlanta
tonight.  So if you're out and about today in the Midwest and see a
southeast bound flash of Dove Blue, chase him down, or at least wave!
 Dan has just left St. Louis, heading east on I-64 to Mt. Vernon, Il
and then turning south onto I-57, then onto I-24 through Paducah, KY,
continuing on I-24 through Nashville, TN to Chatanooga.  Then he'll
hop onto I-75 south to Atlanta.  I imagine
he'll be trying to hook up with Dave Easterwood of NEATO fame in the
Atlanta area tonight.  On Friday he'll go straight through to the
Bulli Brigade event down in Tampa to debut the Binz and show off and
then pass on the Hubcap to someone there so that it can head off in
new direction.  

If you're going to the event and interested seeing the Hubcap, please
look Dan up.  If you might be interested in carrying the torch for a
leg, you must be able to transport it "only" in a Type 2 of some
kind/era.  There is a web site for "the Great Bus Tour at: 
www.type2.com/~chuff    for more Tour info.  Check out the cool
donated momentos of previous keepers of the Hubcap and read the Tour
logbook which is constantly updated by the current Bus driver.

It was great to see Dan and his very cool Binz, and it was nice to
see the Hubcap heading off in a new direction again.  Check both out
if you can!
