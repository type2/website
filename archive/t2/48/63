I put them in my daughters 77 Westy......then I took them out. The idea was
great but the Vanagon belts were too short. She hated them. She could not
move.... The mounting place for them on the drivers side, that panel behind the
seat, even with a large flat washer for support was mickey mouse at best. In a
accident, it would have torn out. And don't even talk about the passenger
side...... all that is available for support is the tiny diagonal piece, way at
the bottom. On Vanagons, the reel mounted halfway up the B pillar, so the length
of the belt was OK.
A better choice are 411 belts. They have a L bracket that mounts the reel at the
same bolt as the bus belt mounts. And the length is correct.
