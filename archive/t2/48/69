Subject: Weekend fun 'n games - bus sightings

While my wife watches lifetime movies on the weekend,  I play a little
game.  I untangle myself from the garage for lunch (Usually a tunafish
sandwich, chips, and a pickle).  I then sit and watch, until I see a bus of
some sort in the movie.  As soon as I spot one, I can go back to work.

ps,  I  sometimes do this even when she's not home (secret shame, everyone
has one;)
