Subject: Re: [T2] Buses in Lawrence

I think that you will find the most busses in the midwest in BIG 12 college 
towns. I am in Columbia, MO with the University of Missouri and have made 
several trips to the university of kansas in lawrence and the only time I 
see busses is in the two towns and there are quite a few, but I've never 
seen even one while driving over there. I have also seen lots at K-state, 
Baylor, and Iowa state, and only in the towns the schools are in. I am sure 
there are lots more in the midwest but maybe only college kids ever drive 
em.
