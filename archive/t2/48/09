Subject: Engine or transmission oil leak??

Howdy everyone!
I have just recently remove my engine (type4 engine,79 bus)
to fix a number of things including a oil leak.
The leak seemed to be coming from the transmission and engine
mating area. It looked like transmission oil, fairly clear and I
figured thats what it was since I changed the oil in the trans about
3k miles ago.  After I removed the engine the clutch area had some
oil in it, not a huge mess, surprisingly the clutch/flywheel was very
clean. So I replaced the input shaft seal only even though I had a
rear engine oil seal also on hand. Stupid I guess but it looked
alright at the time and I didn't think the rear seal was the culprit.

Well I've got the engine back in now and it seems their is still a
leak. From what I can see their is oil on the bottom of the
transmission all along the lowest point, like the case seem is
leaking, doubt it.  There is also oil on the bottom of the engine to 
transmission mating surface.  And oil on low points along the bottom
of the engine.  Now I'm figuring its leaking from the rear main seal
and getting blow onto other sections of the bottom of the engine.
That would explain the extra oil on the bottom of the engine, but not
the oil on the bottom of the transmission. Figuring the wind blows
it back as I drive how does oil end up on the transmission bottom?
I haven't been know to drive around in reverse for hours on end at
moderate speeds.

So what i'd like help with is....
1) Do you guys think the leak is from the rear main seal or
some where else?
I'd HATE to pull the engine again and not fix it.
I'm having a very hard time telling them apart since I recently
changed the trans oil and its not to dirty yet I suppose.
The smell of the oil doesn't give me any clues either. Also the
engine oil level has gone down a little in the last hundred miles.

2) How much longer can I drive with this leak, after I park the
puddle is about the size of a half dollar in two places.

Also any clues on why this seal is leaking, it only has 1,500
miles on it. I checked the endplay and it was within spec last
time the engine was out for the trans seal. It is a recent
rebuild though.

thanks for the help you guys have given me in the past
