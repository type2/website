Hey guys,
        You are going to laugh when you hear what I did. I went in windows
paint program on my computer and made up this long drawn out diagram to see

if you guys could help me figure out the right wires to change and what
not.
So anyway I diagram out the postive side of the coil and then I go outside
to sketch the negative so i can draw it on the computer. Anyway as I am out

there and I switch one of the wires from negative to positive like you all
said and it worked, no stalling now......So I did all that work diagraming
it out and then I fixed it...Go figure...Right? Thanks so much you
guys....I
have one more question though there is a wire coming from the wire condiut
that holds on of the wires from the postive side of my coil(i think the
wire
for the ingnitions switch) Anyway this wire goes to a terminal set into the

engine tin a bit and is right behind the distributer? What is this wire
Because it starts up with out it being hooked up and runs ok...I am curious

please let me know what you guys think...Thanks again for the help this
mailing list is the Best.......

                                     Thanks,
                                         Travis

                           Travis
