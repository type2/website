Hey all,
I'm in Lawrence, KS on business and today I'm seeing a larger than usual =
number of Buses around.  We've got an orange and white late bay in front =
of the Free State brewpub, a grey/primer split across the street in =
front of the candle shop and I just saw a blue early bay Westy come out =
of the parking lot behind the Eldridge hotel.  Some sort of Bus event I =
didn't know about?  Anyone on the list?=20

This seems an unusual concentration of Buses for a one-block area :-)
