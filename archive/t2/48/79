Subject: NEW Folding Cup Holders $8.95

I now have a new inexpensive line of folding cup holders. These are direct
replacements for the original-equipment cup holders on the Vanagon Multivan
camper, but can also be screwed into any vertical surface on a bus.

These are similar to, but nicer than, other folding cup holders I've seen.
The part that grips the cup is expandable, allowing it to hold up to a 46
ounce cup. They are available in a choice of colors (black, gray, or brown).
They have a very small "footprint" when folded up.  And they're not as
flimsy as the more common aftermarket ones (which are Taiwanese). They're
are original-equipment Ford, believe it or not (although not labeled as
such); it turns out that the Vanagon Multivan cupholder and one used in a
particular Windstar van interchange.  You can see a picture/description at
http://www.busdepot.com/images/cupholder.jpg .

$8.95 each.  Part number CH100B (black), CH100G (gray), or CH100M (mocha).
