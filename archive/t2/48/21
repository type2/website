Subject: 72 Bus owners

I hope this is ok with the list rules for Friday!

I was wondering how many one year, first year and last year parts where
found on our 72 busses?

Rob would you post a list on your www.72camper.com sight?

So to start off I'm going to list a few 1 Year only parts that I know of.

One Year Only:
Rear Shift Rod Extension
Turn Signal High Beam Switch?


What else can you think of?

Meredith
