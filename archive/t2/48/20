Subject: engine cutting out when I put in reverse its fixed!!!

Hey guys,
        You are going to laugh when you hear what I did. I went in windows 
paint program on my computer and made up this long drawn out diagram to see 
if you guys could help me figure out the right wires to change and what not. 
So anyway I diagram out the postive side of the coil and then I go outside 
to sketch the negative so i can draw it on the computer. Anyway as I am out 
there and I switch one of the wires from negative to positive like you all 
said and it worked, no stalling now......So I did all that work diagraming 
it out and then I fixed it...Go figure...Right? Thanks so much you guys....I 
have one more question though there is a wire coming from the wire condiut 
that holds on of the wires from the postive side of my coil(i think the wire 
for the ingnitions switch) Anyway this wire goes to a terminal set into the 
engine tin a bit and is right behind the distributer? What is this wire 
Because it starts up with out it being hooked up and runs ok...I am curious 
please let me know what you guys think...Thanks again for the help this 
mailing list is the Best.......

                                     Thanks,
                                         Travis
