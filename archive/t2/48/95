Maybe your confusing Marvel Mysrery oil for ATF.

Marvel is an excellent product to help keep your upper end
lubricated--valve stems and guides, but never heard of what your
proposing ATF might do.

Is it true that it helps the fuel pump to put some ATF into the fuel at
gas up? 
If so, how much? 
I bought Dexron III/ Mercon automatic transmission fluid from Canadian
Tire, Motomaster brand.
