Subject: Bus is out of commission

I recently bought a 1976 bus in which the PO put a '72 type IV. The =
other day it developed a SERIOUS oil leak under the engine. The PO told =
me that the engine had been rebuilt shortly before I bought it. Are =
there some common things that I can check - (I know engines, just not =
aircooled engines)? If in fact I need a rebuild, where is a good place =
to get one? I gather from reading past postings that GEX is not a =
popular choice in informed circles. Thank you for any help.
