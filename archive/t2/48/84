Subject: Anti-Spam Blacklists


Volken,

There has been some kvetching about messages being blocked by the anti-spam
routines we're using. We use those anti-spam routines because we think it's
the right thing to do; we not only want to keep the lists spam-free but we
think it's our responsibility to help try to keep the net free from vermin
(or at least make the life of vermin as difficult as possible).

We've been using blacklists for years, this isn't something new--but we
recently added some new blacklists, and this has produced some (of what is
called by anti-spammers) collateral damage.

To my knowledge three people of ~1500 subscribers have had legitimate
messages blocked by our anti-spam regimen. The listees themselves are not
blacklisted--the mail servers they use are, usually because those mail
servers are misconfigured and can be exploited by spammers.

We're trying to develop a way to "whitelist" these people, as their ISPs
seem to be quite unconcerned with solving their own problems. In the
meantime, if you find yourself collateralized, let me know and I'll be happy
to set you up an email account from which you can post to the list without
fear of being blocked (complete with nifty web-based interface ala Hotmail,
you will not have to change the configuration of your mail program).
