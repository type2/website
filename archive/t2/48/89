Subject: Re: [T2] Buses in Lawrence

Just a miny Buskatiers event at the Free State Brewery.  You are in the area
of many Buskatiers, so watch out, you may get a very large dose of friendly
bus people, we do have a good time with our busses!!  In the area of
Lawrence there are over 40 busses that belong to Buskatiers, you should be
one.
