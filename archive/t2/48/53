Subject: '76 westy FS

Hey folks,

Our world is not entirely salvaged buses. We like to keep good buses out on
the road. A recently new customer has a '76 westy for sale. It needs a good
canvas and a stove unit. The engine was recently rebuilt. The paint is
really nice and it looks to be in good shape. Give him a call if your
interested. He is in the Boulder, CO area. Tell him that Joe at
BUStedBUS.com sent you. We would be happy to help out with a new or used
canvas as well we have a stove unit that he was looking to put in it. Adam
is the owner and his number is 303-667-4301. Please only call him if you are
serious about purchasing his bus. If you have any relevant questions about
this year or model please feel free to contact me.

Thanks,

Joe Mitchell
