Sean, I believe you may have come across a Buskatier or two.  I am not sure
what their schedules were but we have about 5 Buskatiers in the Lawrence
area.  No special events that I am aware of though.

Nice to know someone else was around...

Stay Cool.

Subject: [T2] Buses in Lawrence


Hey all,
I'm in Lawrence, KS on business and today I'm seeing a larger than usual
number of Buses around.  We've got an orange and white late bay in front of
the Free State brewpub, a grey/primer split across the street in front of
the candle shop and I just saw a blue early bay Westy come out of the
parking lot behind the Eldridge hotel.  Some sort of Bus event I didn't know
about?  Anyone on the list?

This seems an unusual concentration of Buses for a one-block area :-)
