Subject: RE: painting an engine

the impact of paint on how well your engine runs is very interesting but 
also higly subjective.. i think if you paint your engine a color you really 
like it will make you feel happier when working on the engine and thus 
encourage better maintenance. the human driver is the nucleus of the vw 
organism, the psychological impact of a such a paint job can help keep the 
nucleus preforming more smoothly. come on you know it is true haahaa
