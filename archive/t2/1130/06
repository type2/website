I realized that might not be clear - the wood should be just long enough 
such that it fits between the top of the engine deck (which is the 
bottom of the hatch opening) and the bottom of the U-hinge with the door 
open.  The exact height might need to be varied to provide the correct 
bend, but you can experiment with that.  You can also run the wood all 
the way to the floor, but the problem is that you'll end up picking up 
the car because the suspension will unload when you pull the door down.
