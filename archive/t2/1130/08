Subject: Re: [T2] Rear deck lid

Be careful with Mike's solution of wedging in a brace. If you press too hard 
on the door, the brace might colapse the metal around the door frame before 
the hinge bends.

I still think your original solution of pulling, as in your photo, is the 
best because it replicates the original bending force in reverse.

Wedge a piece of wood on either side just below the hinge "U" and the
deck of the hatch opening - this will keep the door from closing.  You
might want to put a piece of metal over the end of the wood so the hinge
doesn't split the wood as there will be a lot of downward force.

Now pull down on the end of the lid and it should open up the "U" of the
hinge.  I'm guessing that the door should be a pretty good lever arm and
give you a good amount of leverage such that you should be able to bend
the metal with just your body weight.  You might try doing a  small bend
one side and see if it helps in the right direction.  If so, do a little
more on the other side and move from there.
