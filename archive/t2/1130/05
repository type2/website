Wedge a piece of wood on either side just below the hinge "U" and the 
deck of the hatch opening - this will keep the door from closing.  You 
might want to put a piece of metal over the end of the wood so the hinge 
doesn't split the wood as there will be a lot of downward force.

Now pull down on the end of the lid and it should open up the "U" of the 
hinge.  I'm guessing that the door should be a pretty good lever arm and 
give you a good amount of leverage such that you should be able to bend 
the metal with just your body weight.  You might try doing a  small bend 
one side and see if it helps in the right direction.  If so, do a little 
more on the other side and move from there.
