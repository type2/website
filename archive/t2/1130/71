Bob the best you can affort.  First 220V only.  Second, a 2 stage (look for
pistons of different sizes) if you can afford it.  Ingersol Rand ideal, but
you'd be $1200-1500 for their cheaper "home" grade 2 stage, the chinese stuff
at Lowes or HD if the 2 stager, go $800-1000 depending on sales.  Short of
that, anything.  Do NOT get an oiless "direct drive."  You want a good chunk
of cast iron pump, and a belt, even if the sucker is a $300-500 one.  The best
deals are often found on C-L or local traders.  I have bought 2 commercial
grade 2 stage (first DeVilbiss from the 60's when the name met something) and
the next an old Quincey, for $100 and $200 respectively.  They outpump
anything I could buy short of $1500 today (left the first with dad.)  Both
needed trivial tinkering ($30-40 in pressure switch or other.)  Of the cheaper
things, anything in the $300-500 range from Sears, Lowes, HD will all be the
same Chinese stuff, look for a sale and
 buy the biggest tank and biggest CFM rating you can for what you got to
spend.  Vertical tanks nice if it will sit in 1 place, horizontal and wheels
if you need to move it.

restore the Westy. What is the minimum size I need and what brand is
reliable?
