Subject: Re: [T2] Air compressor

B/c somebody here in Type II is bound to know more than I do - can a 
person upgrade a single stage compressor to a 2-stage by simply 
switching out the compressor portion? Everything I know says yes. I 
wanted a 2-stage but it was out of my budget but at some point in the 
future if this thing I bought somehow doesn't keep up I could -I think- 
upgrade it if the compressor portion died or something. Can't see why it 
would but like John Anderson said - most of the cheaper compressors are 
likely Chinese junk compared to a GOOD commercial grade compressor.

I learned some time ago that the price of everything "good" has gone up 
considerably when I wasn't paying attention but that the entry level 
stuff has stayed cheap b/c of Chinese production. I avoid that stuff 
whenever I can afford to b/c the quality for me has been hit or miss.
