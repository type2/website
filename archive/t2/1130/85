Hi Tim,

I'm an electrical engineer and the simple calculation for power is amps 
times volts for DC. Also, you cannot get more power out of the converter 
than you can put in. In fact you will get less out of the converter because 
of the losses in the converter.

But I think that when we convert we need to convert voltage too,don't we?
It seems to me that the converted power for a 150 watt alternator would be
closer to 17,000 watts, or am I doing too much glue?
