I seem  to remember that JBugs used to sell a fiberglass insert to fill
the odd  shaped air gaps since the profile of the 1600 is smaller and
differently  shaped than the 2000 but I can't seem to find it on their
current website.  I might just fab something up, but it would be nice
to see what vendors are  offering.

Thanks



hello Jules  yes as long as the pressure plate is the late style it  will 
work. classic fab had fiberglass panels for filling in the space.  If  just 
doing this till other motor is ready you can do it the poor boy way of  
screwwing an inner tube around the opening. Some say you need to fab the rear  
motor hanger bar but I have seen it done without anything back there, Again 
poor  boy style I have seen a chain strapped into place from one side to the  
other.   later  mark d
