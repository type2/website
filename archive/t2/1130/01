Subject: Type 1 Engine in a late Bay

Hi,

I have a few working 1600 engines in my garage and I have a 78 bus
that needs an engine rebuild.

I'm considering dropping a 1600 (used to be in a '71 bus) into the
engine bay of the (US)78 while I rebuild the 2.0 engine.

First off, anyone done this lately? Any caveats?

I seem to remember that JBugs used to sell a fiberglass insert to fill
the odd shaped air gaps since the profile of the 1600 is smaller and
differently shaped than the 2000 but I can't seem to find it on their
current website. I might just fab something up, but it would be nice
to see what vendors are offering.

Thanks
