Subject: vapor barriers & insulation

Hi Tim,

I am not an expert on insulating buses, but I do deal with insulation as a
General Contractor/Architect. I have been reading a lot about the different
types so insulation, and have used the open cell type on a few projects(as
well as rigid board, ayr-foil, blow in cellulose, and others).

The rigid foam insulation is just that -rigid. I have been told-no
experience here-just been told by guys that install, that the rigid stuff is
super rigid. Your bus will twist and torque way more than a traditional
building. This could potentially cause it to pop off what it has been
adhered to. Again, I have not witnessed this, just been told about this from
a few sources in the industry. Maybe it is not true, and is merely a myth.

As for a vapor barrier-depending on the thickness of the insulation-here is
some info I just recently read in JLC:
"Whether or not foam insulation requires an additional vapor retarder
depends on the foam being used and its thickness, the climate." Closed cell
foam has a permeance averaging about 1.5 per inch, so as the average
temperature goes down, more foam thickness is needed to keep the temperature
inside the wall   or cavity above the dew-point and minimize the potential
for condensation inside the assembly" 

I think that the amount of foam you can get in to the 'wall cavity' of your
bus will be so minimal, and the potential temperature difference in your
climate, that the temperature delta-will ensure some moisture will need to
land somewhere.
