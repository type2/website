You will be the best judge of your local situation. You need a
mechanic that you can trust to do the job competently.

He will also most likely have a source for brake shoes. This is not a
really critical purchase. Most sources will likely be remanufactured
rather than new. Your mechanic will know if there are junk brands in
the area to avoid.

I don't think Haynes would advise replacing the wheel bearing. Normal
procedure is to inspect them for wear, and if still good, clean and
repack them with fresh grease. High temperature wheel bearing grease
is normally used by any good mechanic. Inspect the axle seals to be
sure they do not need to be replaced.

Inspection of rubber brake hoses is also important and not very
expensive if found to be bad.

Procedure is to remove the wheels and remove the brake drums. This can
be difficult on the rear wheels. Be sure to disconnect the speedometer
cable from the front hub first.

Clean and lubricate all moving parts. Turn adjusting stars to the
loosest position. Change shoes and reassemble. Adjust shoes. Bleed
brakes if you changed the hoses or otherwise broke into the fluid
system. For example, you may have also found the wheel cylinders
needed to be overhauled or replaced.
