Hey Tim,

Looks like a fun project. I love the  idea of a daily driver, and the
radiant floor heating. 
Some suggestions based on your ideas - 
-If you go with the spray foam, you will need to use the open cell(the stuff
that dries soft), as closed cell(the stuff that dries hard) is too brittle.
When the van flexes as it is want to do-it will pull away from the body, and
you will end up with gaps.

-If you go with the spray foam-you will need to put a vapor barrier over the
foam afterwards, otherwise your bus will rust from the inside out. If you
are not sure why this happens-check the list archives, or I can explain in a
follow up email.

-Radiant heat in the floor sounds great-but make sure you insulate under the
heating elements, otherwise you'll lose half your heat to the underside of
the bus.

-The foam should make an excellent sound barrier-for road noise, while
driving.

-looks like you are making quick progress with the body work-congrats on
that, I'm jealous!

Good luck, and keep us updated.
