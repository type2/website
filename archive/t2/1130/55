David, many epoxy primers now days are only "2 parts" if you will the paint,
and the other can, which is actually the activator, not a reducer.  The paint
is pre-reduced in the can, and the volume of the activator is larger.  (They
spray a lot less cause much less solids you are buying per the "gallon.") 
These usually are something like a 4L can of paint, and a 1-1.5L can of other
stuff, but no little can of activator like back in the day.  Some of them say
you can add a good enamel reducer to thin to consistency if you like.  M-S
used to be a fine paint line, probably still is OK, haven't sprayed any of it
20 years, but probably OK for whatever you eventually put on it being epoxy
even if you change lines.  NAPAs generally sell OK paint, not PPG/Dupont but
not shit either.

As far as primer goes, I bought a 1K epoxy primer from Napa. I am leary about
using it. It seems that an epoxy primer should have an activator, but this
kind doesn't. It is callled PCC industrial epoxy Primer made by Martin
Senour.
Has anyone used this primer before? It was only about $57 a gal. I am used to
the old 2 part primers. Back when I worked at a body shop years ago, we never
used epoxy primer, so I hope that I have chosen well by buying it.

I will post pictures later when I am closer to being ready to prime. Let me
know what you think.
