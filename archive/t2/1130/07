Subject: '74 Westy interior question

Hi, I am currently 'rebuilding' the interior in my '74 Westy, new 'factory
look' rear top and bottoms seats, side rear bolsters, and front seats.  I was
wondering if any list members could tell me the problems I would run into if I
'chucked' the entire '74 Westy cabinets, and 'moved up' to the newer style
where everything was along the drivers side wall. Is the bed the same size?  I
would like to get the rear 'overhinge' cabinet, and the refrigerator, and sink
cabinet, thats all.
Cheers
Syd
