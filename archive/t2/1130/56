I met to second that in my other post, as well as for the epoxy primer.  I
would only sand using an N95 rated disposeable mask, the box of 20 or so at
Lowes being the best deal.  And for painting with that epoxy, you make the
call.  At LEAST a good paint rated mask from the NAPA or auto paint store of
your choosing, and of course air supplied respirator always ideal if you got a
buddy with one.  A good mask, with great ventilation, and a good HVLP gun
though and you are probably OK.

Be careful about sanding fiberglass. It is very harmful to the lungs.
