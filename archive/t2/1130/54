Subject: Need 2 Seat Belt Halves

I need a pair of used seat belt buckle halves to use on the front bench seat
of my '78 crew cab.  I'm thinking the fabric ones from a Bus rear or center
bench seat would work. (The metal ones from the front of a walk-through Bus
would not.)  My crew cab currently has the 3-point halves but nothing to
click them into. Does anyone have these lying around?  Please email me and
let me know the price.

Thanks,
