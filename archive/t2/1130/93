Subject: I weighted my 1971 Westy

Fun Fact for Friday 

 

Got a chance to weight my Westy at a scrap yard the other day. I stayed in
the bus and it was right at 3700 lbs. I weight 180.

 

1971 Westy Stock with a pseudo Hurst Bumper on the Front (About 80 lbs)

 

3700 Westy 

-180 me

 -80  Hurst

 

So about 3440 lbs give or take!
