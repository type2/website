Hi Volks,

It must be fall on the type2 list; the 12V heater threads have started 
again!

Now on to helping Tim:

Heating a big steel box in the middle of a Winnipeg Winter is going to 
be difficult. The amount of surplus electricity available from an 
aircooled engine simply will not be capable of warming the bus, 150Amp 
alternator notwithstanding.

You could do quite nicely though with 12V heated seats, vest and gloves. 
They can be found in any snowmobile dealership.

Another practical approach would be a gasoline furnace from espar or a 
propane furnace from propex. Plus a lot of insulation.

Also, if you are planning on running computers and battery chargers you 
would still be better off powering them from 12V. When you upconvert to 
110 there are significant losses as power is lost as heat and to the 
cooling fans that are used to dissipate the heat.


Happy Trails,
