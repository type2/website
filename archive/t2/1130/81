Not to burst the bubble, however a 150 amp alternator is good for only 1800 
watts. I'm sure the battery can assist once you reach maximum levels, but 
for how long?   Why not install 12V tracings instead of losing some of the 
power (10-20%) in the inversion process? Not to mention the danger of 
running 115VAC in a vehicle where its not expected.

Sounds like a great project. The photos are looking good!
