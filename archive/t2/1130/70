Look around - perhaps you could find a cheap tank from a dead compressor???

What about Propane tanks as found behind homes? What are they rated at? 
Of course a small compressor might need to run for an afternoon to pump 
it full... LOL!

Once upon a time I heard about a fellow using a Freon tank as a 
reservoir. Dunno what kinds of pressure those tanks live with when full.

Trip to your local propane supplier with questions?
