Subject: Cam timing question?

I just found the specs for my Eagle Racing cam.  Now it is installed in a 1.8
L with 'solids', bigger valves, twin Dels 34s, headers, electric 'dizzy',and
MSD 6A "box".  The specs are intake opens 35, exhaust closes 29, Exhaust
opens,69, intake closes 63 and 'running clearance for intake is oo4, with
valve lift of 410, and duration of 278 Degrees, and Exhaust running clearance
is oo6.  After doing some 'ciphering', I am wondering if I chose the wrong
cam, and also wondering what I should expect for 'performance', and at what
point of 'power curve'.  Any offers of help in this would be muchly
appreciated.
Cheers
Syd
