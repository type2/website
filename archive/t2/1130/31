Wasn't able to get in deep enough to trace out the wiring, but I did
start it up again and discovered that the severe discharge is only
under idle conditions.

Once I rev it up the alternator brings the needle back to about zero -
no charge or discharge.

So apparently the alternator is sufficient to run the lights while
driving, but not while idling, and not enough to add charge back to
the battery while the lights are on.

Thanks,

John
