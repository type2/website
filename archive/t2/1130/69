	Those with far more experience than I will advise on the 
compressors themselves.  What I can add is that a big air reservoir 
between the compressor and the tools can allow the tool to work a 
satisfactory period before it needs recharging.
	I have a cheap (c.U$150) Italian compressor, which came 
mounted on a small air bottle of its own, claimed to be capable of 
delivering 8 cu. ft./min (which I gravely doubt).  I have mounted 
this on a much larger air tank from which I can run a paint-sprayer 
long enough before it is too depleted and I have to stop using the 
tool to let the big bottle recharge.
	The cheapest tanks I know of that may be suitable are LPG 
tanks.  Can anyone provide expert opinion on whether they are OK?  If 
the compressor gives 200 psi and the if the LPG tank is only rated at 
10 atm (= 10 bar) i.e 150 psi, it may be dangerous   ...   the 
missiles from fragmentation of such a tank could severely injure  ...
	Even if you have to buy a more expensive tank for that role 
of the big buffer between the compressor and the tool, you may still 
end up saving money because you can afford a *new* small compressor.
