Subject: Re: [T2] '74 Westy interior question

Thanks for going to the trouble to pull up those pics Greg.

I had one of those campers, but can't find those pics, so I did a
little poking around to see if I could figure out if mine was an
altered hybrid, or if model variants were offered that year.

Sources are unclear and conflicting though. The Samba brochure section
is thin on Campmobile brochures in that time period, so I looked at
Eccles, which has brief write-ups and small pics which are difficult
to see.

He lists 1974 Camping Mosaik versions as SO 73/7 with a full width
rear seat/bed and SO 78/8 with a 3/4 width, but he doesn't say what a
Camping Mosaik is. He only lists European models as Dusseldorf,
Malaga, and Offenbach, and US models as Campmobile.

He does say that 1974 Campmobiles were "offered in a similar range of
combinations and alternative layouts as described for European
models".

For 1975 he lists the S 76/1 Berlin and SO 76/2 Helsinki, with the
Berlin having the short bench, and the Helsinki having the full bench.
I don't think I have ever seen a Helsinki in the US though.

The Samba only has a complete 1975 brochure for a "Standard VW
Campmobile P-21", which looks similar to the Helsinki, but without the
side bench under the louver window.

The Baukastensatz "Camping" mix and match do-it-yourself kit also
appears in 1975 with a full-width bench only.

For 1976, Eccles states, "This layout (Helsinki) and options remained
during 1976-79, but the versions were now coded as:

P21: standard Campmobile
P22: standard Campmobile with elevating roof
P27: Deluxe Campmobile"

Well, there's the P21. The Samba brochure is clearly labeled 1975 P21 though.

Well, all very interesting and informative.

I'm glad you brought it up!
