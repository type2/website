Subject: Re: [T2] '74 Westy interior question

The '74 has a "full width" bed, in that it spans the entire width of the bus.

The 76-89 setup has a "2/3 width" bed, where the passenger side of the bed is
against the outside of the bus, but the driver's side ends at the
fridge/cooler box.

If you chucked the 74 interior for the later style, and kept your back
seat/bed, you will have room for the spare tire, sink, and stove units.  Since
the sink/stove unit has moved, you probably need to cut a hole in the side of
the bus for "city" water if you want that feature, too.  You will not have
room for the refrigerator/cooler and the corresponding cabinet/fridge motor
which sits between the rear seat and the wall.
