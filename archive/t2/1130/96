Hi, Tim.

One thing to consider is the time it will take to warm the bus up with the
radiant floor heating. Are you going to plug the bus in while it's parked?
Rather than using a heat proof covering, you might be better off using
something that is heat conductive (durock?), skip the plywood and use the
thinnest material that will suffice (i.e. masonite). Any materials used
above the heat tape will delay heat going where you want it.
How about a mini-split heat pump?
