Subject: Re: [T2] Rear deck lid

On further thought, Mike may have a good idea there. I would go for a 2x4 
from the bottom of the U to the floor rather than the bottom of the hatch 
opening. The trick here is to bend both sides evenly and in the correct 
amount. If you overbend, bending back again would be difficult. Once set up 
with the braces to the floor. Use a come- along to pull the door down. Maybe 
attached to the bumper??

I would do a pull and check, pull and check sequence until the hinge arms 
bent. Each time you pull, pull a little further. Carefully measure each 
successive pull with a tape measure in possibly 1/4" increments. Might take 
a couple hours to do this, but you are likely to get it right.

NOTE: The other place that might deform is the attachment point of the U 
arms to the door. I think I'm back to your original set up in the photo. Get 
some chain.

Mike Said:

I realized that might not be clear - the wood should be just long enough
such that it fits between the top of the engine deck (which is the
bottom of the hatch opening) and the bottom of the U-hinge with the door
open.  The exact height might need to be varied to provide the correct
bend, but you can experiment with that.  You can also run the wood all
the way to the floor, but the problem is that you'll end up picking up
the car because the suspension will unload when you pull the door down.
