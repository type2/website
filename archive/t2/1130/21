Subject: Re: rear sway or front sway... 

I am ordering some other repair parts and what not for my bus, and based on
list suggestions (due to sway) I figured I should replace the rear torsion
bar bushings on my '69 as well.

I'm trying to find out exactly how to do it, it looks like a bit of work. Is
there a site with info on this replacement? Is there anything else I should
be preparing to do the same time? Ie what other parts should I have ready to
replace while I am at it.

I have looked at the Bentley-and it looks like a fairly extensive job-but
they include removing shocks & more. Do I need to do all this just to
replace these rear bearings?

Thanks for any tips, hints...or directions...
