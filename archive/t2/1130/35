Subject: Vanfest photos

I've posted lots of photos taken today at a sunny Vanfest here:

The biggest problem was the number of people, I don't think I've ever seen 
the show so crowded.

There was  VW powered generator for sale:

can anyone shed any light on it ? Is it something cobbled together or a 
production item ?

Thanks
