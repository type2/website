The regulator is going to heat up- it's gotta do something with the  
waste energy, so that's normal.  There is some light bleed over in my  
cluster from other instrument panel lights.  Very dim is somethings  
just either bleed over, or even sunlight reflecting.

If you didn't have problems before, it's very unlikely you're going  
to run into anything nefarious with just a battery and cable swap.
