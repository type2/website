You could also put a piece of wood under it to distribute.. that or run 
the wood down the bumper.  At least this way it's much more controlled 
and direct than straps pulling the door away from the bus.  Plus there 
is much more direct leverage being applied to a specific location.

The other problem is that just because the door got pushed, pulling it 
out doesn't necessarily mean it's applying the correct direction to bend 
it back.  It really depends on where the bend is and pulling it out 
might just bend another part.  The door was a lever in one direction 
against a stop (the natural door-open hinge stop).  Now it's a matter of 
creating the same circumstances in the opposite direction.  With the 
wood (or any other strong material), you can adjust the fulcrum about 
which the force is being applied and have more control over what part of 
the hinge is being bent.
