Subject: Re: [T2] Dimly glowing battery light

My experience with both generators and alternators, the damn light just 
glows. If you do a search on type2 and vintage bus you should see quite a 
few posts. The subject periodically comes up and the consensus is to ignore 
the glow, but if the glow goes away, look for a problem.  I can't remember 
seeing any good technical expanations for the glow.
