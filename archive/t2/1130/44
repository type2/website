Subject: Re: [T2] Dimly glowing battery light

To all,

Just to add into this thread.  I have owned 10 buses over the last 15
years, driven hundreds
more and worked on all of them to some extent.  
Under the right conditions, considering the age of these vehicles, there
most likely will be some
"glow" at the battery light.  Could be bleed from illumination/turn
signal lights at times, also I get
a faint light under heavy charging conditions  (night, stereo/changer,
wipers and my phone charging).

If your battery is not going dead, lights are bright enough to drive at
night, charging at the battery post 
is at least 12V with ALL accessories turned on at a high idle (1500).....
then don't worry so much.
