	I believe VW did sell such a rig in the early 1960s.  The 
motors for them were more or less exactly the same as the vehicle 
motors.  A Kiwi academic who shall remain nameless imported one such 
motor under the Customs category 'industrial', avoiding a large tax 
which was in those days levied on vehicle motors.
	Today, static motors for generators have come some distance; 
little Chinese diesels look a better bet for such static power 
sources.  Another impressive possibility is the sturdy, light Honda 
160cc SOHC petrol motor.
	I can't tell whether that's an alternator driven off the 
extra pulley, but if it's a generator (i.e with brushes) it requires 
more maintenance than an alternator.
	I'd explore purchase of this rig just for the engine.  The 
custom chrome exhaust system would be a bonus 8-)
