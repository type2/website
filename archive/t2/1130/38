Subject: Dimly glowing battery light

78' Westy stock 2.0 FI motor. Just replaced my battery cables and battery as part of preventive maintenance. Historically  the battery light at the dash would glow faintly when using turn signals at night. The light glows very brightly at first key position, then dims down to nearly out entirely once engine is started. I'm seeing 14v at the coil which tells me things are charging. Noticed that the regulator gets warm to the touch and the bottom of it feels hot. Ideas???
