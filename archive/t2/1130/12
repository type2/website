Subject: Looking for a few parts... 

Looking for a good rustfree upper front nose panel for a late Bay to repair
typical winshield rust.
Need one cut across just below the grill/turnsignals and a few inches up the
pillars.  I'll trim it to what I need.
Shipping Greyhound would probably be best.  If anyone has a wreck out there
and would be willing to cut what I need, please let me know.
Also looking for a dropleaf table and table leg with knobs, '78 Westfalia.
Thanks,
Greg
