Be careful about sanding fiberglass. It is very harmful to the lungs.

One of the understatements of the year from John.  You are only coughing up
what didn't get deeper into the lung tissue.  If it is like concrete on the
van body, it is like silica dust in your lungs.

ANY sanding needs a respirator, not a dust mask.  A cheapo dust mask only
slows the particles down before they hit your lungs.  Essentially they are
decoration because they don't fit your face well enough to seal properly. 
Something like this http://www.airace.com/  will do a reasonable job. 
However, AirAce are more expensive than respirators in the US, so you might as
well go with 3M organic vapor + particulate respirator.  The fine glass/dust
particles are equally damaging to your eyes.  They need goggles at least. 

This is actually the real deal.  3M is a bit proud of them IMHO.  If I was
going to do a full restoration, I would include one in the cost and get it
before I started.  Also available with welding helmet.  One dose of zinc fumes
would make you wish you had it.

  A quick search on "dust control" will turn up many articles by woodworkers,
and re-finishers, who have developed extreme allergies to wood/paint/varnish
dust, paint fumes, etc. from their hobby/work.  Well worth a cautionary read. 

Ignorance of the dangers of your work environment is not your friend. Basic
PPE (for glass/paint/sanding=appropriate gloves, goggles, tyvek, respirator,
ear plugs) is affordable (<$60), sensible, and comfortable in 2010.
