Michael,

I would go back to the straps as you showed in the photo, possibly you 
should try some chain instead of the straps as chain won't be nearly as 
springy. Make an excellent connection to your garage beam. You don't want 
any of that pulling loose, and hitting your bus or other item like your 
head.
