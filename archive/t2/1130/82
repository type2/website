Not to burst the bubble, however a 150 amp alternator is good for only 1800
watts. I'm sure the battery can assist once you reach maximum levels, but
for how long?   Why not install 12V tracings instead of losing some of the
power (10-20%) in the inversion process? Not to mention the danger of
running 115VAC in a vehicle where its not expected.
Okay,
       so can you explain to me why the 150 amp alternator will only give me
1800 watts ? It seems to me that that works out to 18 amps or so (ac)
I will be running the dual battery set up so i won't be draining the motors
battery.
I would love to install 12V tracings but cannot source any here in Winnipeg.
Do you know any national suppliers?brand names?
I will be running 115VAC in the van regardless for computers,battery chargers
etc. so that will just be the new reality.
Cheers
Tim
