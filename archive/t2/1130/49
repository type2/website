Great pictures!!! Thank you!!!

Anybody know what kind of wheels those were on the "Mystery Machine"???

And why do the recent Scooby movies use a GM van instead of a VW van or 
at least a Corvair Greenbrier??? That's bugged me badly each time my 
kids what the movies.

Any good UK Type II forums? Just curious what the UK enthusiasts talk 
about. Rust? Gasoline at $6.10 per gallon?
