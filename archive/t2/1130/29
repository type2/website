well... I could say a lot by guessing..... but.....  we [*I*] need to know
how that ammeter is wired in .

I really can't imagine a proper wiring as that would mean the wires at the
starter would have to be disconnected and run ALL the way to the dash,, thru
the ammeter,, and back... not including the actual starter lead.

BUT , if someone wired the ammeter into the main lead already going to the
dash,,, then the ammeter only reads the power thru that circuit... and DOES
NOT give any indication of the amount of current going from the alt to the
battery.

if I am wrong,, and the ammeter is actually wired in the alt to battery lead
... then it is showing battery charge current.. and I might guess the
regulator, or the field brushes need attention...  my guess would be the
field brush.

can you determine where the ammeter is wired in the circuit.  ??
