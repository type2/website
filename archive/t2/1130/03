I checked the roof and found no bending on the roof.
I have checked my other bus (and 1976) and my 71's hinges seem to be a little
bit different.
I took it to a body shop today and they said they couldn't do anything.

To be perfectly honest... The paint on the hinges wasn't cracked or indicated
any bending.  All I can figure is that the U shape of the hinge itself was
minutely bent inward.  Any other suggestions?
