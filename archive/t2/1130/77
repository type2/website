Hi all, I have a Type 2 Cargo van that I am in the process of
rebuilding/refurbishing and thought you guys would enjoy the photos of the
progress so far.
As well as the body work I am installing a new wiring harness from Watson's
Streetworks as well as an Alternator putting out 150 amps.
I plan on using a 3000 watt power inverter and installing radiant floor wiring
in the cargo compartment.
I'm also toying with the idea of having spray foam put on the walls and roof.
We will see.
I live in Winnipeg ,Canada so cold is definitely a concern.
The van will be a daily driver/work vehicle and at this point I will probably
need  to drive it at least sometimes in the winter.
Cheers,here's the link for photos,
