I'm with Mark here, if you truely don't expect to do this for long (and I
wouldn't) go full on poor man, you got nothing to lose if you got the 1600. 
It will hang there fine without a rear bearer bar off the tranny alone, the
tranny is well supported with the rear bearer in a late bay.  And the inner
tube solution is perfect, in reality to just move it about the yard, or town,
and with full knowledge you will kill it fast, and risk seizing it overheated,
you could just hang it in there and forget it.  Many a late bus has moved
around this way.  Particularly heading into winter you will get some time out
of it.  But the inner tube is a simple temp solution as well that I might even
chance some limited low speed interstate use with.  Paying for anything
fiberglass tin wise is just money better spent on your rebuild.

other.   later  mark d
