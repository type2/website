Subject: Brake pads replacement on T2 68 ?

Hello will be the r

I live in a country where there are not that many T2 and Beetle's so I
need advice on how to decide on who auto repair shop to replace the
brake pads for pur 1979 Bus - it has drums on both front and rear,
whit the wide positioned bolts. From Haynes I understand that the
whole bearing should be replaced, which makes me suspicious on who wil
do the job.
I have no time and no place to do this kind of job.
Please help with any suggestions :
Whats teh best source for brake pads?
What are the critical steps in such (minor) repair?
What about grease ? type ?

Thank you in advance !
