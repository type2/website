Subject: Re: [T2] Dimly glowing battery light

I don't have an amp meter and was using a voltmeter to confirm that the alt was at least charging. Think I need to read my bentley some and figure out what could be causing the light to faintly glow and pulse the way it does. I think the regulator is okay because once the field current gets excited the light goes from very bright to faintly on, if I hit the turn signals it pulses slighty brighter with them but not so bright as when at first ket position.

Sorry, but would not a 'Battery' Volt meter be better than an 
'ammeter'..because, a Battery voltmeter, measures voltage at your "source' 
battery, and an ammeter is always 'live' and therefore another source of 
.."hot current", and if 'it', decides to "play", you do not have 12 Volts, 
you have whatever the Alternator "gives' to the rest of the wiring circuit! 
I appologize for this incumberance on the subject..because..after 'ions' 
and 'photons', ..I am in the "dark".
Cheers
