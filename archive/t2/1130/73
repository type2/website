	LPG is a mixture of propane and the (relatively) less volatile butane.

	I think the small compressors driven by single-phase mains 
can typically deliver c.4 cu ft/min, which is not good enough for 
paint spraying (unless some new gun has been created which I'd like 
to learn of).   If one of those babies continuously charges your big 
tank, from which you take 8 cu. ft/min, you can do that taking nearly 
half the time.

	Not nearly as strong as LPG tanks; do NOT use for compressed 
air in the normal sense (5 - 15 bar).

	They are often surprisingly ignorant about the dangerous 
goods they sell.
	Better to catch an inspector, or phone the regulatory agency 
which certifies the test procedures for the tanks.
