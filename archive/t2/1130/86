> 1800 watts ? It seems to me that that works out to 18 amps or so (ac)
150amps at 12 volts = 15amps at 120v
15amps x 120 volts = 1800 watts
So you have your 1800 watts at 120volts,but wait,surely your engine uses some
power to run say 25 amps at 12 volts(just guessing)so now your down to 12.5
amps at 120 volts coming out of your inverter,oh wait,your inverter is going
to loose about 10 percent of its output to heat and other mysterious
electrical forces so now your down to about 11.25 amps at 120v   so 11.25A (-at-)
120 v=1350 watts. So technically this maybe possible,but you can talk to
someone who knows more about alternators but
I dont think they were designed to run at a 100% duty cycle and will probably
burn out rapidly.Just my opinion and I have been wrong before.
