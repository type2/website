JC Whitney has long had various headlight alarms... Under $20 I think. All you are doing is looking for a wire that is hot when the headlights is on, another that goes to ground (or dead) when th key is off, and a ground. I think using a relay, you could close a normally open relay to power up the buzzer. I've given it 2 minutes of thought, surely somebody could do something more detailed in 20 minutes of thought. Cost? CHEAP. Relays are $2 new, beepers or buzzers about the same. Cheaper if done in the junkyard.
