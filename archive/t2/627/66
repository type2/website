Subject: Breaking up around 35-45 mph

 1977 Fuel Injectioned 2.0L Idles Ok, But it breaks up on high RPM
OK this is what I have done:

Verified the valves are set at .006 on a stone cold engine
Points are set at 50 dwell
Idle is 1200 (Automatic) 800 in drive
Timing is set at 7.5
Did a compression check and got 120 on #1 and 110 on 2,3 & 4

Changed spark plugs, Old ones seemed to have normal wear Grey / Black
Tested Vaccum on Dist - Worked Good (Held Vaccum fine)
Looked for any Vaccum leaks on the Fuel Injection system - none found

But at High RPM's sounds like it is either sucking AIR or Starving for
AIR???

Tighted a few hoses and changed a couple -- no change.
Re-sealed the Throttle Gasket -- no change
Changed the condensor in the Dist -- no change
Changed out teh Brain (had a spare) -- no change
Changed out the Volt Reg (with a spare) -- no change
Air Filter was replaced 2 weeks ago --

OK where do I go from here. It idles fine, but when I accelerate the engine
breaks up.

Exhaust leak ?

NOTE: My brakes have been spongy, not like they use to be, I found a broken
boot on the servo, but it has been like this for over 2 months. This loss of
power just happened, after we got GAS in Gafney, SC. Yeah Yeah I though of
bad GAS but I took about a gallon out and No water is visable. Filled up
with High test and dumped in dry gas just in case

Any suggestions are welcome, the Bently has a section on a loss of power
leading to the auto transmission: They call it Poor Acceleration, Top speed
low despite good engine output: says to check
1. Correct ATF level -- good
2. Torque converter one way clutch ???
3  Forward clutch defective ????
4. Direct and reverse clutch defective ????
5. 2nd gear breke band or servo defective ????

I just dont know if I have eliminated everything in the engine... to start
messing with the Auto trans.
Thanks.
