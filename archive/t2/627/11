Subject: RE: [T2] bad fuel filter reactions

When you pull the old filter off inspect closely for little red things. 
Rust. That's rust in the gas tank. I like the train of thought of changing 
the filter every oil change/tune up. They are really cheap and I think it 
prevents junk from  getting in your carb.

Take it for a test drive and let us know if it's running better with the new 
filter.
