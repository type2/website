Subject: Re: [T2] locking gas caps

Al,

I don't know about locking caps, but I have a lock on my filler door, simple
thing, looks natural to be there, and does the trick!  hippie previous
owners must have had a bad experience. . .

I will send you a photo when I get it put back together, it's being painted
right now. . .

Will
