Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Fibreglass insulation

It is the air trapped between the fiberglass strands that provides the
insulation, not the fiberglass itself. That is why you do not want to pack it
in there. Just put enough to fill the area that is being insulated. Not sure
if the air pillows will provide as much insulation factor as fiberglass since
I think I remember something about needing lots of little tiny air pockets for
better insulation. Although I could be wrong.

I used the Q pads, dynomat, etc in my bus with undercoating and rubber roof
stuff sprayed over that for rust prevention. Por 15 on all seams. Then I put
fiberglass insulation in all the panels and even added the vapor barrier. This
was before I heard about negative things happening when the vapor barrier is
added. To late not, I am not removing my interior. Maybe in a few years I will
remove it and see what kind of damage was done. I am hoping that the
undercoating and rubber roof stuff will prevent any damage. If not, then I
will have a new project :)

I've actually been researching the use of "Plastic air pillows" used in
shipping and packaging as it's my understanding that the air provides
the insulation and not the material.
