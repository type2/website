Subject: Re: [T2] heat exchanger exhaust fumes

Hiya Al,

I can't speak to the Streetmax HEs.  I'm pretty much a stock kinda guy.  
However if you have good German HEs, by all means, use them!  The original HEs are 
hard to find in good shape.  The aftermarket stuff ranges from mediocre to 
downright lousy.

You might want to take a good hard look at the coupling point for the HE and 
the muffler.  This is a common point for noxious gases to enter the heating 
airstream.  Check to see if the ends of the heat exchanger (where the J-pipe 
emerges) has been discolored by soot.  A sure sign of an exhaust leak which is 
likely contaminating your air.
