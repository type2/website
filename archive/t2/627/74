John,

Take a closer look at the distributor cap, rotor and test the resistance 
on the spark plug wires.

Also, didja see mine and another post last week about the sparkplug 
connectors breaking internally.....sounds like what happened when one of 
my spark plug connectors broke internally.  Idle great, but lack of high 
speed power.

Only other thing I can think of is a bad AFM track at the top end or fuel 
restriction for whatever reason....test fuel presure?

Does it "miss/breakup" when reving it up in the driveway?

Cheers, dave
