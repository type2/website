Subject: Re: [T2] solar panel charging aux battery?

Just look at the output. 20 watts or so? You can convert that to amps and see the charge rate in the those terms and compare that to the amount of time it would take for your plug in charger to work at the same rate. Less than 1 amp? It takes a long time to charge a full size battery at 1 amp. I had one for my motorcycle and it took a while even on that small battery. 

Voltage = watts / amps is the formula. 

Seems like there is a formula that describes how long to charge a battery at a certain rate. It's been too long. Sad since I used to be a Navy Electrician and did battery maintenance. 

FWIW remember that the solar charge is only max rate in max sunlight... 

Big enough solar panel and you might be in good shape. 

www.homepower.com is a great place to read about all this too. Free issues of the magazine for download.
