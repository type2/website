Subject: what type of hose for crankcase breather

Hi, the braided hose going from the big s shaped hose off the air intake to 
the crankcase breather broke yesterday when I tried to put a clamp on it. I 
know that it is 21 mm, but what type of hose do I need.  FLAPS wanted to 
sell me all sorts of stuff, radiator hose, fuel hose... What should I get?  
I put silicone around the split and electrical taped it to make it there.
After I replace and clamp it as well as the other vacuum hoses what will I 
have to adjust?
Thanks,
Kyle
