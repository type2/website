Hi Don,

You were using a hand drill, right?

Wrong tool for the job. Get yourself a $50 angle-grinder, or borrow or 
rent one. The extra power and RPMs make a HUGE difference.... That much 
floor should take 15 minutes, tops. 11000 RPMS makes things happen a 
lot quicker.

An angle grinder can also be used for sanding and cutting. I bought 
mine for the "Westification" project, and have found it to be extremely 
handy in autobody and metalworking projects. A worthy investment in my 
case.

If you're working inside the bus with an angle grinder be sure to wear 
ear plugs.

Happy trails,
