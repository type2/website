If I remember correctly, your 79 bus is a Calif version; correct?

If yes, then no..... two different AFM's.  
The 78 should be part # 0 280 200 020 [or old # 0 280 200 018]
The 79 Cal version uses 0 280 200 022
There is no compatible sub for the 022 AFM.
But I do not know what the difference is between them. I believe there is, otherwise Bosch
would not of made it and VW would not have required it.
