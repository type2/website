Subject: Westy cabinet part needed

Hello, I have a 78 Westy, I am trying to find the
spare tire cover that hooks to the sink cabinet behind
the drivers seat. Back when the spare tire was
originally stored in the cabinet. If anyone has a
decent one they would like to get rid of, let me know.
I am located in Pocatello, Idaho, but I am willing to
pay shipping.
Thanks,
Shawn R.
