It takes friggin FOREVER to wire wheel the rust!!! In 3 hours I had
only done a 2x2 foot section. Wow.

Anyway, I used a wirewheel, rolled Prep & Prime on it (phosphoric
acid), let it set 2 days, then wiped it off to remove any dust and
such and hit it with white Rustoleum primer. Rustoleum sucks, but this
is an interior piece so I'm not too worried.

As you can see, there are many holes for the propane tank and sink
drain and such. I'm not decided on how to deal with those yet. I
treated and painted the undersides of those holes as well as a
precaution. I was thinking about getting some sheet aluminum and using
body adhesive to attach it. The aluminum will conform to the shape of
the floor nicely, and the adhesive will keep me from having to drill
new holes for rivets or whatever.

I'm not worried about the appearance since it'll all be under carpet anyway.
