Yep you are correct on both accounts. That is what it is called. I am a 
Civil Engineer but work as a Construction Project Manager for a site 
developement company. I hate my boss has a dream of paving the planet "Make 
'er Black", he says. I myself will turn down a McDonald's or Clear Cut 
Subdivision bid everytime they hit my desk just because of what they do to 
the environment. He is coming around to the whole "Green" attitude of 
building. I have him interested in a Pinetar Emulsion Pavement Mix that goes 
down basically the same as asphalt, but lasts longer and is more eco 
friendly than a paper napkin, well when you look at the product and not the 
placement. You still have to place it with diesel powered equipment. But I 
am trying to talk him into converting one of the older pieces of equipment 
to Veggie Fuel. "People could pay you to take fuel, your equipment runs for 
free and get a tax credit.

himself". MTK
