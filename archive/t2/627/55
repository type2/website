Subject: RE: [T2] bad fuel filter (LONG)more problems

well daniel looks like i have bigger problems than just a fuel filter..
 
i have been concerned so after finding a bad leak(oil) that just got worse all of a sudden and after the slight bucking that i experienced last week i have been doing a little checkup on everything might as well winter coming around the corner...and she is telling me somethings wrong....?
 
{{{{not all in this order though..}}}}
checked all connections to wires(solenoid,spark plugs,etc..etc..)
i adjusted the valves... 
adjusted the carbs and got them in synch
checked dwell
checked all hoses added new ones to the old ones....
checked timing and well it was off so tried to set timing and the dizzy is loose a bit... try to tighten it and it wont tighten down all the way but gets snug... with effort the dizzy can still be moved...not forcefully but just effort..
 
set that and got it best i could and hoped the dizzy didnt slip anymore from not being  as tight as it should be...
 
took for a test drive and bus drove best it had ever driven since new duals were put on.....
 
then parked in the carport and shut off engine walked around back and found oil dripping from the belly of the armor of the fan houseing and around fan houseing area tin...
 
changed the dipstick boot and found it to be as aggrivating as they always are... it was dry rotted a bit if i squeezed it i could see the cracks throughout it.... after 7000 miles from rebuild how long do those little pissers last anyways.(grins)...?
 
after looking around have came to the conclusion that it has to be the rear main seal leaking...had someone email me the same thing right after i had been thinking this from my findings...of oil and the way it has splashed right and leakign out and such...
i had did a real good cleanup of oil and the engine before test driving so that when i parked i could trace the oil down good... and the engine is usually very clean... clean enough that i usually use the vaccum cleaner to get the dirt and such out LOL.(from insdie the engine compartment..... well you know its my baby,.... been alot of time spent there and labor of love on that engine hehehehe~!~
 
also had a loss of oil on the dipstick level.. great deal bought 1/4 to half qaurt maybe...?
 
havent added oil back yet so guesstamation....from previous fill/touch ups...
 
for quiet sometime now i have found oil laying in the rim of the fan and in the bottom of the fan houseing tin and small drip/s under the bus..?
 
looking to replace this (rear main seal) now.... gotta be what it is or telling myself thats it...?
now how to pull the fan without to much trouble and without having a puller..?
 
i know i can use the three bolt holes from the fan screen (protector).. but what about grabbing ahold so when i tighten down it pulls evenly on the fan it'self./.?>?
 
 
 
thanks alot 
peace and love
chris

When you pull the old filter off inspect closely for little red things. 
Rust. That's rust in the gas tank. I like the train of thought of changing 
the filter every oil change/tune up. They are really cheap and I think it 
prevents junk from getting in your carb.

Take it for a test drive and let us know if it's running better with the new 
filter.
