Subject: Just found out something really cool about my bus...

Full sheets of plywood fit nicely through the rear hatch. 

=D

I went to Home Despot to get the carpet and plywood for the floor
today on the way home from work. I also grabbed some pressboard to
make a new driver's side door panel.

It didn't occur to me until I was pushing the wobbly cart out to the
bus that the stuff might fit through the rear hatch. Did, with 1/2" to
spare on either side. heh

I'll miss that feature when I put the new cabinets in. Sigh.
