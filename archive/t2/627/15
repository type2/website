Subject: solar panel charging aux battery?

Listees,

I want to run an aux battery and I run a generator and don't want to do the 
alternator upgade. (The gen works great and I have a backup gen as well). So 
I'm thinking about using a charger to change my aux battery from shore power 
and I'm also thinking one of those nifty solar panel charger things would 
work well to also charge the aux battery.

Has anyone used one of these? Do they substanially charge the battery at 
all? I just LOVE thought of harnessing the suns power to power a 
boombox/light in my bus.

Thanks,
Daniel
