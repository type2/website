Well, my fiche doesn't even list the drag link boot as a separate part,
so I took a quick look at a tie rod and a drag link off the shelf, and
the boots do look the same to me. 

Incidentally, we sell these as well, both individually (# 113415835) and
in sets of four (# 113415835/4). But we don't get all that much call for
them, because for not much more money you can replace the whole thing,
boots and all  New boots are $5.95 each or 4 for $19.95; a new tie rod
end with a boot is $8.95; and a whole new tie rod with two ends and
boots is $24.95.
