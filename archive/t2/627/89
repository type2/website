Subject: thoughts on converting FI to carb

I'd like to hear from some of you who have switched from fi to carbs or at 
least are experienced with both.  I know fi is supposed to be more fuel 
efficient and better on emmissions, but it only seems to be that way when it 
is tuned perfectly and this seems to be pretty difficult to achieve w/o a 
lot of expensive equipment.  My understanding is that carbs are easier to 
work on, but less efficient.  Is the conversion difficult?  Will there be a 
lot of parts I would need to get?  Would there be a noticable difference in 
performance?  What carbs are compatable with my engine? what are the 
benifits/drawbacks to duel carbs vs single carb.

Thanks a lot everybody,
Kyle
