Subject: Re: [T2] 74 Westy Stool and veggie bus update

FWIW the 76 brochure calls it "an upholstered storage box, that can be used 
as an extra seat when dining" and the 77 brochure calls it an "upholstered 
storage container". These are obviously the later Westies and the 74 
brochure doesn't elaborate. However my thoughts are that if it were a trash 
can why would you need to be in an upholstered cabinet? And if it were just 
a storage container why would you need a plastic bucket inside of it?

I am not sure what Westfalia really intended, but I imagine the salesguys 
probably said something to the effect that it could be used as a toilet in a 
pinch.

Call it what you want, use it as you like.

Glad Petunia made it home ok!
