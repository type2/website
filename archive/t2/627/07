Subject: re locking gas cap for 1970

< I have yet to see one, did they exist of VW manufacture, or some level of
vintage quality.
Modern plastic Chinese models need not apply. Thank you,

I have looked and looked. No such animal exists nor will you find one.
However, there was a locking gas cap for the Thing that does fit. You
sometimes see them at auction for like $50, used.
Another idea is to install a cam lock on the gas flap, it'll at least lock
it. Not too vintage though.
