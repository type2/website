Subject: BN4 fuel line routing question

Hey all,

On a 1927 Westy, which would be the preferred method of routing the fuel line 
to the BN4:

split off just after the fuel tank outlet and run it over the tranny and 
through the little hole in the lower left front (FIF) corner, just to the 
left of the fire wall;

or run the line through the engine tin and then split off and run it around 
the front of the engine?

Unless I'm not seeing some important factor, it seems safer to run the fuel 
line above the engine tin where it's cooler rather than below and risk the 
line contacting the heat exchanger?
