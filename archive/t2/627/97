Wrong ... The driving factor were North American emission requirements. In
other markets (including Germany) air cooled buses and vanagons never
received FI. Dual carbs until 1982. I am not sure about the water-leakers
though.

Made things a lot simpler - there is only one 72-83 muffler and only two
different heater boxes: square port or oval port for the rest of the world.
That is for the type 4 engine; 1600 engines with single carbs were available
through 82 as well.

Still, I agree: keep FI. I have messed with both and based on my experince
go with a 79 FI system, get a Vanagon electronic ignition (if you do not
have the CA setup, a water-leaker ignition will work fine), and install a
72-74 exhaust system.

FI is superior, thats why the VW engineers went that way, and NEVER looked
back......
