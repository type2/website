Subject: Re: [T2] Breaking up around 35-45 mph

OK where do I go from here. It idles fine, but when I accelerate the engine
breaks up.


This is exactly what my old '77 did all the way to Everybus one year. It was
fine until it got to the high end of each gear, then it would buck and jerk
like it was starved for fuel-everyone thought it was an FI problem, but it
ended up being the ignition coil-check it!   Jeff
