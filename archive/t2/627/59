Subject: Re: [T2] Flex plate

This is an older topic, but I wanted to let anyone who is interested know 
that YES the air cooled Vanagon flex plate is the same as the late Bay flex 
plate.

I have been offered the chance to "borrow" some flex plates from other years 
to do a side by side comparison with pictures for automatic owners in the 
future. Right now my priority is getting my flex plate on and the bus 
running again but I will post this page soon.

I am still in need of the original 3 bolts that hold the flex plate to the 
torque converter.

vanagon.
