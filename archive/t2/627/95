You shouldn't need a puller for the fan.

I might be coming in on this too late I have been busy with a lot of stuff 
and not checking the emails. I am sure that someone will have already given 
this to you, but here goes.

The fan is the easy part to get off. Three bolts and wiggle. The hub has to 
be pulled. I use big washers or flat metal pieces, etc. whatever you can get 
behind the three threaded holes. Reinsert the bolts you removed. No go round 
and around tightening the bolts a little at a time until the hub comes off. 
Pull the seal out remove the o-ring.

Check the end of the crank to see it it is marred gouged or anything that 
could screw up your new seal just as you should check your front main seal.

Reinstall all in reverse, don't forget that O-ring. If you can't find one go 
to the FLAPS and get a 1 3/8" OD with 1 1/8" ID oring.

Good Luck,
