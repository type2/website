Subject: '80 Vanagon for cheap

This is a pretty sweet deal for anyone else that's got a vanagon.  It's 
an 80, not a westy, but it's a poptop (I forget the conversion name). 
It's got a busted engine, but everything else is good.  I don't know how 
bad the engine is, apparently it's making some clanking noise (broken 
rod maybe?).

My dad doesn't want to deal with it anymore so he's offering it up to 
the list.  How's $500 sound for a complete bus?  I took out the dizzy 
and injectors, but everything else is there.  He even just put in a 
brand new alternator in the bus.

If you're interested, pmail me.  He lives in Belmont, CA (near redwood 
city).

thanks,
Mike
