Subject: Re: [T2] Battery won't hold a charge

Hi all,

I pulled the battery and went to sears and bought a battery charger it 
is a die hard 15/2 amp battery charger.
The battery is an UltraEnergy 85. It's made by Exide and sold through 
Strauss's (must be up east where I purchased the bus, I've never been 
to a Strauss's before) anyway...I hooked it up to the charger and it 
goes through its test and after about 5 minutes of charging the charger 
starts to blink, the manual for the charger tells me "The battery could 
not be charged in a normal manner. This could be due to a battery with 
a partially shorted or open cell, sulfated battery plates or 
electrolyte out of ballance." Does this mean the batteries fried? If so 
what could have done it, the battery is less than a month old from the 
PO. I've already checked about the warranty and because its a used car 
the warranty isn't transferrable. I don't mind getting a new battery I 
just don't want to fry the next one if something else is wrong. Also 
what size / brands are recommended?

Thanks,

Blake
