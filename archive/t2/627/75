Yes and no......
For a USA 72 to 79 with a typeIV engine, left and right have different part numbers:
Left = 211 255 387
Right = 211 255 388

For 68 to 71 with a typeI engine, left and right are the same:
211 255 387  [same as the left on 72-79]

PS, you may want to fix your sig...... whenever you abbreviate a number, the ' takes the place of what you
removed. 1976 becomes '76. When you put the ' after a number, it means feet. Do you have two 76 feet long
T2's??
