Yeah, but you don't have to own the equipment and when it's in tune it stays in tune longer. Even Bentley suggests using a CO meter to be used to set the dual carbs properly.

I prefer to drive FI buses. Every carb bus has been a bus experience but lacking by comparison.

Tell that to all the 72 owners with no engine hatch. :-)

No.

Manifolds, throttle linkage etc.

Yep. On a stock engine nothing beats FI (stock or aftermarket).
