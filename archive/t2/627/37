Subject: re tie rod end and drag link puller tool

I am thinking about buying a puller for this. CIP wants $44.95 US for the
Bugpack tool. It is more in Canada. Someone mentioned the Hazet tool.
Any advice about where to find a quality tool for this job and prices? It kind
of has to be the specialized tool made for this application. 2 or 3 jaw
pullers won't cut it.
