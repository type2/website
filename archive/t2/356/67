Subject: right colour seat covers?

Dear List,
I have an orange 1973 Westy with the yellow cloth interior.
The front door panels are a tan colour.
I'm re-doing the seat covers and door panels and am confused by the
correct colour.
Is the "tan" or "beige" the correct one to order from Bus Depot?
Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks,
Tom Adams
