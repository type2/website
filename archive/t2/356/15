Subject: show and shine so fla

went early, whirlwind the swaps, left early, didnt hook up with anyone.
Not many busses mostly all the same local busses. Maybe more cars overall.
nothing real noteable that struck me.
Had good fortune at the swaps.
got a couple hubcaps (I always seem to lose one every few months or so)
old hubcaps are nice and heavy.
got a 205T dizzy 5 bucks :)
found an oilbath and a cargo door handle for the 64.
basically everything 5 bucks. I gave 10 for the aircleaner though.
Im not much for haggling usually  I ask how much and if its too rich I
just pass.
