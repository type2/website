Well. GEX has an awful track record. Lots of short cuts and marginal
parts. Hopefully it will last you some time. If you have the ability you
might want to tear down the engine and do some pre-emptive work just in
case there is something fatal lurking.
The paint thing could be good or bad. New paint is nice but it can be used
to cover some horrors in the body.

the rear passenger side should not/would not have had a vent because it
gets in the way of the sliding door.
Personally starting from scratch Id replace both rear windows with solid
one piece ones and probably put sliding windows on the middle 2.

For used parts bustedbus.com is a good start. local junkyards if you can
find a bus in one.

Im not sure what chrome youre talking about. deluxe trim maybe? its
aluminum. the outer window scrapers come with the trim.(also aluminum)
The door locks can be rekeyed unless the chrome is real bad then you could
replace some again bustedbus, junkyards, vwswaps at shows etc...
I have no idea what a commando door is.

Yes they are cheap but you originals are heavier and made better than
repros and you can get them at swaps for cheap. either really is fine.

r 1/2 1/1   is the gas gauge
I think you should start by going through all of the wiring.
you can find a diagram at www.vintagebus.com
