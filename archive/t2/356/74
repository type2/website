Subject: More Questions...

Hey guys,

	Sorry for all the questions... but I'm going to have a lot in the
next couple of months...

1) What type of motor oil do I use for my 1.8 motor? IE: 5W-30? 5W-40? or is
it even 50 weight?
2) Is the Bosch distributor original equipment?
3) The car came with a standard 2-bbl carburetor (I believe), but we also
got with the car, a dual carburetor set-up.. they're Webber carbs. It also
came with a stack of books, etc. Obviously, I'm not planning on entering
this bus in the 24 huers de Le Mans any time soon... but I was curious how
much horsepower if any that would provide over the standard 2bbl carb it has
now?
4) Do you guys know of anywhere that actually SELLS used glass? After
looking at the price of refurbished side vents.. I'm wondering if I wouldn't
just be better off purchasing whole windows for the rear and buying new
gaskets. Of the places I looked.. they don't sell actual glass.


Last question... why do some of my windows have the Audi OOOO symbol on them
and others do not? 


Thanks!
