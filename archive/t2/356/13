No pics, but the rails on the passenger side are the same as the rails on
the driver side.  As a matter of fact, the driver's seat was not a VW, and
was bolted down with aluminum brackets.  It was in such bad shape that I
ditched it and removed the "after market" brackets (nice places to leave
holes...), then moved the passenger seat to the driver's side.

Granted, the passenger seat is mostly shot, but it "sits" okay and slid
right onto the rails, and I can now safely drive the bus.

I picked up a set of captain's seats from a neighbor who was upgrading his
RV, and was excited about having such nice seats for the bus until I
realized that they won't fit.  These were designed to mount on a swivel
bracket of some sort, and are too high when set on the seat pedestals in the
bus.

We've got one temporarily set up on the passenger side just for looks, and
the other turned to face the back and placed up against the passenger side
seat pedestal to give my son some place to sit where he won't torpedo
through the windshield in an emergency stop.  (The seat on the passenger
pedestal is seatbelted down and won't fall forward.)

We're trying to find a buyer for the captain's seats to offset the cost of
the seats that we're getting for the front of the bus.
