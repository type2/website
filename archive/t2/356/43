Subject: oil in air intake

Hello all

While I was doing some work on my 78 today I found that the air intake
regulator was full of gummy oil. That mayonaise looking stuff that you find
under the oil cap when a water cooled car is leaking water into the oil. This
gunk had almost plugged the breather totally and had traveled up the hose to
the S shaped housing and I am assuming into the throttle valve housing. I am
thinking that this is most likely caused by worn rings creating blow-by. Would
this be the most common cause? I have also noticed that my oil starts to smell
like gas after awhile. This would also be caused by blow-by correct? This
isn't what I wanted to find today and am just hoping that there may be another
cause for it.  Fuel preassure regulator maybe? That wouldn't explain the oil
in the breather though. Any suggestions would be very much appreciated.

P.S. The engine still has good power and when I did a compression test about 5
months ago I got between 125-140 lbs. 125 being on the #3 cylinder. I guess it
is time for a leak down test huh?

Thanks
Jasan C.
