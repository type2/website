This being my first VW, please have some pity. I'm not sure if I have an
upright engine. It looks pretty flat to me.

The battery drains slowly but if left overnight, forget it in the
morning. I'm not sure where the idle cut-off solenoid is or if it is
connected. There are a lot of misc. wires hanging around.

The red light has a little "c" in the middle of it and it is on the left
side.

Any chance your 72 bus has an upright engine with a generator?

If it did I'd suggest that your generator/regulator is a tad bit
broken...it's attempting to run the generator as a motor, which it's
able
to do just after the engine shuts off since it still has momentum.

If your 72 has a type4 style engine with an alternator you can forget
all
of the above...slim chance of making an alternator do that. :)


Does the battery drain rapidly or slowly?  Have to checked the
idle-cutoff
solinoid on your carb/carbs to be sure that it's working/connected?
This
solinoid cuts off fuel flow from the idle circuit when you turn off the
key.

Is the red light the left or the right light? (left is oil, right is
alt/gen if memory serves) (and I've forgotten if the 72's have red/green
lights or both red..hmm. :)
