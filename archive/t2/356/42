Subject: Re: Wipers and washing Westy interior

I started with washing my curtains but they came out shredded. I guess
30 years of sun have done their share of damage. As soon as I find the
correct bright orange fabric, I'll have to make a new set.

Does anyone have an extra set of good bright orange curtains (individual
curtains would be fine, too) for a 74 Westy with the orange plaid
interior?

I hope that my matress cover which is in the washer right now will hold
up better ...
