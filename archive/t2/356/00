Thanks, Richard.  Looks like the swivel seats won't fit my bay.  I think
that the rails for my original seats are welded to the pedestal.  It looks
like the swivel seats have their rails on the swivel mech, and that the
swivel mech bolts to the pedestal.

I might need to keep looking for another set of seats. :O(
