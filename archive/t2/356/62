take a sawzall and a box of long metal blades, figure out how much you are
going to need of the nose and then cut all the way around the bus about a
foot further back, finish on the roof and have the nose supported so it
doesn't fall, put in truck or trailer and take home, it will be pretty
heavy, at home remove what you don't want or need.

have fun, I took a front quarter like that and it is amazing what a
sawzall will cut, heck just sawed the windshield in half (it was already
broke and worthless)

Good luck and be carefull
