Matty,
I would go get a set of the 12 point tools. You can get cheap ones at 
autozone. Try tapping the correct size into the bolt and see if you can 
get it to turn. If not try the next size up. I use these twelve point 
"tools" for getting out stripped allen bolts. If you still can't get it 
then use a pair of vice-grips as others have suggested. Also like George 
wrote,if  it's the outers on a vanagon use a drill bit big enough to 
drill off the head of the bolt only. You may need to turn the tire to 
get a direct
shot at it. Make sure you get some new bolts.
