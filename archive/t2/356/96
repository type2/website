Subject: oil leak / cracked case

I have been noticing excess oil at the bottom of the engine of my '71 bus for
a while but the oil consumpsion has not been excessive so I have not been too
concerned. I now have the engine out to have a bad generator worked on and can
see that there is an excess amount of oil on the top of the case on the right
front above the number 1 cylinder. The surrounding area, including around the
oil cooler is dry. I have had the bus for over 10 years and have put quite a
few miles on it so I guess the possibility of a crack exists. I cleaned the
goo off pretty well with Brakleen but no cracks are obvious.
I see in the book "How to Rebuild Your VW" by Tom Wilson (chapter 5, page 76)
that that area is a place where cracks are common and he recommends using a
propane torch to open the crack enough to identify the location. However he is
doing this on disassembled cases. My question is this. Is there any problem
with doing this on an assembled engine? Or are there any other suggestions for
trying to identify a crack without a complete teardown.

Thanks,
Bill Moon
