Hi All, Boy did we have fun, this was something new
for me, I have the first time esperance, now I seem to
be hooked on the meeting of the busses. My friend
Craig had been to Everybus last year and talked me
into coming this year, he won't have to do it next
year. Craig and I (Phil) were the ones that passed
out the bungie cords during the light rain. I had just
bought my Westy, and rebuilt the engine and Craig
talked me into this trip to break in the motor, it
used no oil and got a average of 22 MPG temperature
ranged between 210-240 at 60-65 MPH so it must be
alright. A fun time was had by all, Thanks Phil
