This I agree on big time George.
And when I am King--there not only will be a standardized 12v accessory
plug, but a standard on trailer power plugs, air chuck fittings, every
vehicle in the world will have the same headlamps and tail lamp
bulbs,the same spark plugs, all the nuts and bolts will either course or
fine--one standard, two thread pitches per inch--no metric, no American,
no British standard, no Witworth-- and the whole world will drive on the
R/H side of the road--on and on--

Just make things simple--:>)

Because the "rest of the world" is wrong (IMO)
The common "cigar lighter" sockets are poorly designed for continuous
use, being designed for momentary high-current heating where a bad
connection won't hurt things. The only thing that holds "cigar ligher
plugs" in place is friction, and for long-term connections they will
work loose. Anyone who has accidentely dropped a coin into a cigar
lighter will know the other disadvantage to their design!
Ham radio folks tried using cigar ligher plugs for their radios, but
most have gone to using a common Radio Shack connector (222 Molex) for
12V applications. I use these and they work well.
There really needs to be a good "12V recepticle" standard, and the BMW
approach is as good as any.
