Subject: Accelerator Cable for 74 with Single Weber Carb

I purchased an accelerator cable for my 74 with a single Weber and it is a
little too long.  I purchased the 3655mm cable.  Does anyone have an idea
which cable would be the right cable for that?  I've got the cable in, but
one of my buddies cut the end off before I could measure it for the
difference.
 
TIA,
