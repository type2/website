Subject: New To List!

Hey Everyone,

I am a first time subscriber to this list. I look forward to many years of
interaction with you guys. I have been part of the vintage list for a while
and it has been a huge help for my 67 standard bus.

I have a 1972 camper van. I need to replace the starter. My starter has a
mounting bolt on the lower left and what looks like some sort of tab on the
top right. I know there is supposed to be an additional mounting bolt on the
top right but all I can see is this tab like thing. Has anyone ever seen
this type of mounting? I so, how do I get my starter off? I need help!

Thanks in advance,
