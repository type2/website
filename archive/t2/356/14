Subject: Fuse Question...and more electrical problems

Good day all

Question: according to the bentley(and the owners
manual that came with the bus) ive read that there are
suppose to be only 2-16amp fuses in my bus(74

these 2 manuals say?

Secondly...i have one fuse that has blown 2 times in
the last month....(number 2) what could be the cause?
