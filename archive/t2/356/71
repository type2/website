start saving money NOW for a new engine or rebuild, GEX maybe one of the
worst rebuilders in existance, once in a while they get one right by
accident but 3,000 miles seems to be about average for how long they last,

more important, replace ALL gas lines, with high presure fuel injection
gas hose, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT

replace the flexible brake lines, I would also replace the brake

replace ALL fluids including oil/gas/transmission/brake fluid with good

several folks here on this site own companies, including Bus Depot,
