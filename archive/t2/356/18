Hi, all.

Just got my first bus ('79 Westy) and boy oh boy am I gonna need some 
advice soon!   Hope everyone had a good time at EB.

What I've found so far:
1.  Low compression #3 (50#)
2.  Water coming through rear heater vent.  "Hey, is it supposed to be 
cold in here?" :-)
3.  Front axle beam rusted through (didn't see that!) at center pivot 
point.  (just a small hole).
4.  Front end loose as a goose.
5.  Steering requires a pretty heavy effort, is this normal?

Other than that, it's just fine! :-)

My main question right now is does anyone know where I can find a new 
axle beam?  I've seen the adjustable ones, I think I want to find a 
stock unit.
What should I check on the engine before I pull it, or can I do all my 
checking on the bench?
Should I convert from FI to carburetor as long as it's working?

Hope I haven't bit off more than I can chew.
