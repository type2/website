Welcome. Get the green Bentley manual if you haven't already.

Under the rear bench or under the fridge (if you have one)?

Steering Damper dead or missing. Replace it to determine state of steering
box.

If the tires are properly inflated if will feel heavy until you get up to
taxying speed. ;-) The large steering wheel and lack of power steering fluid
container is a hint that it's normal.

New ones are hard to find these days. Last ones I heard of came from Europe
thanks to Bus Depot but they've since been sold. Perhaps a listmember
grabbed one and has it for sale.

Get a state of the engine before you make changes. Do you have a starter on
a bench setup? Can you deliver fuel and route exhaust? Probably not.

Check compression, idle rpm, dwell, fuel pressure and manifold vacuum. That
way you can see the difference you made after your rebuild and assembly
which will start with a valve adjustment.

The best advice I can give you while the engine is out is to thoroughly go
over the electrical ground system (engine and transmission) and clean all
the contacts. More than one person has taken the engine out put it in and
it's failed to work for mystery reasons.

This has been said many time: no, that is unless you want to give me the
parts. ;-)
