That is because those mechanics are MORONS. They are probably so afraid of
what has to be one of the simplest FI systems ever made that they soil
themselves at the mere thought of having to put what is obviously a
startlingly small amount of intellect and troubleshooting skills to the test
on anything more than 100 year old technology. These are the same mechanics
that insist you do not need a t-stat or flaps, and swear by GEX rebuilds.
Avoid these people like the plague. There is a reason that every car built
today has FI. It is simply a better way to manage fuel delivery by several
orders of magnitude than carburation. Get the Bentley and Haynes manuals,
learn your FI system, and become the Mechanic. You'll repay yourself ten fold
in the long run.
