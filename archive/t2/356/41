There is practically no clearance between the nose and the air ducting to
work with.

I've never mounted one but I will have to do it in future. My kit came with
molly bolts (sleeve-type hollow wall anchors) assuming you'd only have
access from the outside but the original mount looks like the bolts are
secured from behind...I'd like to know how it was put on also.
