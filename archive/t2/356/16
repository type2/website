If your wiring is intact fuse 2 looks like it is taillights turnsignals
and the license light. Maybe an intermittent short in one of these
circuits, chafed wire or a problem at one of the sockets.

could be bad contacts on the relay, less likely could be fuses or lamps
but then it would have to be both.
