The illustrations helped me understand. My bus engine definitely looks
like the type 4 layout.

also there is this big Black panel behind the generator on the type 1
engine on the type 4 you can see all the way to the firewall in the
back,
also most (not all) buses with type 4 engines have a hatch on the top
 a 72 flat engine does not have the hatch and any retrofit might have
one

sure sounds like you have a type 4 engine
