Subject: Front Dash Table

Greets List -

(I forgot to thank those who responded to my Dual Oil Pressure sender - 
Thanks!)

I scored a front dash table out of a '77 Westy at the boneyard yesterday. 
Giddy me.

The two table mount brackets were centered on the dash, at the plane just 
above the dash switches on the '77 (one mount to the left of the ashtray, 
one to the right).

Is this the "stock" location for these brackets? I see that I -could- also 
mount the table on the passenger side, which would keep the brackets far 
from the switches.

Any pictures would be greatly appreciated. BTW - this is going on a '69 
Westy.

Thanks -

Mike
