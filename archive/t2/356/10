It is hard to answer without just guessing,, but I would guess you have a
dropped valve seat, also called sunken valve seat.
rings take time to wear , so do valves, but seats drop very quickly

I would suggest you find some way to put compressed air into each cylinder,one
at a time, at TDC, then listen to hear air escape from the engine.
If it leaks a little past the intake valve, you'll hear it at your carbs,, in
your case at the intake ports of the head
If it leaks a little past the exhaust valve, you'll hear a hiss at the muffler 
If it leaks past the rings, you'll hear a hiss in the oil filler funnel, take
the cap off 
If it leaks past the cylinder and the head surface, you might have trouble
finding that hiss sound, 

This is basically a leak down test, 
If you can get a leak down "tester", you will have a better understanding of the
problems inside before you take the engine apart.
