<< what i really need to know is:
1) how difficult is it to remove this section? (the parts bus will

2) what tools will i need to do the job?
3) are there any articles, etc. out there that will help me?

please keep in mind i have never really done any type of
bodywork, so please explain so a 'beginner' can understand.

There's quite a bit attached to 'just' the nose section. Like the dash, 
steering assembly, air ducting, doors, etc. You'd hafta remove all of
that before cutting off the nose. Afterwards (especially without the 
steering), I'd think the donor bus might be less than 'transportable'.
Unless, it's just gonna be winched unto a flatbed trailer...
