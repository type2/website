Subject: Nose Repair

Hi All,

Question, doing a resto on my 76 Westy and am getting around to fixing the nose 
where the holes for the spare tire mount are. The holes are split and I was 
wondering if anyone has come across this before and whate route they took to 
repair it and/or reinforce it for future mounting of a spare tire? Thanks
