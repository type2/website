Starter fluid will do just that.

It's a long way from the tank to the #1 injector. What I do, is turn the key
and deflect the flap in the AFM by hand to bring the fuel rail up to
pressure. The pressure regulator is totally mechanical so when 35 psi is
reached it will return the excess fuel to the tank so there is no danger of
pressure build-up.

Run the pump for 15 seconds, put the air filter back on, then start the
engine and see if it idles.

Yes, all at the same time. Motronic is the L-Jet variant that fires each
injector individually.

Get one. It will be useful for compression tests. There's a nice one with a
red LED that will indicate that the battery is connected.

Where do the neck bolts go? ;-)
