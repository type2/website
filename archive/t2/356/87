the upright engine is characterised by having a small pulley that is
connected with a fan belt to a generator (cylindrical shape) mounted
up and toward the passenger from the main pulley.

the "pancake" is easiest to identify by a pulley on which runs an
alternator directly to the right of the pulley. The biggest key is
that this style of engines main pulley is also a fan.
