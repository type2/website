Subject: Re: [T2] removing nose section from parts bus

there is a great article in the new
camper and commercial magazine
on how to do it.  He only wanted from the windshield
down and used an angle grinder with
cutting disks, this seem easier than a sawzall
If you want i could try to scan the article
i plan on doing the job when i run across a decent nose
he used a mig welder to get it on.
willis

anywho, i was recently offered a good nose section from a parts bus
to repair the badly damaged nose on my new-to-me 77 Riviera.

what i really need to know is:
1) how difficult is it to remove this section? (the parts bus will
        still need to be in transportable condition after the surgery)
2) what tools will i need to do the job?
3) are there any articles, etc. out there that will help me?
