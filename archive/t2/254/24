There is a plug on type IV engines on the left above the Temp Sender that
covers the access hole for auto-tranny flex plate / torque converter
removal. Then there is the one on the right behind the air distribution
box , three wire magnetic sensor for TDC that would be used by authorized
VW service if we trusted them.
