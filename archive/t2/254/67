Subject: stange timing reading, need help!

I guys, i have a strange timing problem!!! I need suggestions!!!!!!
The bus is a 73, engine is a 1700 with original Solex 32-34

Here it goes:

DWELL is 34deg at the most (It should be 44deg to 50deg!!!!!)
Gap of breaker point is .40mm  (It should be between .40mm/.50mm by
Bentley, mine's OK)
To have a DWELL reading of 44deg I would have to gap the point at about
.20mm (not tested yet, what do you think)

RPM is 900, well I try to have a stable 900/1000.

Timing with strobe light (new style that clip on the wire of #1
cylinder)
Reading so the van run's well: -24 (yes, minus) far from the + 10 I
should read/have, the engine won't run at all a even 5, I can maintain 0
but It doesn't like that at all (no power and bucking). When I try to
turn the distributor clockwise to go close to 10 (or I should say 0, the
engine feel offset and stall right away) I was running the van at -10
and the engine wasn't running right, so I said to myself; of course!!! I
am at -10, I need to go to 10, well not!!!!!! I need to go the other
direction (-25) so the engine run's nice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Strange stuff: The vacuum on the distributor can mushroom
(advance/tardiness) (the one on the left/flat side) is open (nothing on
it) without any vacuum line attach to this one, the Bentley doesn't show
much!
The upper vacuum on the right side (round side of the mushroom) goes to
the left side of the left carburetor near the butterfly, just over this
one.
I have to exact distributor but with different part #, the original
one(if original) was remove this morning to put the other one with new
point. Could the distributor be the problem, is the strobe gun the
problem, is the white reading arc misplace, is the pulley offset (I
don't think so), is the vacuum the problem.

Why am y so offset to the left (-24), this is a lot, something is wrong,
do you have any suggestions, I would appreciate a lot gentlemen's.

Best regards, Ben
