Subject: STP Air Filters - not recommended

So anyhow, I was getting ready to do a bit of the usual fall maintainance
this morning and went down to the FLAPS to buy filters, etc.  First big
disappointment is tha tthey have stopped carrying Bosch and now have the
stor brand and STP as their lines.  Bought an STP air filter. Came home
and popped it in.  Second disappointment is that the STP element is only
1" thick!!!!  The Fram it replaced (how the heck did I get a Fram in
their???) was 1.5" thick and the molding on the filter housing seems to be
ready for a 2" thick filter.  I am heading off on Tuesday to buy a Bosch
and compare it, but I wonder...  Are they just generally getting thinner
as time goes by or is this like the oil filters, some are better than
others???

On a related note... the old filter was *FILTHY*!!!!  I change air filters
every 6 months whether it needs it or not. I think actually a shorter 4
month would be better, but I do spring and fall maintainance and it fits
right in.  Usually I detect a bit of darkening on the filter, but not
actual dirt.  this time it was awful.  I am blaming it on the drought we
are going thru.  It is just a lot dustier than usual around here and the
filter showed it.  If you have not changed/looked at yor filter lately and
you are in the SE, take a look, it may be in the same shape mine was.
