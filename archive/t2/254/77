Hey Now!
I only have my two buses so I have to chose either the 1800 or my 2 litre to
run in......I use my 1800 most though because I like the camper to be ready
for campin' without me having to tune her up from driving her daily to and
fro.

I save the camper for 'special' trips and the transporter is my daily get
around vehicle, she's my trooper but you really gotta keep more of an eye on
the tunings on VW's because daily driving can call for regular checks on
brake fluid, oil, good quality gas (with a led additive if you use it),
checking your fuel filter often, etc. basically just all your regular tune
up things but I put most these on my priority for every day checking with
mine.
Carry extra belts and fuel filters, etc.
Make sure your spare is aired up and you have your jack (trust me from
personal experience, hehe)
Gas can too :o)
I always keep three to four quarts of my bus's oil in her.

So yah mine is on the road daily, people don't seem to like that fact, but
alas; my favorite sticker on her STILL is "Arent' You Glad You Got Stuck
Behind a VW Bus"
It makes me feel better when people zoom around me in their new Lexus's.

Peace,
