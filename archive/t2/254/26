Probably a bunch of Palestinians in a factory in Ramala :-)

You *don't* want to get me started on the politics of "Made in" nor the
politics of the middle east.  Very briefly:

"Made in" is a fraud! If the truth be told, the phrase should be "Passed
through" This is not just true of your "Israeli" fuel filters but even of
whole vehicles!  Despite the theoretical legalities, if any assembly,
however minor, occured there, if the place has cachet then the bit you buy
will be stamped "Made in".  I can't tell you how many bits (VW and
otherwise) I have bought that were stamped "Made in USA", "Made in
Germany", or "Made in UK" or..... that I know damn well were made in China
or India!  But they sell better with the "Made in USA" or "Made in
Germany" label, so that is what they get altho all that happened in the US
or Germany was that they were screwed together and put in a box.  As an
example , Chrysler (now Daimler-Chrsler, soon to be Daimler.) has been
making engines in Windsor, Ontario for *DECADES* Every Dodge slant six
engine ever made came from Windsor!!!!  But look at any of their
products... try to find Canada in print!  That fact disappears!  and we
don't even *mind* Canada!!!! (yeah, I hear you, Greg and Jamie :-)

On "Made in Israel"... First, that covers Israel proper, the West Bank,
the Gaza strip, as well as things actually made in Syria, Iran, Jordan,
etc. etc. and brought in to the West Bank and the Gaza strip for assembly
and packaging.  In addition (and to make it more difficult), Israel is a
second source for many small parts and machine tools.  Look at router
bits.  Half the router bits I buy are stamped "Made in Israel".  Where are
they actually made?  Who knows!
