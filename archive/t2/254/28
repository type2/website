Subject: CAL 79 Bus Smog Test II Prep questions

I've read material in the archive and the library that make the process seem
doable,
but after studying the parts catalogs I'm still left with a couple of
questions. Maybe
those of you who've been through the 2nd smog test can answer these.

I have not yet seen the results of the first test and thus cannot narrow
failure symptoms
down somewhat depending on whether high HC vs. CO, but it appears there are
several hurdles to getting a 1979 California Catalyst bus to win the game of
emissions
limbo.

Assuming the bus has good compression and is sitting at the beginning of its
60 day (30 day?)
time period between test one and test two, there seem to be limited options.

Again assuming good compression one could run a full dead on tune up, but
what if the
california only Cat is stuffed and full of junk? Bus Depot seems to have the
Non-Cal Cat but
that probably wouldn't cut the mustard. The exhaust parts are certainly NLA
but not impossible
to scavenge, but It appears this 1979 CAL Cat is NLA - if so, what have
others done? What about
the EGR valve for 79 CAL buses? Also NLA I presume? Has anyone succeeded
using busdepots 81-83
cat exhaust setup to pass?
What of the Hall effect distributor - does this unit act up and
contribute to high readings? I see Rocky has a kit to tune it up, but
suppose the distributor
has high mileage and is worn - sounds like another to the NLA boneyard item
if needed.

Considering acquiring a bus in this state and want to know the success
rate - in other words
have people gotten it together and passed test II from junkyarding for the
exhaust and following
the tips in the library for the test?

Thanks,

Chris
