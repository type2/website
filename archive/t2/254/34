Subject: timing light vs. static

Muir says absolutely use static set up.
But the Type 2 library recommends using a timing
light.
What gives? Answer personal email, if this is old hat.

I have to check my timing and it appears the crank
pulley has been switched over the year's to a
single-notched one. Seems I have some fiddling to do
and I might as well do it right, even if it means
spending $30 on a timing light..

(BTW, I Recently adj the valves, idle etc.)
