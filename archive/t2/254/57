Subject: Jalousies in a Vanagon

Volks,

Barry found a vanagon westy with jalousie windows.  I am curious, as I did
not think that such  a thing existed, but I have seen them now and they
are sure as all get out jalousies and fit the vanagon window opening!  Has
anyone else ever seen such a thing???
