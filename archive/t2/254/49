Subject: HCBF - Lost and found - power strip

Gentlebeings,

OK, so I finally got to cleaning out the bus after High Country.  It's
the "Alice's Church" school of bus ownership, I guess :-)  Anyhow, I am
embarrassed to say that I found, upon cleaning the bus, a power strip that
someone was generous enough to lend me for the dwell seminar.  It wound
up in the box with all the distributors and mouldered there a bit.

If the owner of this will step forward, I woudl be happy to return this
item, he said (feeling really guilty).
