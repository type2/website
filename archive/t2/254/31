Many companies contract out to other companies to produce their 
product.  Bosch and VW both do it.   so does ford chevy  etc.  Read the 
vw part number on an item and then tell me  who made it.  type 1 fuel 
pumps were made in Italy, brazil, germany, and a couple others.  all 
sold by VW they only had VW  number on them.  Filters are a known 
international item and so are rotors.  I could  show you raybestos top 
line rotors for the same vehicle  made in three countries.  china, 
venezuala, canada.  that same purolator filter used to have indonesian 
markings on it.  now its isreal.  next contract maybe iraq.  forget 
country of origin on parts and go by what standard it was made to.  
Bosch  was not the sole supplier on VW as many people think.  Ask 
busdepot or bus-boys or any dealer.  BTW a filter cross reference 
doesnt  list bosch as a supplier of that filter.
