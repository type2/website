Subject: RE: [T2] Troy's engine problem of the day.....More

I was not sure how much a timing light would help while at cranking
speeds but I hooked it up anyhow and noticed that I did not have a good
pattern coming from the light.  This was with the light hooked up to the
coil wire.  Should the light show with a steady pattern like this
*...*...*...* ?  Mine goes like this  *...*...*.*...*.*.* and so on. All
while cranking at about 20rpm's. Thanks for the help.

Items checked again

Coil is good
Spark at the plugs
Fuel pump works
Fuel from the injectors (Although pressure not confirmed)
Compression in the cylinders
Good spark from the points
Rotor is good
Sensors check fine
Double relay checks fine
Spark plug gap correct

But...still wont start...no matter how far forward or backwards the dist
is turned or even with a shot of starter fluid.  

Troy-----whose brain dead at this point.
