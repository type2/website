My guess is that VWoA replaced the asbestos-containing components on a
few buses so that they could demonstrate later in asbestos liability
lawsuits that they had tried to do something about the problem. When
pressed, the VWoA mechanic conceded, off the record, that, yes, it did
have something to do with asbestos.

I think the VW legal department had hoped most of these old buses
would eventually rust away or otherwise end up in the junkyard. With
prices for old VW buses going through the roof, though, it looks like
more folks will be hanging onto them, or buying old ones and fixing
them up.
