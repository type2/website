I would clip it to the #1 wire where the plug goes through the engine tin. I've had trouble when connecting the pickup to the wire too close to the other wires.

--This is called induction. Happens anytime high voltage circuits are adjacent without proper protection. Bad when high voltage gets in with out of phase high voltage, worse when it jumps on a low voltage line.

At work (EE office) we take a lot of precautions to avoid this.
