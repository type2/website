Subject: Fuel filter origins

I've ordered a few fuel filters from several online vw vendors over the
months as part of larger orders for the hell of it and I assumed they were
all Bosch filters even through they say "07711 Made in Israel 1115".

There are no Bosch marking and the boxes they come in are blank also.

Today in the local flaps I saw a Purolator filter, same shape, same markings
and the Purolator book confirmed this is their part # for a VW bus.

Does anyone know who makes this filter in Israel?
