Subject: Re: [T2] water tank removal

thanks for that work.  it has confirmed my suspicions that that is a 
job i will put off till later.  i looked at those cabinets for a long 
time trying to figure out a way to get at them.  from the book it 
looked simple, but when i looked at it i scratched my head and left it.
