Hi all,

     We are starting to look for a new bus as we will have our insurance =
money next week.  We are considering another Vanagon maybe.  I have =
never owned a water-cooled VW.  I have heard about the coolant & head =
gasket problems with these buses.  How are these things to work on =
compared to air-cooled?  If properly maintained can I expect comparable =
reliability & parts lifespan?  Any real advantages between the 1.9L & =
2.1L?  Anything to avoid altogether.  Any input would be helpful.
