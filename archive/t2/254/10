Subject: RE: [T2] Plastic plugs (valance)

I have these holes but they are not threaded and have never had any
plugs in them.  From looking at them...the prep job and paint around
these areas looks well done.  This leads me to believe that they may not
have been meant to be closed, but rather an outlet for water?  Just a
thought.

These holes threaded??  If so these are the holes where options you 
dont have got attached.  could be standard bus, commercial bus, or 
westy, or weekender.  sometimes vw is nice enough to put them in places 
where i find uses for them.  the one under my  bench seat came in handy 
for a wire entry location.  this would have mounted rear heat on the 
water cooled diesel.
