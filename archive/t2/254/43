Despite all the expensive disposal regulations, as of a couple of years ago you could still buy those asbestos tiles/shakes for the outside of your house.  

Short of attacking them with a sledgehammer they're just about indestructible, and the baked on finish lasts for decades.  During installation they are cut to size with a special tool much like a heavy-duty paper cutter, leaving very little if any dust/residue.  

Kind of makes you wonder why the removal procedure is so restrictive.

[Obligatory Bus Content}:  I wish the structure and finish of my Westy's poptop were as sturdy and durable.
