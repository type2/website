I just installed a new rear cargo hatch seal in NewBus.

I bought the replacement from Bus Depot.
Since the rubber in NewBus was original, before I installed the 
replacement, I was very methodical to inspect exactly how the original was 
installed as I removed it, and then made a very detailed comparison of the 
removed original to the Bus Depot sourced replacement as to cut, design, 
fit arrangement of lips, mould shape, etc., right down to a very really 
deep minutia of examination............ .........result of inspection 
......... The rubbers are identical.

I tell you this just so you know.
Perhaps others supply a seal identical and sourced from the same 
sub-vendor. I suppose maybe they do, but I am happy to know that this 
critical sealing piece has not been design compromised or metamorphosed 
over the years.
