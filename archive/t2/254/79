Maybe we should know better than most that one of the best things that we 
can consistently for ourselves in our every day lives is to take the small 
amount of effort and additional time required of us to express our 
gratitude to others when they treat us well with service, product, 
humility, concern for our well being, etc.

Also, next time you interface with a minimum wage worker, be creative in 
the way with which you can go out of your way to be especially nice to that 
person. You might be the only nice thing to happen to them for a very long 
time.

If "compassionate conservatism" rubs you the wrong way, as it does me,
then offer forth compassionate liberalism to those that may not be in the 
loop of every day happiness.

I'm off my soapbox now, and back behind the wheel of my bus.... over in the 
right sided lane. :-)
Quite a soapbox, huh ?
