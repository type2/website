I have matched up several others to  the one i mentioned before to  
various  configurations of the vanagon  There are two plugged holes 
under my bench that correspond to the rear heater of the water cooled 
deisels.  there are ones in the floors for seats  even in the  westies. 
  the regular vanagon will have almost 16 extra holes in it.  Every plug 
i pulled in my westy is threaded  and there is a solid threaded insert 
in the hole.  I have looked at the mounting points for the floor 
cabinets in regualar vanagons and found the corresponding threaded 
holes, but not always.  Pulling out the book i just matched up four 
more two on the sliding door side and two on the oposite side.  they 
are for retractable seat belt options for the back seat of the standard 
vanagon.  turns out there are others that are hidden behind the 
material for seatbelts for the third seat as well.  these may be the 
ones in the original question.
