Ron, 
I just wanted to add my 2 cents worth. Ive seen a lot of posts regarding
your products and some less positive than others. I have always been
completely satisfied with the products I have purchaced from you guys and 
at the prices you can't go wrong. I
have been buying stuff from you guys for about 5 years now and have come
to depend on the bus depot for my parts. Your staff has always been
honesty and friendly.
 I think there are a lot of people out there who
don't understand that bus production stopped 22 years ago in the US and
that original eqipment parts are hard to come by. You guys offer the best
alternatives at reasonable prices.  I totally envy what you do and I
really appreciate the work that you guys put into your company. You are a
major contributor for keeping many buses on the road especially on the
east coast. and for that I would like to thank you.

Bob,
Thank you so much for taking the time to post your positive review!  It
really made my day to see that our efforts are appreciated. So many people
only bother to compose an email when they have something to gripe about.
