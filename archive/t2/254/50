To the list,

Went by Pick Your Part in Hayward, CA.  Still looking for that pot top.

They have 5 Bays coming onto the lot when they clear DMV.  One hi top 71 =
what looks to be a 76 Westy 68 or 69 Westy a 70 & then 73+ been =
repainted can't tell the year from this side of the fence.

Pass this onto the Syncro folks. They got a 7 pas wagon wanting to come =
in, it is intact a this point they will sell hole.
