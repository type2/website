Subject: water tank removal

I removed the camper water tank to thoroughly clean it and boy, was it
awkward to get out.  The is a rubber stopper about half way down the left
side which makes things difficult and sliding it out takes a see-saw action
because the filler opening at the top rubs against the top drawer support.

Was there an easier way? I have to put it back in and I'm not looking
forward to it.  All the cabinetry seems to be glued and stapled into place
to bear the weight of a full tank.
