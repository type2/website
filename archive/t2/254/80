As always, H Steve has the good information!

I just thought I'd  add,,,
as Ben was originally asking about -quote----
>DWELL is 34deg at the most (It should be 44deg to 50deg!!!!!)
>Gap of breaker point is .40mm  (It should be between .40mm/.50mm by
>Bentley, mine's OK) 

put the emphasis on using the DWELL METER,, not feeler gauges.  If you have a
dwell meter, ignore the feeler gauge settings
The electrical spark could care less about the mechanical distance the points
are open, but it makes a huge difference having the correct electrical time, or
degrees that the points are closed.
The dwell meter shows the actual electrical time in degrees 

using a 16 thou. {.40mm/.50mm} initial setting, or when stranded will make the
engine run
Using a dwell meter will give you accurate results.

Old Eskimo trick...
When stranded,, and have to change points in your snowmobile,, you will find
that a paper match book cover is about .016" thick and makes an excellent point
gap gauge ,,, to get you running till you find a dwell meter and strobe light.
Your fingers won't stick to a match book as they do to that cold metal feeler
gauge.

Hmmm,, the Bentley manual cover is the same thickness!  8-)  For those
non-smokers.
