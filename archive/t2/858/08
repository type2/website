Subject: Re: [T2] westy light bulbs

Kevin asked:


 Anybody know a part number on the flourescent bulb for the Westy   dome light?  Or something that will work?
None of the usual  suspects list it.  Surely something on the market uses that type  bulb.  Cheers...KR

Well.......
I took apart an extra light I have. It has a Phillips 5W/33 flourescent tube in it. So I perused the Phillips
lighting website. Came up empty handed.

Looked it up in my Westfalia parts manual. The tube is Westfalia part number 231 069 581. Again came up empty
handed on that number.

Came up empty on page 2 here:

Tried the whole lamp part number, 231 069 580. Came up empty again.

Still researching a source.......  I believe it is a T5 but so far the 12" T5 bulb is 8W, not 5W.
