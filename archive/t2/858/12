Brittle maybe an exaggeration in their description but I've seen  
enough NOS rubber to believe it's less good than it was when it was  
new. It's almost never stored properly and the preservative has  
turned to a powder and flaked off long ago.

Prices have gone up with the Euro. When I bought their seal in 2003  
it was $37.

Searching German eBay and paying shipping from Europe for old seals  
seems less cost effective than getting new seals from OEVeedub (at  
least the available seals, not the rare pickup seals).

They've been selling these seals for a long time. They import them  
directly from Germany. Lucky for us German law virtually mandates  
that the original seal be produced.

The problem with the NOS seal is the rubber formulation. We know that  
it shrinks prematurely and causes the window lip rusting problem all  
baywindows seem to have. The seal profile is similar to the side and  
rear windows but the front lip has more of a scoop in it that  
compounds the problem.

The OEVeedub seal is the exact same shape as the original, same  
perfect fit but the latest rubber formulation.

I also pick and choose parts based on price but in this case I think  
it's worth investing an extra $1/yr (today's prices) in this seal.
