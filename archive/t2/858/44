Kevin,

> 12V,  8W.  So I figure it will work.

0.66A (-at-) 8W vs. 0.42A (-at-) 5W, shouldn't affect anything.

You can check a light bulb for continuity with a meter, not sure about
fluorescents though.  Have you checked the light fixture with a meter to see
that you're getting 12V with the switch on?

> Where did I go wrong?  Anybody have a schematic of that  light.

When it's all taken apart you can visually follow the circuit path, the switch
is a hokey spring-loaded arrangement, maybe something's just not making
contact inside anymore.

Take it down, pull it apart and work the switch to check for continuity.
Can you work a meter?
