Subject: about load range D vs C reinforced tires

Trying to check for tires on daughter's 75 which is 800 mi from me-
she'd have to find a tire in Savannah area.

A search of our tire size (185R14C) on tire rack (I used 86 Vanagon as a 
search)  Shows only 185R14, the Yokohama load range D, the Vanco 8 (no 
load rating shown), and the Michelin Agilis, L R of D.  I thought D was 
a passenger tire but usable- can one not get "locally" a 186R14C with 
the reinforced rating?  She has Wrangler LT's with correct rating, but 
searching their site only shows a HT with a load rating of C!!!!  This 
is why I asked if there is another vehicle using the correct tire.
