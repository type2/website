Bently T-II section 5 page 42.... NOTE---Use a piston ring compressor 
that can be taken apart. Otherwise you will not be able to get it off 
the piston after the cylinder has been installed. also same page Fig. 
12-2...Cylinder being installed. Note design of ring compressor.

Bentley says specific compressor for specific procedure for specific 
T-IV assembly. Do otherwise and solve your own problems created thereby.
