Subject: Part needed for T4 engine

I am placing an order for parts needed to rebuild and 
engine. cip1.com has all but one item that I need. I tried 
Bus depot for some parts, but as usual, they are out of 
half the items.

There's only one item that I really need. Does anyone know 
where I can find cylinder spacers for a 1700-2000cc 
engine, .40" , I need 4. Part #80540

I also checked my local VW store. They cannot find them 
with the #80540

Is there another part number for them?

Thanks for any help.
