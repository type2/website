Hi,

Forget importing. You will never legalize it to DOT standards. Some do
use resto shops for buses, but there's nothing like the feeling of
accomplishment of doing it yourself. Plenty of buses for sale at VW
shows, on the Samba, and even ebay.

 As a previous owner of a '69 bus, I'm finding myself looking back to my
 youth and desiring the fun of that drive again.  I'm finding very few
 sources for decent used busses in Northern California (unless anyone has
 any suggestions), so am thinking about alternatives.
