Generally speaking, there is very little load at idle. As long as 
pressure comes up off idle there is not much to worry about in the 
short term. In the long term, 3 psi less pressure at idle will likely 
mean 10 or more psi less pressure off idle. Not the road to 
longevity. However, monkeying with the lubrication system is far more 
often than not a road to hell. The fact that you have the light issue 
at all is proof of reduced efficiency with the lifeblood of your 
engine. Just take a look at the size of the oil pipes and pumps used 
on stock engine cooler setups. They are huge for good and proper reason.

The negatives are:
1.) reduced pressures due to friction losses in the lines and coolers 
that the pump capacity was never designed for.
2.) more connections = more risk of leaks
3.) less cooling due to poor mounting in many cases I have seen
4.) longer warm up time due to excessive oil capacity
