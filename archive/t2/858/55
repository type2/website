Subject: Tire FART is over!  Bus Depot came through...

Got a headache calling places in Savannah, (only ones in right size were 
the Chinese $79 Wynstar), $10 more than the better ones Bus Depot sells, 
who will ship them to her for $20 for the pair, 3 day delivery.  Nyssa 
will have to trust her spare or use the bicycle!
