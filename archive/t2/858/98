Subject: Re: [T2] Investigating: newbie questions for the group

In looking for a van for my mom (yes ended up with an ASI 80 vanag*n :) we
had found this nice European camper in Washington:

'73 westy camper

I talked with the guy the other night (after we had bought moms van) and was
disappointed that we had already bought one, but he seemed very
knowledgeable with the T4 engines and even though i have not seen or driven
the van - I would recommend that if you got the chance, to take a look at
it. I also told him about the puyallup, WA spring meet and will probably go
- maybe a great place to look for busses - yet it is a bit far from
norcal...

Just FYI - '72 and UP all have the T4 (type 4) engines - 1.7, 1.8 and 2.0 if
you want to know more about these engines go to this site:
http://www.tunacan.net/t4/

'71 and earlier all have the T1 engine that is probably what you are
referring to, as that is what your 69 had. Each have their own pros and cons
- you can find more info about this on the samba forums or even searching
the archives - after owning a bus with each, i personally love each engine
types - but only currently have a high performance T1 in my 71 - like i said
there are pros and cons of each...

If you can do mechanical by yourself - that is usually good enough for me -
I CAN do welding and bodywork and paint, but usually i just leave that up to
the professionals as it takes them less time and usually comes out with a
better finished look :)

good luck!
