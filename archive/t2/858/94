Subject: Pertronix wires

Hello.  I have a spare distributor  Bosch 022 905 205S with a Pertronix
setup.  I want to put the distributor on my spare 2.0 GE '78 engine.There is
a red wire and a black wire coming out of the hole where the condenser would
normally be.

Do I connect the red wire to the coil, and the black wire to ground??  Is
that all there is to it??

Thanks.
