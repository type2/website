Subject: Re: [T2] EEC valve

Antonio asked:

 During my quest to find a vacuum leak in my 1978 2.0L FI Californian bus I
 came across testing the EEC valve. Since my engine is out for rebuild, I can
 not test as proposed by Richard Atwell, by blowing into the large tube while
 accelerating. Instead, I tried sucking on the nipple (sounds weird but
 thats the best way I had to describe it). The result was not convincing. 1
 time out 10 the EEC valve holds the vacuum. Is it possible that I didnt
 apply enough vacuum? What is the normal ported vacuum? Any other test I
 could perform before getting my engine back?

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Put a short length of vacuum hose on the nipple. Suck on it with your mouth and then put your tonque on the
end of the hose. It has to hold vacuum. Does your tonque stay on it or falls off? If it leaks off, you need
another back half of the air cleaner with a good valve.
