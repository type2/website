Well, getting the rod to slip onto the end cap bolts after case 
assembly would be trading for a very difficult procedure, 
particularly with the last piston/cylinder in place. Split ring 
compressors work just fine and of course allow correct procedure. 
Verifying rod to crank assembly before case assembly will save you 
from a lot of extra work. At a minimum, it means at least one extra 
rod torquing not otherwise necessary. Not a fair trade for an 
unnecessary non-spec type ring compressor. Just one opinion.
