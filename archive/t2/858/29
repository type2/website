Subject: Re: [T2] about load range D vs C reinforced tires

Mike said:


Trying to check for tires on daughter's 75 which is 800 mi from me-
she'd have to find a tire in Savannah area.

A search of our tire size (185R14C) on tire rack (I used 86 Vanagon as a
search)  Shows only 185R14, the Yokohama load range D, the Vanco 8 (no
load rating shown), and the Michelin Agilis, L R of D.  I thought D was
a passenger tire but usable- can one not get "locally" a 186R14C with
the reinforced rating?  She has Wrangler LT's with correct rating, but
searching their site only shows a HT with a load rating of C!!!!  This
is why I asked if there is another vehicle using the correct tire.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 185R14 is a 82 aspect ratio tire. Any tire without the /xx numbers is a 82.
A 195/75R14 is real close to a 185R14 in size.
You can go here http://www.miata.net/garage/tirecalc.html and put 185 and 80 and 14 in on the left and play
with other numbers on the right for comparison. Just rememner that the higher you go on the 1st group of
numbers, the wider the tire will be. Not good for older steering boxes......

The C and the D is load range. It could be C load range of a passenger tire or C load range of a LT [light
truck] tire. 2 totally different load ranges. Whenever you see a tire marked 185R14C, THAT tire is a
Commercial tire [LT in the USA]. The C does not mean Load Range C in a passenger tire. A 185R14C is not a
reinforced passenger tire. Two totally different tires and ratings.
The VW bus [passenger MPV and Westy] requires a reinforced sidewall passenger tire or a Commercial [LT] tire.
Page 61 of the 1978 bus owners manual explains it:
http://www.conservatory.com/vw/manuals_nyx/Images/Owner-sManual/78Type2/pg51.jpg

Using the Michelin XZX and the replacement MX tire for an example: in passenger car mode, the tire is a load
range C with a max load weight of 1450 lbs. In the reinforced style, the max load weight is 1540 lbs. This
makes 1540 the minimum max load weight in a reinforced or LT tire you can [or want] to use. About the highest
passenger car tire is 1521 lbs. but that is a bogus figure when used on a bus.

A 185R14C tire is in the 1800+ lb. range. A good description is here:
http://busdepot.com/details/tires.jsp
The Hankook 185R14C tire is 1874 lbs.

Whenever you use a P-metric tire [a passenger tire] on a VW bus or Westy, you have to divide its max load
rating by 1.10 to get a true max load rating. An example would be a Cooper Weather Master in 205/70R14 at 1521
lbs.

That now makes it a 1383 lb max load weight tire.......too low.
Cooper does make a LT tire in 185R14C, the SRM II, at 1875 lbs.:

Supposedly, up in the northwest area, Les Schwab Tires offers a Jupiter brand tire in the 185R14 flavor but I
have not been able to find the specs on it.
http://www.lesschwab.com/tires.html
Seems to be made in Korea by Itochu International and AKA Hercules and Merit.
But that is all I can find about it.

Where did I get the1.10 figure from, you ask?  Federal Safety Standards for tires!
S4.2.2.2 below. And then you need to read S4.2.2.3(a) after that.

http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/05dec20031700/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/octqtr/49cfr571.110.htm

S4.2.1 Tire load limits for passenger cars.
S4.2.1.1 The vehicle maximum load on the tire shall not be greater
than the applicable maximum load rating as marked on the sidewall of the
tire.
S4.2.1.2 The vehicle normal load on the tire shall not be greater
than 94 percent of the load rating at the vehicle manufacturer's
recommended cold inflation pressure for that tire.
S4.2.2 Tire load limits for multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks,
buses, and trailers.
S4.2.2.1 Except as provided in S4.2.2.2, the sum of the maximum load
ratings of the tires fitted to an axle shall not be less than the GAWR
of the axle system as specified on the vehicle's certification label
required by 49 CFR part 567. If the certification label shows more than
one GAWR for the axle system, the sum shall be not less than the GAWR
corresponding to the size designation of the tires fitted to the axle.
S4.2.2.2 When passenger car (P-metric) tires are installed on an
MPV, truck, bus, or trailer, each tire's load rating is reduced by
dividing it by 1.10 before determining, under S4.2.2.1, the sum of the
maximum load ratings of the tires fitted to an axle.
S4.2.2.3 (a) For vehicles equipped with P-metric tires, the vehicle
normal load on the tire shall be no greater than the value of 94 percent
of the derated load rating at the vehicle manufacturer's recommended
cold inflation pressure for that tire.
(b) For vehicles equipped with LT tires, the vehicle normal load on
the tire shall be no greater than 94 percent of the load rating at the
vehicle manufacturer's recommended cold inflation pressure for that
tire.
