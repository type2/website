Subject: EEC valve

Good evening all!



During my quest to find a vacuum leak in my 1978 2.0L FI Californian bus I
came across testing the EEC valve. Since my engine is out for rebuild, I can
not test as proposed by Richard Atwell, by blowing into the large tube while
accelerating. Instead, I tried sucking on the nipple (sounds weird but
thats the best way I had to describe it). The result was not convincing. 1
time out 10 the EEC valve holds the vacuum. Is it possible that I didnt
apply enough vacuum? What is the normal ported vacuum? Any other test I
could perform before getting my engine back?



Cheers



Antonio
