Subject: New 1600DP "German" heads for sale

Hi All,



About five years ago I purchased a pair of new German 1600DP heads from
Bus Depot for $400.00. I never built an engine and sold my Bay last
summer and bought a Vanagon. You can have them for what I paid. I live
south of Boston MA and would prefer not to ship these but I will if I
must. Please respond by p-mail.



Thank You



Jeff
