Subject: Investigating: newbie questions for the group

Regarding your post on the Type 2 list -- As an easterner I would think 
northern Calif would be great hunting ground for low-rust Volksies, but then I 
read about the antipollution Gestapo and how they make life difficult for 
honest old-car hobbyists on the West Coast.  Suffice it to note that Audi's 
marketing people are said to consider the state of Calif, after Europe, their 
second-largest opportunity, after all of Europe!

I have a 1969 Type 2 that my sister bought new.  It was Ziebarted, spent its 
life in Maryland, never seeing salt.  It is now up on stands in my garage in 
Sparkleburg, S.C., awaiting a clutch and then paintwork.

There must be something at least that good on FleaBay or the Samba...???

Good luck in your search!
Glenn
