The C suffix means the tire is from their Commercial range, and may or may
not denote a C load range.

Allow me to suggest our Hankook tires - it beat the Michelin in a German
head-to-head test, but is cheaper, and unlike the Yoko's is an all-season
tire.  I have been using them for over ten years.  We have also sold
hundreds of them to Bus owners and had nothing but glowing feedback about
them.  They are an absolute bargain in terms of price/performance, and
exceed all VW specs for safe Bus use.

You can find a very detailed guide to choosing Bus tires and understanding
the specs - as well as our selection - on this info page:
