Hi Tim,

First off, we just went through the "Finding TDC" on the type2 list a  
week ago. I have forwarded you the post Karl made off-list. it will  
help ensure you do have TDC at #1.

Secondly, the fact that the valve is tight is no reason to think you  
are NOT at TDC. You could be dealing with a stretched valve, a sunken  
seat or a sticky valve guide. Or a worn cam lobe, a broken cam, or a  
bent pushrod...

Tim, don't panic yet; you said the bus is runnning OK. It's probably  
nothing major.

If you ARE at #1TDC already then my guess would be one of the first  
two possibles I listed. In either case, I would suggest you adjust  
the valve back to spec and then check on it in 1000 miles or so to  
see if it's stable or if the problem is getting worse.

Thirdly... I thought the 74 bus had an 1800cc engine. Not that the  
orifinal spec is any guarantee 32 years later. What's the serial  
number on the case??


Happy trails,
