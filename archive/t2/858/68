Subject: EB06 T's Reminder! "send a bus to camp"

Just a quick reminder that this is the last week to
order  SDC Everybus shirts and hoodies. I need to have
all orders in by April 2nd midnight. I will be
screening as of April 3rd.
I may have some available at the event...but not very
many! And they sell out very quickly. 

If you are interested, please visit
http://www.mindspring.com/~everybus/ or
http://www.busesofthecorn.com/suburban/ for more
details!


Thanks,
Adoom
