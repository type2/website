Timo, I spent several months there last year.  And 10 glorious  days in a two room suite on the 38th floor of the Ashton in downtown  Honolulu (waiting for a ship to arrive).  Of all of the places  I've been (probably 40 countries), I'll take Hawaii over any of  them.  That would be the end of the line for me.  And I can't  think of a better place to have a bus.  There are people living in  tents on the beaches there.  But hey, you couldn't pick a better  place to be homeless.  I may do that bus shipping thing  sometime.  Could you have that luau waiting for me?  Lots of  hula girls, please.  Mahalo....KR
.................................. ALSO, some of you have asked
about renting a VW bus on these islands. I recently found out there are
several companies doing it. Do a search on "Westfalia Rental Hawaii"
they mostly rent Vanagon campers. I met a couple touring the Big Island
in one and they recommended it heartily. Of course, I tell people to
ship a van you want to sell over here, and vacation in it. Then sell it
when you leave...IF you leave! :^) Feel free to ask any questions,
aloha, Timo
