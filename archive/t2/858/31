Subject: type 4 valve adjust

Can anyone guide me? I'm trying to adjust the valves on my '74 1700  motor. Should be very straightforward (I've done my 1600 Beetle  numerous times). I'm using Bentley as my guide (not crystal clear).
  
  My problem seems to be that I cannot find TDC on my #1 cyl! When I line  up the dizzy (per book), there is no gap whatsover. Am I missing  something? That's the position of the cyl I thought you ADJUSTED the  gap at, ergo, there SHOULD be the requisite gap present (or close. I  should mention the motor runs great, this was only intended to adjust,  not correct a known problem). Therefore, I am hesitant to start making  adjustments without being sure I know what I'm doing.
  
  The paint mark on my fan wheel doesn't line up at "zero", but I'm not  completely confident I have the dizzy in the proper orientation either.  Help?!
  
  I scoured Ratwell and can't find anything about valve adjusts
