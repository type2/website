From phil cain:

 I'll bet that the emission hole on the head is not
 plugged and it putting exhaust gas right into the
 engine compartment. While the engine is running put
 your hand around where the intake manifold goes into
 the head and I'll bet you find a big exhaust leak in
 the engine compartment. Phil

I believe you are thinking about the 1700/1800 type 4 heads used on 73/74 buses with air injection?

1600 DP type 1 engines did not have that :)

Here is the beginning of his post:
"Because of what appeared to be a sticky exhaust valve problem (#3 had about
80# compared to 120-125# in 1, 2, & 4), I dropped the 1600 DP engine in my '71 Bus last weekend and stuck on
some new heads as well as a new muffler (plus new gaskets all around)."
