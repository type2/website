Fixed it, Billy.  Tore it apart, found that two of the four white  wires had broken plugs not making good contact with the underside (hot)  of the board.  Thought about taking the board loose and soldering  them direct but the rivet would have been a problem.  Went to my  local appliance parts store and found 4 connectors that were real  close.  Just had to prise them apart a bit with a  screwdriver.  Soldered them on and installed and the light stayed  on constantly.  Did some more checking with the meter and figured  out that the rocker switch was indeed bent up a little.  Monkeying  with it fixed it.  Now it works fine with the original bulb.   So now I have at least one and possibly two good spares.  I'm  almost afraid to pull it again to test the bulb that I think I  fried.  It's working like a charm for now.  Cheers....KR

0.66A (-at-) 8W vs. 0.42A (-at-) 5W, shouldn't affect anything.

You can check a light bulb for continuity with a meter, not sure about
fluorescents though.  Have you checked the light fixture with a meter to see
that you're getting 12V with the switch on?

When it's all taken apart you can visually follow the circuit path, the switch
is a hokey spring-loaded arrangement, maybe something's just not making
contact inside anymore.

Take it down, pull it apart and work the switch to check for continuity.
Can you work a meter?
