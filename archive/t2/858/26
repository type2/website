Subject: Re:load range D vs C reinforced

I checked the receipts for daughter's Wrangler tires; actually it is an 
HT, listed only as 185R14, but the tire itself shows 185R14C - and 
searches for tires asking for size input never have a slot for the C!
At the current prices (like $165 for the HT) I think I'd go for the 
Michelin as an all season tire, while the Yokohama lists as highway-
still, is load range D acceptable?  Also, I'd prefer to use a pair at 
least, not a mix of Wrangler and a Yokohama?
