Subject: Investigating: newbie questions for the group

All:

As a previous owner of a '69 bus, I'm finding myself looking back to my
youth and desiring the fun of that drive again.  I'm finding very few
sources for decent used busses in Northern California (unless anyone has
any suggestions), so am thinking about alternatives.

Basically, I'm looking for a '72 or older Kombi/Transporter, Type 2b with
our without the middle row of passenger seats.  The '69 I had before had a
slide out bed in the back for weekend camping, and that fun (but leaky)
huge metal sunroof, but was without all the internal usual camping stuff
(folding tables, etc.).  I liked that.

So I am visualizing 2 options:
1.) Buy used and restore to as-new
2.) Look for a later model Mexican or even Brazillian model to buy used
(or even new from Brazil) and try to import into the US/California

As to option 1, there are fewer and fewer good shops who can do the
restoration work, and there are a scant few sources for a good start to
the project.  Does anyone have any recommendations as to where to look for
a good used bus?  Same request for any good restoration shops ideally in
the SF Bay Area?  Is it possible to get a decent minimal-rust decent shape
bus in the $3K range and get it to as-new with a reasonable budget (say
$4-5K)?

Regarding option 2, is it even possible to import a bus from outside the
US and have it pass required smog and registration requirements in
California?  Have any of y'all heard of anyone doing a new Brazil bus
import?  My limited knowledge of Portugese from the VW Brazil site yielded
a new water-cooled bus at ~$17,559USD (today's exchange rate).

Thanks in advance for replying to these basic questions.
