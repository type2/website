Subject: Re: [T2] rappin, buckin, barely runnin

I had symptoms like this in Betty after i rolled her :(  .. (she was a '73
westy that i installed an '83 2.0 and converted to L-jet FI)  but i know
that one of the problems i was having was due to the excessive fuel pressure
- which for L-jet I believe is supposed to be between 28-32 psi.

I replaced my fuel pressure regulator and the bucking/bad acceleration went
away - but at the time i was so fed up with her that i sold her within a few
days and don't know if really fixed the problem.

the other thing that clued me in on this was from 0-60 she wold buck and
grumble, then after 60-65mph she would just cruise - hence the amount of
fuel being poured down her throat....sigh...anyways - I would test your Fuel
pressure first, then maybe even refer to the FI troubleshooting guide....

Good luck!
