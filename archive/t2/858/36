Wrangler LT doesn't come in 185R14C does it?

IIRC, late 80's Volvo 240 Wagon required 185R14C, but looks like Tire Rack has this car listed as 195/75R14 (more widely available size). I believe spec should be 185R14C.

Also,
>what is the actual "aspect ratio" as some search options ask for?

82, but just leave as "no number" in search engines.

keep in mind there are a limited number of tires available in 185R14C 
Load Range D.

Hankook RA08 ((-at-) Bus Depot) (all-season, good value)  <--I use these
Wynstar Phaser (all-season, great value, Chinese Michelin company)
Vredestein Comtrac (summer/highway, $$$)
Continental Vanco-8 (all-season)
Vredestein Comtrac Winter  (all season, $$$)
Nokian Hakkepelita (hardcore winter, $$$$)
Bridgestone 603V (summer/highway)
Yokohama Y356 (summer/highway, only load range C)
Michelin Agelis (all-season, $$$)
YKS (rare)

YMMV, others may have brands to add to the list, corrections, or LT 
comparables.
