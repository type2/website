if you up size your tires you might need an aspect ratio.  I had some
great Michelin MXT's (no longer avaliable) that were 205R70/14 on there
with the 70 being the aspect ratio.

I have seen buses run 185R14, 195R14 and 205R70/14 without modifications
or problems in a bay.  other sizes usually require some phutzing with
suspension etc. if you have 15 inch rims you can get tires easier but I'm
not familiar with the 15inch sizes that can be used
