I had a 1973 VW bus - and sold it over 10 years ago. This is the kind
of bus with the pop up top (vanagon) and had the extended room family
tent that attached to the side of the bus.
Just realized I have the tent (frame) poles in the original bag for
the tent. Not the canvas tent itself - just the poles.

any one need?
