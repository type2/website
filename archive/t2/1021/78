Therein lies a problem.  I wouldn't trust this work to a "generic" shop.
They will ream you for this job.

Even after years of disuse, I doubt that every part has to be replaced.
Seals, perhaps, but not everything.

But, they upgraded their systems in 1973, when the engine was only 1700cc.
The engine didn't go to 2000cc until 1976.

The real reason that the system was changed was because of brake pad wear.
The late system doesn't stop any better, it just goes longer between pad
replacements.  I get lots of pad life even with my '71 calipers.
