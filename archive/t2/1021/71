Subject: RE: [T2] upgrading a 1971 brake system to a later bay system

From my understanding there really wasn't a whole lot of improvement in the
braking systems. The master cylinder is the same. The calipers and pads are 71
& 72 specific and the pads are a bit thinner - rotors are 71 and 72 specific
as well. Early 73s share the same power booster servo.

A 71 system thats in great working order will stop the bus great, even if its
a loaded down camper.

To be honest I'm questioning why you would want to do this - the amount of
cash and work involved doesn't seem like it would yield very much.

I am about to install new rotors on my 71, the difference between the original
and new German is substantial - its hard to tell how worn out they are by
looking at them. These are nice beefy heavy rotors. Yummmmm.
