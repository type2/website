Subject: Re: [T2] Diagnostics - Oil Leak

One of the problems in diagnosing oil leaks is that
when the engine is running, the fan blows the oil all
over the place. It is typical, for example, for
somebody to be certain they have a leaking oil cooler
when the real problem is the oil pressure light
sending unit or the small "bellows" on the dipstick
tube.

Are push rod tubes likely sources for oil leaks? Yes.
They have an O-ring seal at each end and they cook
until they are so hard they don't seal any more. There
are the good seal (help me someone - what is it
Vitron? Viton? Something like that)which are usually
orange and/or green and the regular ones which are
generally black and worthless.

When you open up the valve cover, pay very close
attention to the spring wire retainer that hods
pressure against the tops of the tubes. Look where it
resides and how it hooks into place. That will likely
be the most vague piece of the puzzle when
reassembling.

I always just took the rocker shafts out totally
intact hang onto the ends cuz all the parts can go
sliding off! Notice that the shaft / saddle alignment
needs to be correct when reassembling and keep your
pushrods dedicated to the same position (hole and end)
when reassembling. A cardboard box with holes punched
in it with a big phillips screwdriver works well for
this.

To pop the tubes upward, I always used a crescent
wrench placed on the tube, just below where it flares
bigger, then smacked the wrench so as to pop the tube
loose. After the first one it will make sense. Pick an
easy to reach one to do first. Pop them all out then
clean, clean, clean, clean....

When I put new seal on, I used the thickest, stiffest
grease I could find and smeared it all over both
o-rings. I aligned the tube and started it into the
bottom hole, then used a large dowel or a screwdriver
handle - my favorite was a particular hammer handle
and just push downward on the top of the tube, slow
steady force, until it popped into place. After the
first one, it will make sense!

The only other tidbits that I can offer are when you
put the pushrods back in, they can hang up on the edge
of the lifter (at least on the hydraulic lifters) so
be sure you wiggle it around until it finds the center
seat.

That wire retainer spring that holds against the tubes
- the ends hook into the open side of the saddles and
then each flat spot will find its way into the opening
of the pushrod tube. That's not where it belongs, but
it's easiest to allow them to do that, then, with long
needle nosed pliers or hemostats, lift each one up to
where it seats against the edge of the tube, where it
will exert downward pressure onto the tube.

Somebody else will help with how to adjust the valves
and many people have differing opinions on the valve
cover gaskets. I found that the only good gaskets were
the thick cork ones from reputable suppliers. Most of
the aftermarket sets use either thisn neoprene or thin
cork and I have never gotten them to seal. I also used
some Gascacinch or weatherstrip adhesive to attach the
cork gasket to the spanky-clean valve cover and let it
set until the cement was cured. Then I assembled it
with the surface of the head and the bottom surface of
the gasket dry. That was the method that worked for
me. About 99 other methods did not work well for me!

Be sure to look in the archives for information on
this subject. There's proabably a few nights' reading
there!
Hope I've helped. Watch for others' replies in case I
got something wrong - It's been a few years since I've
done 'em and I am getting feeble-minded! -BaH
