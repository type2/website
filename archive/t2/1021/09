Subject: donut spare

Hi Volks,

Has anyone here ever tried mounting a donut spare from a 5x112  
equipped vehicle like a passat, audi or mercedes onto their bus?  I  
am wondering whether or not it would be worth the space savings to  
carry one inside or under the bus. The space on the front of my bus  
is already spoken for.

Happy Trails,
