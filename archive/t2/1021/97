Subject: Re: [T2] Bays and snow piling up on windshield

How about heat strips in the bottom 2" of the windshield?  If you want a 
lower wattage device without the conversion loss of the inverter, a 12V 
hairdryer might be just the ticket.  Available at truck stops and 
probably on the internet too.  Or just *maybe* one of those cheapo 12V 
interior heaters would work?  I used one to keep the windshield defogged 
but it probably wouldn't be strong enough to keep the snow melted.
