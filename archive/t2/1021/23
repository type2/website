Subject: Fuel lines

I converted my '78 Westy to a progressive last summer and in doing so I removed and replaced all of the fuel lines.? 
It was very sobering to see what my bus was running around on.? The factory FI pump put out something like 28 psi or so, and the original hoses were completely shot!? When I think about tooling down the interstate with those dryrotted lines and factory omitted fuel line clamps, I don't know how it made it.? It's a wonder it didn't all go up.
I always carry a fire extinguisher--always--, but it wouldn't really be very effective if the fire was being fed gas?out of the bottom of the fuel tank from a burned or ruptured line.? The bus would be sitting in an ever expanding pool of fuel.? One extinguisher wouldn't cut it.
Everybody do themselves a great big favor and replace those lines, especially you FI people!
Small price to pay for the peace of mind.?? 
Don't put it off!
Do it.?These buses are getting too hard to find.
