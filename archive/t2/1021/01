Subject: Re: Dual carb brake booster line

On my Aussie 76 van the brake booster line is rubber hose to just
outside the firewall. This connects to a metal line that passes through
the firewall then immediately "T"s into metal lines leading to either
side of the engine. The last segment is rubber hose that originally
connected to each manifold. My carbs have been replaced with a Weber
progressive so one of the rubber hoses has been blocked off.
