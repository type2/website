Subject: Diagnostics - Oil Leak

After I replace all of the fuel hoses I am going to adjust the valves using the procedures
outlined in Muir's book. I'm thinking that even though repairs might be doable, diagnostics is
where I'll have difficulty.

While I was under the bus getting oriented as to where things are I found another issue.  I
thought the passenger side oil leak dripping on my driveway was coming from the valve cover gasket
but found that it's coming from the left end (toward the center-line of the bus) of one of the 4
tubes leading into where the valves are.  From the diagrams in the books I'm thinking these are
the push rod tubes (??).  

I'm hoping it's something as obvious as replacing the rubber ring/gasket that I can do during the
valve adjustment, but this is where my diagnostic "skills" end.  Might the leak be symptomatic of
something more serious?  I don't hear any expensive sounding noises and the bus runs pretty well
although it sputters as it accelerates in 1st and 2nd gears sometime.

I have a 1974 bus with dual carbs and CA smog equipment (disconnected).  The engine number starts
with AW which according to the internet makes it a Type 2.  

Thanks for any help.
