Subject: got rear-ended - need advice

Hey Everyone,
I was rear-ended a couple days ago when I was up north.  It was nothing 
horrible, just bent the bumper and pushed the body in *slightly* and the 
engine lid a hair, too.  I came to a stop, the lady behind me came to a 
stop, and well, the lady behind her didn't ;)

So, the lady in the very back has Allstate, so that's good.  Now, I just 
wanted some advice on how to proceed.  My major concern is how the 
repair is fixed.  I don't want some bondo job - I want to get things 
back perfect, so I thought I'd consult the list on how to proceed 
because this is the first time I've had to deal with an issue like this.

Now, I'm going to be bringing the bus to a metal shop in the very near 
future to replace the front skin, and that's going to cost around $1200, 
so I can't imagine this costing much more than 4-500 to repair.  Is this 
something I can negotiate to have him do the rear repair as well?  I 
really trust his work and would feel comfortable with him fixing it...

btw, it's a 78 westy.

Thanks!
Mike
