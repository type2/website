I just got a reply from SQUID and he suggested that I just talk to my 
metal guy (which I will :) ).  I guess I probably should have also asked 
is whether or not the other driver's insurance company would allow 
someone other than a non-insurance approved company to do the repair? 
Are the buses considered as a collectors cars by insurance companies?  I 
just want to make sure that the repair is as good as it can be, not some 
bondo/fiberglass job...

Thanks!
Mike
