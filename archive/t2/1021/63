It's the super secret, special edition, limit print run, Heinz  
Nordoff commemorative issue, w/ hologram wiring diagrams that was  
only sold at...aw heck, it's just the Vanagon Bentley. :-)

Bus calipers are likely only still available because they were re-

Dave, you've got some groundwater coming into your basement and Wed's  
lotto numbers are 9 14 16 27 32 38. Avoid driving during the next  
full moon and throw some celery salt over your left shoulder the next  
day. :-)
