Subject: RE: [T2] upgrading a 1971 brake system to a later bay system

I've done or will be doing almost 100% of my 71 brake system and was able to
find everything I needed. The calipers and rotors are just a tad cheaper if
you are buying for 73-79 but other than that I didn't notice much difference
or have difficulty finding parts.

Self adjusting rears would be nice but vehicles get most of their stopping
power out of the front brakes. I've heard of some people doing rear disk on
their bus but I sure see alot of fabrication.

Starting with 71 our buses really have a good brake system. As long as the
booster is working correctly and everything is within spec it really is a
pleasure. I've owned VWs from the 80s and even early 90s where the brake
system was basically the same as my 71 bus.

However if Michael is dead set on this change I wonder if he can just change
the calipers/rotors/pads. I guess the hub part may be different two but I know
the spindles and bearings are the same. The MC is the same. the booster is the
same in 73 but I guess that booster change may have had to do with the front
end changes that year more than any brake changes.

Seems the caliper/rotor change occurred because of a change of manufacture of
the calipers and maybe that's the reason as compared to a "performance"
change. I know the pads are slightly thicker which means they last slightly
longer.

I think if I was having Firestone doing my brakes (sounds like a bad idea) I
would keep things stock as to not confuse them. -Daniel> Unless/until the 1971
parts are NLA, I doubt there would be much > "upgrade" between going from
early to late-model disk brake setups.
