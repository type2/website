Hi Stan,

Good point.  Our provincial parks HATE those little propane bottles,  
they have to be treated as Hazardous waste when empty and every  
single one that a camper disposes of costs the parks system more to  
throw away than what the camper paid for it in the first place. I  
carry a 25lb BBQ tank that can be refilled for $13 Even with a  
considerable investment in hoses and adapters it is still much more  
economical and better for the environment as well.

A friend of mine with a '74 deluxe westfalia has adapted his propane  
tank to include a standard fitting so he can attach an 8' hose to the  
tank when he wants to BBQ or run a lantern. It certainly helps that  
on the Baywindow westy's the tank is on the passenger side.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
