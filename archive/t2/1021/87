By the way, the donor vehicle (85 Quantum sedan) needs to go soon.  It 
has a good 5-speed transaxle, free to any listmember who wants to come 
to Dallas, TX and remove it... perfect for the truly adventurous 
conversion project, such as an AWD bus.  :-)

Please p-mail me directly if interested.  The car will probably be gone 
by this weekend.
