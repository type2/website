Subject: Re: Thermostat cable busted

James,

I have in the past used a hand brake cable from an old ten speed bike.  I
had to file down the "ball" on the end to fit into the barrel nut that
threads onto the thermostat, but it worked great.   I did try an "E" string
from my bass guitar, but it repeatedly broke, so don't waste your time
trying that!  (too bad too, I have an endless supply of those around!)  Good
luck.
