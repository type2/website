Subject: Re: [T2] upgrading a 1971 brake system to a later bay system

Hi Michael,

Unless/until the 1971 parts are NLA, I doubt there would be much  
"upgrade" between going from early to late-model disk brake setups.

The upgrade I will recommend to your braking system would be for the  
rear, where you can upgrade the system to the self-adjusting rear  
brakes common to 1980-91 vanagons. Karl von Salzen has already  
written that up for the type2.com library, it's available here:

Happy Trails,
