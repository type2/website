Bicycle brake cable works fine.  Those are pretty heavy duty.  Buy some 
of the little cable-end things to crimp onto the end of the cable so you 
don't have the strands going everywhere.  You can get them at the bike 
store, too.

You might have to grind down the little plug at the end so it fits 
correctly in the thermostat fitting, but that's pretty trivial.  After 
you get it all rigged up (with the engine cold and flaps pulled open), 
tighten up and squeeze on the end-cap thingie with some pliers and call 
it a day.

Enjoy the road-trip and worry about the thermostat later.  The flaps 
close by default in the cooling condition, meaning your engine won't 
warm up as fast, but on a long trip it will get the cooling it needs. 
Yeah, this probably isn't the best thing to do long-term, but that 
hasn't stopped tons of people that don't feel like fixing their thermostats.

Old cable bending back and forth is eventually going to snap..
