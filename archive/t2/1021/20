Subject: Engine Fire

My poor 1972 Bus is no more.  It was very damaged from a split fuel line, Engine fire.  The  hoses were all checked in July and were all in fine condition.  A policeman saw the fire in the back and warned me.  The engine was running fine and give no warning of what was doing on.

So, please everyone, check your fuel lines again.  Now I am looking for another Bus to start rebuilding again.  I had to spend my cash I was saving for a new engine for a Vanagon I was given to purchase a car to go to work with.  It is nice, but it is not my Bus.
