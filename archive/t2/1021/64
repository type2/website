Actually the ATE have two tiny cutouts to fit the edges of the piston 
cutouts; often these are flattened by ill-fitting (not properly rotated) 
pistons.--After a lot of annoying sqeaking, I found these fitted wrongly 
by a mechanic, and I could not rotate the pistons.  I ended up cutting 
the backing plate down to allow the "towing in" of the pads that stopped 
the squeaking I was getting.
The Girling shown has a half-moon cutout with the straight part of the 
half-moon raised to fit the piston cutout.
