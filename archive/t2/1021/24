Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel lines

When people said , replace those lines , I have two parts on the fuel 
line, metallic pipe connected with flexible  fuel lines.
Changing the flexible line is obvious , but what about the metallic  
pipe (which probably has the same age of my van) , do we need to change 
them ? do they oxidized ? with what ?
