Wolfgang told me that most people only change the vent flap seal, but miss
the other seals that are deeper in. Never did it myself, but you might
check. I was told that is why I had a draft coming in up above the ceiling
panels.

Also was told to check for good seals on the turn signals.

I've got the belly pan, but I'll hit those pedal seals tonight.  I'll check
on the vent too, but I think it's sealed fairly well - I put new rubber up
there a couple of years ago.  I'll test it out though.
