Subject: True Canadian Winter Bus Campout

Hi Volks,

Just a reminder that the FIFTH annual True Canadian Winter Bus  
Campout is coming up soon... February 16th, 2008.  I know it's hard  
to believe, but the hardcore campers of the frozen tundra just keep  
coming, so I keep making it happen.

This year the event happens in the usual location, Valens  
Conservation Area. Their facilities are top notch, and the cost of a  
serviced (electrical) campsite is only $30. I was told by the gate  
girl that we WILL be allowed to double up on campsites, so the second  
vehicle will only have to pay a for a $7 day pass, which can reduce  
your costs to a mere $18/busload. Bring an electric heater and your  
bus will be toasty warm.

This is basically a noon-saturday to noon-sunday event; but people  
are welcome to extend their stay before or after the event if they wish.

Conversely, Cambridge Comfort Inn is close by if your craving for a  
campfire conflicts with campmobile coservation.

Happy Trails,
