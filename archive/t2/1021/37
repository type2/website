Subject: Re: [T2] Thermostat cable busted

  Do I need a special cable to replace this one?
   
  **Regular stranded cable of similar size. Bicycle cable works well.

Can somebody give me specs, diameter and length?

  Why do you think the cable broke in the first place?
   
  **30 some year old cable weakens.
