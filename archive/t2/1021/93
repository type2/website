Hi There,

There are gasoline furnaces available new from Espar. They cost about  
$1200, and show up on ebay pretty often. There are also propane  
furnaces available from a number of vendors. Check with your local RV  
dealer, as a lot of times people will buy an RV with a small furnace  
and upgrade it to something bigger. If the dealer has one of those  
"too-small" furnaces on hand they will often give you a good deal on it.

One of our local buses is being heated with a webasto coolant heater  
plumbed into a vanagon heater core. Apparently this system runs very  
nicely and doesn't use a lot of fuel, either.


Happy Trails,
