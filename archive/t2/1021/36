Subject: Thermostat cable busted

I walked behind my bus this morning to see how the thermostat looked, I noticed that the heat was not getting hot the past few days during my 7 mile trip to work, warm but not hot.

The cable was snapped of at the little arm, so now thermostating going on.

Do I need a special cable to replace this one?  

Can I rig something up at the hardware store?  Can somebody give me specs, diameter and length, so I can go get it without taking my bus apart?  (sorry to whine, in the next 24 hours I have a final, a cooking competition, a going away party for a friend, and I still haven't packed, I need to streamline the repair of my thermostat)

I am going on a road trip tomorrow to Florence, Oregon, it might snow on the beach, I need enough heat to keep my breath from freezing on the glass.

Why do you think the cable broke in the first place?

Thanks,
James
