Subject: upgrading a 1971 brake system to a later bay system

Are there any guru's, or websites where I can reference information on how to,
and what is involved in upgrading the complete brake system to a lter bay
system 73-79.

My main intrests are fit, clearances, and modification, unless it is a bolt on
and go ! I have recently added 15" rims and spaces, so will the be a benefit,
or a challange ?

What about:

Backing Plates (front and rear)
Calipers (larger size)
Master cylinder (larger size)
Rear drums (larger size ?)
Proportioning Valve (stays the same ?)

If this goes well, I will make a website with pictures and forward to
