Subject: Re: [T2] Accelerator and Fuel Leak??

if this bus has a type IV engine, the accelerator cable does not attach to the carb(s)...it attaches to a crossbar which attaches to the carbs.  It is probably frayed where it comes through the front firewall tin.  That is a common location for cables to fray.  I've never heard of one fraying where it connects to the crossbar although I suppose that could happen.    Nevertheless, if the sticking accelerator coincides with leaking fuel, that is probably because it is sticking at a point where it is opening the throttle plates at the bottom of the carbs to a spot where they are extremely worn (common problem) resulting in fuel leaking.

  The accelerator cable on my '74 bus is frayed where it attaches to the carburetor (?) according to
the mechanic that checked it out when I bought it. It seems to catch now and then and I have to
pull the gas pedal up or the bus idles too high.

I also have a fuel leak that seeeeems to NOT leak when I'm careful to remember to pull up the gas
pedal when I park. Maybe the two are unrelated and it's a coincidence that has to do with the
slope of the driveway or whatever.
