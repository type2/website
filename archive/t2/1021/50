Subject: Accelerator and Fuel Leak??

I guess here is where I test you guys' patience with a true VW and mechanical rookie :)

The accelerator cable on my '74 bus is frayed where it attaches to the carburetor (?) according to
the mechanic that checked it out when I bought it.  It seems to catch now and then and I have to
pull the gas pedal up or the bus idles too high.

I also have a fuel leak that seeeeems to NOT leak when I'm careful to remember to pull up the gas
pedal when I park.  Maybe the two are unrelated and it's a coincidence that has to do with the
slope of the driveway or whatever. 

Might the stuck cable be keeping something open allowing gas to drain out?  

I bought the How to Keep Your VW Alive book last night and will try and do the repairs myself, per
many of your suggestions.  There doesn't seem to be a section on replacing the fuel lines, but
that might be an such obvious thing that the author didn't cover it.  How many hoses are there?

This list is an amazing resource, as I'm sure you are all well aware.

Thanks,
Steve
