Except for the location, you're describing the swirl tank setup on Helbus'
conversion:

I think that the collector tank (also called a swirl pot or header tank)
should be at the coolant outlet, as this is the highest point in
the engine end of the
coolant path.  If you locate it at the inlet and air manages to get past
it the air will be trapped in the engine as it apparently is now.  The air
will be moved along by coolant flow as long as it is moving horizontally
or upward.  It won't move downward very well at all, so you want to trap
it at the highest point, the coolant outlet

In order for the header tank to work well, there has to be way of
automatically purging the air from the system and replacing it with
coolant.  This is normally done through normal expansion and contraction
of the coolant as the engine warms and cools.  When the engine warms,
pressure builds and any air bubbles are pushed out through the radiator
cap into the overflow bottle.  When the system cools, coolant is drawn
back through the cap, keeping the expansion tank full.  However, if you
have header tanks at both ends of the system, only one will work
properly, the one with a lower pressure cap.  You'll need some other way
of purging the other.

This is one reason why I am really trying to avoid having more than one
high point in the system.
