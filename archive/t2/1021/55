Subject: a Kansas City mechanic

On a cross country road trip several years ago I used Vee Village.  Friendly
and honest folks and no real problems.  They did the usually-- timing points
etc.  said she was fixed,, of course the surging problem I had started to have
did not happen when I took it to them.   I was able to continue to NC, but the
problem keep coming up.  I later changed fuel filter.  That helped for a
while, but I again had problems when I got to GA.  Several repair shops later
always fixing the timing and points I found a mecanic in FL  that determined
it was the condensor shorting out.  DUh.  It was not grounded the screw had
came out.  I had the problem happen since then too, but knew what to look for.
I have been told that it is best to pull the distributer when tuning it up, so
you can tightne that screw.  Seems like that is a lot of work, but I have had
a problem keeping that screw in tight!
 I used the below link to find a mechanic in Colorado and found one of the
best shops I have ever used Vee W Unlimited !    Good luck
I used this link to find one in Colorado a while ago
http://www.roadhaus.com/shops.php  the website has changed I think , but still
a great resource, I got the original link from the list or maybe ratwell.com.
I Did not see anything listed for kansas city, but I just did it fast.
