Subject: Re: [T2] Accelerator and Fuel Leak??

if it's a high-mileage bus you might also have problems in the accel. pedal hinge and pivot assembly. . . this happened on mine, it would cause the pedal to get stuck.  would stick down due to wear in the pedal hinge, pivot pin, and pivot bracket.  it's not designed to last 500,000 miles. . .

look at the pedal when you push it down, if it has any side-to-side wiggle from the hinge on top, you are at risk for this problem. new hinge pin and pedal can be purchased from wolfsburg west.

takes a little head-scratching to look at the underside, but if you remove your front belly pan and get someone to press on the pedal you should see smooth action at the pivot.  It should not cant sideways as tension on the cable increases.  the hole for the pivot can wear egg-shaped.  the pivot pin itself can wear and warrant replacement.

I cut out my old accel. pedal floor section (rust etc) and welded in a plate of 16 ga. steel bent to fit that included both a replacement hinge and pivot bracket.  Not likely you would have to go to this extreme. . . I got the alignment correct but the geometry wrong. . . now I must re-weld pedal rod to new length. . . $#&%%.  not to mention the master cylinder hose torched from the heat. . . 

I can't see how accel. cable problems would relate to a fuel leak.  although if it gets stuck and you are running a weber progressive it might be possible.  Find the leak ASAP! do not pass go, do not drive to your mechanic.  we've already seen one burnt bus this week.  if you have a sloped driveway, that might contribute, as would a worn float needle valve.
