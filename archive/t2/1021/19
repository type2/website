As with Martin's, my '73 has a metal line and the part that passes through 
the firewall is what I would call a nipple of about an inch long which the 
rest of the rubber hose connects to going up front.  The rest of the metal 
line back in the engine compartment goes to the carbs.  Hope this helps.
