Subject: Re: [T2] Girling or ATE?

Oh yes- the pics on your ste of Girling vs ATE do not show the entry 
point for the brake line- as I recall one was by the center of the 
piston (ate?) while with the other it comes in at the top (or bottom if 
caliper is flipped), requiring a replacment of a longer brakeline?
