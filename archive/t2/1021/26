Subject: Re: bus fire - fuel lines

When I got my engine rebuilt some years ago I was told by the rebuilder
that the fuel lines had been replaced. Imagine my surprise when several
years later I discovered that the fuel lines had not been replaced and
were old, inflexible and cracked and in one case was a size too big
which was accommodated by tightening up the screw clamps! Probably the
only thing saving me was that the pressure put out by the stock
mechanical fuel pump was well below spec!

I believe another source of grief on stock carbs is the brass fitting
into the carb coming loose...

PS. I have a 76 2l with a Weber progressive.
