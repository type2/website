Subject: Dual carb brake booster line

Hello List,
I am trying like mad to put one of my busses back together. Having almost
solved all my problems, I have one more.
http://www.ratwell.com/technical/VacuumHosesCarb.html
shows what appears to be a hard brake booster line?
What I have is a soft rubber line, and I am trying to get this back to stock,
although I have since figured out I have a 73 or 74 carb system on my 72 bus
(I have a paper air filter, nto an oil bath). The question is, does the rubber
line come through the tin, then "T" into the hard line and lead to both intake
manifolds? I would have though I would only have one place for the brake
booster line to hook to, but I have a hookup on both intake manifolds? Also, I
cant seem to find a good closeup of the acelerator cable to linkage hookup.
One picture I saw somewhere showed the line coming up as if it were hooked to
something on the engine block. Mine was changed to a single carb at some time
in the past so the cable of course comes through the tin in the wrong spot
but when moving to the correct hole, still will come at the linkage almost
level. This is going to make the hook to the linkage a little wonky and not
provide much leverage for the linkage to actuate the carbs. Anyone with
72-74ish carbs willing to take a close up picture of the accelerator cable
setup, and the linkage? Or some detailed instruction?
I have only had a brief chance ot look through a shop copy of the Bently
manual but even that didnt have a specific picture liek I was looking for.
Hoping the copy I ordered comes in by mid week.

thanks
-Gerry
