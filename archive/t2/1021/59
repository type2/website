Subject: Latest thinking on thermostats, & availability

Found out today that I have a bad thermostat on a '77 Type 4 engine I'm assembling.? I am a believer in thermostats and always use them.
That said, there are no more OEM type 4 thermostats available, apparently, and the type 1 ones that are available are ridiculously priced.? (Type 1 part # 111-119-159A)
I can pull a used one off of one of my many type 1 parts motors and modify it to fit, (although who knows how long a used one will last) but are they correct as far as opening temp and length of travel for a type 4?? Will they properly regulate the operating temp?? This bus will be driven mostly by someone who is not very in tune with?their machine?and won't have any 'seat of the pants' judgement to rely on.
Has anyone used one of the new spring type thermostats that seem to be the only ones available?? How do they work on a type 4?? Do they fail closed or open?
There wasn't much in the archive that I could find relating to this.? The consensus on The Samba seems to be that the new type thermostats are no good.
What about Corvair thermostats?? Anybody got a pro or con on the use of a Bowtie part on a VW?? Apparently they are still available reasonably priced.
Who has found a source of VW thermostats at the best price?? I can find them all over in the $70 range (or more), but I've seen folks write that they've paid half that.? Where?
Any and all help or advice appreciated.
Thanks,
Greg
