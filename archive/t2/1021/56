Subject: Re: [T2] Accelerator and Fuel Leak??]

We should not forget about the progressive carb option.....If your 74 
has a dual barrel progressive carb, the accel cable would attach to the 
carb.

My question is: where is the fuel leak coming from?  The only way I can 
think as to how the two are connected is if the cable (behind the engine 
tin) is pulling against the fuel line.  What I would do is replace (or 
at least check) all the fuel lines and their ends for leaks.  There is 
not that much fuel line from the tank to the motor in a Bay so checking 
the lines would take less than 5 min.

So Steve, as an early VW owner/mechanic, I'd advise you to not 
underestimate yourself.  Common sense almost always prevails.  Also, I 
would suggest you get more than one book.  My first vehicle (ever) was a 
non-running '74 Transporter that I got when I was 16.  The first book I 
bought was the Haynes manual.  I liked the book (read it cover to cover 
more than once!) and the only problem I have with the Muir book is that 
it does not include a whole lot of Type IV specific information.  Plus, 
the Haynes manual has a lot of pictures to help guide you.  I do not 
think you should treat any one source as 'know all information'; read 
the books, look at the websites, and talk to a lot of different people 
(thats why this list is here), weigh the advice and make good decisions.

Good luck with your bus!
