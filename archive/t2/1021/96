Subject: Bays and snow piling up on windshield

I'd like to hear from you cold-climate guys how you
deal with the buildup of snow at the bottom of the
windshield. My wiper keeps pounding the snow down and
compacting it until finally the wiper arm slips on the
shaft and then I really have troubles! This usually
happens when there is traffic and no pullout area!

My most recent solution was last Saturday, in very
heavy snowfall. I took my small ceramic heater and
placed it center of the dashboard, turned it on low.
The low setting is still kinda high at 800watts but it
sure worked well. My inverter is 1200 watt rating
continuous, and I was able to keep it all working at a
fast idle. I have a small hair drier that I think
would do a good job at less wattage. Ideally, about
400 watts I think would work without draining the
battery while driving.

I also have a small squirrel cage blower (about 3"
diameter) attached to a flexible shaft and to a
powerful magnet - that I can position directly over
the defroster vent and blow the hot air toward the
base of the windshield. That may work better now that
my heater is working more efficiently.

Any other ideas? -BaH
