It's a bolt-on.  IIRC, disks, calipers, spindles, and backing plates all
have to be changed.

The rear drums stayed the same, as did the proportioning valve and master
cylinder.

Be advised, the late brake system has exactly the same area pads and
pistons as the early system, so braking is exactly the same.  the only
difference is that the pads are thicker for longer wear.  If your early
bay system is working, run it and be happy.
