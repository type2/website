The metal lines do not require replacement unless they are corroded or
damaged.  The usual source of damage is loss of the grommet through the
front tin of the type 1 engine.  If the grommet is not present, the edge
of the tin can wear a hole in the line, resulting in a
just-about-unstoppable fire, since it will be both in the engine
compartment and underneath the bus at the same time.
