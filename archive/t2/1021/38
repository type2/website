James,

Go down to a local bicycle store and buy a brake/shift cable. They work
perfectly and you simply cut them to length. They have the little lead plug
that keeps the cable from sliding past the thermostat bung.

Subject: [T2] Thermostat cable busted

I walked behind my bus this morning to see how the thermostat looked, I
noticed that the heat was not getting hot the past few days during my 7 mile
trip to work, warm but not hot.

The cable was snapped of at the little arm, so now thermostating going on.

Do I need a special cable to replace this one?  

Can I rig something up at the hardware store?  Can somebody give me specs,
diameter and length, so I can go get it without taking my bus apart?  (sorry
to whine, in the next 24 hours I have a final, a cooking competition, a
going away party for a friend, and I still haven't packed, I need to
streamline the repair of my thermostat)

I am going on a road trip tomorrow to Florence, Oregon, it might snow on the
beach, I need enough heat to keep my breath from freezing on the glass.

Why do you think the cable broke in the first place?

Thanks,
James
