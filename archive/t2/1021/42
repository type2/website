Subject: a Kansas City mechanic

I just recently bought a '74 Westy, my first VW ever.  I'm in Kansas City and am looking for a
mechanic to adjust the valves and do some misc. repairs ... like help me find the fuel leak :( 
Looking through the list archives I found Vee Village (downtown) and reference to Brown's (Lee's
Summit) that I can't find a phone number on.  I'm in Olathe so anything south of the city would be
best, but any suggestions at all will be helpful.  Thanks, Steve
