Subject: Re: [T2] upgrading a 1971 brake system to a later bay system

Hi Michael,

The criteria for bus brakes has much more to do with cargo capacity  
than engine capacity. Why would an increase in HP require better  
brakes, if the original brakes were good enough already? Stopping  
from a given speed requires the same amount of braking regardless of  
how fast you were able to attain that speed. Change for change sake  
is not how VW does things in my experience.

If I already had a functional system in a 71 bay, I would spend my  
upgrade $$ elsewhere. Knowing that your entire system needs to be  
replaced certainly makes a difference to the advice you will get.

If it were me with your needs, I'd base my choices on future  
component availability, and go with the late-bay calipers for the  
front, and vanagon parts for the back. Stick with the early booster  
unit to avoid issues with component fit, and send it out for a  
rebuild if required.

There's a TON of info about the particulars in the archives.

Happy Trails,
