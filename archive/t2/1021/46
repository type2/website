Subject: Leaking Propane Valves

Since it's Friday... I have several Coleman propane
bottles and the valves just don't quite seal when I
remove whatever utensil I had mounted on them. I
thought it was from the cold weather, but now I'm
thinking I haven't bought a bottle for probably 8-10
years, so maybe they're just old. Any suggestions?
Yes, of course they're kept in my bus! Can't stand the
smell! -BaH
