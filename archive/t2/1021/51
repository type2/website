Subject: RE: Leaking Propane Bottle

Throw them away!!!  They contain enough propane to turn your Van into a very
dangerous device.  Take them to a proper recycle depot and buy new ones.
Those little green bottles are made very cheaply and their valves are meant
to be a "one time use, use them quick before they get any sort of rust or
contamination on them", product.  One of these days the safety people are
going to twig on to them and they are going to either disappear from store
shelves, or go up drastically in price.  I repeat, they will turn your van
into one of those devices that ignites and burns extremely quickly producing
a very strong concussion wave. Can't say the "B" word without seeing black
helicopters circling the neighbourhood shortly. ;-)
