Subject: Anyone around La Pine or Bend, Oregon?

Hello all,

I need to borrow someone's knowledgeable eyes to check out a car for  
a friend of mine. Yes, it is an a/c VW. We'll pay you for your  
efforts. I am in Portland and I simply do not have the time to do  
this myself and it needs to happen soon.

Suggestions for reliable local appraisers are welcome, too - I could  
not find any online.

Please p-mail me.

Thanks,
Marcus
