Subject: BUS --- I am done...

Y'all,



I know this isn't a "sales site" but I have gotten like 4,000 emails, and read damn near all of them, replied to a few, and been fascinated by all. I bought a 72 bus, KOMBI, for my son (who has since decided I am an ass and wants nothing to do with me). I have spent about 200 hours, as a newbie, learning the?tricks and getting grease in all of the innappropriate places. 



I have a 98% straght bus, with a brand new, rebuilt motor, that woudn't turn over (see previous posts) I finally discovered that the rings were too big ( by about .008"), machined the rings, and have since given up... My house is about to be foreclosed upon, my daughter needs books for college, and the other one is hooked on brand names. I NEED YOUR HELP. Please sell my unassembled bus... in decent shape, but mostly disassembled... I need at least $1K... DFW area... I love reading everyone's posts, and I will do it again, but right now I am F-ed $$$$ wise. ANY help is welcome.... Chris
