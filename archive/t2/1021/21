Subject: "Lines" of different types

Hello all.  Had the opportunity to read the fuel line links again, and I think
some of us figure, if it is running, it is ok!  But like others have seen, the
"BAD" lies undiscovered in that thinking, and rubber is rubber....no matter on
tires, windshields, fuel fixtures, et al!  If we pride ourselves on our
"rides", lets take the time it takes to digest a coffee, and check, or wait
for this,......replace all the fuel and engine lines and hoses, on our rides!
No, I am not on a box in a park...advocating!!!!  It is just the fact that our
rides are "ageing", and if we just enjoy the ride, and not the upkeep, ..we
should maybe switch to something else!  (sorry, just put out a fire in a
beautiful '77 Westy on the highway, and if not for my "nomenclature", fire
extinguisher, could have been a lot worse!!)  There are some "super" rubber
hoses out there, and sure if it doesn't look like it will fit, be creative,
and add some metal for bends etc.  Or if you have lotsa "pesos", use braided
hose!  Sorry, prolly the adrenalin "winding" down!!
