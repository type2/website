Subject: First drive for the turbobus

Tonight I drove my bus off of the ramps and out of my garage.  May not 
sound like much but it's the first time it has moved under it's own 
power in well over a year.  I looked in my logbook and the last time I 
put gas in it was October 2005!  Now it has three gallons of diesel in 
the tank.  :-)

I still have a TON of things to finish on it before it will be ready for 
  extended trips.  Most of the gauges are not hooked up, the muffler is 
suspended by coat hanger wire, the radiator fan thermostat is not 
working, the alternator and A/C compressor are not attached to the 
engine, and the throttle linkage is a mess, for starters.

It's a different driving experience ("a complete absence of torque" 
comes to mind), but I am just as enamoured with the bus as I was when I 
first drove it 20 years ago.  It still has a VW engine spinning 
underneath the rear deck and it still feels like an old friend to me. 
An old friend who just had a heart transplant.  I'm also glad to hear 
the ticking of the clock again, it was depressing to have a completely 
silent bus in a cold dark garage.

And ya know what?  After the test drive, I parked it outside for a few 
minutes, started it up to pull it into the garage and there were NO OIL 
SPOTS on the ground underneath it!  You have no idea how giddy I am over 
that.

I don't have any pics up of the (un)finished product yet, but I will try 
to get some posted in the next few days.  There are some text updates to 
the web page though.

Thanks again for the support of everyone here on the type2 list.  I 
couldn't have done this on my own.
