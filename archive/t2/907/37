Subject: No gas up hill

Hello Volks

I have been silence for a long time now due to many diferent things, but I am
still reading the list on regular basis to improve my knowlege from you all.
This time I calim for help my westy has a strange behaviour up hills, after a
short time up hill the bus start to fail as a fuel stravation, if the hill is
not to step or long I can manage my self to go over but in the other hand in a
very step or long hill the bus fail to dead. As soon I change the position
avery works well.
Somebody in the list know about this problem or maybe already experienced it?

As ususal thanks in advance.
