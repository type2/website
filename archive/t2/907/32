Subject: No start when hot (not starter)

Well, the high milage wonder will not maker it to Busses of the Corn-we 
will take the daughter's bus and a tent.  It has finally become 
unreliable- After running it 2 days ago a while to pump up the lifters, 
I turned it off- would not restart about 10 min later. Had no time, so 
checked it the next day (I had been working under the van and thought I 
bumped the starter, so checked the connections.  Started fine. Thought 
it was fixed.  Today we wanted to go out, so I warmed it up o 185 deg 
with a hammer on the pedal, then revved it a bit and turned it off.  15 
min later- no start!  Not a glimmer of it catching.  Verified it had 
fine spark. Took another car.  After coming home, and it had cooled to 
99 deg I tried it- started fine.  So I tried an experiment- warmed it up 
to 185, turned it off for ten seconds- started OK.  Waited one min- no 
start!  Ran back and sprayed starter fluid in intake, ran up front- 
started and ran OK. Turned it off, and on restart it sputtered like it 
would run for 2 sec and died.
Checked intake hoses and noticed I can spin the manifold boots, but 
don't see cracks. The y tee that feeds the brake line vac pulls too 
easily, as does the one feeding the aux air reg.  I'll see if it starts 
tomorrow when cold.  Obviously adding starter fluid  either enrichens it 
to start with air leaks, or lets it run a bit with no gas present- but 
that does not explain the running ok when cold?
