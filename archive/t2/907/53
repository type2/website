Heh. I was a scout leader too and have a bunch of tents now, including the
"Taj Mahal" that was given to me by a retiring leader. 3 room tent that sets
up in like 20 minutes.

I had a Westy tent and agree that it was a PITA to set up. When I got it I
set it up in the parking lot in broad daylight with all the time in the
world. Took 2 hours the first time, over an hour the second time.

I eBay'd it.

I just can't imagine getting to the site at 9pm (typical for my family) and
trying to set the thing up in the dark. Ugh.
