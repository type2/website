Subject: Bizarre flat spot off of idle on my 70 bug (OT for Buses)

Sorry to cross post, but it's all air cooled and I need all the brains on this
one. This concerns my 70 bug with stock 1200 engine and 28pict carb. This
engine was an option in Canada that year, like a European bug with swingaxle
etc. Never available in the States.
I have this large flat spot off of idle if you push the gas pedal too quickly.
If you push gently it will be ok. It is almost non-existent when the engine is
cold and first started and the auto choke is fully on. When it's warmed up
and the choke is fully open thoiugh, it will almost kill the engine if you
open the throttle even moderately quickly, you have to pump the pedal and it
will get past the bog.
Things I've done to try and rectify this:
1) Checked fuel pump - puts out good volume.
2) Replaced stock dizzy even though the vacuum advance was working fine put in
new  points, condenser, no help
so replaced it with a pointless ignition on a German 009, no help.
3) Checked timing, plugs etc.
4) Disassembled and rebuilt carb twice, accelerator pump is squirting fine.
5) Checked for vacuum leaks.

I am absolutely stumped on this, but the symptom of being pretty good at cold
with full choke, then awful when fully warm has to mean something. The only
thing I can think of is the carb mixture is off or the carb shafts are sloppy
enough to allow an air leak?? They do not feel sloppy compared to other carbs
I've checked though. I don't have another 28pict to swap out.
HELP!! Big clue is the cold to warm change???
