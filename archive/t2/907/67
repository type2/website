Subject: Check those fuel lines!

Yet another reminder to check those 30 year old fuel lines.  Here are
some kids who have did the "get a bus and drive across the country"
project.  They were doing it partly in promotion of the web service they
started.  The other day their bus was the victim of a nasty engine fire.

Their pictures are on their blog at http://blog.mykin.us and they are
not for the faint of heart.  I know I'm going to check my fuel lines and
make sure a fire extinguisher stays in the bus at all times.

Thinking of poor speedy meeting such a fate is too much to bear!
