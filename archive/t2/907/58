Hey Guys  I disagree with these guys on this  I can set mine up  in 20 min. 
and having the floor in it is a real blessing when it rains. I will  even say 
that I don't think these new tents will ever hold up as well as a real  westy 
tent will. Mine is 36 years old and still looks great. The extra room and  
floor is great. I have used mine with my splittie and vanagon and it works with  
either. My wife loves it cause then she can use her pee can in the tent at  
campouts instead of having to go outside.   later  mark Dearing
