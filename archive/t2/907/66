So one day I was checking out Castrol.com for no particular reason. I found a section saying "Deos your car have a great story? We'd like to hear it".  So I wrote in about my bus.

They put my 'testimonial' and 3 pictures of my bus on their website.

They also sent me a couple oil change rags, water bottle, pen, and T-shirt. Pretty cool.

Just wanted to share.
