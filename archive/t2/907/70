Subject: BOTC... Last minute details.

Hi Volks,

OK, we're getting down to the wire and I thought I'd post a few more  
final details about Buses Of the Corn.

T-Shirt sales are closed. There will be a FEW shirts available at the  
event.

The weather forecast is phenomenal. No rain, cool evenings and bright  
sunny days. Shorts and sandals will be recommended.

There's now a walmart, Canadian Tire and grocery store within 2 miles  
of the campground.


If you're coming, please note the following suggestions:

BRING:
- Firewood.
- Drinking Water. We will be bringing in 100 gallons for the group  
kitchen, but there won't be a tap onsite.
- Musical instrument to play at the campfire
- A 2-meter (six-and-a-half foot) leash for your dog, if you're  
bringing a dog. Dogs must be kept on a leash at all times.
- A suitable container (Red Cup?) for your adult beverage, should you  
choose to consume one. The rules at the group campsite prohibit alcohol.
- Stuff to sell at the swap meet, or cash if you're buying.
- A Shirt or other item for the Tie-Dye workshop
- An ingredient for the Breakfast Burritos and a side dish for the  
pot-luck dinner.
- $25 CA$H for the weekend, or $15 if you're only coming for a one- 
nighter.

DON'T BRING:
- Firearms or Fireworks.
- 110V Appliances. We have a bare minimum of electricity available  
and it is already allocated to medical priorities, group cooking and  
administrative use.  If you do have a medical need for electricity  
please mention it and you WILL be accomodated.

I'll be away from the interweb from now until Sunday, but I can be  
reached on cell-phone at (416) 735-1236.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
