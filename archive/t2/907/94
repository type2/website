It's just press-fit as you saw. Put it back in with a bit of threadlock on
the tube, then peen the pot metal of the carb around the fitting. Then make
a safety wire.

The same thing happened to me on the freeway once.

I used some single-strand wire as safety wire. Just wrapped it around the
screw opposite the fitting, then around the hose clamp on the fuel hose
that's on the fitting. The peening helped seal it and hold it, and the
safety wire made sure it wouldn't pop out again.
