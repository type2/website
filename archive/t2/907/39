Subject: Re: [T2] 8.5 volts at FI fuel pump - what's up??

Electrically speaking, that 4 volts has to be going
somewhere...

It could be a bad wire connection, a bad switch or
relay, or the pump itself like somebody else
mentioned.

1) Is the battery making at least 12V?

2) Is the electrical system grounded? The strap is
between the tranny and the frame on the driver side.

3) Is there 12V available at the lead on the pump?
(with the lead removed) 

4) Is the pump grounded correctly? I can't remember if
it grounds to the frame or has a ground back to the FI
system. Check for 12V across both pump leads with the
leads removed.

5) If you have less than 12V at the pump, statrt
back-tracking until you find out where the volts
change from 12 to 8.

Good Luck
