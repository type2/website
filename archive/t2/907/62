> So what listees will be heading out?

I'm driving down from Portland, OR. I'm planning on leaving Wednesday
morning. I am a little torn about whether I should get a swap spot to
sell a few things which would be good, but I will be stuck in my spot
and would love to roam around and check everything out since this will
be my first time.

I'm heading down in my 65, which I have been slowly getting to a
driver state in the past few years, seems like the first couple years
were spent just gathering parts and staring at it, but then when I
finally got started it went together pretty fast, so this trip will be
a huge thing for me.

I would love to meet up with anyone who will be traveling to the show,
I have a delivery to make in grass valley, and will be meeting a
friend from phoenix somewhere near the goal line, but other than that
it will be just me by myself the whole way.

I am sooooo looking forward to this trip, I can't wait to finally meet
the SV2 family and others.

later,

Matthew
