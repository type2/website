Subject: 77 electrics dead in Montreal

Hello from Montreal Canada!

 

Total lights out on my 77 Westy.

 

Had it for 4 years. Same battery as when I bought it. 

How old? Don't know...

Battery took a lot of abuse the 1st two years until I beat the dreaded Hot Start problem by installing a Bosch Relay.

Last summer and this: no problems.

 

Until 2 days ago. 

3 weeks without moving, starts right up, 40 minute drive, no heat wave here, normal temp.

Daytime= no lights.

 

Got to my destination. Shut down for a moment. Then wouldn't start: familiar"old days" very slow crank. Felt like those "hot start" days. Push started it: fine. Re-parked, 3 hours to cool down. Started back up fine.

Drove back towards home. Dinner stop. 2 hours. Cold again on restart. Vroum right away.

Head for final destination, 20 minutes. 

Dark= lights on.

Park it. Try a restart: sloooow again. No start.

Next evening: hit the key: Vroum! BUT Then 2 seconds later: abrupt engine stop. No lights, nothing works.

 

This morning: still nothing: check battery = 12.49 volts...

Do the "shake-any-wire-you-see" thing. No change.

Bring out the charger, set it a "boost/start/70 amps" hit the key = Vroum.

 

Leave it on fast charge for 75 minutes: check voltage= 12.85 (what???)

Look at the charger: voltmeter needle shows NO activity, idiot light at  "Off/full voltage" (at 12.85??? what is this?)

BUT Try the key: Vroum

Leave the engine running, go back and check the idle voltage at battery= now 13.65 (what???)

Shut down the engine.

Unplug the charger.

Read the battery: 13.49...

 

Crank it, no charger attached

Engine starts and  runs fine.

Alternator light come on at crankup and goes off within 1-2 seconds.

Use voltage tester on battery while engine runs: shows variation from 13.60 to 13.85 at idle...

Alone so can't hold probes while throtling up by hand so don't know what voltage would be when engine revs up.



Shut down. Re-attach the battery charger. NOW it's charging...

 

Any comments?

I'm going to put in a new battery but I'm heading out for a long trip so I want to cover any other possibilities...

 

And oh...4-way flashers don't work: where should I start on those?

(*Yes, as soon as I'm off this I'll check the archives on 4-ways)

 

Thanks in advance
