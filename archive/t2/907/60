ok so i found the parts locally well sort of but close enough that i wil be able to do the work now this weekend...

  seems to just have a couple of nicks in the side but nothing wrong with the disc or the bearings.... 
   
  if it is to bad i gotta get one tomorrow when i got get the other parts....?
  but i am looking at it thinking it looks fine... the holes on the sides(hanger holes) also look fine...
   
  i still plan to wire the super hooks on though just in case so this  wont happen again....
   
  just need reassurance the TO beaing looks ok...
  thanks
  chai

The good ones also have thicker material in the forks. Instead of a
little divot on the front (FIF) side of the "hook" there is a hole with
material ahead of it. This stops the hooks from breaking off at the
"divot" when they wear.

You're right about the welding, though. If I pull a throwout fork out and
it isn't completely welded I will weld it up. However, if the hooks are
worn the fork is trash unless you can weld up the fork a bit and reshape
the ends.
