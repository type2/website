Subject: Re: [T2] 8.5 volts at FI fuel pump - what's up??

Has anyone else heard of something like that??  A
black ground wire coming
out of the ECU??  Where would it normally connect to??

I don't have the book handy, but I recall a ground
wire from the ECU harness (not the ECU itself) that
connects to a 3-prong spade (male) connector that is
attached under a bolt on the top of the engine
case...IIRC it's pretty hard to get to, but if you
shine a bright light under and around the intake
manifold box you should be able to find it.  Mine was
very corroded and the connector was almost separated
from the wire, so it's certainly something to check.
