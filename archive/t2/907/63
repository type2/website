hey jamie  that's not quite  fair  :)   I am glad  you like my method of 
taking it down. works real well and gives it time to dry  out on the bottom.  I 
use an old army duffle bag that belonged to my Dad to  carry and store the tent 
in. It is the only thing I have seen that is tougher  that the westy tent  :)  
later  Mark D   PS  wish  I could come up there and camp with you guys  tell 
Greg and gord and marge  HI for me
