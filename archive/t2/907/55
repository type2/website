Subject: Re: [T2] OEM tent value?

Eagle Scout here...two bronze palms, even. Yes, it's true. I have the
overseas badges and Camporees and  World Jamborees to prove it.

I have had many people recommend the Bus Depot tents.

I only resist because I like OEM.

And then I realized that a 1969 Microwave oven or Laptop or Macintosh
(HAHAHAHAHAHA...no such thang!) or spark plug may not be practical.

So I sit on a precipice...

I want the OEM circus tent because it is COOL...but I think about a
newer tent because it is probably FAR, far better.

FAR BETTER.

But less cool. Way less cool.

NOTE: Does cool keep the bugs and rain out? If so, I'll pay the premium.
