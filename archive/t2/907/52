Hi Volks,

As a period accessory, the original side tent rocks.

But as a camping tent, it's nowhere near as good an investment as the  
modern side tents. I have heard it referred to as the "Divorce Tent",  
as it's so heavy and cumbersome to set up.

I bought the $200 Bus Depot side tent when it as introduced back in  
2004 and have been extremely happy with it. This past week I took it  
on a Boy Scout camp *without* my bus and found it to be extremely  
comfortable and a great place to live for a few days, easily the  
equivalent of the eureka tents that most of the other leaders were  
camping in.  Having a floor in the sleeping cabin only made it very  
convenient. And since the tent isn't an antique I don't have to worry  
about devaluing it with regular wear and tear.
