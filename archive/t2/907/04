I want the big "3" to succeed. I want manufacturing to remain in America 
so we retain the jobs but for some reason GM and Ford can't seem to 
build anything but the big SUVs and they like to build a large number of 
their cars and those cars' parts overseas. The Asians can build cars 
here but the domestics have trouble. Maybe the domestics are trying to 
go broke gracefully so they can ditch the UAW and come back with a 
vengence. We work with union shops and while they can be good for their 
members, they are also very tough to work with.

Personally I don't really care what is on the new car lots b/c we can't 
afford to buy them. We buy well used cars and then keep them going...
