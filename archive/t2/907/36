Hey People,

Just returned from a quick camping trip up in Pumpkin
II on Palomar mountain...finished up a brake hose
replacement project on Sunday, and off we went!

Anyway, after a year (or two?) of distractions, I'm
back scheming to get P-II repainted.  I'll need a new
windshield lip, battery tray, and some surface rust
prep for the undercarriage. I'm going to do some
restoration work on camper parts (including the top)
myself.

Does anyone know of a shop in San Diego county that
knows buses? Since I may be looking at a bare metal
inside and out job, I'm really hoping to find someone
who knows how to dissassemble and re-assemble a bus
correctly!  If not in SD, then maybe the LA area?

Also, any ideas on what something like this would
cost...I want all the rust prepped. I probably will
want to prep/paint the interior also, depends on
additional cost.

I do not have the facilities to do prep/paint myself. 

Thanks!
