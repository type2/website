Wayne,

You absolutely must verify that the senders/gauges are actually right!
Or at least close enough for government work.

See my testing results on CHT senders/gauges on ratwell.com
here http://www.ratwell.com/technical/VDOGauges.html

Yes, you desperately need the rest of the sealing parts...especially 
around the spark plugs.  Stick your hand in there, rev the engine up and 
feel how much air comes out.

If you have a friend with an IR non contact thermometer it might be 
usefull when you think it is really hot to shoot the oil filter and see if 
it really reads 230 degrees.

I really hate it when gauges lie to me.

My standard 78 bus with A/C on at 99 F degrees reads 325 to 375
on the 3/4 head at 75 mph up or down hill.

Is my gauge lying....I think so....maybe in the opposite direction 
than yours!

Your first sentence below about it sounding and running great should be a 
clue.

Cheers, dave
