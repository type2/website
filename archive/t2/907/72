Subject: hot meat

Hey guys.  I went to my favorite store for wanna-be chefs like  myself (Mia Cucina) and they didn't have long-stemmed (11"-12")   meat thermometers.  Can anyone advise where I might find  one.  I'm going to stop by Chattanooga Restaurant Supply the next  time I'm down at Lockhart VW,  (practically neighbors)  but I  don't think they have them either.  
  
  Can anyone point me to an online source.  Or a brand/part  no.?  I'll trade shipping charges for sales tax any day.   Thanks....KR
