The good ones also have thicker material in the forks.  Instead of a
little divot on the front (FIF) side of the "hook" there is a hole with
material ahead of it.  This stops the hooks from breaking off at the
"divot" when they wear.

You're right about the welding, though.  If I pull a throwout fork out and
it isn't completely welded I will weld it up.  However, if the hooks are
worn the fork is trash unless you can weld up the fork a bit and reshape
the ends.
