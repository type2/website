Subject: Re: [T2] OEM tent value?

Cliff asked:


 Can anyone help me with figuring out the value of a tent I had on my '74
bus that came with it. It's kind that attaches to the side.  I'd like to
get rid of it but have no idea of its value.  Thanks in advance!

It depends on the condition of it and if you have all the poles for it.
Any holes in the canvas?
Is the rubber that connects to the drip rail nice?
Are any of the rubber bands broken?

For a price comparison, they are on the Samba and eBarf.

This one is billed as a 'split bus tent' but it has a floor, so it is a bay tent:

This one is set up wrong! The rubber bands go OVER the bars and hook into the grommet. They do not hook onto
the bar.

I'll give you $50 for it :)
