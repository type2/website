Subject: Re: [T2] hot meat

I have a couple of those...and have used them with wiring extensions
from radio shack to actually have them inserted in a T1 engine while 
driving.

I suspect you could *gently* staighten it out...but then use a brass tube 
and jb-weld....no welding to make an extension for it.

I also suspect that you could add a piece of round metal(washerlike) on 
the top to act as a positive insertion stop as well.

I have seen washers that look very like a cup that would probably fit 
well...

Then you could mark it and use it as a regular oil level stick as well as 
an oil temp gauge.....the batteries last about 2 years.

And you can set the main unit to beep once a certain temperature is 
reached(overheating temp gauge with warning signal!).

Cheers, dave

 Hey guys.  I went to my favorite store for wanna-be chefs like  myself (Mia Cucina) and they didn't have
 long-stemmed (11"-12")   meat thermometers.  Can anyone advise where I might find  one.  I'm going to stop by
 Chattanooga Restaurant Supply the next  time I'm down at Lockhart VW,  (practically neighbors)  but I  don't
 think they have them either.
