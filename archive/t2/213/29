this might not be 100% correct, but here goes. My bus is a type 4 but
my beetle is a t-1 engine (duh). I believe what these holes are are
the heat riser that is part of the single port manifold. top side
connects to the manifold, & the bottom side is where the muffler has
those goofy looking heat risers. I'm not sure exactly how the bus
muffler hooks up, but this might be some lead.
