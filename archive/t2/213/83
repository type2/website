position, but the pump wire (red/white) is on terminal 50 per your post.  ?"


1. Something is not per the stock schematic. If double relay pin 86a is at 
or near 12 volts the pump should run. The pump wire from double relay pin 
88d is red and blue.

2.Both solenoid pins 30 and 50 have red and white wires attached.

3.The hot start relay applies power to pin 50 directly from pin 30. It is 
activated by the red and white wire from the ignition switch (position 
3)that formerly was hooked to pin 50 (in stock configuration).

4. If you run the pump with an external 12 v source will the bus start?
