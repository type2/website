Re having a "stock" foam cushion over the spare tire well in the 71
Westy-

I had a European 71 a serviceman sold over here in the US- exact same
deal, a fiberboard that clipped in and a cushion with matching vinyl. 
The tire was mounted on the front.  Does your Westy have a cot on top or
the European foamboard that hinges in the front and goes up with the
top?
