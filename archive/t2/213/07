How many do you want?

<www.mcmaster.com> part number 3846K6 $7.24.
Hose barb, $.95 from NAPA (bought one this afternoon.)
1/4" fuel hose, $.72/ft.
hose clamp, another $.75,
fancy pasteboard box and blow-molded insert, $50.
Total cost, $60. ;o)

(We're talking a piece of test equipment here.  It's not going to be a
permanent installation. Based on my experience, it'll get used about 
once a year. Maybe less often. They're cheap enough, that at my house, 
each bus has it's own. Except the Diesel, but only because NAPA hasn't 
got the 3,000 psig gauge in stock.)
