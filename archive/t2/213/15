Jamie,

What is the possibility that the hose part that is supposed to allow
incoming outside air to the booster is plugged.

Couldn't find a picture and it's been a few months since I did mine.

If the booster can't suck some outside air someplace, then it's going to 
have to try and suck past the seal in the master cylinder.

10-20psi of suction all the time is going to make something give 
somewhere.

Remember the post where someone had ice/snow blocking theirs?

Cheers ,dave
