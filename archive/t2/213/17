I don't know, but I don't think it's something you have to worry=20
about.  The pushrod is constrained by the master cylinder.

Hmmm... I don't think mine was that way, but it has been several years=20
since I removed the master cylinder.

Unfortunately, brake fluid is corrosive and it is very likely that the=20
inside of your booster is now rusted.  If it works at all now, it likely=20
won't continue working for long.  I think your best course of action is to=

replace both the master cylinder (to be sure it won't continue to leak into=

the booster) and the booster.

Without removing the booster, the only way I can think of would be with a=20
siphon.

I had no problems understanding you - your English is very good.
