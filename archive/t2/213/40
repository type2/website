Subject: Dixie Bus T Shirts

Anyone thinking they want a commemorative T-Shirt from Ohio's greatest bus
bash, the deadline is Thursday.

Cost is $15 per, an extra $3 for the XXX sizes.  Kids are more than welcome,
and we'll work on that cost.

I do not expect to order extra, meaning there will not be any available at
the venue.

Please p mail (someone tell me what the "p" in pmail means)

Respectfully,
