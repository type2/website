As you are finding out, the 68 system is one-year-only. Most all the uppers
are now crystallized and self-destruct when you touch them. You may want to
look for a 69 or 70 and get the upper, lower, and the tube connecting them.
You will need all 3 pieces. You will need to modify the upper mount.
These parts are more readily available but the material is the same. So pick a
good upper......
