I would say it's time to pull the motor and make sure that your flywheel and 
pressure plate are still attatched to your crankshaft!  Actually, it could 
be the pressure plate is shot, and won't apply enough pressure to mate the 
engine and transmission properly.  Your disc could have exploded as well.
