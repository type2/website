Circuit 15 is key on power.
Circuit 30 is key off power.
Circuit 50 is starter engage power.

Circuit 30 is the big post on the starter solenoid.
The 2 spades on the top right are both circuit 50. It does not matter if you
put the crank signal wire from the ignition switch on the left or right one.
They are tied together.

The lower one is not used.
