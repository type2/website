I'm with Chuck Watson, verify the battery first. Does it have at lease 12.6 
volts at rest with no load?? No!!! Charge it and if it won't take a charge 
and a load test and rebound properly, replace it.

Are you using a FLAPS peg hook cheapy VOM?? Trash it and get one of 
reliable, durable quality that will save you thousands of dollars in the 
future verifying all things electrical with precise facts.

Once you have ruled out the source of voltage as the cause (the battery), 
then do the voltage drop tests others have outlined to find the weakness 
that prevents you from getting the voltage to the pump.

(All of this presumes that the battery case and terminals are clean. If 
they are not, well, that's what kills batteries and alternators and 
starters more than anything else, cross cell amperage flow through the 
grime on the top. Purely and simply, lack of reasonable maintenance.)
