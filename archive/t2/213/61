Subject: Re: [T2] won't start still - help!

I'm going to throw these possibilities in because it is a very rare
problem that is difficult to diagnose.
The VW ignition switch, the white electrical part, has a fused portion.
Very infrequently this fuse which is simply a drop of solder will break
connection. It can be re soldered but there is a tiny spring that is
difficult to reset in the switch after it had been repaired.
On one rare occasion I went through the entire testing process and found
a bad rotor arm after about ten hours of frustration, I installed a
complete (good used) new FI and ignition system and the only part that I
didn't replace was the rotor arm. New rotor installed. At last it
started.
VW starter solenoids are a very accurate fit between the plunger and
magnetic portion, I've found slight but enough friction caused by oil and
clutch dust (magnetic) to render them ineffective. Just a cleaning will
fix the solenoid.
