Subject: Louver window screen frame plastic clip thingies

Sorry for the "technical" subject. I'm trying to find out where I can order
those little plastic clips hold the screens in place on louvered windows.
Some of mine have disintegrated. Anybody have a part number for these
things. 

How do other people hold in their screens on their louvered windows?
