Subject: Westy sink question

I recently (finally) started to strip the interior of 
my "old" 72 Westy. After I pulled out the sink/icebox 
cabinet and set it on milk crates in the garage, I was 
trying to figure out to remove the tank from the 
cabinet.It appears to me that the tank, the fill tube 
and the part where the cap screws on are all one piece. 
I gave a gentle upward tug on the threads to see if the 
tube pulled out of the tank and broke them off(D'oh). 
So, Is the filler assembly all one piece? I would think 
not because the cap is bigger than the hole in the sink 
top. Is the fill pipe just stuck really good to the 
tank? The Bus Boys catalog shows a fill pipe that fits 
68-79. Do I just cut off the broken one? Anyone have any 
wisdom to offer.
