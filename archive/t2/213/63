Subject: Re: [T2] My servo is full of brake fluid!!

I have found that the easiest way to get brake fluid out of the booster
is.
Take a turkey baster ($1.99) with a piece of hose to extend it and suck
the brake fluid out of the booster.
In addition I take some standard rubbing alcohol and using a coat hanger
with a cotton swab (old T shirt piece) squeezed onto an end loop, I clean
the remaining brake fluid out.
