Subject: RE: [T2] Shifting poll

I'm probably jinxing myself but I've just completed installing a rebuilt
Corvair 2.7 liter engine with aftermarket cam and associated trans in my 69
bus. Here's a website that is supposed to show the theoretical HP and torque
numbers. http://home.hiwaay.net/~langford/corvair/2700_030_OT10.jpg I
haven't verified them yet. I plan to attend the HCBF this weekend. Its
interesting, I shift from 3rd to 4th at about 45 or 50 mph.
