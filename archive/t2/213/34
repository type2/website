Let me tell you a little story. Keep in mind BRAKES!

Went to a small VW carshow in Gatlinburg, TN one year. saw a GT-40 (I 
think) kit car built on a VW pan. It had MUCH HP and I think it may have 
even had a Corvair or Porsche 6 cylinder - I really can't remember.

Near the end of the show he got ready to go and motored his way out to the 
side road and LAUCHED it towards the traffic light at the end of the short 
side street.

Near the end he hit the brakes and realized that he might not have enough 
brakes. So did the split window Beetle he was aimed at.

Luckily the light changed, the splitty hit the gas, and the crash was averted.

It wasn't so much a lack of brakes as it was a lack of weight to make those 
tires grip.

So as you add horsepower, add some brakes too.
