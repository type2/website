12.4, guess I need a little charge.

It's not a fluke 9,000,000 oscilloscope, but it's a GB (elec products manf) that has served me reliably as an alarm tech./electrican. 20.00.

It's 12.4 as far as the solenoid, but when it comes back from the ignition switch, I'm down to 8vdc.

(All of this presumes that the battery case and terminals are clean. If they are not, well, that's what kills batteries

Just replaced my battery cable and cleaned the posts.

I guess high resistance from the solenoid to the ignition switch and switch to coil. Seem like a lot of stuff gets supplied by this circuit. (coil, pump, ecu)
