Subject: Shifter adjustment

After reading the "Shifting Problem" posts and replies, I went to check the
type2 library because I'm having shifting problems also, but my problem is a
little different.  Since installing the new clutch I have been having
intermittent trouble shifting into first and second, it's almost impossible
at times, and when I shift into reverse the bus grinds or jumps into gear.
I was wondering if the instructions below could be used for a 76 Westy as
well... and if so... should I just try different positions of the shifter
base until I get it figured out? (since it says the base moved forward
favors 2nd, backwards favors 1st, and I'm having problems with both...)

It's easy. On your 71, at the shifter loosen the bolts fore and aft of
it--loosen, don't take them out. Moving the shifter base towards the front
favors engagement of 2, 4th and Reverse, moving towards the rear 1st and
3rd. Once adjusted, retighten the bolts.

Make sure however that the shift coupling square headed screws are properly
seated and that the tranny nose mount is secure..


Thanks!
