Subject: Buses Of the Corn T-Shirts & Burritos

Hi Volks,

I have updated the Buses Of The Corn website with new information about 
T-Shirts and the Saturday morning Breakfast Burritos.

For T-shirt info see http://www.pottsfamily.ca/VW_type2/BOTC/T-
shirts.html
I will be accepting mail-orders but I need orders placed ASAP. Shirts 
will cost $10US / $15CDN for Adults, $6.50US / $10CDN for kids. Shirts 
can be picked up at the event, or will be shipped for $5/shirt.

For Breakfast info go to

To get the big picture, including pics from last year go to

The event is going to be well attended with buses from across Ontario 
and as far south as West Virginia. We'll have buses from the early 60s 
right up to 2002, and every decade between will be represented. We're 
also setting up a very cool Frisbee-Golf Course. Sunday we'll be 
finishing up with a carabus to the Great Canadian Bug Show.

Hope to see you there!
