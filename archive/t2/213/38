Subject: Re: [T2] roof wrack

Gentlepersons-
                       Anybody out there with a Barriecrafter roof rack, model
Unisport, that has an extra outside clip for the rain gutter? This model
will not fit a type 2 roof but I plan to adapt it. Picked it up at a yard 
sale;
but missing the clip...The local ski shops only sell sets for more than I 
paid for the whole shebang. Any skiers with a broken rack wanna sell off 
the piece I need?
TIA
