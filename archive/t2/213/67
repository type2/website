We stopped messing about with pumps for the same reasons. We carry a few 
gallons of distilled water from Wal-Mart, about 65 cents each, and pitch 
the empty jugs. We skip pumping it, and just pour the water from the jug 
when needed. Simple can be good.

westy with a "handy pump" .......snip...Does anyone have any good
experiences with a pump for this application? ....snip....
