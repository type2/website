This part is 025-133-199.  It connects the oil breather hose to the s-boot.

I bought a replacement from Bus Boys and you can see that a plastic item on
the left replaces the original metal piece.  I think the plastic piece has a
slightly larger diameter.

I'm wondering now if I can fit a 1" hose there instead of the 22mm hose that
tore.  The other end where the oil breather connects still needs a 22mm
hose. :-(

I also bought a replacement hose elbow, part 022-129-637 that connects the
aux air regulator to the hose to goes to the s-boot.  The replacement piece
is really tight.  I ripped it trying to get it.  Has anyone has this
problem?  The original piece looks like it stretched considerably.
