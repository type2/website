Subject: Re: [T2] Shifting problem

Casey:

Two things:  first try shifting into 2nd first then go
up inot first.  That should help short term.

When you get a minute you should try the shifter
adjustment.  Go to the type 2 archive and search for
shifter adjustment.  

I had similar issues and a quick adjustment made it
lots better.
