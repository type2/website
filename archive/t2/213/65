Subject: Re: [T2] Westy spare tire cover cushion (Was re-doing Westy interior)

I've got the one person fold out canvas cot up top.  I had the tire on the
front too, but took everything off when I painted, and put an emblem
back on
instead.  I've been on the list for over three years now, and am still
amazed at your 233k!  Maybe the cushion was some sort of westy option or
something. who knows?
