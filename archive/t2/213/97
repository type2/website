Works exactly the same as on any of the type IV powered fuel injected buses.
The oil vapor comes out the breather box, through a hose and back into the
plenum just downstream of the air filter where it get sucked back in through
the intake valves and burned.

There were at least 2 different styles of breather boxes on 914's.  One
required you to pop the wire bail and remove the whole box to fill the oil,
the other has a nice little neck with a screw-on cap (much easier to use).
I'm not certain, but I suspect the 70-73 motors had the removable box and
the 74-76 had the scew-on cap style.
