Blake,

Try a marine or RV store. They should have a water pump for this
purpose. West Marine is one place I know that has them
(www.westmarine.com). Im sure if you looked you could find one for
cheaper than they sell them though.

I have replaced the water pump for the sink in my 75
westy with a "handy pump" found in a camper that was
given to me by a friend. This pump is the same that is
offered by bus depot for my 75. Well, the motor
turned, but the pump didn't pump. I thought what the
heck, it was free and all, so I pitched it and ordered
the same pump from BD. After a couple of months of
use, it began leaking water into the motor and
eventually failed (poor quality pump, or just bad
luck? I don't know). Does anyone have any good
experiences with a pump for this application? I have
looked for another 12 volt pump online, but all I find
is expensive ones that can drain a pool in 25 minutes.
For my westy, I need very little gpm/psi and I figure
there must be many inexpensive options out there. Any
insight from anybody.
