Subject: Coil Failed

I was driving my bus home last night when the engine quit (1600 DP stock).  I determined that there was no spark from the coil to the distributor.  I went home and grabbed a spare coil, drove back to the scene of the crime and installed it.  Started right up.

I've never had a coil fail before.  Is this common or could something else have caused the coil to fail?
