Subject: 79 CAMPER FOR SALE 

I have a 1979 VW camper for sale . It's a poptop , 2.0 engine , everything
works . New Alternator , new tires , new front brakes . The engine leaks oil
but I drive it everyday . It's just that I don't have the time to work on it
. I'm asking $1600.00 . I live in Atlanta Ga. Thanks folks .
