Subject: My servo is full of brake fluid!!

I can´t get my front disc brakes to work, I thought that the master cylinder 
was faulty.

But when I removed the master cylinder I found that the servo had fluid all 
the way up to the master cylinder.

When I tried to empty the servo I saw that the master cylinder pushrod in 
the servo started to sink in to the servo as it should.

So maybe the brake fluid blocked some importend holes in the servo. My first 
questin is how far should the master cylinder pushrod sink in to the servo.

My pushrod sinks in so that it comes parallel to  the bolts that hold the 
servo. Is that enough? When I reinstalled the master cylinder I found out 
that the pushrod pushes the front cylinder a little bit even when no brakes 
are applied.

I think that there still is fluid in my servo becose I can hear it but I 
can´t get it out.

Have anyone had the same problem and could this be the reason why my front 
brakes doesn´t work? How can I remove all the fluid?

Please answer becose I can´t find any information about this in my repair 
books or the internet.
Hope you understood my english (it is not easy to explain this in a other 
languge)

I forgot to tell you that the servo booster works fine(the pedal sinks a bit 
when I start the engine)

//Johan
