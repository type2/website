Subject: Determing Tranny Age

Is there a way to determine whether I've got a -'70 or a '71-only =
transmission and clutch without having the engine out?  Are there any =
casting numbers, stamped serial numbers, or other visual clues which =
would help me determine what I need before I tear into everything?  It =
would be nice to have all the parts on hand rather than pulling the =
engine and then placing an order for clutch parts.
