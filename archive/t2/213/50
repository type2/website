The last Handi-Pump I personally used was in my '77 Westy. It was about 2
years old when I sold the Westy and it still worked; couldn't say how long
it lasted after that.  I get very few back, so they generally do seem to
last at least reasonably long.

However, there are two issues that can cause problems. First, if water
freezes inside the pump it can damage the pump when it expands, so if you're
in a climate where the weather goes much below freezing for very long, it
may pay to remove the pump for the winter unless you do winter camping.
This happend to my original pump one winter, but the identical replacement
pump made it through two winters without incident; go figure.  Secondly, I
got a bit of a drip from the junction between the pump and the tank, even
after tightening a hose clamp as tightly as I felt I should.  So I put a
plumbing o-ring from a hardware store inline, which solved the problem. I
have had a couple of pumps come back to the shop that were claimed to leak,
but did not leak when tested; I'd suspect that the leak was actually from
the junction between the pump and the tank, as with mine, and the water was
simply dripping onto the pump, causing the owner to blame the pump.

One problem with buying a larger pump (besides cost) is that most of them
deliver too much volume, so you run out of tank water quickly. Even on my
Handi-Pump, I ended up choking off the hose to the faucet just slightly with
a hose clamp to reduce water flow and make my supply last longer.
