Subject: [T2] Shifting problem

Having trouble getting the car to go into first. I have to push really hard 
to the left then push up to get it in gear. Wondering if anyone could help a 
frustrated bus driver that keeps getting honked at out. I have messed with 
the plate before under the shifter but it didnt seem to fix. Maybe its the 
coupler?

Thanks Casey
