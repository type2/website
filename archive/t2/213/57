Subject: Fw: [T2] My servo is full of brake fluid!!

 I had this problem a couple of years ago.

 Replace the master cylinder.

 Remove the old cylinder (this is easy).  Get about 3 feet of plastic
tubing.
 Push as much of it that you can into the bottom of the servo and then cover
 the end with your finger and then pull it out to ground level but leave the
 servo end of the tube at the bottom of the servo.  When you remove your
 finger the old brake fluid will siphon out into a container.  When all the
 brake fluid is siphoned out you can install the new master brake cylinder.

 Good Luck
