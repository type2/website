Dave B. says:
 
>You really *must* get 12v at the two wires that feed the fuel pump.  Maybe the ground wire needs cleaning?

I think so too, did clean the ground, voltage still bad. But this comes from terminal 15 at coil, via double relay, where I'm only seeing 8vdc for starters, so I think the problem's more toward the battery side of the circuit. Battery shows 12.4.

>Check voltages to devices with them *not* connected.

Checked pump like this, 6-8volts.

>Check your ground from the battery....check voltage between battery terminals(literally) and the + terminal to a close clean ground on the bus....same????

Will check.

>the 30/50 pin problem would make the fuel pump not work at all, not have low voltage.

It gives the pump voltage during key postition #2 when it should only have it at #3. See Bentley fuel injection chapter, page 8, "NOTE" at top of right column.

Thanks to Dave Bolen, who's been answering my questions religiously.

Billy
