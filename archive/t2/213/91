I think this is more of a fine tuning adjustment. I've tried this method on my 76, but it doesn't solve 1/3 and 2/4 problems. Check your front shift rod bushing (under bus at front of shift rod). Some would say change your rear shift rod bushings (involves dropping tranny and many say it doesn't work).

Check the squirrel cage thing at the rear end of the shift rod where it connects to the tranny, deteriorates over time. Make sure tranny nose is secure.

Later,

Billy
