Subject: Re: [T2] gas stabilizer v. ethanol

I think that is flat out 100% wrong, even opposite reality.  Drygas doesn't do
much since the advent of significant ethanol (well sort of as ethanol drygas
(yellow can HEET) was never as effective at absorbing and keeping water in
suspension as isopropyl dry gas (red can HEET)) as the ethanol does keep some
water in suspension.  Adding drygas (the yellow particularly) is just adding
more ethanol.  Stabil or your favorite stabilizer actually works to help when
the ethanol has sucked up water in the tank to keep the gas from being as
volatile, stops varnish, etc.  Oddly I (and everyone in AK) still run plenty
of isopropyl drygas as well in the winter, but for storage definitely Stabil. 
They do say with ethanol gas, in a full vented tank (classic car or most old
small engines) that Stabil is only good for 3-4 months probably, so Chris is
right, draining is most effective, but is a PITA of course.

The proprietor of the small engine shop working over my big mower

doesn't and, so, I should run any engine dry rather than use gas
stabilizer.  Since I use gas stabilizer in my bus before hibernating
it for the winter, this brings the question to this list.
