Right -

The seats WITHOUT the adjustable / folding / floppy arms are about 1 1/2 to
2 inches LOWER than the later / newer seats.

Best to grab a set of the early Vanagon seats if you can.  Mostly, if the
fanny part is OK, you can re-do the back with some new horsehair material.

You can get this horsehair material from Jo-Ann Fabrics in my neck of the
woods.  [Oh, the fanny part is a foam cushion insert, so it may be a little
loose at the edges after 25 - 30 years.  No springs in the fanny part.]

Oh, well, youse guys are driving me out to the local yards again....
