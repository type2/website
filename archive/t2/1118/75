Hi Bob,

Are we talking about the same site? HCBF moved two years ago. Last year 
I didn't really look that closely at the accessibility but I will be 
sure to check that out this time around. The place is a bit, ummm... 
"rustic" in some aspects.

The canoe launch site we used is very primitive; I will also ask if 
there's an alternative that could be used.
