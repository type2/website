The clipped off end looks like a 1/4" diameter barrel with a width 
groove machined in it. It's about 1/4" of an inch long as I remember 
from about 15 years ago. (Seriously that long ago?!?!!? Where did the 
time go?)

The stepped half-moon part you mentioned is part of the choke assembly. 
If the butterfly you mentioned is at the top of the carb then it is the 
choke plate. If it is at the bottom of the carb it is the throttle plate.

I'd recommend that you find a copy of the Muir book and read through the 
carb tuning procedure. Even if you don't make a single change the 
familiarity with the crab can be useful in case something goes clunk 
while you are traveling.
