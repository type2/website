been using the compufire for years and haven't had to adjust the timing 
at all.  However, I just recently switched to (true) electronic ignition 
with the MegaSquirt, and that blows everything else out of the water :)

Btw, what you're looking for is an electronic points replacement unit, 
not electronic ignition.  With electronic ignition, the timing is 
controlled electronically instead of mechanically.
