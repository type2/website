Don't remember what year/model you have, but all of
this sounds eerily.........NORMAL... for an air cooled.

First is water vapor/water mostly from condensation.  Depending
on use and climate, there will be more or less of this.

Next: Since I doubt there is a coolant leak, probably just the transition
from 
overrich "choke on" mixture to relatively "clean" burning.  Again
depending on use and climate, this could be substantial or
inconsequential.

The blue smoke is also pretty normal as the engine starts to "tighten"
with heat
and what oil made it to the combustion chambers after the last drive
burns off.  
With any air cooled engine (especially boxer type) there is going to be
some smoke
during initial warmup. 

All sounds good to me, if the engine is running good, not making
unusual noises and has "normal" power.

Christ lays opportunities to serve him at our feet every day.  
We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
