That assumes stock dizzy installed properly.

Likely the dizzy was not properly oriented when last installed. Pull 
the valve cover on the 1-2 side. Turn engine clockwise while watching 
the no. 1 exh valve lifter as it opens and closes. Then continue 
turning until the pully notch is alinged with the 0 scale. That is 
TDC No. 1. Turn the motor crank pully counter clockwise 180 degrees 
to TDC No. 2, counterclockwise 180 degrees where the pully notch 
lines up again on 0 scale to TDC no. 3, counter clockwise 180 again 
to TDC No. 4.

With engine at TDC No. 1, you can then pull the dizzy up and turn the 
gear to properly line up the notch, IF it is a stock dizzy. Lots of 
dizzys will fit but cannot be oriented properly due to the vacuum can 
or condenser hitting something. That's why you see so many of them 
mis-oriented. If you should happen to set No. 1 on the No. 3 lobe 
which is retarded 3 degrees, the other 3 cylinders will be advanced 3 
degrees from stock, meaning No. 3 will then be advanced 6 degrees 
from it's normal 3 degrees retarded. Burned pistons and valves can 
result. Could be why you are burning up valves. Was it No. 3 that 
failed? That's why I say, stock ist beste. If it's something else, 
better put on your thinking cap to make sure your juris rigus don't 
attack your bank account.
