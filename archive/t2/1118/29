Subject: seat spring

I've got an odd thing I need.when my truck was hit, some of the broken glass
damaged the front seat. Therefore I'm going through the re-upholster thing
now. I noticed that one of the springs is broken, and figured while I had
the seat apart I should replace the spring. This is one of the coils
springs, not the flat wavy springs.

Does anyone have one or know where to get one? This is for the driver's seat
on my '69 singlecab. I tried an upholsterer, and he actually had the flat
wavy ones, but not the coil spring ones. He said my best bet was to go
through a junkyard.

Thanks,
