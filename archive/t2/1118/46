Subject: mufflers

Greetings,

Mine is an 81 air cooled, and without putting you all to sleep with the details,
I want to install a catalytic on it, (I am in Utah) as I am weary of worrying
about emissions testing.

The exhaust is an aftermarket version, which does not really allow room for the
cat. The muffler that came with it passed away a while back, and a muffler shop
replaced it with a cylindrical muffler, but its 24" long, which means the 12"
cat would push the tailpipe outside the edge of the vehicle.

If I could find a muffler that was 18" from flange to edge, I could install the
12" cat, and life would be so much better for me. It seems to me that the
muffler that failed, was about 18" long, so I have hope that somewhere out there
is one I can use, even if its not specific to the vanagon. Are mufflers shorter
on buses, or waterboxers?

Hanging it will be fun, but I can handle that. I just want to get it through the
damned emissions test, and then break it in, tweak it, and even get it to where
I won't need the cat.

Anyone know of any source for a muffler that would work, which is only 18" from
flange to end?

Much appreciate any suggestions or ideas/resources.

Thanks a lot,

John
