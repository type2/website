Subject: IT LIVES sort of.

got the new engine from Suburban Engine back into my 78 auto bus last week 
and fired it up friday.  drove nice for about 6 miles then stopped???? got 
it the last mile home and checked, Distributor wasn't fully seated... also 
noticed a gas leak so fixed that too.

now it runs, but only for a few minutes then stops.... will usually start 
right back up but it intermititantly stops.  seems electrical like maybe 
the FI stop firing for a moment.

the ignition is a crane and it has a LED on it and it does not stop 
functioning.
there is a fuel presure gage hooked up and the fuel ring stays up around 
30psi so that isn't likely it..

when it restarts it blows a little black smoke so is probably running a 
tad rich.  but it is not overheating and the oil presure is staying up 
over 30psi  so that isn't likely the problem....

?????  got me stumped at the moment...

suggestions it is beginning to be a "manic/depressive" session one minute 
it is running like a champ, then it drives me nuts trying to figure out 
why it stopped..... am kinda afraid to drive it anywhere til I figure out 
the problem.
