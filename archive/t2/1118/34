Subject: Just some info

Hi..I am Squid..and I am on the West Coast of Canada!  I plan to ride my MC
across America On HWY 2..as far as possible , through 'your' country, and
hoped there might be 'people' on the list who could help me, to find 'camping"
(tent), across Hwy #2, throughout the Northern states..., like Montana, North
Dakota, etc,and realizing, that I have a  300 mile range, before '64 age sets
in!  Was supposed to drive the '74 Westy, but, I did not get it done, so, will
go the "long Tooth" way..with help, from you!  I know, this is not the correct
"time"..(Friday)..to post this, and yes, I have over 3 weeks left to
prepare,...but just would like to narrow down the "bads", and prepare for the
"goods"!
Do you have any .."positive"..input as to things to see and places to stay?
Cheers
Syd
