Subject: Question about diodes and Compufire ignition

Hello List,
 
Well, I found a compufire ignition for my distributor. From past experience 
with these things, the two ways to kill one is to hook up the wires backwards
or to let one of the wires touch the cam. The second can only be helped by
carefully placing the wires.
 
Would it be possible to place a silicone diode on each wire that goes to the
coil to keep from frying the module if accidently wired backwards? I know that
silicone diodes have a 0.7v drop. Each wire would have the 0.7v drop accross
them.  Do you think that would  negatively affect the opperation of the unit?
 
Let me know. I may just have to try it to find out. If it worked, It should
help to keep the module from frying when accidently hooking it up backwards.
 
Thanks!
