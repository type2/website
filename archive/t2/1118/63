Subject: gas stabilizer v. ethanol

The proprietor of the small engine shop working over my big mower
said that gas stabilizer used to help but that since ethanol it
doesn't and, so, I should run any engine dry rather than use gas
stabilizer.  Since I use gas stabilizer in my bus before hibernating
it for the winter, this brings the question to this list.

Perhaps out of season, but is this guy right (that the presence
of ethanol defeats gas stabilization)?
