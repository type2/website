Subject: Re: [T2] early vanagon seats (seat spring)

Tom, I'd go with the latest seats available, armrests, more comfortable, foam
throughout and likely to be in better shape than the early ones (through
'83-'84ish.)  Now having said that, the armrests can/will interfere with the
door armrest or the air passage depending on year/type of bus, on Westy
swivels will only swivel if you open the door, and I'm not sure 100% when the
bus tracks change, so what year fits.  I've installed late Vanagon seats from
'75 on for sure, oddly '73 is the only year bus I've never owned, and never
tried in a '74, someone else will recall better.  I wonder about EV seats as
well, as the armrests are much narrower, as is the seat slightly I think. 
Although a Vanagon seat does NOT fit a EV track (the track is taller though
spaced the same) the EV seat does fit on a Vanagon track, hence probably on a
bus track.  On this regard though, early EV seats ('93 in US, most likely to
be parted) are terrible in upholstery
 quality, I've never seen one over 60k miles or so where the side bolsters
aren't worn (at least superficially, probably because it is narrower and my
ass like most in the US are too wide) and looking like crap, though the ones
post '99 seem to hold up better.  Might be interesting for someone to try,
probably some '99 floating around cheap at pick and pulls by now.

What years would the early seats be from?  They seem to be the way to go.  I
would be putting them in a '73 Westie.
