Subject: Interchangability of FRONT BEAMS

I have a 71 I want to install a rebuilt beam into. Am looking at  
different beams from 71 to 79, and need to KNOW (no guessing) if a  
73-79 front beam will fit. My basic understanding that anything after  
71 will work. Beams before 71 need the power brake mounting plate  
welded on to be correct ?

Please respond with comments only if 100% sure as the beam is being  
shipped to me, and not easy to return it if incorrect. Only thing I  
think is different would be the brakes, but planning on upgrade them  
off of a 73-79 anyway.

Sent from my iPhone... this thing is awesome
