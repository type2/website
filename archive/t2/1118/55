Subject: They're more stoked than you are!

Some of you know I put the Guac up for sale. We're financially upside
down by about a grand a month, and we're selling anything we don't
need to survive. My little girl cried when I told her we were selling
it. Shoot, I might have too...

Anyway, I've been really picky about who's buying it. I wanted someone
who would use it and take care of it as a family member, not a garage
queen or beater. I think I found him.

His name's Steve and he's flying in from KY next week with his son.
They're both completely stoked about the bus.  I've spent a lot of
time on the phone with him and think he'll be a great papa to the
Guac, and the son will love it as much as my daughter. Hooray! He said
he's even going to keep the name "Guacamole Bus" and the swirl on the
nose!!!

I'll be sure to turn him on to this list and AIRS (or whatever it
becomes), IAC, and he already knows TS.

I'm going to stay on this list, and still be available as a resource
on AIRS. Partly because of what this community has done for me, and
partly because I know this won't be my last bus.  I wanted to thank
all of you for your help (bus help and otherwise) and ask that you
guys support him as well. I feel he'll fit right in to this community.

Thanks again for everything, all of you!
