be careful that you're not pointing it at the notch that positions the
distributor cap correctly...my "timing mark" is a very faint line machined
into the distributor housing that when dirty is very difficult to see 1/8th
inch sounds a bit big for the timing line on the distributor

1. Rotate the engine clockwise until the distributor rotor points to the line
on the rim. (in my case its more of a 1/8 inch notch than a line)
