Subject: RE: [T2] truck won't start

I figured it out today...thanks for your help.

I checked the carb solenoid-it did not click when I gave it power. So I
thought I found the culprit. But when I pulled it, I realized the PO had
already broken off the end, so this was merely acting as a plug for the hole
in the carb.

I checked the points were opening and closing...tried flooding the engine.
It just felt like not enough gas or something...even when I sprayed starter
fluid into the carb, it would not start...

The I started tracing the wiring related to the shut off solenoid...then I
realized: The carb was stuck shut...I think it is called the Idle Cam Lever,
was stuck, which I believe shut the butterfly type valve  in the carb-so my
engine was not getting fuel, even though the pump wanted it to get it.

I jiggled the lever a bit, and it came loose. Problem solved. I put the
other distributor back in...and it started right up.

Thanks for all your help...so lesson learned, take air filter off carb, and
check to make sure valve is opening and closing, because if it is shut, no
matter how much starter fluid you spray in there, it isn't going to start.
