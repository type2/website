I had a 71 Westy that I had the front seats redone by a shop with foam.
Driving it home felt like I had just installed new Hankooks and Koni shocks
on my bus. It was so much more comfortable to drive. I could drive the bus
for 300 miles without the need to get out and stretch. Made driving the bus
fun. The few friends that drove the bus were so amazed at the ride - I told
them it was the seats - they all  thought I had a lucky and  perfect bus. I
sold that bus and regret not keeping the seats. Trying to find the guy again
to do the seats in my current Westy. If I find out who made the seat kits I
will let the group know. I don't miss horse hair one bit. Trey
