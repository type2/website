Subject: Re: [T2] Question about diodes and Compufire ignition

Hi,
Likely you can do this without an adverse effect. You will need to use 
diodes that have the proper current handling rating. The typical 1N4004's 
are rated at about 1 amp. Might not be enough. If you go to a diode rated at 
5 or 10 amps, be sure to mount them in a heat sink.

There are also Schotky diodes that have a lower voltage drop. The ST 
Microelectronics P/N STPS1545FP, 15 amp rated, provides .6V drop at 5 amps 
and 25 degrees C and lower drop at higher temperatures. You can obtain the 
diodes from Digikey, their p/n 497-10041-5-ND. $1.40 ea. They do charge a 
small fee for orders under $25.

Good luck,

Hello List,

Well, I found a compufire ignition for my distributor. From past experience
with these things, the two ways to kill one is to hook up the wires 
backwards
or to let one of the wires touch the cam. The second can only be helped by
carefully placing the wires.

Would it be possible to place a silicone diode on each wire that goes to the
coil to keep from frying the module if accidently wired backwards? I know 
that
silicone diodes have a 0.7v drop. Each wire would have the 0.7v drop accross
them.  Do you think that would  negatively affect the opperation of the 
unit?

Let me know. I may just have to try it to find out. If it worked, It should
help to keep the module from frying when accidently hooking it up backwards.
