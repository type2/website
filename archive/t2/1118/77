If you didn't know that solenoid was to stop the gas flow when the 
engine is turned off. I think to cure run-on. You could put a brass plug 
in it's place I suppose. I had one of those PO "customized" solenoids too.

Couldn't feel feel that in the pedal? (Not jerking your chain, just 
wondering).

I think the throttle arm screw has to be turned until it props the 
butterfly open just a bit. I think three turns after it touches the 
choke cam? Your truck is the same year as my Beetle but there is very 
little 1965 left in it (it's Type IV dual 36mm Dellorto powered).

GLAD you got it running!!! Have fun!
