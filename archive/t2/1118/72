yeah I suspect some sort of intermitttent connectivity problem, but which 
connection.  the head temp sensor is about a year old and I have the new 
Kyle wiring harness so things usually connect up tight if going to the 
ECU.

am frustrated now...and is hot and humid as all get out so will probably 
have to wait a bit for both weather and me to cool off a little...supposed 
to be nice Mon and Tue.
