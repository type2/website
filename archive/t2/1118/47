Hi John,

Any decent muffler shop should be able to attach a generic 18" muffler to
the end of the cat and keep it inside the bumper boundaries. It might not
be as quiet as stock but it would probably be cheaper.

As you sure you need a cat to pass? My understanding is that they help
with NOx emissions but not so much in other areas. It would help here to
know which emissions are failing you and by how much.

Happy Trails,
