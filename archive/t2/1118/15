The distributor body has an indexing notch in it that's about 1/4 inch wide.
There is a corresponding raised portion on the distributor cap that fits into
that notch.  The purpose is to make sure you put the cap on the distributor
body the same way every time.  That notch is NOT the notch you're looking for.
The notch you're looking for really is a tiny line machined into the rim of
the distributor body and it _should_ be directly underneath where the #1
cylinder spark plug wire is on the cap.  It may not be in that spot, but if
the distributor and cap are set up right it will be.  Scrape your fingernail
around the top edge of the distributor and you'll catch the notch sooner or
later.  It is tiny: a few hairs widths or perhaps a 50th of an inch.

If the distributor is setup appropriately then the notch will be underneath
the spark plug wire for the #1 cylinder.  At the very least that notch will be
under one of the four spark plug wires.  If you find that it's not underneath
#1 then you should probably hold off on the valve adjustment until properly
figured out where TDC for number 1 is.  If I found that on my engine I'd fix
it before proceeding with the adjustment.

Good luck finding your notch.  The finger nail is your friend here.
