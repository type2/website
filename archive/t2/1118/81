Subject: Cold Start Valve wireing.

Hi,

The cold start wiring on my 1978 CDN bus keeps coming out of the
connector.

The little clips on the inside of the connector don't work any more and
the body of the connector is damaged.

Thoughts on this would be appreciated.

I can's find specific information on this in the archives.
