Subject: Re: [T2] Cold Start Valve wireing.

Alan.  years ago we used to put a small "gob" of RTV silicone on connectors
that we didn't want to pop apart ...coil wires in the dist cap for ie..
and now you see that major manufactures have incorporated a silicone sealing
gasket that also holds the plugs together,, and just for belts and
suspenders.. they add a plastic retainer clip.
so.. If it was me, and I didn't feel like replacing the harness or the end,,
I'd just goop it up! lol..
if you put a nice neat gob on the side of the plug while it is in place,,
you can pull it apart later if you need to.  no need to make a huge mess,,
and get the stuff inside the plug..
