Subject: oil pump studs

Engine rebuild 1800 for my 73 bus

While reassembling my oil pump I managed to snap one of the studs.  I
didn't think I tightened to much.

What is the torque value for the the nuts holding the pump together?

Does anyone know an online source for automotive studs?

Thanks,

Daniel
