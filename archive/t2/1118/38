I have a '79 and that's exactly what I was thinking of doing.  The only
trouble I foresee with the Vanagon seats is with regards to the height of the
seat.  I'm a tall guy and when I sit up straight on the seats I have I already
have a hard time seeing out the windows.  How much do the vanagon seats raise
up your bottom?  If it's more than an inch or so I might have to figure out
some kind of modification to make them shorter.
