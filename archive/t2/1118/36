Subject: Re: [T2] upholstering van seats

Alan -  I stopped by an auto upholstery shop to ask just what they could do
to reupholster the FRONT seats in my '78 camper.

I came away with a greater appreciation of the work involved, and the
craftsmanship and techniques.

For example, after I politely asked to see his 'setup', the gentleman took
me in the back where he displayed the STEAMER that is used to soften the
finished vinyl covers so they fit smoothly, and he asked if I had auto seat
cover foam.

I thought he meant the thin foam headliner.  No, the seat he makes will have
a thicker density foam sheet sewed to it to give the seat cover the body it
needs. He showed me a set of covers which were ready to install, and I then
understood. I have not yet been able to discover the source for that seat
cover foam.

Of course, our seat covers do not have such foam, but you may wish to
consider such if you are going all out, stop by a few shops and get some
ideas.

And remember to source out the piping, or learn how to make it.
