Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic ignition, which one?

David I've been recently using the super cheapy MSD (name of the model escapes
me, but the black/aluminum cased one, we talked about this just 2m ago,
search...) on my Triumph, I'm going to buy one for the '69 SC.  I always
classically used the Universal Products one recc'd by Hoover, but this was $85
(on a good auction on the bay) whereas it lists about $120, has built in
selectable rev control, etc, etc.  Doing nicely in the Triumph, I like it.  As
I've said countless times I like CDI's, you can revert to points in seconds. 
Albeit rare, if your Pertronix dies, it is dead, had it happen at a most
inopportune time on my first car (a '914 I had in HS 20+ years ago.)  With a
CDI you need to remove (or purchase) a modified rotor for the dizzy.
