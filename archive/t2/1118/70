Subject: rear brakes

I finally got around to replacing my rear break shoes on my 73 van. The  
replacement set I got (bought a long time ago) does not have the parking  
break lever attached. I got the German Pagid set. What is the best way to  
attach the parking brake lever or is there a better set to buy that has it  
already attached.
