Subject: Re: [T2] Cold Start Valve wireing.

$130.00.. but the actual filament lamp is a $4 part from FLAPS as long as
you cut out the silicone holding it in....   genuine factory!
and...  TV high voltage plugs to the CRT have a gob holding them too..
i am saying , that if you do it nice , neat..  you will get a comment like..
that is an ingenious way to hold it... instead of .. what PO did that to
your bus!  lol
