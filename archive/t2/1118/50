Subject: my tailpipe

Hey,

I have been noticing startup as following.

-water comes out about 30 seconds after startup.

-about 1 minute after that a gray/white plume of smoke.

-about 3 minutes after that, it goes blue.

Then after driving it, this fault clears.

The exhaust gasket was replaced on 3 and 4.

There is a gasket on 1 and 2 that still needs dealing with, my mechanic
says I am OK for now.

Which way should I go the confirm/clear this fault.

Alan
