Subject: Adjusting my valves ('74 bus)...trying not to screw it up again

I have a 1974 Westy w/ dual carbs.  On my laaaaaasssst engine, I think I screwed up the valves.  This time I am a bit gun shy so I thought I would ask a question, albeit a dumb one.

According to Muir, the steps to get the engine set for cylinder #1 are:

1. Rotate the engine clockwise until the distributor rotor points to the line on the rim. (in my case its more of a 1/8 inch notch than a line)

2. Now line up your TDC notch ... (for the 1972-77 bus) The timing notch of your pulley must line up with the "0" mark on the scale.  This is TDC for cylinder No.1 where you adjust the valves for this cylinder.


The problem is, when the rotor is pointed at the notch, the notch on the pulley IS NOT pointed at the "0".  When I get the pulley notch pointed at the "0" the the rotor is off.

What am I not understanding?  It doesn't appear that I can get both lined up.  

Thanks for any help.
