I have some spare seat springs with the clips and all. I just did this on my bus. Check out pics on the samba forum "1972 westy hardtop project"

That's exactly what I did when I needed replacement springs.  I went to Uncle
Bob's VW shop here in Tucson and he dug out an old seat that I could
cannibalize.  Unfortunately my seats still came out uncomfortable... now I'm
really considering just finding some good Vanagon seats to swap in.  Had I
known my seats would be uncomfortable after reupholstering them I would have
just done that to begin with.

You might try BustedBus.com for the springs if you don't have a good VW yard
in your area.
