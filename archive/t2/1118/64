I'd argue that the plugs need to be cleaned. If I start my fuel injected 
Honda or VW Cabrio cold and run it long enough to move it around the 
driveway and turn it off, the next time it runs poorly until the 
cylinders are cleaned out. Both miss and run on 2-3 cylinders. Hard to 
start, etc.

A carburetor vehicle would be much worse. I suspect the shop started the 
engine a few times to move it around the shop and the plugs are fouled. 
No big deal.

That's the low hanging fruit. Next you'll want to see if the solenoid on 
the carb is working, if the coil is getting 12 volts. See if the timing 
is right. See if the points are opening and closing and if the contacts 
in there are clean. Likely one of these items is the problem.

Really easy test - put your foot on the floor and hold it there while 
you crank. See if it is "flooded". No pumping of the gas because that 
will make it worse. 30 seconds in two 15 sec sessions ought to reveal 
that. 15 sec on, 15 sec off, 15 sec on. If it tries to fire try more 
without taking your foot off the gas. If it starts up run it at 1200 rpm 
for 2-3 mins to warm it up, get the oil moving, and let the engine clean 
it's cylinders out.

If you're an old pro- sorry for the newbie advice. GRIN!

Glad you are close to back on the road!!!
