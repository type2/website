Michael -

In one word, yes.  Additional words....71-79 beams are virtually
interchangeable.  1970 beams, while having the same bolt-in pattern do have
to have the PB mounting plate welded on.  68-69 beams, because of a
different bolt-in pattern will not fit 70-79.  Hsving owned several Bay
Windows I know this for a fact.
