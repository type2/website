Subject: Potential Brake Problem - Hot rims, bolts, brake assembly

Hey Volks!

I own a 1978 Standard Bus, completely stock. Having some trouble today.

While driving around town today, started hearing some noise from my front
brakes when I would brake, didn't happen every time, but about 50% of the
time. Then I started hearing noises when I was driving and not touching the
brakes, seemed to be coming from both sides of the drivers cab. When I got
home, I jacked the van up and went to remove the drivers side wheel, it was
hot to the touch. Put it this way, when I sprayed Liquid Wrench on the wheel
bolts, it began to steam off. Once the tire was removed, the whole brake
area was very hot.

What's the deal? I'm going to Burning Man in a week from Los Angeles and I'm
hoping this isn't a huge problem of some sort. School me......
