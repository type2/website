Subject: CSRA VW Club? (Augusta, GA)

Folks,

The other day I met roadside a gent in a blue 71-ish Westy in
Augusta, GA, who tried to pass
along the website for a CSRA VW club... I thought I heard
www.csravwclub.org, but this doesn't
work, nor does a search from AltaVista...

Perhaps someone here can direct me?

Cheers!
