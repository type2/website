TJ,

Did you *not* look at the pictures(#12) here?????

I resisted doing this for more than 3 months.  I should have done it=20
first.

I tried everything I could think of including=20
putting 2 gallons of paint thinner in the tank and letting it sit
for several weeks and then circulating it thru the lines with a cheap=20
aftermarket electric fuel pump.

Trust me, bite the bullet and do it *now*, before it gets cold.

Once you pull it out and look inside, take it to a radiator shop
where they can "boil" it out.  Plan on repainting the outside and=20
replacing the fuel filler lines and the gas gauge sender before you put it=
=20
back in....it should be good for another 25 years that way....


Once I did this, the bus runs great.

Cheers, dave
