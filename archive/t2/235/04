I have put pertronix or the competitor into every vehicle i have had 
(that didnt have a halls) for years.  Only had one fail and it was only 
a few minutes to put a set of points in , crude set them, and drive 
home.  Before the electronic I lost a lot more than one set of 
points/condensor.  not to mention that on some vehicles trying to get 
dwell right is a real PAIN.  Also it has been a long time since i have 
seen points that cheap.  With current prices on points and condenser for 
my vanagon(non cal) I was looking at ten bucks a year.
