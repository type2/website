I guess that could be right; never thought about it, but ...............
we're talking lumens emission here, not thermionic emission as in a vacuum 
tube where quantifiable fall-off does occur with age.

Something of note, and I may be way wrong here, but
for those who are squinting at their fuel and speedo scales and thinking 
their VW dash appears to decrease in brightness with age (aging car + aging 
owner's eyes) ...............
there might be a reason......
The waffle mount bulbs behind the VW dash use a dual filament design.

I suspect it is not uncommon to look at the bulb, see it somewhat dark 
around the glass,
and be confused by it's still working........
however.........
Only 1/2 of the bulb is working ........ 1/2 has failed.

Yes, not all electrical components are born equal, but at $1.77 for a 
package of two of these little bulbs, I am happy with the handy replacement 
find and can handle a 1/2 life projection.
