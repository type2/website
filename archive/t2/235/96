Dunno. The tin is similar in that it is a pancake too.

You would be subject to the same argument about the Type IV 2.0 versus the 
Type I 2.0.

Type IV offers larger and beefier everything. Type IV offers 2.0 out of the 
box where the Type I requires alot of expensive stroked cranks, special 
piston/cylinders, etc.

Is there an advantage of using the Type I in the Type III configuration 
versus the Type I engine in the Beetle configuration? Of course if it is 
what is on hand then that is advantage enough for me...

Remember the gearing will be higher on the Type IV engine bus tranny versus 
the Type I bus tranny. Might mean lower noise and lower rpms but might also 
lead to higher engine temps (low fan rpm) and lower power.
