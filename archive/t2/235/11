Subject: FREE BUS ALERT!

Got 'em!!!! I'll go back out this afternoon and cut the engine and tranny 
mounts and brackets out that I need for my Transvair conversion.

Went out to the Jackson County boonies this morning to see if the parts 
busses I knew of were still there. They were and I got an invitation to 
take some or all of the bus that was left.

There ain't much left! <grin>

If you or anyone you know wants some or all of a 1970's (Beetle powered 
bus) then let me know.

I will take you out there and introduce you to the current keeper.

The is a FREE deal.

It is a rolling shell at this point. All the doors - except the engine lid 
- is there. Some of the glass if left.

No engine, complete suspension, no steering box, no interior except the 
dash which has been partially stripped.

Looks like there are alot of good body panels there.

He wants it ALL gone soon b/c it is going to the crusher.

This bus is located approximately 1/2 way between Nashville and Knoxville 
along I-40. It is about 20 minutes from the interstate.

Again I will be happy to help anyone that wants to come get it. I think he 
would prefer that the whole thing go at once but would still be happy for 
it to be stripped a little more so nothing worth anything goes to the 
crusher and gets wasted.
