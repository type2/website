Subject: Re: [T2] Front Shift Bushing Replacement

Travis,

As I said several weeks ago to someone on this exact thread...

this is one of those jobs that the hard way *is* the easy way.

You might try just loosening up the shifter, but the point is, it probably 
needs cleaning and greasing up anyway.

Just do it!
Bentley tells how to set it back correctly.



Cheers, dave
