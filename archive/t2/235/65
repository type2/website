Well, I dunno.  Most gasket shifts occur during initial install and unless
you have several hours to wait for the weatherstrip adhesive to set (with
the gasket properly held in place) it will be just as slippery as anything
else.  I've never had a shift with Hylomar (it's really tacky when under
pressure) and I can't say the same for
weatherstrip cement.  I think that the scraping (and inevitible scratches)
involved in cleaning weatherstrip cement off the cover result in more
annoying drips.  My Mexican engine valve covers have been off a dozen
times and still have the original unscratched paint as the sealing
surface.

Since I do valves every 2000 miles, the easier cleanup with hylomar is
significant in time savings.
