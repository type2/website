Subject: Re: [T2] Rewiring A Bus/Smoking Wiring Trouble

Yes I rewired a 63 bus. I seriously considered making wiring harnesses 
because they were so expensive to buy complete.

But as to your question, VW made a harness that worked, and any smoke or 
problems are due to other issues, like bad grounds, worn wires, etc. From 
the factory they worked. Interestingly, the bus harness I copied was from a 
6 volt bus, modified to 12 volt. The 6 volt harness is actually of a higher 
(read bigger not literally higher if you understand wiring) guage wire and 
is better then later busses.
