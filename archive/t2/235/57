Subject: Re: [T2] Do I have to pull the engine?

You can do it but I think you'll have to remove the fan shroud.

Can be done but I think it is easier to remove the engine and remove the 
fan shroud. I done it both ways.

Don't leave it out.

Why not make the mechanic do it. He has the tools and the lift...
