My '65 Beetle stalled on day b/c the pre filter failed. Seems that water 
collects around the base of the wire gauze and rusts AWAY.

Fell off the tube and allowed crud to clog the line. I mistakenly thought 
it was a bum filter or pump.

That was 1 week after driving it from Norfolk, VA to Chattanooga, TN towing 
a Hyundai. Glad that didn't happen during the trip (all night drive).
