Subject: RE: [T2] vacuum leak from brake booster line

Its really not that big of a pain to replace, however it does mean crawling
under the bus. The problem you'll probably encounter with replacement is
that you may not be able to find a replacement hose. This hose is reinforced
with a spiral piece of wire ( read spring )that keeps the hose from
collapsing under the vacuum that its subjected to. I ended up going to a
specialty shop and purchasing the correct diameter fabric wrapped breather
hose. then I went to Home Depot a purchase a long spring that would fit into
the inside of the hose. I stretched the spring the length I needed and
inserted it into the hose and then installed it. Remember there's two
sections of hose that need to be replaced. One is the one you saw in the
engine compartment, the other connects to the vacuum unit on the master
cylinder.
