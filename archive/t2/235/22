r. And it was filled with smeg, a word my wife uses to describe all thing=
s less then clean. Anyway, I replaced that line. It was so clogged, it wa=
s like I was lucky any gas was getting through. My ace mechanic/friend/VW=
 shop owner advised I run the bus around and see if that does not fix the=
 problem...It seems to have; I'll drive down to South Beach this afternoo=
n and see if it does well.
