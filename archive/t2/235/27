Subject: BRAND NEW VDO CHT kit

I just noticed on the VDO web page that they now have a "new" gauge for CHT.

I was of the impression and have been told consistently that this gauge 
ONLY came in Cockpit Black configuration.

It does now come in Cockpit White
with a p/n 310-902 for the complete kit
and
p/n 310-241 for just the gauge.

The CHT still does not come in their "vision" design nor any of other meter 
design layouts.....
just Cockpit......... but it does come in both traditional black as well as 
the brand new white series, as noted by the part numbers, above.
