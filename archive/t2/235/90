TJ,

There was no such thing in my 78 when I took it out.

There is a "bowl" around the two pipes on a 78.  It has small openings
around the bottom perimeter to allow gas to get in to the bowl after the 
gas level falls below about 3/8 of a tank full.  The bowl is squarish 
shapped and about 3 inches high and about 6-8" "square".

One of the listees has some great shots of inside the tank when he took 
his out around the same time to clean it also.

Cheers, dave
