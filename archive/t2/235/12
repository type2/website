So my 71 westy decided to not start yesterday, so I push started it and =
it drove home just fine, but this morning it just clicks when I turn it =
over so I thought I would check the solenoid and starter today but =
wanted to make sure I do it right. so.....
1. Check all wires and contacts
2. ignition off, bus in neutral screwdriver across the 2 large contacts =
on the solenoid?  It whirls then starter is ok? If not starter is =
problem?
3. Screwdriver between battery contact on solenoid and to terminal to =
ignition?  It whirls then solenoid is bad?
Anything I am not thinking of, especially safety issues.
thanks in advance
Steve
