Extensive driving is not a cause of engine failure, Extensive driving with a
poorly timed engine, missing engine tin, leaking oil and missing engine
compartment seals, clogged fan housing etc. causes engine failure.

I have a VERY heavy foot, but I have everything that the factory intended to
be on my engine on my engine, I can drive the heck out of my bus for hours
on end and when I stop I can lift the engine lid and FIRMLY grab the
dipstick and hold it for as long as I want, no heat at all.

There are several people on this list with older Westies with 1600cc engines
and they do just fine.

My advice, before trashing your engine,  pay a GOOD VW mechanic to check all
of the problems your bus has, I bet you will be surprised at what a good
mechanic can do.

Whats your Idea of reasonable? $500???? I dont think you are going to find
an engine worth any driving for that price. Your looking at around $1000 or
more for a good "NEW" engine.
