    1. The short tube is used to pressurize the tank so it will spray, that
is if it is fully sealed. I use a bicycle pump to fill mine, but I am
looking for something small that I can keep in the glove box.
    2. I had my wipers lock up also. On my bug it was simply rust where the
shaft comes through the body. On my bus the motor died. Try pulling the
wiper arms off the windshield, like you would if you were cleaning the
window. Then try them again. If they work while there is no pressure on the
shafts, I would lean towards a bad motor or more like the plastic gear in
the motor assembly.
    If they don't turn, check the ground wire that goes from the motor to
the body. I left mine off when I reassembled mine.
    3. I'll have to check my Bentley's to see about the passenger wiper not
touching because mine does that also. I just figured I'd have to live with
it.
