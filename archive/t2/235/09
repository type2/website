Yes, I am leaning that way...In fact have been out there this AM and deci=
ded that must be the problem...Hope it is! The tank was drained just a co=
uple of days ago; maybe it should be cleaned. If that is it, then I will =
be all happy. If it's not, then I'll weep, wail, tear my robes, and gener=
ally knash my teeth. No, wait that's what I would do if I was Moses and m=
y camel had dropped...
