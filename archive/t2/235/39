I dont bother with either method. I use dry gaskets, or possibly a little 
grease on the valve cover side, thats it. If it leaks you got another 
problem.

It was mentioned that pressure on high rpm engines can blow the seal. Easy 
fix, on my drag bug I simply run valve covers that have a tube put in them  
and run hoses back to the carb. This relieves pressure and is an easy fix.
