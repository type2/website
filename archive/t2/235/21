Easy squeezy, to say anyway.

1. Remove the motor.
2. Remove the head.
3. Take it to a machinist for removal of all the studs and repair of 
threads if needed. Specify timed inserts as helicoils are grossly inferior 
in this and most thread repair applications.
4. Install new studs.
5. Reassemble and replace the engine.
6. Mount the exhaust.

The key to preventing this problem is to ALWAYS replace the studs when ever 
the exhaust is off if any of them have the least bit of pitting or wear.
