Subject: Made it!

Just wanted to let everyone know that Wanda made the trip from NJ to WI
and back home again safe and sound!  We actually drove straight to
Chicago on the way up, stopping every so often for gas and rest stops
(an 18 hour drive!)  She had no problems at all!  Went through about 2
qt's of oil the whole trip, and got about 20 mpg...

So to the guy who said "Try the long drive, she just might make it"  I
say, damn straight buddy!
