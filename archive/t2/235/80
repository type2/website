Subject: Overheated & stuck flywheel

FHi Volks,

Today on the way to the Great Canadian Bug Show from Buses Of the Corn 
Jamie Auch's 71 Deluxe bus over-heated on the highway. We pulled over 
and it was very hot. As soon as it was shut off it quickly squirted an 
8" puddle of oil from the tranny/engine gasket. After a while it stopped 
dripping and it ended up about a quart low. The dipstick was way to hot 
to remove without gloves.

We decided to head back to my driveway and work it over there. We 
figured the main seal had  failed, plus it needed valve cover gaskets 
and hopefully that would be it. Jamie reset the timing and meanwhile 
Collie Corner called us on a cell phone from the GCBS and was able to 
save us a trip there to get the gaskets and seals needed. Collie also 
borrowed a distributor from Denmeister to replace the 009 Jamie is using 
now. Collie also loaned us a brand new flywheel lock, still in the 
blister-pack.

We checked the compression, and it's low. 55 / 60 / 70 / 90. Adding oil 
made no difference. After checking the compression we pulled the motor, 
and Jamie noticed that some of the intake manifold nuts are only finger 
tight. I'm hoping that if we retorque the heads and reset the valves the 
compression will come up; Jamie put one of these heads on only a week 
ago. It needs to sit a few more hours before we can do this, and I need 
to borrow a torque wrench from somewhere, too. Or buy/rent one tomorrow 
AM.

Getting the flywheel off is the current sticking point. We have a 1/2" 
drive socket and a 4' pipe extension but it won't budge. I fired up a 
naptha-gas blowtorch and it still wouldn't loosen. I don't have air 
tools, but could take the motor to a garage tomorrow to get to one if it 
would help.

Ideas & Comments would be welcome.  Jamie's family needs to be back in 
WV for Tuesday night.

Happy trails,
