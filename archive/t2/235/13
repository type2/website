Subject: Re: [T2] leaky valve covers

I have been following this link for about 48 hours.
Valve covers don't just start leaking for no reason.
If you've removed the covers for maintenance and reinstalled the valve
cover with the old gaskets this might be the case.
All that glue is going to give you a nice easy to fit valve cover and new
gaskets might help for a while but I'm speculating that you have
excessive crank case pressure from some source.
I'm telling you right straight that an engine will run just fine with a
couple of broken rings for a while and then the cylinder wear just starts
causing excessive leaking.
One tell tale sign is the oil dipstick moving out of the dipstick tube
about 1./4 to 1/2" during daily operation.
I'd definitely check the compression before you have to start checking
prices on new engines.
I may appear to be way too serious in my reply to this post but having
been there myself, I know that valve cover will hold their integrity for
three or four and even more years unless there is a problem on the
horizon.
Patronize me guys: Check that compression.
