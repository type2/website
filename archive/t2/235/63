Subject: RE: [T2] Potential Brake Problem - Hot rims, bolts, brake assembly

Defective power assist, defect master cylinder, defective pedal (not 
returning).

Stuck caliper causing heat and boiling brake fluid which thus expands (b/c 
it is containminated?) causeing the front brakes to drag creating more and 
more heat and pressure and...

Why wouldn't the rear brakes be hanging - if they are adjusted correctly....

Just ideas for you to look at. I'd say one of the list experts will know 
right away.

Couldn't be anything else that I know of....

Let us know what you find.
