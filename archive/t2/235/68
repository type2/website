Over 90% of the time, it's one of two things. Both are due to lack of 
maintenance, ie, failure to flush and renew the fluid periodically which 
allows the fluid to turn ugly with crud. Either the seals in the calipers 
get hard and gummed up and won't allow the pads to spring back a hair to 
release the rotor, and/or the crud blocks the flex hoses which keeps a bit 
of pressure on the calipers so they won't release. The calipers can be 
rebuilt if they aren't pitted but the hoses must be replaced. Be sure to 
flush the system BEFORE you replace the parts. You don't want that filthy 
fluid flushed through the new, clean parts.

Just take a look at the fluid reservoir. If it's black and ugly inside, the 
whole system is contaminated.
