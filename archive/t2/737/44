Subject: Re: [T2] Sun Screen for Windshield

Are you referring to outside or inside shades? I took my custom front 
curtain (spans side windows and windshield) and sewed tabs on each side. 
  These go to snaps (or velcro) just inside the ends of the front door 
frames.  Covers the whole front windshield.  Shutting the doors traps 
the tabs.  To keep heat out of the bus, one must shade it, not block the 
windows with curtains or such on the inside, for radiant heat goes 
through the glass anyway and gets trapped inside.  That's why one keeps 
some windows open.  The shading only helps to keep exposed surfaces from 
direct sunlight, like the dash. On our cross country trip I made it a 
point to park the bus so the sunnyside was the awning side (which I 
could pull out just a few feet) and the other side shaded itself.
