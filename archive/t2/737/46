Id like to add my personal experience on this one. 
At work, the employee parking lot has NO shade. None. I found that simply closing my stock Westy curatins , and parking with the windshield pointed away from the afternoon sun, my Bus will stay 25 degrees cooler. It gets HOT here in Las Vegas in the summer, upwards of 120 some days. (Thats outside temp, not in the bus temp)  That 25 degrees is a huge difference.
