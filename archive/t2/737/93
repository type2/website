Those Saab guys will be stoked. Two stroke Saabs are the holy grail if
you have what I suspect you have. :)

I don't know what area you're in, but regardless, you shouldn't have
too much trouble finding homes for all those Saabs and busses.

Mud sometimes acts as a preservative. Have you looked under the mud to
see how much rust there is in the pre-61's?
