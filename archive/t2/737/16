Subject: RE: [T2] power inverters

Your battery has around 65 Ah capacity (if it is a big one maybe 80 Ah) -
i.e. 65A for one hour. 1300 W at 12 V translates into a current of more than
100 A on the primary side. Given a perfect battery this thing would not even
run for an hour until the battery is totally drained. Most inverters have
circuit that turns them off if battery voltage falls below a certain
threshold. Mine does that around 11 V. Given the huge load you plan on
running and the voltage drop in the wiring between battery and converter it
will probably shut off almost immediately if the engine is not running ..

BTW, you bettter run really heavy guage wiring between the battery and
inverter and mount the inverter as close to the battery as possible (i.e.
inside the engine compartment above the battery). Otherwise your wiring
harness will provide plenty of heating when it starts to melt and burn.
