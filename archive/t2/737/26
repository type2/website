Subject: re. broken engine mount

I think you are right Bob, 
 I have made a paper template of the missing piece, I am going to try 
and  fabricate a new one out of aluminum plate and have it welded.
I am not sure if I will be able to have it welded without  total disasembly?
I have a 1976 fi tansporter in the back that I think the engine is good, 
it was having fi problems and needs restoring .
I am thinking of pulling that engine and putting it into the 78 
transporter until I can get this engine repared, 
if I use the fuel injection system off of the 78 on my 76 engine will 
this work ?
I still have the broken stud I have to get out that started this mess, 
ha ha
Thanks Andy
