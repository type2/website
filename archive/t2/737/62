Hey guys  Sorry I'm not impressed  You need 200hp in a bus like you need a 
hole in your head to say nothing about the hole in the wallet that it would cost 
and its life would be very limited.  If it was so great how come all the drag 
racers arent using the type4 motor???  How do you say overated, overpriced, 
and a waste of time,  to each his own  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
