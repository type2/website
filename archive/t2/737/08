Subject: power inverters

I just ordered a 1250w/2500w power inverter  the book claims it will run a 
60"tv,table saw,toster, iron. What IM hoping it will do is run ceramic safety 
furnace that requires 1360w IM hoping this will keep my vw camper worm i ordered 
from Heartland America 1-800-229-2901 item c466054 $100:00 Have any of you 
ever tried this? thanks. Neal
