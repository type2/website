>I would guess, without having facts, that
increasing a 2.0 liter to say 3.0, would likewise
increase the 101 HP to say, 150. 

The stock T4 engine had 65-80hp, so 150 hp would
be roughly double the amount of hp for which the
other components were designed.  A 100 hp 2.0
would itself be a hot engine with very
significant modifications.  

It seems to me that if one needed 200hp in a bus,
it would be easier to add a well hidden radiator
and a turbo golf/jetta engine... and keep several
thousands for the pockets.  

Heck 200hp 4.3 Chevy's are available complete
with an Astro attached for $1500 or so everyday
around here.  :)
