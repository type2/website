Subject: BUStedBUS.com is For Sale

Hey folks,

I want to sell my business. I will be packing everything up at the end of the
summer. I have to throw a lot of stuff away in order to do it. I want to be a
structural engineer, 10 years of school must not be wasted either.

Please keep it alive.

Here is what I have.

3000+ bin boxes full of parts, all with part numbers and descriptions.
About 30 sets of doors (cab, sliders, deck lids, rear hatches) on pallet
racking
More engine tin then you could possibly imagine.
15 or so engine cores (mostly Type 4)
18 plus parts buses (some restoration projects with titles, 71 sun roof, 73
panel, 78 champ etc.)
40 ft trailer with westy cabinets and louvered windows, fiberglass tops
1000 plus customers, toll free number, www.bustedbus.com , several whole sale
accounts for new parts
About $125,000/ year in sales ($12,500 last month) you could triple that with
some more capital and a few employees ( I have done most of it myself with
some part timers in the summer.
no debt, free and clear
lots and lots of stuff, (every bus (25 in the last 5 years) that has come
through here has been dismantled ( 25 years worth) has been completely striped
and I mean completely)

I will take $35,000 OBO cash for everything by the end of the summer ( if I
don't sell it by the end of the summer, then it will all sit for 25 years
until I retire)
I will container and ship it all to you, anywhere in the country for another
$10,000. I will train you for 30 days for another $2500 or three months over
the phone for $1000

I sold it 2 years ago for $125,000 (that's at least what its worth). (I had to
take it back, he didn't want to or couldn't make it happen???)

You have to work hard, but it is a great business.

I am keeping all of my tools.

Please, very serious inquires only. No partial sales, all or nothing. or a
part for 30k and we toss the rest. ( I will take a $5000 deposit and pay for
all the attorney fees.)

call my cell at 303-981-9542 if you want to talk (again seriously, no, well, I
might be interested, I don't have the time)

Please pass this email on to anyone you want but please forward it in
entirety.
