No filtration is called for at all there. The purpose is to vent
crankcase pressure and to prevent harmful oil and exhuast fumes from
escaping to the atmosphere by burning them with the intake air. If you
experience too much oil in the intake system you have other problems
such as worn compression rings allowing excessive blowby.

 I'm finding my way around the bus engine in preparation of dropping it

 Bentley and would like to know more about the oil breather. I assume
 it's purpose is to ventilate the crankcase and recirculate some gases
 as part of the anti-smog system.
