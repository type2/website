The supply will give what is demanded- you can use it practically up to 
500 watts (electric drill) while the bus is running.  Better to loaf at 
1/3 capacity than full blast (like many 300watt inverters.) Go to a 
marine store and get a battery terminal with an extra wire mount.
The best let you clip the old terminal, insert it into a large hole, and 
turn this large screw to tighten it.  Same for the smaller connector.
Normally you run that through a fuse- note that Amps X volts= watts   so 
A X 12=500
or 40 amps- that's a 50 amp fuse.  I presume the power supply is 
internally fused.  Since you want to get at it to turn it on, perhaps 
while driving, installing in the engine compartment is impractical 
unless you want to run a long reach supply switch.  I'd install it under 
the rear bedseat, and run a (1/8" thick=6 gauge?) wire through the wall 
and under the seat.  A good ground is to put a terminal under one of the 
floor bed mounting bolts or a seatbelt bolt.  I don't know how big your 
unit is; we keep a small 300 watt one in that well between the bedseat 
and the outside wall, running the wire along the wheelwell to to floor 
of the rear bus bed (next to spare tire), drilled a hole, and then ran 
it to the spare battery.  It is for running a shaver or a monitor and a 
dvd player or vcr.  To get fancy, install an outlet in the wall of the 
bedseat just for the power supply, feeding it through a 15 amp wire to a 
plug into the supply.  To be less fancy, use an airconditioning 
extension cord and slot it through the gap between bedseat and the wall 
on the driver side.
Best for higher wattage use is to get a tiny generator-We got this for 
home office and take it if no hookups, quiet, as it backs down if load 
is less:
