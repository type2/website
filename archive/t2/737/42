Subject: Re: [T2] power inverters

It does not hurt having the biggest inverter possible. This way you can run
power tools with your engine running - great for junk yard hunting ...

Just make sure that you mount this thing as close to the battery as possible
and use the heaviest gauge wiring the connector on the inverter will accept.
The shorter and heavier the wire is, the better your inverter will perform.
Also, since you will not find an automative fuse that will handle such a
load (except maybe a Diesel glow plug fuse) it is always a good idea to keep
unfused wires as short as possible to minimize fire hazard. Use grommets
wherever you need to route the 110 V wiring (or any wiring) through sheet
metal.

There was a brown 70/71 or so camper at Everybus with a power inverter
mounted directly above the battery. I think I have a picture somewhere. Many
of the (good) big inverters have a connector for a remote switch - so that
you can have the inverter in the engine compartment and still operate it
from inside the bus.
