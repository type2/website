Cofap is an OEM supplier to VW Brazil. Their Bus shocks are low-end
products, but not utter garbage as are many shocks in this price range. Not
a bad shock, but I can offer you a far superior alternative for about the
same price.

We just bought some Boge shocks on closeout for only $17.95 each. Boge is a
much better shock that Cofap and usually sells for about three times the
price. The reason these are so cheap is that Boge sold them to a company
called IP, who slapped their logo on them, only to go out of the shock
business a while later. So we bought their remaining inventory. These are
the very same Boge shocks sold for $40+ elsewhere, other than the label.
They are an incredible deal, and anyone in need of budget-priced Bus shocks
should grab a set.

I should mention that these are made by Boge in Mexico, not Germany - and so
are the Boge branded ones sold everywhere else. Sachs/Boge North America
sources all of their Bus shocks for the U.S. market from their Mexican, not
their German, factory. They do still make them in Germany (under the Sachs
name), but only for the European market. We, however, stock the German ones,
as we import them ourselves. So our Sachs/Boge branded shocks are German
made, whereas everyone else's Boges (as well as our IP's for less than half
the price) are Mexican made.

In addition to the Mexican Boges (IP's), and the German made equivalents, we
also sell a higher-end version of the Sachs/Boges (heavier duty than their
normal shock, and not normally sold in the U.S.; we import it directly), the
AlKo's (which are perhaps the best value for dollar in my opinion), and
KYB's (which, as you noted above, some people find too harsh).
