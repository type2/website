Subject: engine mount broken

Hi, I am working on a 1978 transporter, I broke the exauste stud off in 
the head so,
having read the previous threads I went ahead and pulled the engine to 
get the head off to take it to machiene shop.
while takeing  the engine out I was having a hard time seeing up to the 
top bolts but I found {it} thru the top hatch..
I could not see the other bolt but the engine was free,
when I got it out I see why. the top left corner is missing off of my 
engine where the bolt was supposed to be.
I do not have the piece to weld back on and I have found several 
stripped bolts already.
what to do? I am unsure of the miles on this engine but I am looking at 
at block and head repair already plus
stripped out bolts everywere. is it time to get a new engine?
thanks James
