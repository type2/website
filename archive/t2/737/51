Subject: Re: [T2] 3 Liter Type IV

A 3-liter A/C VW engine would begat a pleasant
increase in power.  Envy.
    
But, based upon my experience from the High School and
College years:  When you increase the horsepower of
the engine significantly, the other parts of the power
train begin breaking.  On the Chevy's I used to
trick-out, U-joints, Differentials, Engine & Tranny
mounts, and Transmissions quickly become undependable.
    
I would guess, without having facts, that increasing a
2.0 liter to say 3.0, would likewise increase the 101
HP to say, 150.  With that increased power, would come
an equivalent increase in wear and tear.  The
Transaxle, clutch, and the VW version of U-joints all
would begin a pattern of early failure.
    
Guess I would want to purchase and read any of the
several books concerned with adding horsepower to VW
engines.  They would be a good place to start.
   
But to warn doom and gloom due to power increases? 
Not my intention.  
!!
Tell us T2 members what needs beefing-up.  This
inquiring mind wants to know!  
!!
Reading your posting makes me want to purchase a the
"Turbo-mania" book.  But most such books are geared to
the Beetle T1 engine & power-train.
