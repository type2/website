<Well, to be fair, I'd bet that *IF* Jake decided to sell that engine
it would be in the $10-15k range.>

Prob fair in the land of custom engines but it is far, far beyond my budget! <griN!> 

I'll prob have not more than $6K in my WHOLE Beetle with a laundry list of upgrades... 

4 wheel disc brakes, ragtop sunroof, 911 replica cooling, dual Dells, Type IV engine, etc. etc. etc.
