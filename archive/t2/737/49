I found that simply closing my stock Westy curatins , and parking with the windshield pointed away from the afternoon sun, my Bus will stay 25 degrees cooler. It gets HOT here in Las Vegas in the summer, upwards of 120 some days. (Thats outside temp, not in the bus temp)  That 25 degrees is a huge difference.

Even with the mild climate in my area I always park in the shade. This windshield sun screen is top notch and makes a big difference:

It's the only one I know of that's a perfect fit for the bus windshield.
