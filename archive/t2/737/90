Does anyone know what # 25 is in the following fiche?

http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Microfiche/t206100.gif

my accelerator cable will not pull far enough forward
on the 79 westy.  The rubber boot between part number
24 and the end of the accelerator cable is not
allowing the cable to pull in all the way when you
mash the gas so I'm wondering if #25 is some kind of
spacer that pushes #24 (bracket) more toward the front
of the bus.  I don't think my transmission has a #25
on it.  I hope this makes sense to someone.  I can't
get my kickdown to work.  thanks, Greg
