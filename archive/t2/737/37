Get a wire brush in there and do some cleaning. I see the rust on the rear beam you mentioned but I'm not sure that it isn't just debris (not former steel) and not the end of the bus. The rest of the bus looks pretty good to have fatal rust there... 

Definitely go in there like Marcus said with a hammer and a screwdriver. 

Maybe you need to do a cool custom Porsche 911 suspension install which would require the torsion bar systems to come out. Break out the welder! (and grinder, sawz-all, measuring tools, and... and... <grin!>)
