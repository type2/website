Hmmm... it seems to me that I've read elswhere that ACVW driveline
components (and Bus stuff specifically) is quite over-engineered and
will handle a good deal of horsepower over stock. Consider the
strength of the suspension setup and the 1-ton stock payload rating as
example. At the very least, I wouldn't be afraid to retain the stock
trans, CVs and axles if I were only increasing output by 50HP. I might
beef up the clutch assembly, but that's about it. Otherwise, unless
you're dragracing your baywindow (as cool as that would be), I doubt
you're going to blow anything up much faster than you would with stock
components. That said, bring on the 3.0!!!
