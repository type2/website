Hey all well this afternoon (thrusday) after alot of phone calls and
thinking i made the call to Bob at Boston engines. He is going to make me a
long block engine a 2.0L fuel infected engine. The only thing different it
is going to have hydralic lifters the wait he said is going to be 30 days
but i am willing to wait that long because i heard of his reputation is
incredible. Well i will let the list know more information when it comes in
take care to all and happy driving.

Sam,
   I have a Bob Donalds 1600DP engine in my 71 bus.  I can't say enough good
things about the engine or Bob.  Not only does he build a good engine, but
his customer service after the sale is even better.  Example, after a
routine valve adjustment I couldn't get the driver's side valve cover leak
free.  It was fine before I removed it but new gaskets, tightening up the
bail, and spending much time cleaning the gasket surfaces just wouldn't keep
the valve cover from leaking.  I called Bob for advice and he assured me
that he'd send me everything I need to fix the problem.  Sure enough UPS
delivers a package to me that includes gasket, a bail, and a new valve
cover.  After a careful installation of the new parts the leak is cured.
Customer service doesn't get much better than that!  I think you made a good
decision.
