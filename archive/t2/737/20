Subject: RE: [T2] Need shop to adjust dual carbs around DC

I was actually looking at the LM-1 for another project. Is anyone using this
on a non-FI application?

Has anyone used the optional tail pipe clamp while driving the car or is
this for stationary use only?

Does it use the same wide-band sensors as the megasuqirt? (Obvioulsy, this
question has nothing to do with my current problem ...)
