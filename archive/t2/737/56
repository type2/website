Wouldn't the bus be a fairly good beast to build a better engine for since it already comes with a better transmission sought after by the Beetle and dune buggy crowds? 

Everything is already beefed up beyond the Beetle design...

Better would be to upgrade the tranny to a Porsche 9xx tranny (think late model), late model Porsche axles, upgrade the engine mounting system. Of course this leads to upgrades in the wheels, tires, swaybars, brake rotors, brake calipers, etc. 

Just build it (or use it) for increased power...
