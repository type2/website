Subject: Re: [T2] 3 Liter Type IV

Here in Australia there have been plenty of engine upgrades done to T2
kombi's. Unless you go to serious power (above 200HP) or drive like a fool,
non seem to suffer trans issues if you start with a sound one.
200HP is achievable in a type 4 without the need of 3L also, even a well setup
type 1 motor under 2L can get 150-200HP without too many drama's. But HP =
$$.

If you consider $$, the most common "value for money" up grade here is a late
model Subaru motor (even in T3's), they can be fitted with almost no mods to
the body work (which means you can convert back one day), and can give good
reliable driving with ~165HP. The conversion can be done much cheaper than
re-building a type 4 and adding a few performance mods.

Vanagon motors are too expensive to re-build compared to a type 4 (almost
double), and more than the cost to install a low mileage Subaru, so not a good
option.

In my opinion though, if I was not happy with the performance of my T2 I would
upgrade to a more modern vehicle, no conversion hassles, easier to maintain
(as any shop can do it), and no worries about upgrading suspension, brakes
etc. To me the motor suits the van and is it's soul, replace that and you may
as well just buy a new one. I love all of my old VW's (bus's, beetles & type
3's) and that's all I drive, they do all I need them to do and that's all I
ask.
