<At work, the employee parking lot has NO shade. None. I found that simply closing my stock Westy curatins , and parking with the windshield pointed away from the afternoon sun, my Bus will stay 25 degrees cooler.>

Also saw a thing on the web that said misting water would lower the inside temp too. Evaporation. Supposedly a squirt bottle with the tip set to mist. Squirt it around the interior for a minute or two. 

Dunno if that was supposed to be used with a/c.
