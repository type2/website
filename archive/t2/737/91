Subject: Re: Found Busses - one of 'those' stories

Wow! That's VERY cool.... although it's also kind of sad.... I really hate to see any kind of classic cars just left behind like that... especially those Busses. I mean, I have a Bay Bus, and I love it... but you don't see very many of those early Busses.  Man, I really wish I had the time or space to collect more cars... if I did though, I'd probably end up like that guy. (Cept that would be a parts hauler, not a fruit hauler). 

So you're going to restore the WHITE one? or the Red one? The White one looks like it's in the worst shape of all of them... at least, considering the fact that it looks like it was actually under water.. hehe.. but you say that one has the least amount of rust and whatnot? 

As for the Saab's... I've never really been into Saabs, but I kind of think that we should be obligated to at least tell them about it... a classic car is a classic car... even if it is a Saab.

I went looking on the web and found a place called www.vsaab.com

It's a Vintage Saab community.

They have a mailing list: list(-at-)VSAAB.com

If it's ok with you, I'm going to subscribe to their list later and tell them about your busses...
