Subject: HELP ON ELECTRIC

Well, this is the 1st time I really need help while working on my van
(77 transporter)

It has been a while now that I'm working on the electric, All went well,
very well
i should say, I did learn few more tips from last week post, very
informative.


Any how, while plugging the radio, I connected the wrong red wire... It
was so wrong that I have no power, what so ever anymore....   I realized
that that Red wired was the feed for the front light not the Radio red
wire.. what a idiot I am..( should not said that I don't use/need the
Muir book so much.....)

all my fuses look fine but I don't know where to start, if their is
another fuse elsewhere ... etc.. I want at least to get power to get the
van running... now it wont even do nothing........like nothing at all...

any idea..

regards

Patrick
