Hi Jon,

900 miles from Wisconsin to Oklahoma should be no problem, that's do- 
able in two days easy... Back in October my parents picked up a '67  
camper in Seattle and drove it back to Toronto.

As for the 79, in good condition you should face few problems.

Before the trip, have an independent mechanic verify the brakes,  
tires, steering and suspension and engine. Make sure the cooling tin  
is complete and functional, then have the oil and filter changed, set  
the valves and check vacuum, fuel pressure and compression.

After that you're good to go, but take the AIRS list with you just in  
case.


Happy trails,
