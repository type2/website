You will have no problem operating this system to keep  your bus warm as long as
you are in Miami Florida, or Pheonix Az.

OR,,if you keep your Bus in a heated garage,, and only have to drive 2 minutes
to work.... and park in their heated parking lot....

If you are thinking of using it anywhere cooler,,, and I might add somewhere
Like CANADA where is can get downright COLD.... then your out of luck.....
wait.. Unless

IF you add a second alterator,, and a battery pack that looks like an electric
car, or forklift set up. Then you will have enough electric capacity to power
it...
you know when a V8 car airconditioner kicks in,, the engine kinda slows a
little ..
well , when your heater kicks in,,, your 4 cylinder is going to grunt a
little....

unless of couse you use small gauge wiring,, and the voltage will be low at the
heater,, so the current will be less also.. and not as much power will be drawn
from the battery, invertor, alternator, engine...

but,, as the heat developed will drop off the power of 2 with the current... you
will not have much heat.....

ah,,heck I should have said...  ahh,, electric heaters will not work in a Vw Bus
in cold weather

Jamie Rivers
Free Heat system,, includes airconditioning
Now I have a heated bus in the summer,, and air conditioned bus in the winter
