Subject: sooty plugs, again  and again

---------- Forwarded Message ----------
siiiigggghhhh,
      i have a 75 fuel injected bus, automatic.  my fuel pump has been acting kind of funny lately causing some power issues.  it's an electric one.  this morning i filled up with bp 87 octane fuel and headed out to work.  did much many driving.  the head temps were usually low.  like 315 (-at-)65 into the wind uphill.  then later on in the day started to expeirence power loss on hills. then later on she died, started, ran for a bit.  i drove some more same power issues.  bad idle at stops, almost no power at go.  pulled the plugs when i got home.  they were covered in sooty,sooty black soot.  cleaned them.  checked the "new" rebuilt afm for mixture.  maybe a little rich.  adjusted.  drove around again.  same problems within minutes.  i pulled the plugs again.  cleaned them again.  repeat of previous.  repeat again, everything the same.  i am very frustrated.  does any one have any ideas, suggestions, paneceas, magic cures?  is it related to my fuel pump?  could it be the fuel?  i usually run shell.  the afm tested ok on the ohmeter.                             i'm ready to do great harm to the gosh danged, son of a goat.
