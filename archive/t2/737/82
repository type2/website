Hi Volks,

Tonight I pulled the tin, FI, exhaust  and fan housing off the  
sunroof engine. That's the engine which originally came to me  
installed in the sunroof bus with a single weber. Two years ago I  
pulled it out and had some refurbed heads installed and it has since  
lived the past two seasons in the westfakia. I've decided that it  
should simply go back into the sunroof from whence it came. Esp.  
since the engine that was in the sunroof last year is doing such a  
good job in the westfakia.

OH MY GOD, the amount of oil on that thing was DISGUSTING. There are  
puddles in the heater boxes, for crying out loud. And in the fan  
housing too. ICK PTOOOIE!!

The good news is that I'm pretty sure it was the oil cooler seals  
that caused the problem. I never took the cooler off when I swapped  
the heads out, and assumed they'd be OK. That area of the block seems  
to be cleanest, suggesting a regular flow of oil across it.  
Everywhere else the oil is caked on and scummy, which suggests it  
wasn't flowing anywhere.

Got any suggestions for dealing with this mess?? I'd prefer to leave  
the heads on if at all possible. I'm thinking I'll buy a very large  
plastic bin at crappy tire and a couple gallons of varsol, and just  
let the fan shroud and heater boxes soak for a week or so.


Happy trails,
