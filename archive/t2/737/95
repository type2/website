Subject: part number needed

I need the part number for the upper disk brake caliper mounting bolt 
for a 71 type 2. This is the special bolt where part of the thread 
length is machined for positioning the caliper. So far none of my usual 
parts sources lists this part. Any help would be appreciated.

Sincere thanks,
