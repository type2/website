Subject: KYB install

Hey, folks.  I just installed KYB Gas Adjusts on
the front of my 70 bus.  The diagrams with the
shock seem worthless.  

On the top of the shock, I installed those
spacers between the shock and the mounting hole. 
(In other words, bolt head, shock hole, spacer,
mounting hole in body, lockwasher, and nut.)  

A friend thought the spacer should have been
between the bolt head and the shock on each side
to basically shorten the bolt.  Thought that
might decrease leverage on the bolt.  

On the bottom, I installed the spacer between the
shock and the mounting bolt.  (That is spacer,
shock, strange flat washer, lockwasher, and nut.)
 

What is the right way?  




Happy bussin'
