Hi Andy,

If you swap the mechanical components, the wiring harness, AFM and  
ECU over you should be OK with the 78 FI on the 76 Bus.

I currently own two complete sets of FI gear for two FI engines. One  
set is from 1977 and the other from 1975. I can change the FI over  
from 75-spec to 77-spec or back in about 40 minutes; I've had to do  
this twice this year in troubleshooting.

Happy trails,
