We need to know which year so we know drums or discs. 

Also a funny thing I learned one time was that the side pulling wasn't the problem, it was the other side which had a stuck caliper and was hot - actually overheated. When I applied the brakes it was too hot to provide any friction and so the other side worked alone and pulled the vehicle that direction. 

Check to see if one side is hotter than the other. A hand close to the wheel (hubcap off) ought to tell a little there after a 10 minute drive. 

Fix was free. Removed piston, cleaned it with emory cloth, cleaned bore with emory cloth, cleaned both with brake fluid, and reassembled. Corrosion was the problem. 

flush and bleed your brake system today.
