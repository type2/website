It looks like #25 is where 24 screws into... Just a funny nut?

Thanks for finding that fiche. I've been trying to find it for a
while. I'm prolly just blind but I couldn't find it on the ratwell
page. :(

Now I know what bits I need. On the second diagram, I'm missing
everything past the cable except #14 and #12. Wow.
