Hi Cliff,

You're right on the money. This is already proven by Britt Grannis  
with the Toyota powered "RoadCow". He consumes a tranny a year with  
that thing. It sure does haul *ss though. I rode in it at Everybus  
2002 and it was way faster than a baywindow had any right to be.

Every now and then I put my foot to the floor in my employer-provided  
GM 3LV6-4-speed-automatic and think that it might be nice to have  
that much power in the bus. But when I can drop the engine on the  
weekend in less than an hour I remind myself that faster isn't always  
better. I stripped apart an 88 Vanagon WBX engine on the weekend and  
the plumbing nightmare on that engine was atrocious. Thanks be to God  
that I don't have to reassemble it!


Happy trails,
