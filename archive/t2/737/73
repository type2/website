Subject: Fw: Re: [T2] Brake help in Seattle area?

Thanks to Tom for the suggestion.  After receiving his reply, I checked the
Library with respect to brake hoses and found this article:

Sounds like a good test to confirm that this is my problem... and a relatively
easy fix, too!  Gotta love it.

Cheers!
