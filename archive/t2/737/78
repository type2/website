I'm with you there -- *but* I sure don't mind reading about the adventures and
exploits of the folks who *do* upgrade their Buses' engines!

Being a contrarian myself, I can understand why the idea of driving an
inherently slow vehicle *fast* fits the same kind of personality inclined to
buy an inherently slow vehicle in the first place:

(1) We all drive Buses in part to be different from everyone else on the
road.

(2) Some people modify their Buses to be different from other Buses.

(3) The one thing that *everyone* knows about VW Buses is that they're slow.
What could be more unusual, more surprising, or more fun than to drive than a
VW Bus that goes fast?

Of course, the folks who actually implement #3 tend to be those who also enjoy
a good technical challenge...
