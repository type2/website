Subject: Re: [T2] Brake help in Seattle area?

Hey Miles
couple of thoughts
What other people have mentioned about the hoses collapsing puts you on the
right track.
What happens when the hoses collapse internally, is that when you push the
brake pedal the fluid is pushed outward applying your brakes, but because
the pressure pushing the fluid back is weaker the brakes stays applied. If
you had drums I'd say they were just out of adjustment, but as you have
discs what I would do is pull apart the caliper and clean the piston and
caliper and replace the seal. My guess is you'll find some dirt or debris
keeping the piston applied and causing that side to pull.
In fact, if it were my bus, I would just replace the hoses and seals on both
sides. 'Course goes without saying check the rotor for runout and replace
the pads.
