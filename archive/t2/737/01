Subject: type 2 list server commands

seeking the knowledge of the list on whether there is a webpage on the 
type2.com site that details sever commands that can be made by subsribers. 
i looked around for a while and the best i could come up with was:

http://type2.com/type2subscribe.html

i'm heading out of town for a couple of weeks and would like to set my 
subscription to nomail, but that doesn't seem like its a listed option. 
maybe i'm just to tired these toothpicks are starting to bend :(.
