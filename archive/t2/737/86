Subject: still problems starting

A few weeks ago I posted with problems. I was out driving and my bus died. When I tried to start it my idiot lights went dead and nothing from the starter. I Followed the advice Karl ( and others) gave me (thanks) and replaced battery and ground cables (both of em). Still no luck. I brought my battery down to Pep Boys and their test showed it was toast. So I sprung for a new battery. Put it in tonight after work, but no luck. Here's where I am:

Turn key and starter spins slowly (maybe 2 turns per second) and gets slower until it stops turning altogether. If I try it again I get nothing from the starter.

Next step?? Should I pull the starter and have it tested?
Another question : I tried bridging the connections on the solenoid, but I can't seem to with my screwdriver, the piece of plastic between the bolts gets in the way. I used an old wrench held with insulated pliers and it sparked, but the starter didn't turn. Can I make a jumper wire with push on connectors or will they get melt to the bolts? ( can I just disconnect teh wire from teh battery and touch the different terminals? What do you all use?

Sorry for the long post. Weather should be nice this weekend so I'd love to drive.
