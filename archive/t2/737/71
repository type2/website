Highest probability: Plugged rubber brake flex hose. Replace all 4 of them. 
This is a no-brainer. Even though they look great outside, they're plugged 
up internally like blocked arteries, allowing fluid to go through under 
pressure, but slowing it's return.  You should also remove all drums and 
check for leaking wheel cylinders, and unseize your brake adjusters.

<I think there's something wrong with my Bus's right-front brake: it's 
pulling
to the left whenever I step on the pedal.  The harder I brake, the harder it
pulls.  The problem does not get better or worse after heavy or extended
braking.

I know virtually nothing about brakes or front-end work, but would like to
learn.  What could cause this?  Air in the brake line needing to be bled 
out?
Some sort of problem with the master cylinder?  Or an unrelated suspension
issue?  I don't think I'm leaking any brake fluid.
