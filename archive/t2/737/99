On my '78 Westy one of the brake lines is collapsed (the rubber part). I can apply the brakes normally but when I remove my foot from the pedal, one side (driver's) won't relax. Acts like a check valve. Affects steering if I am pushing the van around, makes it feel like it weighs about 30,000 pounds <griN!> 

Honestly anyone who does not know the age of their brake lines prob ought to just replace them in the name of disaster prevention.
