I should clarify that (luckily) I'll get to have a "shakedown" trip of
sorts. After picking up the bus in Madison on Saturday, I'll be
driving back as far as St. Louis that evening. That first 350 mi trip
should give me a feel for how the bus handles on the highway, and I
can make any needed small adjustments at my brother's place on Sunday.

We'll spend Sunday in St. Louis, and then return to Oklahoma City on
Monday. Normally, the trip from OKC to STL takes around 7hrs, but I'm
planning for 10 or so with the baby girl along for the ride. Plus, the
7-hour trips have been made in our Audi with the cruise set around
80mph, which just ain't gonna happen with the Westy! Thanks for the
advice; I'm going to contact the seller about having those items
checked out.
