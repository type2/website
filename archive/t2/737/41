Subject: Trip report: Picked up the DC

Well I finally got to pick up Willie the '70 DC and it was quite an
adventure as he lived about 5 hrs away but the wife said we're in the
neighborhood we have to go pick up this couch at her Mom's another two hours
past that.  So she drove me down, we got him and then she drove behind as my
emergency chase vehicle.  Well, Willie had even more rust than I thought, if
it weren't for the floor mat, there would be a hole in the floor of the cab
that could easily swallow a leg.  His seats were well worn, his headliner
ripped, his bed dinged up, he even came complete with a bullet hole.
HOWEVER, his 1776 totally spanks!  He's incredibly easy to shift and he
moves right along.  Totally smokes my 2.0 FI Vanagon (not fair its heavier).
Well I totally surprised everyone, Willie made it down to the Mom in law's
house, kindly accepted a giant couch and hauled it back home about 300 miles
getting 19 mpg's all the way.  He doesn't look like he could do that.
Never even got the oil temp above 220 and we crossed 4 mountain passes in
mostly 4th gear.  It really is love already.  Now I gotta get on that rust.
Wow I'm really overwhelmed with that part of it.  Oh and the brakes are
obviously not power assisted in any way.  And he doesn't lock up, oh yeah
and his heater is like nonexistant. Etc etc.

Cheers, Nik
