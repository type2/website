I have to agree with that one.  I was amazed that
people actually soup-up and drag race VW busses.  Why
do they do it??  'Cause they can!  

More power to anybody that can do anything unique to a
bus.  Look at Everybus or any VW gathering and you see
individuality.  Few prefer straight stock all around. 
If it's ok to modify the body or interior, what's
wrong with upgrading the engine?  

As far as conversions go, I have issues with putting a
Japanese engine in a VW.  But I understand.  If that's
what you want, more power to you.  I just love a good
german aircooled engine.  I'll sacrifice power for a
nice sound, reliability, and not having to deal with a
difficult re-engineering job to get it to work.  But
then, what do I know, I'm a musician with limited
mechanical ability.  Cheers...KR
