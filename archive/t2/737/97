Subject: Re: [T2] part number needed

From bill moon:

 I need the part number for the upper disk brake caliper mounting bolt
 for a 71 type 2. This is the special bolt where part of the thread
 length is machined for positioning the caliper. So far none of my usual
 parts sources lists this part. Any help would be appreciated.

This pic from the fiiche is a little misleading:

It is 73 and up.

While researching your bolt question, I did find something else. A lot of people have been wanting the special
plates, 6A and 6B, in the lower pic. They keep the caliper piston from rotating.
They are ONLY on Girling calipers! Girling was used from 76 to 79. ATE used flat plates. ATE came on 73 to 75
buses. Before you guys run around looking for something you think the PO threw away, make sure your caliper
really used them!

OK, now back to the bolts:
71-72:
upper bolts    N 10 127 4        M12 x 1.5 x 30
lower bolts    211 615 141         ?

73-79:
upper bolts    221 625 141A    M14 x 1.5 x 34
lower bolts    N 10 127 4         M12 x 1.5 x 30

Does the 73-79 lower bolt look familiar?  It should, it is the upper bolt on 71-72.
