Subject: Sun Screen for Windshield

Does anyone have the link for the outfit that cut custom made windshield sun 
screens??

These sun screens were made of a plastic that were stored as a roll, and 
when released, they snapped open into a flat piece that fit into place.  
They are custom cut to the model of car (VW??) that you ordered.

Thanks
