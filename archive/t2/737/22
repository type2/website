Good analysis.  My physics students often ask "why do I have to learn this
stuff?" and the answer of course is so that they won't fall for dubious
claims like this.  P=IV, it's not just a good idea, it's the law!  :)

I'd say that asking your battery to supply more than 500W for anything but
the shortest periods is asking for trouble.  The only circuit in your car
that pulls more than 500W is the starter and check out the size and length
of the wires it needs to function and the length of time it functions.

The only electric solutions to heating a bus are those you put right next
to your skin, such as electric blankets, clothing, or seat pads.  Nothing
electric will heat the air enough to make you comfortable.  Even the small
catalytic heaters fall short of the mark.  The only real heat solutions
are a gasoline or propane-fired furnace, or a stock heating system in
excellent working order.
