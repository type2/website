Subject: Oil Breather

I'm finding my way around the bus engine in preparation of dropping it
to stem some oil leaks. I've done some reading in the archives and
Bentley and would like to know more about the oil breather. I assume
it's purpose is to ventilate the crankcase and recirculate some gases
as part of the anti-smog system.

When I popped the bail handle on top I found the space inside the
breather stuffed with paper towels! It wasn't gummy or "cheesy" or too
oily inside. I assume the PO did this to lessen oil leaks and reduce
oily gases from fouling the air intake for the AFM. The towels were
made into a pad that fit the inside dimensions and then another towel
was just wadded up filing the rest of the cavity. I found this amusing
and annoying at the same time.

I don't suppose that paper towels were part of a filtration of
crankcase gases. The bus runs good (needs tune up) and I haven't
driven it since I've been messing around in the engine compartment.

Is there a filter media inside the oil breather? Could a freely
breathing filter media be used to reduce the potential for oil leaks
or dirty oil vapors from geting into the combustion air intake? What
are good methods to fit this gasket and bail to prevent leaks. The
caps doesn't seem to fit as tight as it should.

Thanks in advance,

Rick
