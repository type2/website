Subject: METAL TAG

I found an aluminum tag taped to the storage compartment
under the drivers seat when I bought my 1980 vanagon a couple
months ago when I was cleaning it.  The tag looks like a key code
tag with vw/audi logo and 7 digits .  00xxxxx.  The numbers on the tag do not
match
the 4 digit key code found on my door handles.  The tag was taped with
masking tape and was very brittle and appeared to have never been removed.

Any ideas of what this is?
