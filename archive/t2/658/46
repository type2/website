Subject: Paint for cold weather?

I was wondering today if anyone knew of a paint and/or primer that is 
suitable for use at temps between freezing and say 40 degrees.

I want to do some bodywork on my bus and it lives in a car port. I don't 
mind working in the cold but I want to be able to at least prime it when 
done moving metal. I have a compressor, sprayer, etc and will buy paint 
from an automotive paint supplier if I have to. But, is there even a 
reducer / activator that will work that coldly and still give good adhesion 
to the metal?

Chris
