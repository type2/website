Ok I have the solution here. We are both correct. I was commenting on
the picture daniel posted which shows the distributor connected
correctly [0]. I'm pretty sure you are commenting on something daniel
said in the text of the post that seemed to indicate he had switched
from what the picture showed to the opposite, which like you are
pointing out is 120% wrong (inflation you know :)

In case daniel hasn't seen this yet the library article is:

haven't been following that, but it could be what our disagreement was
about. Commenting on two different setups daniel had at different
times.

are we looking at the same picture ray? The pic listed above shows
this exactly as you describe, so it should be correct.
