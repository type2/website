I also thought it might be to keep it more out of the way when working

 I wonder if it is a serviceability issue. When you look at that circuit you
 have some 5 plus wires on the 12 V + side of the battery. These could
 junction any place before a load and still function the same. The starter is
 simply a secure, out of the way place to have them all meet. That seems
 better than having to remove them all from the battery every time it is
 serviced.
