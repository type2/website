Thanks Dave, here are my responses.

I've verified and reverified and rereverified again that they are going to 
the right places. Wire above notch is going to #1  and the rest go counter 
close wise 2,3,4 correct? Also I have physically verified TDC and the pulley 
notch is stock on this engine and marks 5ATDC.

I tried sucking on both ports, the arm doesn't move at all. Could it be 
hooked up incorrectly or does this mean 100% that the vacuum is kaput?
