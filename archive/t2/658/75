A sure sign of a pre-existing condition in fuel or starting system.

 Oh well; perhaps I'll pull the engine, rebuild it again, and see if that
 fixes it.  If not, maybe this is a sign that I should get rid of the Bus.

Certainly shows no need to pull the engine. If you have good
compression, you are barking up the wrong tree! I certainly wouldn't
get rid of a perfectly good bus over a hard starting troubleshooting
problem.
