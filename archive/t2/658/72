I wonder if the double-relay is properly working? If it isn't starting
running the fuel pump when the key is in the "start" position, then
you are waiting on the engine to turn over enough and open the afm
flap so that the contact that controls the pump works and you have
pressure. Perhaps a quick jumper wire to the pump from a 12v source
before starting tomorrow morning would either confirm or bunk this
theory.
