I have also wondered why the alternator wire goes to the starter rather 
than the battery. The theory I have is that because the engine moves 
relative to the battery any wires that go between them will flex. This is 
more of a problem for thicker wires as they are less flexible. The VW 
engineers had no choice with locating the battery to starter wire, but they 
did with the alternator wire - hence it goes to the starter, not the battery.

I also thought that I'd better leave the alternator wire where it was to 
avoid becoming a DPO (well, more of a DPO). :))
