Subject: RE: [T2] More vac dizzy fun on 71 1600 dp...

My first question is this, where does the brake vaccuum
>booster plug into on a 71?

This is a really big port just below carb on drivers side, can't miss it. 
There's should be a teeny one also on manifold on same side before the 
manifold turns down to meet with heads. Get both plugged tight.

I would make as few changes as possible to get it in tip top running shape. 
Adjust valves, leave the current dizzy, throw new points and condensor 
in...(gap points), change fuel filter, then time engine, then carb 
adjustment. It's take me time and pratice to get decent at the timing/carb 
adjustment thing, you might try to find a friend or someone to help if you 
can.
