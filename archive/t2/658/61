Subject: Hard Starting When Cold

Hi Folks,

Since I got my rebuilt engine running back in September, I have been dealing 
with a hard-start situation when the engine is cold.  It used to crank for 8 
pulses and fire; now it cranks for 8 pulses and *almost* fires.  After that, 
it takes 3 or 4 tries (8-10 pulses each) before it sluggishly comes to life. 
  This is a 1977-spec 2.0 FI engine with 26,000 miles on it, with single-vac 
dizzy timed to 8* BTDC.  Valves are adjusted to .006, and engine is running 
15W-50 Mobil 1 oil with Mahle filter.

I usually start it with the parking brake on, clutch in, and no feet on 
either brake or throttle.  Sometimes I flutter the throttle to help it 
start, but that seems an intermittent fix at best.  When the engine is warm, 
it fires right up and idles fine, if a bit high (1000 vs. 850).

I replaced the Temp Sensor II, which got it idling more normally.  I also 
tested the cold-start valve by removing it from the plenum and squirting it 
into a jar while cranking -- fuel spray is normal.  I also tested for vacuum 
leaks with starting fluid at all hoses -- no RPM changes, and all hoses are 
on tightly.  I checked for bad grounds by wiggling the FI wires on the 
block, and checked for good FI connections by unplugging and re-plugging the 
injector connections.

Is there something I'm missing?  Is there something else I should test for?  
Is there something else I should replace?  Now that the cold weather has 
come to WNC, I'm worried about killing my battery trying to get this 
sluggish engine to start.  I enjoy driving my Bus so much, it seems a shame 
to be annoyed at it for such a simple problem.

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.

Best,
