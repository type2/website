Here are photos of what my linkage looked like when I managed to
rearrange the linkage to fit with my new alternator.  This should help you to
see which piece needs to get turned around, and which way it needs to
end up facing.

Before installing my alternator, I had the joy of buying THREE rebuilt
Bosch genators in about 5,000 miles.  Yes, that's four generator
failures: I installed the first rebuilt generator, which I bought from
Northwest Connecting Rod.  That failed after a few months.  Thinking I
might have done something wrong to bring on an early failure, I had Mike
Schmidt, a well-reputed Seattle VW mechanic, install the next one.  It
failed after one day of driving, so Mike installed the third one too.
That failed a couple of months later.  With newfound confidence that my
problem was simply the extremely poor quality of the rebuilt generators,
I bought and installed the alternator conversion kit from the Bus
Depot.

Since putting everything back together and figuring out the accelerator
pump linkage, I've driven my Bus about 3,000 miles, including a
2,500-mile trip from Blaine, Washington to L.A. and back.  In all that
driving, the new alternator hasn't failed at all -- not even once!  I would
have gone through at least two generators by now.

So, at this point, I can recommend the alternator conversion with
confidence.  I deeply regret ever having bought a rebuilt generator.

Cheers,
