Daniel,

Based on your picture, you have retard going to the carb.  I'm not sure what
that port is, but it is supposed to go to the manifold (I recall the
conversation earlier this week, and I agree with Joe Mitchell's response).
advance is on the correct port.  I run a 205E with the retard disconnected
on my T1, and runs fine. set to 7.5 BTDC at idle, vac lines disconnected.

if that doesn't work. . .
I had a similar problem, this used 205E would skip around and not hold a
consistent advance.  The main problem was that the advance plate was binding
on the lower plate--you have to disassemble it almost completely to get the
plates out, mine had some galling between the plates, I had to sand the
galling down with fine paper, lube with white lithium grease, and now it's
much better.  yours may have worse problems with radial play in the dist
shaft but that's what it was for me.  check it with a timing gun at least so
you should see exactly what its doing.

good luck and keep us posted,
Will A.
