Subject: Fitting a 34PICT3 on a 1600DP With alternator

Hi,

I've been making some progress getting a '71 1600DP close to running,
but I've hit a snag.

I removed the carb that came with her a Webber DCNF which I couldnt get running.

I've replaced the webber intake manifold with the stock intake after
cleaning out the heat riser. I've now got everything pieced back
together and went to install the 34PICT3 Carb but the throttle linkage
to the accellarator pump is hitting on the side of my alternator.

This is frustrating, as its taken me a while to get to here and now
that I'm so close I'm stuck.

I found some info in the archives:

"Actually, the 34PICT3 carb has the proper accelerator pump linkage available
for it so you don't have to grind clearance on the alternator.  Basically what
it does is reposition the actuating lever to the top and pulls on the pump arm
rather than pushes.  "

Does anyone have a part number for this item? 

Also, what's the consensus on just grinding down the alternator case
(which I'd rather not do, but will if necessary)?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions

peace
jules
