This model FI calls for no throttle in any weather to start.

 tested the cold-start valve by removing it from the plenum and squirting it
 into a jar while cranking -- fuel spray is normal. 

This test calls for you to time how long the cold-start valve sprays
according to factory spec chart of time vs. ambient temperature. It is
not necessary to remove the valve. You can use a test light or ohm
meter at the electrical connector to measure the duration of the
signal.
