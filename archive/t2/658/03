Subject: Re: [T2] vac dizzy help on 71 1600 dp...

Daniel,

look for the notch on the inside lip of the dist....is it where the #1 
wire is on the dist cap?

Been a long time since I looked at one of these, but it looks to me like 
the wires are 1 off, or the distributor is timed off...I seem to recall 
that the dist should be turned about another 30 degrees or better in the 
clock wise direction.

Go here and check specs and compare points.  http://www.oldvolkshome.com/


You never blow on a vacuum port to test it, only suck.  If you do this and 
the vac arm inside doesn't move, then part of the vac unit is shot...or if 
you suck on it and just keep getting air, then the vac unit is shot.

Personally, at this point, I would disconnect the retard side and 
temporarily plug the line from the carb...and then try it....if the retard 
side really is leaking, then you probably have a serious vacuum leak.

What is the total advance?  Does it match the spec on Ron's page above?
How good does the spark look?

Cheers, dave
