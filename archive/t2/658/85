Subject: RE: [T2] Hard Starting When Cold

Hi Folks,

Thanks for the helpful advice.  I'll check the relay, the fuel pump, the 
dwell, the cold start valve, and the valve lash.  My vacuum readings seem a 
little low -- does anybody still have the link to the cool animated webpage 
with the vacuum gauges?

It also occurs to me that I have not re-torqued the heads yet, although it's 
only been about 1200 miles.  Maybe THAT's the cause....

Sorry for the frustration earlier -- I feel like I'm SO close to getting it 
right, but it's still such a mystery.  Once again, The List is a great 
resource for these fascinating vehicles.

Best,
Jason Z Upper
