Subject: Pushrod Seals

Well, I've been putting it off for some time now, that little tiny leak 
that would drop a few specks on the driveway has slowly grown to a full 
fledged puddle and I am getting rolling on the pushrod seals tomorrow. 
Glad this is a Type4 engine, being a '73 1700, so I can do it with the 
engine in.

 From my inspection of the tubes from below I can see EXACTLY where the 
leak(s) are from on two tubes but I can also see some dents and marks 
on a few tubes. The marks on the tubes weird me out a bit as my tin is 
in place and the deflectors have been in place as long as I have owned 
this bus.

I've been surprised over and over again at what the PO had done to this 
engine so I am kind of stoked to get my pushrods out and tubes out to 
see what condition they are in. Anyone had any deformed pushrods / tube 
damage ?

Also, any tips on keeping the leaks from happening when I put in the 
new seals ? I was planning on doing my usual "non hardening sealant" 
approach along with the gaskets but I as always I love to hear the 
experiences of others.

Steve
