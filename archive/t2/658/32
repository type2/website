Except that he hasn't verified he has a bad
vacuum mechanism.  And he apparently still has
the vacuum lines incorrectly attached. 
Disconnect the retard, and recheck.  I KNOW that
the port more on the left and toward the front is
a proper port for the advance, which is the rear
port on your dizzy (that is the outside of the
vacuum can).  

I'm not sure about the other port on the very
rear of the carb.  And it's too cold for me to
test mine tonight.  

That is a 34PICT carb, right?  

Also, spend some time with this:
