Subject: Sami Dahklia's 911 conversion

I've been chasing Sami Dahklia's 911 conversion pages all over the web, 
from one bad link to another. Does anyone on the list have a current, 
working address for these pages? Or, did anyone happen to save the 
pages and pictures of Sami's conversion?

Many thanks.

Mark
