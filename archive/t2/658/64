It's 30F in the morning where I am and the FI never ceases to amaze me in it's ability to start instantly, no cranking. It takes a moment to come up to a nice idle but I attribute that to the cold. Unless it's far colder than where I am, the 8 crank and fire is a sign of a weakness in the system already.

When was the last time you put your battery on a charger?

That's the aux air regulator job to help the engine idle when cold.

What condition are your spark plugs and rotor in? I would also do a compression test with those new heads of yours.

I know it's winter but did you install at CHT gauge yet?
