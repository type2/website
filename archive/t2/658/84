valves would not have anything to do with missfires

This is common, I would check your valve covers first though. They can leak
esp if you are in and out adj valves and arn't replacing them and or
cleaning them well.

I would like to see a pict of your engine before attempt any diag of your
missfire.

With that missfire is just that, ignition. reaks of timing
