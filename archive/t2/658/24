I wonder if it is a serviceability issue. When you look at that circuit you 
have some 5 plus wires on the 12 V + side of the battery. These could 
junction any place before a load and still function the same. The starter is 
simply a secure, out of the way place to have them all meet. That seems 
better than having to remove them all from the battery every time it is 
serviced.

2 cents and bucket of chicken, anyone want to build a car?
