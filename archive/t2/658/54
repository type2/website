Subject: Re: [T2] dizzy rebuild was vac dizzy help....

The image you see has not been doctored or altered by anyway and has been 
confirmed by a professional photo analyst that is authenticate. :)

Just to clarify the photo was the setup that I thought was correct but 
couldn't get it to run very well at all. Since then I did change things 
around thinking I had it screwed up before I gave up and pulled it.

Also I forgot -  I took a pic from the engine it was installed in (assuming 
of course the PO had it correct).

I'll let you know if I can free the arm and get this bad boy running 
correctly, but it will probably be this weekend. Thanks for the help.
