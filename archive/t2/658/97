Subject: putting disks on a 68-70

i did the job on my 70 - short version is you need everything from 
the ball joints out up front AND everything from the bearing housing 
out on the rear. .. stub axles and backing plate included. you WILL 
NEED to swap out the rear stuff or be doomed to carry two spares, as 
the front and rear RIMS will not match. not swapping stub axles WILL 
cause problems mounting the drums.
your ebrake cables and lever hardware will have to be bodged - i 
still have the 70 cables in mine, and they are too long. i think i 
have 73+ ebrake levers instead of early 72, too :P
you don't need the booster, but you DO NEED the proportioning valve. 
be aware that the booster system CAN be put in, but then you need the 
whole BEAM from the donor bus, or you will have to weld a bracket of 
some such to hold the booster on. also, there is a brake-system 
plenum in the driver's dogleg on the disk busses, but you could just 
run a hose to a big coffee can ziptied somewhere up front :)

capital letters indicate the problems i encountered that you can 
avoid if you heed them!
