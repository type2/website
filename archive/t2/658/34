Subject: Late disk swap on an early bus (70)

I'm going to be needing brake work soon, as my
master cyl is leaky.  I had a disk swap in mind
anyway so I think I may do it all at once.  I
plan on adding 73+ components.  My understanding
is that I'll have to scrounge everything from the
hubs out, wheels, a master cyl, and maybe a
proportioning valve. I will not bother with the
booster.  Sound right?

Happy brakin'
Ray
