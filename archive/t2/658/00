Hi Mike,

That inlet doesn't go through the fuel tank area, it goes through the 
45-degree slanted section in front of the fuel tank and passes directly 
through one single sheet of metal to the underside of the bus.

Somewhere at home in my garage I have this vent, chopped from a donor 
bus for a potential BA-6 transplant that will never happen.

That reminds me.....
Anyone in the market for a **complete BA-6** ?  I pulled this from a 
bus I was stripping, and I have EVERYTHING. Unfortunately I don't know 
if it works. Everything but the belly pan will be included. Now taking 
offers, I can post pics if wanted.

Happy trails,
