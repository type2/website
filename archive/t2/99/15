anyone else seen the new VW commercial. it features a beetle, splittie,
Pasat, NB,  and shows "Something" coming down the road.  can't tell if the
splittie is a 21 or 23 window deluxe since it is only a front quarter
view.

Same old same old...My local VW dealership has a Beetle 'vert on the show-
room floor (roped off); but the parts dept. hides under the counter if any-
one asks for "period" air-cooled parts..."We'll get back to you on that" is
the usual line...Sniff, sniff...and they never call back...
