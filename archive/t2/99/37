Subject: Which Condenser?

Hey Everyone,

I am sitting here with two condensers in front of me, and I can't figure out
which one to use.  Please help! 02086 is the condenser the local VW place
gave me but 02086-009 is an exact replacement for the one I pulled off the
distributor (even down to the little rubber cap on the bottom).  I am
running a 009 that the PO installed. 

Thanks,
Matt
