Subject: more on VW ads

last week while watching Speedvision (can't remember the
name of the show) i saw a replayed television ad.

the ad concentrated on a new feature of the beetle - a larger rear window.
IIRC, the ad went something to the tune of, "the VW beetle is so close
to perfect that this is the only change needed."

then it showed comparison pics of a split-window beetle vs. the new, larger
rear window.  i think they said this was for '58 model year, but i really can't
remember.

it was really neat, though.

happy friday,
