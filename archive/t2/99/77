No shims there.

I put the old assemblies back on, and carefully noted all happenings as I 
did same.

Clutch plate not mounted,
the release ring and the release levers normally apply maximum available 
push of all  AWAY from the clutch plate.

When the entire clutch assembly and drive plate are being bolted to the 
flywheel,
the clutch assembly release levers still continue to push outward with the 
release ring is still outward.................but less so than before the 
bolting up process was performed.

As you start to bolt everything up, the bolting process starts to "suck" 
everything into place and the springs load in a bit.

Now I see what I did not see before............. I guess !?

Thanks all,

Bob Perring
