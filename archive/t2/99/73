===================>
Yes, I removed the "staples".
I think the "new" clutch I got is not right, and I may have to put the old 
one back in. :-(

It seems to my mind that the release ring and the release levers would 
normally be loaded / nest AWAY from the clutch plate, and the release 
bearing then pushes them inward during gear changing.

Damn !
