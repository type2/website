any loading or unloading of said vehicle *into* or *out of* (enclosed trailer
of course) will be done in a vacuum sealed staging area lined with NOS rubber
floor mats, and lighted with NOS Hella light bulbs thus making the DC fell as
if it is still in Germany. Once loaded the DC will be "secured" down using NOS
EMPI camber compensator straps around the front beam and rear axle tubes, these
will be attached (with NOS KAMAX bolts) to NOS seat belts that in turn will be
secure to the floor of said trailer with NOS RASCHE bolts. Once secured the
trailer doors will be sealed and the thermostat set to 70 degrees +/- 5
degrees. At this point the pumps and recirculation units with the NOS Germany
air will be engaged filling the trailer with the the air of Der Fatherland.

Once the 5 mile drive to the body shop for "touch-ups" is made this procedure
is reversed for unloading.

Just joking David.............
