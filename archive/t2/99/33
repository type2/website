Rick,

It *will* work.  Might not be the optimal arrangement but I don't want 
people to think that the system will not cool.  I can say this with 
conviction because my 134a system uses the "stock" 1973-vintage evaporator, 
expansion valve, and condensor designed for R-12 and anyone who has ridden 
in my bus on a 90-degree day will tell you that it works.  Freeze-12 
requires a license to purchase, 134a does not.  I just picked up 12 cans of 
134a at Costco for $27!  That alone might be a good enough reason for 
someone to decide to use 134a even if it means their system will not cool 
quite as well.

As for the compressor, I do have a Sankyo rotary but it performs a simple, 
constant function and I don't see any reason why a York shouldn't compress 
R134a as well as a Sankyo or any other brand (seal issues aside).  The York 
simply does it less efficiently.
