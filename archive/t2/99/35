A little levity to our sometimes heated online discussions :)

CYBERBULBS 

Q: How many people does it take to change a light bulb in cyberspace? 

A: 1 to successfully change the light bulb and to post to the mail list that

the light bulb has been changed. 

14 to share similar experiences of changing light bulbs and how the light 
bulb could have been changed differently.

discussion and its inappropriateness to this mail list.

email exchange to alt.lite.bulb. 

203 to demand that cross posting to alt.grammar, alt.spelling and 
alt.punctuation about changing light bulbs be stopped. 

111 to defend the posting to this list, saying that, "We are all using light

bulbs and therefore the posts **are** relevant to this mail list."

the best light bulbs, what brands of light bulb work best for this 
technique, and what brands are faulty. 

27 to post URLs where one can see examples of different light bulbs. 

14 to post that the URLs were posted incorrectly and to post corrected 
URLs. 

3 to post about links they found from the URLs that are relevant to 
this list, which makes light bulbs relevant to this list.

footers, and then add "Me Too." 

12 to post to the list that they are unsubscribing because they cannot 
handle the light bulb controversy.
