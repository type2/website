You are right David, I forgot about the hightop.  But I do remember you
saying that your AC is very minimal and you were going to try freeze 12 in
it.  I just didn't want people to try the r134 and find out the expensive
way that it just doesn't cool that well.

That's what they tell you, but I don't have a license and just bought a 25
pound bottle of AutoFrost.  The AutoFrost was about $7 a pound compared to
around $40 a pound for r12.  I plan on doing a couple AC busses.

With the compound freons, you can use all the old VW components, just
replace the old hoses with new and charge away.  The compounds will blend
with any r12 left in the system.
