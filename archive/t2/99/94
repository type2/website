Subject: temp sender size

I am having a new motor built and want to protect it the best I can. I 
have decided a temp gauge
using a sender in the sump plate would be a good idea. What size does 
the hole have to be? I plan
on getting a sender from Bus Depot if that matters. I am also 
considering a head temp gauge kit from
Bus Depot. Do you think having both is overkill. I am also considering a 
oil pressure gauge too.
