Subject: Having crank and rods machined and email was down.

Hello list,

I wanted to thank everyone who has answered my
questions lately regarding driving with an open
sliding door. I think I will take your advice and keep
it closed. The only time that I plan to drive with it
open is if I am crusing at a top speed of 25-35 mph
down the roads by the beach.  

Has any one here ever had their crank machined and
their rods machined and rebushed at Rimco like
suggested in the Type IV Bug-Me-Videos? If so, About
how much did this cost? I have never had this type of
work done before so I am quite ignorant about prices
and procedures. If any one can contribute any
information on this subject, I would really appreciate
it. Oh, My engine is a 1700 Type IV if any one was
wondering. 

On a off topic subject, if any one was trying to email
me today, my mail box was full and I did not receive
it. If you did, just send it again and I will get it.
Good luck with your VW projects and thanks in advance
for any information that you might give.

Have a great day!

David Kelly
