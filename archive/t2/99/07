Subject: Re: [T2] Seats

My 72 had comfy honda bucket seats in it when it was given to me (I'm still
saying thank you)
Problem was they were bolted to 1/2" plywood that was bolted to the deck.
I didn't think the seat belt would hold me in my seat if the seat was flying
out the window in a crash so I grabbed my falling apart stock drivers seat
from it's corner of the garage and cut the bottom of the frame out(the part
with the rails on it).
Then I sat it on the bottom of my honda seat and welded it everywhere it
touched.
Now I have an adjustable in all directions bucket seat.
For the passenger side I just welded the honda seat to some lengths of 3/8"
plate and bolted it to the deck.Sounds like a hack job but it looks and
works pro, passed inspecton too.
Something to try.
Brian
