I would ask for the mechanical one because of the pressure issues .
Then, if yoy decide down the road to go to fuel injection you can buy the FI
pump.
If you dont ask for the mechanical one they may send you a case that doen't
have the hole milled for it, then you only have one choice.
Also if you do end up running a low pressure electric one for any reason,
get one with adjustable pressure.
I believe Bugpack makes em.
Good luck

I just got off the phone with AVP. I ordered my rebuilt engine.

I have the stock 1700 in my 72 now, and I have heard of the benefits of
upgrading to the 2000 and wanted to, but I just couldn't afford it. I
noticed the 1800 was only a little more so I figured I could at least do
that.

Well the pistons, etc. are on nationwide backorder for the 1800, so they
gave me a deal on the 2000. You only have to pay the $1100 initial price and
they are waiving the core price, which is $400!! Also they are running a
deal on the hydraulic lifters at $100 for the kit instead of the normal
$150. So even with shipping all the way to me in NC I only pay $1320. Not
bad for the 2000 and hydraulic lifters! If you were thinking of buying one
now is the time!

I only have one question..she asked me if I was going to keep my mechanicl
fuel pump (stock on the 72) or if I was going with the electric one which I
guess came on the fuel injected models. I told her mechanical. Is that the
best thing for this engine? I am going to use dual weber carbs.

Thanks for any input!
