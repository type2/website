I have 78 auto tranny and have had the engine out more times than I care
to think about and the only time I took em out together was the first time
I needed to work on the tranny.  never again they are just too heavy
together (not sure of exact weights but auto tranny is heavier than
manual)


> Any procedures/shortcuts/step by steps for the complete imbecile would be

use a magnetic socket to take out the three bolts holding the flex plate
to the torque converter, and guard em with your life, they are unique and
not replaceable  (looking for spares if anyone has a couple)

also make sure the pump shaft, the small center tranny shaft does not come
out with engine, just push it back. 

also remember to disconect the accel linkage AND PUSH IT BACK INTO THE
HOLE IN THE FIREWALL

also the coil has to come off the engine to get it out, ask me how I know?

also be carefull of the torque converrter it is quite heavy and can easily
fall off the tranny.  carefully pull it straight out and lay it flat.

also change the torque converter seal while there, it is a couple dollar
part that when fails in a royal PITA to change..one trick it is on the
tranny not the torque converter and it can be pushed all the way in, DON'T
it sits flush with the front of the tranny opening


good luck

> great. I have the Haynes, but not the Bentley.

get the Bentley, has more info on the auto tranny
