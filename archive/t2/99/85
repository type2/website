Hoover was trying to get a book out. Last I heard the hang up was 
finding a graphic illustrator that would not break the bank. That was 
at least 3 years ago so perhaps the dream died. If you were lucky 
enough to get a CD it is a neat resource because it is in .pdf format 
and is really handy to work with.

I miss Hoover.
