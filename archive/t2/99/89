Subject: Hyd. valve help

Hello,
It is time for me to adjust the hydraulic valves for the  first time on
a rebuilt AVP motor (78 2.0L FI). Aaron and Leon at AVP recommend that
the valves be adjusted after about 1500 miles and that they be set at
3/4 turns in.

The problem is that the service manual says 2 turns and others have
recommended 1 turn and 1.5 turns.

Is there a consensus?

Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Chris
