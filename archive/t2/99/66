Subject: RE: [VB] RE: [T2] RE: [VB] Vintage Parts Score

Now Greg HAS the right idea!!!!  Actually, I'd settle for plain old original
bolts as NOS fasteners have never been a requirement... heck, I've pushed to
find nice used restorable parts way more often than for nos stuff... NOS
simply means there is way more depreciation the instance you fire it up.

... I just hope all you people that will have parts this Sunday at Octo will
have the few screws and bolts that I'm still looking for...

GregB proposed:  any loading or unloading of said vehicle *into* or *out of*
(enclosed trailer
of course) will be done in a vacuum sealed staging area lined with NOS
rubber
floor mats, and lighted with NOS Hella light bulbs thus making the DC fell
as
if it is still in Germany. Once loaded the DC will be "secured" down using
NOS
EMPI camber compensator straps around the front beam and rear axle tubes,
these
will be attached (with NOS KAMAX bolts) to NOS seat belts that in turn will
be
secure to the floor of said trailer with NOS RASCHE bolts. Once secured the
trailer doors will be sealed and the thermostat set to 70 degrees +/- 5
degrees. At this point the pumps and recirculation units with the NOS
Germany
air will be engaged filling the trailer with the the air of Der Fatherland.

Once the 5 mile drive to the body shop for "touch-ups" is made this
procedure
is reversed for unloading.
