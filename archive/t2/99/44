   I have been dealing with a VW parts (wholesale) supplier that has been in
business for 36 years that is clearing out DEAD INVENTORY. They have parts
going back 36 plus years including Genuine VW parts, Boge shocks, Fichtal
and Sachs shocks, ton's of engine parts etc.. I will have a complete
inventory list (of what I'm getting) and pricing.
   One item I'm working on getting are 10, 2 litre type 2 engines Factory
Rebuilt in South African engines.  These should be priced well with-in
reason.
   I got lucky because the person they brought in to help clear out the
stuff knows me. 

I will keep both list informed on the progress of this deal.
