I did this with a motorcycle, putting a part or two per night (whenever I 
thought of it) into a 7-11 dumpster and a restaurant dumpster. Didn't take a 
very long time, and I didn't pay a thing to haul it away.

The other option discussed was a big ramp to drop it into the dumpster 
whole, but that might be even less practical for a full-size bus carcass.
