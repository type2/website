I found my wiring wasn't correct.. altho I didn't pinpoint the exact error..
but something was firing the injectors .. I could hear them click.. and the
pressure would drop off.
I went over all my connections and have been successful in getting good
results that meet Bentley Specs
35psi with no vac,, 28 psi with vac,, and it holds about 34 psi for almost
an hour now..
