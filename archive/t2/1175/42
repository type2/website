I drive a 1995 Astro daily.  The cup holder is down between the front seats,
and at 55 yo, I am an exceptionally safe driver, never exceeding the speed
limit.

The worst it would probably do in an accident is hit either the seat bases
or the underhang on the engine hump.

If the accident is serious enough to send it airborne, we're going to have
other things far worse to deal with.

Thanks for the warning, though.
