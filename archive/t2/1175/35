Awesome overdesigned cupholder.

Unfortunatley if I had a 64oz Thirst Buster mug, I'd be needing to rig a bedpan to a "weep hose" to store under the front seat or I wouldn't get more than 60 miles in a stretch...

mug, after fruitlessly trying to find a cup holder that will handle a cup of
this size.
