Subject: Re: [T2] front brake hose

As I mentioned I'd definitely always replace fronts as a set, but I think even
that neglects 2 more hoses needing replaced.  Don't stop at even 2, if you
don't know when last changed, replace all 4.  Then we get to hard lines...

Also, hoses should always be replaced as a set (in my
experience and
opinion), like calipers. Some disagree, and I'm OK with that.
