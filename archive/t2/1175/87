Subject: Inside pull-shut door handle screw does not hold on 1977 Type

     Changed the lock on the driver's side door on my 1977 Westfalia 
bus. Now can not get the screw closest to the front on the inside 
pull-close door handle.
     Any suggestions?
     Screw is metric. Am not sure what size.
