Subject: Re: [T2] Which oil?

Actually, well posted on the internet that no standard Valvoline, Penzoil, or
Quaker Shit (oh yeah, said that) in standard weights (5W30, 10W30, 10W40) has
much ZDDP anymore.  Some of the oddball heavier weights do, Shell Rotella T in
30 and 15W40 diesel both still have minimally more, the Mobil 1 in 15W50 does,
I think one of the Castrol GTX heavier weights, Valvoline Racing in 40 an
50 do.  Most of the other common diesel Delvac, etc, do not by analysis posted
on bobistheoilguy and other places.  I actually got a good deal last fall at
Walmart when I noted Briggs and Stratton detergent SAE30, which is high in
ZDDP (by analysis on bobistheoilguy) as it is not auto formulation was
clearanced for $9 to $3.50 for a 1.5 qt bottle, I see now that spring is here
it is $9 again (in AK at least.)
 
Best bet to me is Rotella in your choice (I
like both) and 1/2-1 contatiner of ZDDPlus added.  The Brad Penn would get you
to the same place but isn't around me, and shipping ZDDPlus is cheaper than
oil.  Plus I think I ran the numbers and it was cheaper as well if you buy 25
containers of ZDDPlus, even if you use a full container.  But this summer I'll
be running a lot of the B&S as I bought 10, 1.5 qt containers.  Will go in the
SC, the '77 Westy, an the Triumph.
 
YMMV.

I'd use 10-40 if in a
temperate climate, or 20-50 if I lived in a hotter climate. Try and buy diesel
oil, it has more zinc in it, which fights scuffing. Use a good brand. I like
Penzoil or Quaker State.
