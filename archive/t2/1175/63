Subject: Oil drain plug won't tighten

This is in an air cooled 2.0l motor (my daughters).
I pulled the oil drain plug and when I went to put it in it's just 
not tightening up.

I just looked at the book (Bentley, 68-79 Bus, page 5-25) I need to 
see if the sealing ring (24) is still stuck to the case or if it was 
just not there..

Best thing to do? Suggestions?
Thanks!
