Chris -

See my specs on:

German original SVDA:

Bosch Mexico SVDA:
http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ignition.htm#A905205ZB

I've never had to re-curve a distributor for a particular carburetor
before.  The specs should be the same for either the H30/31PICT or the
34PICT.  They're essentially the same carb, just with a 34mm throttle
bore on the 34PICT.

I've run an unmodified Mexican SVDA on a Single Port 1600 w/H30/31 and
then that same distributor now on a 92 Mexi-Beetle with a Chines
34PICT.  Runs great in both applications.
