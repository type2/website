Subject: 77 Westy - Uneven brakes on front end after sitting a year.

My 77 Westy was fine when I parked it last year. I recently decided to move it to start going through it, and noticed that when I drove down my driveway and put my foot on the brakes, the front passenger side disc brake skidded the tire when I applied the brakes, while the driver side one seemed to act properly. I tried it 2-3 times with the same result. The brakes release fine,just the uneven braking up front. These are ATE brakes, not Girling. Would appreciate any experience people have had with this?
Thanks,
Courtney
