Subject: Re: [T2] flywheel?

OK Kevin 2 ways to do this  leave the 6 volt flywheel and change the  
starter to 6 volt one , you will need a special bushing to do this.  or  take a 
12 volt flywheel and use a brake lathe to cut the outter most part on the  
inside where the o ring goes away.  doing this allows the 12 volt flywhhel  to 
mate with the 6 volt style of crankshaft.  the end step on the cranks  are 
a different lenght.  later  mark d

starter I was planning on using. I need to get a new flywheel, as  the one I
have is 6V. I'm trying to understand what the correct type of  flywheel to
get. It looks like there are a lot of options- I don't really  understand 
the
difference. 



I vaguely recollect, that there  are different types of seals for the
flywheel-some o-rings etc. So ideas on  all the parts I will need to install
the flywheel would be appreciated.
