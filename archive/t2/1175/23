Yer NEVER too old. I graduated college at the ripe old age of 50!!

Besides, if yer like me you're not going to die 'till middle age. When I
kick the bucket, people are going to say "it's too bad he died at 105 years
old, he was only middle age!!"

I'm putting a band together and hitting the road.  OK, that's a lie.  
I'm way too old for that kind of thing.  (50, for those who have to 
know.)  I want to tour the US in my bus but don't have room for other 
band members.  Besides, I'm not Indie.  I'm mainstream jazz.  And still 
glad to be back on solid ground.  Thought you guys might enjoy this.  
It's almost Friday.  Ciao, fellow VW heads.....KR
