Subject: 71 Master Brake Cylinder still good?

Installed new German master cylinder on my 71 Westy - still had problems, I
replaced it again and found out it was the Booster all along. So is first
master cylinder I took off still good? I bought both of them from Ron at BD
($199 less list1e discount) 

 

Would like to sell it. Give it a good home. German Made.
