It'll change your rocker geometry for that valve.  Jake has an extremely 
thorough method on his forums for getting the valvetrain geometry dialed 
it, and if I remember correctly, it involves adjusting the pushrod 
length (which you have effectively done) or shimming the rockers.  I 
would have an issue with the difference in lifter lengths, but I'm kinda 
picky about stuff.  Would it actually make a noticeable difference, who 
knows?!
