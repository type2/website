Thanks,B  I turned the engine so the notch on the pulley was at 0, both valves
free on number 1 and the rotor was then point at 730- 8 o'clock.B  I turned
the case of the distributor (009) so the notch is also there and rearranged
the plug wires .B  Was able to start the bus and adjust the timing, although
my timing light showed it to be way advanced.B  I'll look at it again next
weekend. B  Thanks everybody for the advice.

Does the bus run? B If so I would simply ensure the timing and dwell are set
correctly and drive it. B The risk involved with potentially dropping a shim
washer for the drive is likely greater than just wanting to align the
distributor correctly.

When I turn the engine so that the distributor drive shaft is approximately at
the 12 degree offset shown in Bentley, the notch on the crank pulley is ~180
degrees off, not at zero like it should be.B B Is it possible for the
distributor drive shaft to be installed wrong?B B I would note that the notch
in the distributor case was not in the place it should have been either.
