called the depot and Oliver was as confused as I, he went back in the 
warehouse and the onnes he pulled down had the grooves.

only thing he could think of was it was mispackaged or bad part. in any

putting a notice to check em before sending them out.

"major job" list.

part. will send em back. bought four clips too.

thanks all for the quick replies.  sometimes when it doesn't fit right, it 
really is the wrong part...
