Hi Volks,

Over the weekend I was able to find time to drop the engine and replace 
the clutch. The disk was quite a bit thinner than the new one, though 
no-where near worn to the rivets.

Once I put it back together, everything was operating as usual. The bus 
is now (more or less) ready for the annual pilgrimage to Everybus.

Happy Trails,
