Thanks, John.  Here's another fun fact for Friday:

http://www.cleveland.com/books/index.ssf/2012/03/chitty_chitty_bang_bang_fli
es.html

Chitty starts out in this book as a 1966 VW van, though the book never
mentions the VW part, only referring to the car as a "camper van".

Having read the original book by Ian Fleming (of James Bond fame), this was
a great start to the rest of the coming trilogy.
