Jamie I did find the spec in my "Bosch FI and Fuel Management" book which is
at least 1 bar (14.7 psi) at 20 minutes for pulsed injection, of which L-jet
is the second oldest Bosch form.

Now something else, you have 5 more
potential leak sources of course to consider, 4 injectors, 1 cold start
injector.  I will admit that they usually just seep/drip, and usually fail
closed, but they are possibilities.

I am tuning up my engine, as it has sat
for a while....
one thing I would like to confirm,, is the fuel pressure
should stay when
the engine is off..
with a search of the archive, I found Don
had noted..
From: DurocShark
Engine off: 39
Engine idling: 34
While driving:
40

My pressure is correct, but returns quickly to Zero as soon as the engine
is
off..
