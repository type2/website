Subject: Re: [T2] Which oil?

The mechanic who built and services our 2 litre dual carb uses Fuchs  
20w50.
I don't know which version as that is all that is listed on the  
invoices.

I know I changed the oil/filter my self a few changes ago & used a good
quality 30w oil.  Mechanic not impressed at next service and as the  
motor
has done 60,000 kms without a hiccup since being rebuilt, who am I
to argue with him?
