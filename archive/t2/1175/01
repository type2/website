Subject: Re: [T2] front brake hose

I think you got something you shouldn't have or you need something else Bob. 
You need the clips, as you surmise (and new are cheap if rusted BTW.)   These
are a pretty common initially Super Beetle part, and should defintiely have
the grooves as pictured on the BD site.  Without the groove and clip, nothing
to stop the part slipping and the bracket cutting the hose with time.

Send it back.  BTW
gores without saying, if you have to replace one, replace em all, the day you
don't stop is coming otherwise...

BUT
  there is no groove in the
metal ends to slide the U shaped flat piece of metal onto that holds the hose
tight at both ends and keeps the metal lines from vibrating or flexing. 
wondering if maybe I got the wrong hose or if this is a problem with the
aftermarket part or if it is what we have to live with,
