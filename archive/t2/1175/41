Just trying to get people to consider something they may not have 
thought about before.  Any solid, heavy loose objects in a vehicle 
become projectiles in an accident.  The way I see it, our busses are 
dangerous enough as it is, why make it even worse?  If you wouldn't want 
someone to throw a particular object at you from across the room, then 
it should be strapped down or otherwise secured in your vehicle.  We 
have all done dangerous things in the past and most of us have been 
lucky enough to survive them.  That doesn't mean it's a good idea to 
continue to do them.  I used to carry all kinds of loose crap in my bus 
- tools, spare batteries, etc.  Now that I am older and wiser, that 
stuff is all strapped down.
