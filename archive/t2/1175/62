Subject: parking brake cable

Quick question-

The emergency brake cable should run above, below or through the rear
trailing arm on a '69 single cab:

 

a)under

b)over

c)through

d)what cable?

 

I think (with some help from a local mechanic) I found the problem with the
emergency brake cable on my '69  single cab. The PO ran the cable through
the trailing arm. When I returned the rear to stock height (it had been
lowered) and replaced the cables, I ran the cables through the trailing
arms(as that is how they were). We think the cable should be running under
the trailing arm, but I just wanted to double check before re-routing them.

 

I guess the PO ran it through the trailing arm when he lowered it, as it was
too low to run under it.
