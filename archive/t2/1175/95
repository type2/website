I'd think you could just retorque the nuts and see how it works out as 
the gases escaping at the bottom of the cylinder shouldn't even be that 
hot (relative to the cylinder temps).  What's odd is where all that 
pressure is coming from.  I never have really paid attention to 
crankcase pressure, but there really shouldn't be that much pressure 
that it's able to blow by an even reasonably loose seal - that's gotta 
be some significant pressure (I would think).  Again, I thinking out 
loud here...
