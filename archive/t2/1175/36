Subject: VW Bus coffee mugs

I found two ceramic coffee mugs displaying vintage VW Bus images.....like 
the grandparents of my 76 Westy.   They are fine bone china made in 
England, and ring like a bell when you tap them. Found mine ("Grand Day 
Out") at a TJ Max store in Cleveland Ohio for ten bucks.  It was the only 
one on the shelf.  The ones offered on the web sites are denominated in 
British pounds.

I enjoy using the mug in my home every day, and will carry it in the Westy.
