Courtney,
 
pretty much you already know the answer, something is dragging on
that side.  Could be caliper, or hose, your choice where to look first.  If
the hoses are recent, I'd pull and dissasemble the caliper, probably
reassemble without even a kit if things look OK seal wise.  If the hosen't
aren't new within your recent history, I'd just replace (both) as well.  I'll
bet there will be a combo of minor (or major) hardened gunk or frank rust on
one or both caliper pistons on that size.  Remember when blowing them out,
block of wood between, fingers no where near.  After 20 years of working on
cars I took off the tip of my L thumb about 5 years back rushing on probably
the 100th caliper I've rebuilt in my life, so be careful.  Don't split the
calipers of course as well if you don't have body O-rings for them, I usually
find you can do a lite hone with some wet/dry, anal cleaning after doing so,
without taking them apart to stone hone them if they are
 worth the effort.  If it takes more than that, you should probably be taking
them and trading em in on rebuilt, Advance Auto shows the right side ATE for
$49 with $35 core:

Ron may or
may not be cheaper.  I'd also bet that side isn't releasing as well as you
think it is.  The whole thing may work itself out with some use to some
extent, but I sure wouldn't trust that it does, not with brakes.

My 77 Westy was fine when I parked it last year. I recently decided to move it
to start going through it, and noticed that when I drove down my driveway and
put my foot on the brakes, the front passenger side disc brake skidded the
tire when I applied the brakes, while the driver side one seemed to act
properly. I tried it 2-3 times with the same result. The brakes release
fine,just the uneven braking up front. These are ATE brakes, not Girling.
Would appreciate any experience people have had with this?
