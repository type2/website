Sounds like it stripped :(

Regardless of whether the washer is stuck to the case or the screw, the 
hole is still stripped.  Stop at your local parts store and pick up a 
self-tapping oversized oil drain plug and carefully retap the hole.  I 
had to do that with mine and I coated the bolt with a lot of grease and 
carefully screwed it in a little till it started cutting a few threads, 
backed it out, cleaned it off, more grease, screwed it in a little more, 
backed it out, cleaned, greased, and repeat.

It's just one of those things that happens to a 30+ year old engine.
