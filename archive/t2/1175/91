Subject: Re: [WetWesties] 77 Westy - Uneven brakes on front end after

 A number of people have suggested cleaning the rotors of any rust, which they do need. I am going to give this a go and see if there is any difference. Next will be new brake hoses, and then if still a problem, new calipers.
Thanks folks!
