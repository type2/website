Subject: Question about rear brake line rubber grommets

I'm working on a 79 bus and it's in need of rear brake line grommets. 
On my bus (a 78) it looks like there's one grommet that holds the steel 
line to the rear axle radius arm, then there's another grommet where the 
line enters the axle wheel bearing housing and another where it exits 
the housing - the 79 bus is missing the housing grommets.  I looked at 
the fiche that's listed on thesamba and it only shows the grommet that 
holds the brake line to the rear axle radius arm - does anyone know 
where to get the other two?

Thanks,
Mike
