Subject: front brake hose

just had to replace the front flexible hose between the body and the front 
wheel on my 78 bus.  got one from Bus Depot and it fit fine although it 
was a bit longer than the old one.

BUT
   there is no groove in the metal ends to slide the U shaped flat piece of 
metal onto that holds the hose tight at both ends and keeps the metal 
lines from vibrating or flexing.  wondering if maybe I got the wrong hose 
or if this is a problem with the aftermarket part or if it is what we have 
to live with,

how did you secure the ends so they won't move around and possibly get 
damaged...

I looked at maybe grinding a groove into the ends but the metal is much 
thinner and I don't think there is enough to get even a small groove in 
it. 
also the metal ends are smaller in diameter so even if there were a groove 
I don't think it would seat tight.????

I took photos and can send them to anyone interested but have no place at 
the moment to post em.
