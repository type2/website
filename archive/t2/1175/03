Subject: Re: [T2] front brake hose

Bob,

Definitely the wrong one. I have never seen one without the grooves in both
sides. Definately don't modify it (or any brake line part).

The holding clips are readily available. CIP1 even offers the clips and the
hoses in stainless (not to send business away from Ron),

Also, hoses should always be replaced as a set (in my experience and
opinion), like calipers. Some disagree, and I'm OK with that. ;)
