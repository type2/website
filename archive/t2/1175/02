sigh,,I dunno if there is a better hose...  I had to gerry rig something 
before.. I used 2 cable ties in an X pattern thru the hole and over the 
hose.. on the steel part of the hose, not the flex part.. holds very well.. 
and I use the extra strong UV black ones... so I am comfortable the hose is 
held just as strong as a tin clip.
YMMV
