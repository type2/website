I go one step further when I do this, and slowly flush about 1 qt kerosene
down the fill with the plug out after retapping just to rinse out shavings,
which you may very well find in the pan.  Then I usually flush about a 1/2 qt
of cheap (even used) oil through as well and put in the new oversized plug and
refill.

The rubber expander plugs actually can give fair service as well for
a massively overstripped plug.

store and pick up a self-tapping
oversized oil drain plug and carefully retap the hole.  I had to do that with
mine and I coated the bolt with a lot of grease and carefully screwed it in a
little till it started cutting a few threads, backed it out, cleaned it off,
more grease, screwed it in a little more, backed it out, cleaned, greased, and
repeat.
