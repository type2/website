Subject: Exhaust leak

Well after a long wet winter in the Pacific Northwest I am finally  
finishing installing my new engine. This is my first rebuild and I am  
having trouble getting a good seal on my heat exchangers to the cylinder  
head. I followed Richard Atwell's instructions and that helped, but I am  
still struggling. Are there any other good tips or tricks? I am putting a  
rebuilt 1800 into a 1973 van.
