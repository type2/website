Hi Daniel,

If you are talking about the seals between cylinder head and exhaust
manifold, the place where you need oval copper gaskets, then you may
want to make sure the header flanges are true and in the same plane.
Use a straight edge to check. If they are not straight or if corrosion
took a bite out of them, have a machinist work them with a flatbelt
sander.
