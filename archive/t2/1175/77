Subject: Re: FI Fuel Pressure

I am tuning up my engine, as it has sat for a while....
one thing I would like to confirm,, is the fuel pressure should stay when
the engine is off..
with a search of the archive, I found Don had noted..
From: DurocShark
 Engine off: 39
Engine idling: 34
While driving: 40

My pressure is correct, but returns quickly to Zero as soon as the engine is
off..

I pinched off the return line ,, this makes the pressure increase ,, and
shut off the key at the same time.
the pressure still falls quickly,

then I did same again, only I pinched off the line at the pump.. and the
pressure still falls quickly

so,, I am assuming there is a check valve in the FPR, and the pump, and
neither are working,

How can I confirm where the check valve is,,  Bentley doesn't talk about
pressure in the off state at all that I can see.

I guess I can swap in new parts,,  :(

Thanks
Jamie
