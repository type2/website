Subject: Passenger seat rails (or some other approach)

A while back, I picked up some fluffy vanagon seats to replace the 
vinyl-over-springs seats I had in my 78 Riviera Caper Van. I finally 
slid the driver's side seat in yesterday - ah, how wonderful! And after 
some elbow grease on the rails, the seat actually adjusts!

The passenger seat, on the other hand, has me scratching my head. It has 
the pivoty welded in deals that hook on to the seat bottom and the hooky 
thing behind the seat that hooks on to the seat back - no rails. I think 
from looking at the type2 archives that I am going to need to weld in a 
set of rails if I am going to use that seat. My questions are:

1) Where would I get the rails to weld in? Is removal from a junkyard 
bus /in situ/ feasible?
2) Is there some other option to adapt or modify the new seat (or 
bracket) that you've seen or done? I don't really care if the passenger 
seat adjusts. I just want it to be safe and stable.

Thanks!
