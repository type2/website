Cheers, and happy Full Moon!  Met a chap the other day, and he was 'turned on
to me', by someone who told him I 'did' VW vans.  He found me and asked if I
had any info on how to put a Porsche 911 aircooled six, into the back, of a 76
Westy.  I said I would check with the list 'Gurus', for any info I could
glean..so..here I am..and any info to 'How to sites', or anything ..'positive'
on this topic, would be gratefully  accepted.  Thanks
Cheers
