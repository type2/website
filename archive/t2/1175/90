As per usual John and others, thanks for the excellent advice. I've had the
caliper piston extended out without the brake pads in, to get a good look at
it, and it's nicely clean. I've also moved it in and out using a c-clamp and
it seems smooth. In any case I will replace the rubber brake hoses as I know
they swell over the years. My other thought (and I haven't checked this yet)
is that the OTHER side might not be doing it's job (blocked brake hose?), so
will check that out as well while replacing the hoses. Nothing like picking on
the one side when the other may be at fault.
Take care
