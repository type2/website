David has a good point there, but if your van is like some of mine have been,
a 10lb weight will be the LEAST of your worries.  Hmmn, what is that spare
longblock going to be like unrestrained crashing around when I roll an '86
vanagon.  Oh yeah, I've done it...

Does bear some thought about the things
carried about pretty commonly for me, 50lb toolbox, all kinds of tools, tons
of stuff just bought at lowes, the everpresent unrestrained (when child not
present) carseat, even though they clearly say to strap it down.

Of course
the fondest memories of my youth were long trips around WV and on vacation
(say for instance taking US50 from WV to DC or US19 from WV to FL) riding in
the back of the '73 or '76 where dad would pull the middle seat and me and my
2 sisters would sit on the floor, play games, sleep, eat, whatever.  Something
had to keep us busy in the days before personal entertainment devices.  And I
say this as a pediatrician and all, we mostly still made it out alive.  Could
have been worse, could have been riding down the interstate in the back of a
pickup.

I hope you don't think I'm being a jerk for saying so,
but in an accident that 10lb weight could seriously injure you or a passenger
in your van.  Please consider another way of keeping the drink secure.
