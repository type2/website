Subject: Circle K Thirst Buster 64oz DIY Cup Holder

It's Friday, so here's an idea that I developed for my 64oz Thirst Buster
mug, after fruitlessly trying to find a cup holder that will handle a cup of
this size.

This one does not tip over or slide around the floor, saving me the wet mess
that ensues even though the mug has a lid on it.

The other holder is mounted in my golf cart on the fold-down table (first
picture):
