Subject: Re: [T2] Which oil?

Jake is sort of a pansy on that IMO, there are lots of good choices/options
for flat tappet engines, you just have to be smart enough to make your own if
you need to.  He simply presumes I take it that people will not be smart
enough to know the issue or take precautions which is a bit insulting to an
informed consumer, but perhaps is true...
 
But if I was lucky enough to be
able to get it for $5-6/qt off ebay shipped to AK, I would probably use it. 
Brad Penn does get favorable analysys reviews on  bobistheoilguy.  However if
I recall it actually doesn't have levels that much more than 15W50 Mobil 1 by
analysis.
