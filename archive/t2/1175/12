for what it is worth
years ago I did something
similar
and I used the 6volt starter motor
on 12volts.  engine spun real fast and
if you don't hold the starter on more than a second
or two a motor can be overloaded for short periods of
time with little damage.,  my 6v starter was working still when I sold
the car several years later, not sure how long it lasted for the new
owner.

what have you got to lose, heck grab a spare starter and hang on it.
