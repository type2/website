Subject: Cylinder gasket(s) - Head torque - #4 cylinder combustion cycle

Stock 1600 rebuilt 20,000 miles ago.
Rebuild was meticulous, and involved brand new Mahle cylinders and pistons.

Formsomemtime now, I have been hearing what I thought was an exhaust leak,
which went away soon after the engine reached warm temp status, but further
inspection revealed the noise to be coming from base of #4 cylinder.

I have removed all tin to go to work, and, as I suspected, I discovered the
head torque values to have "stretched" loose.. very loose.

I have re-torqued head nuts to 23 ft-lb all around.

Question:
Do I need to pull the cylinder and replace the #4 cylinder gasket, or might
just the re-torqueing of the head solve my blow-by at the base of #4
cylinder?

I am somewhat reluctant to pull the cylinder, bare the piston, etc., etc.,
etc.
