Subject: Distributor drive shaft question

So I bought this '75 transporter off ebay...B 



When I turn the engine so that the distributor drive shaft is approximately at
the 12 degree offset shown in Bentley, the notch on the crank pulley is ~180
degrees off, not at zero like it should be.B  Is it possible for the
distributor drive shaft to be installed wrong?B  I would note that the notch
in the distributor case was not in the place it should have been either.
