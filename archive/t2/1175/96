Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder gasket(s) - Head torque - #4 cylinder

I believe so, as well, but wanted to ask this group to see if we think same.

gases escaping at the bottom of the cylinder shouldn't even be that hot
(relative to the cylinder temps).  What's odd is where all that pressure is
coming from.  I never have really paid attention to crankcase pressure, but
there really shouldn't be that much pressure that it's able to blow by an even
reasonably loose seal - that's gotta be some significant pressure (I would
think).  Again, I thinking out loud here...
