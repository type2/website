Ya, the picture I linked was of crankshafts out of a motor, which is not the
same view as looking at one installed in the motor.

Your picture looks like a non-stepped crankshaft.
  The o-ring FW goes with the non-stepped crank.................

.......... :)

do check the end play afterthe FW is installed.  ;)

hope that helps

I think I am getting it.
I need to figure out if my crankshaft is stepped or not. Ibm thinking that
since the flywheel I took off had an o-ring on it, then the flywheel I put on
should be the type that takes an o-ring.

I looked at the pics on the website you sent me to, and I can pretty clearly
see the difference. When I take my flywheel off, I see the part that has the 4
dowels sticking out. I thought this was the end of the crankshaft, but it
doesnbt look the same as the pictures.

How can I see the end? Ibve posted a pic of the connection point of my
flywheel - http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/album_page.php?pic_id=913487

Or maybe I am reading too much into this. Maybe if I donbt see a step, that
means I can use the 12V o-ring large clutch flywheel. Is that what you are
saying?

Thanks for the clarification.

yes, flywheels can be

-12V or 6V -  # of teeth

-stepped or O-ring

-large clutch or small clutch.



generally you find  6V stepped small clutch, and 12V o ring large clutch, but
there are other combos.    1500 engines used large clutches, which did come in
later 6V  split buses.    I have even found a small clutch 12V FW.



if the cranks is not stepped, you can use the 12V o ring large clutch FW.

you can see a step at the end of a stepped crankshaft.  when you have the FW
off.  It meshes with the step on a stepped FW.
