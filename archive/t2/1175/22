Subject: Touring as an Indie (in a VW bus)

I'm putting a band together and hitting the road.  OK, that's a lie.  
I'm way too old for that kind of thing.  (50, for those who have to 
know.)  I want to tour the US in my bus but don't have room for other 
band members.  Besides, I'm not Indie.  I'm mainstream jazz.  And still 
glad to be back on solid ground.  Thought you guys might enjoy this.  
It's almost Friday.  Ciao, fellow VW heads.....KR
