I found a picture of the phoenix I was thinking of... I forget if I sent it
already,,

One of the magazines did an article on a  Phoenix .. it was an orange one..
and they made the center part into a camper trailer format... the sides
folded down,, and the top went up.. and there was canvas that covered it to
look like a pop up tent trailer.

I liked it! .... I thought to build one of my own a few times ,,
