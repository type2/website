Subject: felt in flywheel question

I brought a flywheel to rimco for balancing and the removed the steel 
felt retainer that's at the center of the flywheel (79 bus).  If you're 
not totally sure what I'm talking about, it's a thin piece of metal, 
shaped like a ring, about the size of a ring and it fits in the center 
hole in the flywheel.  One side of that "ring" is flanged inward to hold 
a piece of felt from moving.

So, I'm trying to figure out which way that flange is supposed to go. 
Is it supposed to hold the felt against the pilot bearing, or is it 
supposed to hold the felt the other direction (which wouldn't really 
make sense).  Usually it's missing whenever I've pulled off a flywheel, 
but I want to get this right.  I'm guessing that it's supposed to hold 
the felt in place against the pilot bearing and keep dust from getting 
into the bearing - that sound right?  In other words, if the ring was 
installed with the flange towards the transmission, (not the crank), the 
only way to install the felt would be to insert the felt from behind the 
flywheel, then bolt the flywheel on to the crank.

Sound right?

thanks!
Mike
