Subject: Re: [T2] flywheel?

maybe maybe not  the difference is the end cut on the crankshaft   6V is
6mm  12V is 10mm   the 6v flywheel with the o ring came on  the 66 bus,ghias.
still might not mean a 12V flywheel will fit without cutting .  bolt it up
and then remove the gland nut and look to see if it fits flush  against the
crank  later  md

I  actually have 2 b 6V flywheels, one that does not use an O-ring, and one
that  does. The one that uses an o-ring is  the one that was on the engine.
So  I think a new 12V flywheel will be the same connection, right? Ie, I won
bt  need to machine the 12V flywheel, as the crankshaft is set up to take a
 flywheel with an o-ring.
