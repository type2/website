Subject: hydraulic lifter length

I have a 2.0l dual carb in a '73 Westie.  One lifter was soft so I replaced
it with a spare I had that was never used.  The new lifter is about 1-2 mm
taller than the one I removed.  After bench bleeding it appeared to adjust
to spec (1-2 turns from contact).  The engine has less than 4,000 miles on
it (don't run it enough).   Does anyone see a problem in this one different
size lifter?

 

Thanks,

Tom
