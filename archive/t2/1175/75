Subject: Need to change my email

Hi Volks:

After one too many battles with AT&T and I changing my email and want to 
stay on these lists.  However for the last 10 years I've been getting 
mail form the list via Thunderbird, not the web page.  Can you both 
respond off list to me with instructions of how to make the move?

Thanks,

BEN
