That's all in my back yard, Jamie.  Come on down!  I've been through 
Lynchburg hundreds of times.  I'm from Lawrenceburg originally and have 
family there.  We used to drive through Lynchburg every time we went 
'home.'  My favorite, and I'm surprised you know about it, is Point 
Park.  Because it's not advertised like all of the others.  It's a 
national park.  But what a piece of real estate!  Best view in the 
state.  Or close to it.  Bugapalooza is coming up next weekend.  Google 
it!  Ciao....KR
