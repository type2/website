First you need to verify that you have the correct #1 firing TDC.  Pull 
off the passenger-side valve cover and have someone rotate the engine 
clockwise while you watch the front-two valves.  The very front one is 
the #1 exhaust valve, the next one back is the intake valve for #1. 
Watch the valves opening and closing (top of the valve towards the 
engine).  Watch the exhaust valve open (while piston goes towards the 
top of the cylinder), then the valve will close, and when it's almost 
closed the intake valve will open (piston now sucking air/fuel mixture 
into the cylinder).  Now keep rotating until the intake valve closes. 
Go back to the engine compartment and keep rotating the crank clockwise 
until the timing mark lines up with 0 on the timing scale (about 180 
degrees of rotation).

Now you have the engine in the #1 TDC *firing* position.  Go ahead and 
adjust your distributor drive gear so it's at the correct angle per the 
Bentley while being careful that you don't drop the washer into the 
engine.  If your distributor still doesn't line up, either the 
distributor drive dog is installed 180 degrees off or you have the wrong 
distributor.
