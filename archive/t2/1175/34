Subject: Full advance for SVDA?

About 48,000 miles ago I bought a new Meximotor for Lurch.  With it, I also
got a SVDA distributor.

Recently, while chasing down a vacuum leak, I found two - one was in the brake
booster servo, the other was in the throttle shaft of the 40-year-old 34
PICT-3 carburetor.

I had s relatively new H30/31 carburetor laying around, so I put it in.  I
asked to have the the SVDA distributor recurved for the "new" carburetor and I
was obliged - provided I made a purchase alongside of the service.

I got the distributor back (with some of the parts I ordered) yesterday and
installed it this morning.

I can only get about 12 degrees advance out of the distributor (hose
disconnected and vacuum port plugged).  Is this right?
