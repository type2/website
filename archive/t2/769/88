Well, as promised, I will have them cheaper - AND better.

I liked the design of the one shown in the above link (the mounting method
is absolutely brilliant!), but I had an improvement in mind. So I called the
manufacturer and asked them to do a minor rework for me. They had a version
that added a small mesh pouch between the two cup holders for a cell phone.
Good idea, I thought, but somewhat limited. Since the bottom was mesh, small
items could fall through so it couldn't be used for general storage. Why not
make the bottom solid instead, so in addition to a cell phone it could be
used to hold spare change, pen, turnpike ticket, etc.?

I told them I'd take 100 units - but only if they modifed it to my specs,
for no extra charge. They agreed, and they're arriving next week.

Because 100 is a lot of units to stock at once, I'm going to offer the first
50 for $19.95. (That's $10 LESS than Mid-America Motorworks charges for the
one that has only cup holders.)  Once the first 50 are sold I'll raise it to
$24.95, which is still a very fair price IMHO.

To order at the $19.95 price, go to
<http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=BD102>  They won't ship until
next week, so if there are other items you're ordering that you need sooner
than that, put them on a separate order. Once the first 50 are sold the
price will go up. (Actually, the first 49 - I'm keeping one for my crew cab!
:-)

I also had them make half a dozen 68-78 Beetle ones with the same
modification. (They also fit '71-72 Supers.)  If you have a Bug, or know
someone who does, you can order those at
<http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=BD103>  .  I'm not sure if I'll
reorder the Bug ones once they sell out; it depends on how fast they move.
