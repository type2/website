That socket seems fine.  3/4 drive, so make sure that you have the proper
breaker bar or slide handle for it.

I would avoid 1/2 drive 36mm and 46mm sockets.  I've broken 1/2 inch
breaker bars on ordinary gland nuts.  Sure, Sears will replace them if
they break, but why not get the right tool (3/4 inch) and avoid the trip
back for replacment?
