Subject: Window support clip broken

Volks,

So I am winding my window closed at the end of a drive.  It chatters a bit
(as it has been doing lately) and then the window falls into the door with
a "thunk".  I take the panel off the door and have a look-see what is
going on.  Well, the metal clip at the bottom of the window and the tab
that connects that clip to the winder mechanism have parted welds.

First, does anyone in/near DC have one?  Second, is the clip the same on
both the drivers and passenger side?  (If so, I have one on my spare
passenger window)  Third (hoping against hope) are the drivers and
passengers side windows *the same*????  Just flipped around?
