Subject: Timing marks on 69

HEY,

I have been trying to set my timing on my 69, the books show three marks. Two 
marks close together one further apart.

All of which I have. The books say the mark I should use is the one that 
stands alone, but I do the timing seems way off.  I am using wrong marks?  Is the 
possible the pulley is marked wrong.
