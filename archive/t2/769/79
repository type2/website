True, but it's not really not malicious.  The writers tend to be
self-taught engineer types who are very knowledgeable, but whose knowledge
might be quite empirical.  Such folks may not be aware that there is a
difference between radiation and convection, and the fact that the
water-filled thing on the front of most cars is called a "radiator" when
it functions purely by convection doesn't help.

I'm a "degreed" engineer, which means that i've been forced to learn a
set curriculum which included such esoterica as thermodynamics and heat
transfer.  I therefore have a pretty good grasp of exactly how the VW
engine is intended to move its waste heat to the environment, and it
isn't by radiation!.

The problem with "degreed" engineers like me is that we can explain with
mathematical rigor exactly how your VW engine functions, but we sometimes
can't figure out which end of a screwdriver to hold.  :)
