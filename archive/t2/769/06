If you have a friendly local VW dealer, talk nice to the service guy and
see if he has any OEM VW "keep alive" solar panels.  One comes with each
new VW and from what i understand they are discarded when the car is
prepped for sale.  These panels come with a
cigarette lighter connector, but you can put whatever kind of connector
you with on it.  I use a small Molex connector that is more positive than
the cigarette lighter plug.

I bought mine from a VW mechanic at BBB.

Now, if I was a VW mechanic, I'd have an array of those thinge on my roof!
