Subject: Re: [T2] Q about inspecting a new engine after assembly

I can appreciate the enthusiasm of the students, but I'm less inclined
to believe a college student's backyard experiment than the
engineering studies cited in Fisher, "The black surface is more than
ten times better in heat-radiating ability than a plain cast surface".
Quoting Irving, "Motorcycle Engineering" and ALCOA's Engineering
Handbook.
