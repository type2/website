Hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, Steve, but you've got to replace the 
entire regulator ( winder ) mechanism, the "clip", as you put it, is welded 
onto the rest of the winder mechanism, and therefore can't be replaced 
separately ( you've also got to pull the quarter window frame out to replace 
the winder mechanism.

To add to the bad news, no, the winder mechanisms are specific to each side, 
so you'll have to get another driver's window winder mechanism.

FWIW
