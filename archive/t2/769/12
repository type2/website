Reminds me of when I bought my bus.  Seems that the Professional Mechanic
who installed the engine for the PO in Reno couldn't figure out what those
holes in the shroud were for, so he routed the fuel line between the
front tin and the rubber seal.  I couldn't see this since it was
blocked by the shroud.  I actually drove it that way for a while.  One day
I was crawling around underneath with a flashlight and noticed the kludge.
luckily, the fuel lines were fresh and flexible, so they didn't get cut.
