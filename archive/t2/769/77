Subject: Re: [T2] Q about inspecting a new engine after assembly

Back in 1950 the "Vincent" motorcycle "Black Lightning" were the first
ones with then engine painted black. The commenter on the History
channel said that Vincent painted them black to improve cooling. These
were the fastest bikes of their times.

Maybe they could have been even faster with a scraped engine :)
