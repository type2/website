My sliding handle 3/4" drive is a very used tool; I got one for my 
daughter also- great for wheel removal (she is only 114 lbs) and removes 
a wheel by standing on the handle  as she grips the roof gutter.  Center 
it to spin off/on the wheel nuts.  Also uses it laid over the gas pedal 
to fast idle the bus in winter to warm it up.
