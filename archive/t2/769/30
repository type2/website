Hmmm, compare the curb weight of your bus with the curb weight of a
camper.  If they are close, you might be able to get away with using the
camper bars with the camper settings!

There is considerable tolerance in ride height.  Not everyone loads their
bus the same, so you're really trying to get it within a half-inch or so,
not down to the millimeter!
