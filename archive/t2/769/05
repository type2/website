If you happen to be acquainted with someone who deals with medical oxygen
equipment, the hoses that connect the oxygen extractor or tanks
with the patient mask/cannula are ideal for brake bleeding.  Nice
connectors that fit tightly over the bleed fitting and nice thin clear
hose to move the bubbles along.  I don't put any fluid in the jar (500ml
Erlenmeyer flask, in my case), since the first pump provides the fluid I
need.

In a pinch, I've even bled brakes without a hose or container.  All you
have to do is make sure that there is pressure on the pedal before opening
the valve and make sure that you close the valve before the pedal bottoms
out.  Makes a nasty mess, though, so I recommend this only in an
emergency.
