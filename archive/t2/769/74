Subject: Fuel pump/dampener

Update on the 70 DC.  Still not sure why gas is sloshing out of the tank and
into the flap, but it isn't a problem when I'm not driving.  I'm starting to
suspect the filler tube. Anyhow my dual carb conversion seems to be going
well except for the one carb that is leaking like crazy and so will have to
be pulled again.  The suckiest part was cutting off the old air filter
stand, no going back now.  But the engine was already not stock so what the
heck.  My question is about the fuel pump which I believe is stock, but the
brass part sitting on top is really shiny like its new.  This dampener is
aligned at a really bad angle, it is really harshing the mellow of the carb
linkage right where the fuel hoses come in and out.  Muir's description of
fuel pump in the fuel pump cleaning section does not jive with what I see on
the ground.  Does it pop of, come apart or otherwise spin around?

Thanks a bundle, Nik
