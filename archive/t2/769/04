Hi Jack,

That's about opposite. It should be at least 85% open when cold, if
not 100% (been a while since I've worked on one). While the engine is
running, 12v current is applied to the unit which causes the valve to
close. The purpose is to allow an alternate air pathway other than the
primary idle air circuit for engine suction to reach the flapper and
allow more fuel to be delivered. It is equivalent to having your foot
on the pedal slightly. When the valve is closed, idle is normal.

 What I see when I look through the orifice is a moveable metal vane
 with a notch in it. This vane/notch is already a good way into the
 circular opening. I estimate that perhaps 15 % of the area of the
 opening is not obscured by the vane when it is cold. So very little
 air is allowed through and this could lead to my low idle situation.

 I would appreciate any info from someone who has looked down the pipe
 on one of these. What should I see inside there? Is this 15% open
 area normal?
