Subject: Re: [T2] Window support clip broken

I've done this 2-3 times- as I recall,
There is no need to rewmove the enture window regulator; as I told Steve 
in pmail, I block the window up at just the right height to get at the 
uchannel under the glass, using 2 pieces of 2x3 cut to just the right 
length. Tap off the uchannel with any desired drift.  Unscrew what's 
left of this on the regulator (move it up and down to get to it) and tap 
on the donor uchannel, using the best rubber packing you have left.  Get 
the regulator alighned, and put back the 2 screws.
