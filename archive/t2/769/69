It was just my error...

Dashpot's off again, chokes are fine.

Bizarre. I went out and fixed the leak (yep, I screwed up the valve
cover gasket somehow). Knocked the volume screws down 1/2 each. Idle
circuit back in play. I dunno why they would work fine for a while at
that setting then KAPUT!

But I still have no power. Even less if anything. Bucking like a
beast. I put the points back in to see if the new Pertronix was the
problem. Nope. I'm inside taking a break now. I'm going to go out and
completely readjust the carbs from the beginning. Sigh.
