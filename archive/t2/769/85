Subject: [T2] Timing marks on 69

Find TDC by removing the #1 spark plug, sticking a plastic rod (not to short
as to fall in.) down the hole. Turn the engine and watch as the rod is
pushed out by the piston and then comes to brief stop (this is TDC) before
going back in.

If your pulley is 7" in diameter, which it should be, every 1/16" (actually
.979 of 1/16) is a degree on the pulley.

Find the P/N stamped on your distributor and go here to find the timing
