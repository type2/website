Peter,

Exactly so.  Sorry Neale, I have taken the mechanism apart and know that
the clip is seperable from the winder mechanism via two M?4? bolts.  What
I need is what Peter calls the "lift channel" (this may be the the
official name, I have no clue)as my two pieces are no longer welded
together :-(

I am very glad to know that they are the same.  I suspected they might be,
but was not sure. Now...  Anyone have one?  Off a broken window?
