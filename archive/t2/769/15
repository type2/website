Subject: WTB: 1977-79 turn signal mechanism

Subject line tells the story... The turn signal arm on the westfakia  
self destructed on Friday night. The wiper arm is OK, but the signal  
arm is FUBAR.

If you have one to sell, please p-mail and let me know how much it's  
worth to you.

Happy trails,
