I am sorry George, what other gasket, I only found the O ring on the 2 bolt
plate. The screen was no problem.

Something isn't right.  Either you have a bad gasket, one of the gaskets
is missing, or the taco plate is bent.

Check the taco plate by putting it on a piece of glass.  Sometimes the
holes get dimpled.  This can be corrected with a ball-peen hammer.

You should use a gasket on either side of the oil screen flange.
Non-hardening gasket dressing like Hylomar helps to seal things properly.

Be sure to use the proper acorn nuts and copper washers on the screws.
The torque is quite small so make sure that you are not overtightening.
