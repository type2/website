I have done the swap on a 2l but never got it running right. Half the 
problem is that the carbs were secondhand. The fuel lines to the 
weber icts are smaller than for the progressive. I can't remember the 
sizing but I'm sure someone else will know it. I used a metal tee 
piece from a FLAPS to adapt the larger diameter fuel line from the 
pump to the smaller lines to each carb. The other thing I learnt but 
never addressed is that the air for the idle mixture is taken into 
the carb through the separate section walled off from the main 
venturi (obvious when you look at the carb). This means if you want 
to correctly measure idle air flow with the "snail" type meter you 
need an adaptor that fits over the complete top of the carb.

HTH,

Martin.
