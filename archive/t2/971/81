Zack,

My walls were definitely factory installed. Mine is the Kombi model, very
basic (plain panelboard trim without vinyl in the rear), headliner only
above the front seats, removable center seat for three, and a sunroof. It
also had cruise control installed by the dealer.
It was sold in the States, and has the California emissions (sadly, I need
some exhaust part$$$$).
