Hi Bob,

Crappy running at power (but good at idle) is a classic symptom of a  
failed coil.

Other possibilities include fuel pressure, but you've already ruled  
that out. Maybe the regulator has gone bad, and/or the decel valve  
isn't dropping pressure when it should be. I would look around for a  
known-good coil, and think about replacing the decel valve. A  
compression check and a new set of wires might also be a good idea.

Happy Trails,

MPG about 10 or so
have to accelerate very very slowly or it will just stall (not flooding)
top speed way down

starts and runs fine as long as it is in neutral (auto tranny)
fuel presure great
just took out crane and put in old coil/dist

runs very very rough in gear.
