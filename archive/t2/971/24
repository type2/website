Subject: Re: [T2] Passenger door lock installation problems

They are a tight fit, it can take some trial and
error.  I've done them with and without the plastic
covers. Start low near the edge of the door and work
up.  I've never removed anything but the inside panel.

Im having a hard time installing the passenger door
lock in my daughters
Twinkie (75 Bay window). It is a very tight fit
