Subject: Re: [T2] IT MOVES! but electrical gremlin

well the tranny and engine are back in and it moved (2ft) in each
direction under it's own power so that is a step in the right direction.

however there is an electrical gremlin that is confusing me.  I have the
VDO oil presure sender with dual output and guage.  well now the guage is
pegged all the time when the power is on, when ignition is switched on the
gen light is on but oil light is out. start engine and oil light comes on
and presure guage goes to zero. also while engine was out put new fuel
sender in as thee old one read  half tank low, now I get no reading at
all.

when engine was out I double checked the wireing and the sender has the
wires in the right place.

interesting part is that neither wire from the oil presure sender is
hooked up. both are disconected???

WTF??

between vacuum and wiring that 78 engine can be confusing and I've had it
for years working correctly......duh

thanks
Bob
