Subject: Bus Campout at the Rockies | Plans have changed

It doesn't look like Brainard Lake is going to work out for this  
campout.  Instead, we are looking at Moraine Park Campground with  
second area as a backup.  Read more at http://calivw78.com/wordpress/

This is for the weekend of May 11th.

Peace, Troy
