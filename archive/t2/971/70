Have you checked your cold start valve? If it is leaking it will over-rich
the bus and if the thermo-switch is broken and keeping it open, it will over
fuel the motor. At idle it will be ok, but when you need more fuel it can
run super-rich.

Just a start.

well the engine is mostly the same, have replaced most vacuum lines,
waiting for some odd sizes to be delivered. but phutzing with the lines
seems to have no effect

pretty much normal, when trying to start it smells of being flooded but
when running no. and I had fuel presure guage set up and it was factory
spec
