In my photo, you can see that when the engine is cold, the passenger side flap is blocking airflow but the driver's side is spitting the airflow. When the engine heats up, the driver's side air flap lies on top of the oil cooler blocking access from above but it's still open to the fan shroud outlet to direct air through the oil cooler.

and...

If I take a 2L bottle of Coke(tm) and put a valve near the bottom on each side (one valve is the size of an aspirin and the other the size of a tennis ball), fill the bottle half way and pressure it to 50 psi at the bottle cap, when I open the valves at the same time, most of the fluid is going to escape from the larger valve which has the least resistance. To increase the flow through the smaller valve I have to constrict the larger valve.

Isn't this analagous to the fan shroud (bottle), large valve (cylinder gaps), small valve (oil cooler air channels) and fluid (fan shroud air supply)?

The rate of airflow (mass over time) also has to be considered with regard to cooling. While the pressure drop across the oil cooler exists, will enough air mass flow through it or does the Type 4 engine have to lower the flap in place to force a greater quantity of air through the cooler at all rpms?
