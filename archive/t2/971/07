Hi Ed,

Here in Tucson there's some old common wisdom that says you're better  
off without the flaps.  I think it's hogwash, but practically all the  
old timers at the VW parts shops told me over and over again that in  
Tucson you just don't need the thermostat or flaps.

I've got a 79, CA originally, but converted to the lame Webber  
progressive by a PO.  When I bought it it had neither flaps nor  
thermostat.  I was able to find the flaps at a VW shop in town (Bugs- 
n-Buggies) where the owner lets me dig through his piles of parts  
whenever I need anything.  I think I paid him 10 bucks for the flaps  
and thermostat bracket.

After installing them the warmup time has improved dramatically.  It  
used to be that the thing positively wouldn't warm up (this was in  
the winter-time, mind you) just idling; it had to be driven a couple  
of miles (and those miles were a pain in the neck).  Now, a couple  
minutes of idling in the driveway is all it takes.  The difference is  
impressive.

Of course, when the outside temps are in the triple digits all day  
and the high 80s all night the system won't do me any good, but it  
also won't do any harm.  I mostly want the flaps installed for when  
the weather is cool.

In regards to where to get them, I don't know.  The thermostats for  
upright engines are available from some of the online vendors, but I  
don't know if anyone has the flaps.  Perhaps the guys at BustedBus  
could find you one.

Best Regards,
Zack

   Is this something I should try to find and get put back in?

   Any ideas where to find?
