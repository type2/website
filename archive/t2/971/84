Hello to the list.
  I have decicded to ditch the progressive weber and 009 and go to a set of ICT's and an SVDA (thanks to John at aircooled.net) I have a 72 Riviera with a 1700 in it.
   
  Anyone else done this particular swap? Anyone have advice about setting it up.
   
  I have the engine out of the bus to do the swap, doing a clutch, rear main and pushrod seals as well as all new fuel lines at the same time.
   
  Thanks,
  Ed Maikranz
