Unfortunately, in the SFBay area $30 might get you a free brake inspection, 
but not much more.

I'm very familiar with the AFM internal adjustment process, having done it 
on a couple of different AFM's and written about the process many times. 
But in those cases where I was doing adjustment I had a built-in O2 sensor 
to guide me and give me some feedback on  how I was doing.  Without that 
sensor in place I kind of feel that I'm just guessing.  I don't agree that 
the CO screw only adjusts idle; if you look at the air vane as you turn the 
CO screw you'll see that the air vane is moving in response.  Turn the screw 
in (richer) and the vane moves counterclockwise (richer).  Turn the screw 
out (leaner) and the vane falls back (leaner).  This is pretty primative 
system we're talking about with just a few "mixture adjustment points" as 
the feeler sweeps across the resistance strip.  I may end up opening up the 
AFM and tightening things down in the end, but it's not my first choice.

> Or drop a megasquirt in there and it'll pass ;)

Unfortunately, I think I'm about getting to the end of my rope with 
air-cooled VW busses.  If I get this sucker to pass I may just take the 
opportunity to pass it along to some "greater fool!"
