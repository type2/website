Subject: Bus Campout at the Rockies | Plans have changed

I'll be heading out there from Tennessee to pick up my new (to me)
squareback.  While there, I hope to be hanging around with you guys, so
please let me know when plans get firmed up.  If it's all the same, it
doesn't _have_ to be some RV park.  I'm all about being high, so the greater
the altitude, the better.  :)
