Subject: Re: [T2] Metal wall behind front seats

For post-76, I think there was also a full bulkhead all the way across
for 9 passenger models and panel vans.  I seem to remember an option
with only one side having the bulkhead.  I don't have my copy of "VW
Transporter and Microbus:  Specification Guide 1967-1979" handy, but I
think its list of m-code options is more complete than the one on the
type2 webpage:

Note that Andy has a kombi, not a Westy.

I mainly drive my bus around with no interior behind the front seats
at all.  I kind of like being able to to remove the passenger seat and
being able to fit long items in that wouldn't be possible with the
bulkhead.  You wouldn't believe the look on their faces at the lumber
yard when I put both 5x5 and 4x8 sheets of plywood in the back of my
bus.  There's a bit of a trick to getting the 5x5 sheet into the bus,
but once it's in you would think it was made for carrrying
european-sized plywood  ;-).  The rear hatch is also almost exactly
48" wide.
