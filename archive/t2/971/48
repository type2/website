With the right tools any part of a bus is "removable". In fact I think
a number of folks have removed the metal walls to install the later
style rotating captain's chairs.

In the same respect, with the right tools, and probably some extra
metal, I would speculate that there's no reason they "couldn't" be
installed, just depends how much time and effort you'd like to put
forth to the task.
