I dunno about the rust thing (sounds plausible to me) but I used
carpet too. And the same stuff is at Wallyworld for quite a bit
cheaper than Pep Boys.

First I used cardboard to fill the indentation. I rolled up a piece to
support the middle, then taped a flat piece over:

I used spray adhesive instead of hot glue.

I've since trimmed and finished, just no pics ATM. I used door edge
protector to give a nice finish to the lip around the top of the
stand.
