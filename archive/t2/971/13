Subject: Passenger door lock installation problems

Im having a hard time installing the passenger door lock in my daughters
Twinkie (75 Bay window). It is a very tight fit. Either it hangs up when I
try to get it in position or the plastic cover comes off. Then I have to
take it back down out of the door and put the cover back on.

Bently shows a rear window guide that needs to be removed. There is no a
guide that you can remove on my daughters bus as far as I can tell.

Are their any tricks to this installation?
