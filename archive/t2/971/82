Subject: Re: [T2] electrical gremlins and kvetching, solved,! I hope

well the good news and the bad news.

the good news is I'm pretty sure I've found the problem.
the bad news is that it is a sunken valve !! or two...

compression  #1   110
             #2   105
             #3     0
             #4    30

oh *()#$%!(-at-)!!!!

now the 110 is not bad since 100k ago it was only 125, I had it built with
a slightly lower C/R..  in any case, order is off to AVP (via bus depot)
for two rebuilt heads....

thanks for all the help

Bob
