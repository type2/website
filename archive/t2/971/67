ok so I had em in the right place, the (#%$(-at-) still runs really really
rough and doesn't want to accelerate....top speed is garbage too.

MPG about 10 or so
have to accelerate very very slowly or it will just stall (not flooding)
top speed way down

starts and runs fine as long as it is in neutral (auto tranny)
fuel presure great
just took out crane and put in old coil/dist
new filters all around

runs very very rough in gear.
