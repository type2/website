Subject: Re: [T2] Passenger door lock installation problems

I seriously have had very little use for my Bentley manual in my 1977, it doesn't seem to apply to my year very much.

I have R&R'd my front door locks twice, it is a tight squeeze every time, if I remember correctly you come in low and then push them up, but that is a guess from memory, I didn't remove anything besides the door panel.

I need to remove them again but have had too many other projects in the way, otherwise I would do it tonight and tell you, but the bottom line is that it is very tight and there is a preferred route.
