Same spring-resisted air-vane AFM setup as on the 78.  Since I have no way 
to test the results on this vehicle - Federal's had no O2 sensor and even 
though I added a bung the O2 readings have been unreliable - I'm not sure if 
I want to open up the AFM.  Since I'm only guessing at this point I'll just 
settle for turning out the CO screw.
