Subject: Re: [T2] Cooling flaps

The common modification that I've seen in Tucson (and which was  
present on my bus) is to remove the cooling flaps but to fashion a  
piece of tin to sit where the left cooling flap sits when the  
thermostat is fully open.  This piece of tin on my bus was semi- 
permanently installed with several tiny sheet metal screws and an  
abundance of silicon sealant.  So, while my original cooling flap  
system was missing, a piece to serve this critical function was  
installed in it's stead.  I probably should have mentioned this in my  
original post.

I suspect that when Ed pulls the engine tin and takes a look he'll  
find something similarly rigged in his engine.  The guys who did  
these mods weren't entirely crazy.
