Well,, if you believe the laws.... the flaps are not needed. 

the flap does not direct air over the cooler. 

it isn't needed to direct the air over the cooler as the law will do it 
automatically. 

The law states something like.... air under_pressure_ exerts equal pressure 
in all directions. 

So... as soon as the cfm of the fan exceeds the flow of the engine... the 
air is under pressure inside the cooling tin shroud. 

This forces the air to pass by all "leaks" ... ie, over the cyl, cooler, out 
the spark plug holes etc 

The flap only works to direct the air if the air is not under pressure. 

so,,, as long as your driving your bus,,, or the idle is over about 600 
rpm,, then the law takes over,, and the flap doesn't do what you think it 
does.
If the fan isn't spinning fast enough to pressurize the shroud,, then the 
flaps do direct air . 

I didn't make up the law.. I think Bernooli did.   :-)
