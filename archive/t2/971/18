So why design the flaps to direct air in any particular direction at
all? German engineers just goofin'? Had too much Schnapps? ;-)

Have you looked inside a Type 1 doghouse shroud? There's little fins
and crap all over the place to keep airflow even across the cylinders.

The air isn't under significant pressure. It's the FLOW that matters
and removes heat.
