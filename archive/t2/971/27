Subject: RE: [T2] Seat Stand Pedestal Mats?

I'd like to know too. I was thinking about just
painting the seat stands black.
 
Does the rubber help to keep the cab quiet?
 

I bought plain black automotive carpeting (Pep Boys, Advanced Auto, etc)
cut it to fit, and glued it on using a hot glue gun. I've been told I'm
wrong about this, but I think it's true, I believe those rubber mats
promote rust in the seat stand area, as well as the cab floor. With carpet,
at least moisture will eventually dry out. With those rubber mats it gets
trapped. Just my .02.    Jeff
