Subject: Library Plug... Was Re: [T2] Question -- and short rant --

Hi Mike,

You have a valid point about the archives... they are hard to use and 
not always "fresh".

But a lot of volks in this thread seem to be forgetting about the 
LIBRARY!!

The Library is the type2 equivalent of the FAQ that other lists DEMAND 
people read before they post questions. Here in type2-land, the FAQ has 
transcended simple ascii and morphed into the Library. From 009 
distributors to gas-heaters to Wood panelling, it's all there... an 
excellent source of vitamins, minerals and all the child-cot and 
dual-battery-relay info most people will ever need.
