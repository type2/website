Subject: Re: [T2] How to store a bay wind shield

I have been storing a windsheild for almost a year and have not damaged it 
yet.
I just ordered a new seal and will finally be installing it!
I simply kept the old seal installed around the edge of the glass and kept it 
in the upright position leaning against the garage wall.
Please note I don't have any evil cats and the kids don't usually go into the 
garage so it was not disturbed much.
You could also hold it against the wall with some bungy cords or straps keep 
the inside side of the window towards the wall to prevent running into the 
edge and breaking it.
