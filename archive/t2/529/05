Subject: Balancing wide 5's.

I've got my wide 5 balancing problems solved. I got an old Beetle front drum
with 5 lugs. You bolt the drum to the wheel, and get them to chuck the drum
up on any tire balancing machine. It's just like having a custom machined
adapter made in Germany for you. Must be a front drum. I got them to spin
the drum by itself first to make sure it wasn't out, and it was evenly
balanced. It's a little extra work but well worth it- all 4 of my Conti
tires needed weights, due to the old 34 year old wheels not being perfect no
doubt.
