Hello everybody.

My name is Tosha Berk, that's with a long 'O'.

I'm in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, was at one time on the 
Vanagon e-list, am currently on the VW Scirocco e-list and have a bus 
built 07/71 out in the driveway as I type. 8])


I'll post back w/ specific details, don't worry the fun is just 
beginning. Lets just drop a few teasers, shall we?

Broken valve. (#3 cylinder?)
Broken head bolt on other side. (weee!)
Tar in fuel line. (ooh, that smells worse than gear oil.)
External oil cooler with Fram filter. (Hmmm. Nice, nice.)
Decent body with nary any rust, just a few bubbles.
Nice teal blue paint.


Looking to swap for a good used motor and find it a good home.

Anywho, Thx for having me.
TBerk
