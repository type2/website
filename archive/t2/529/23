Subject: leaking oil galley plugs

My engine is leaking like a sieve so I am going to split the case, drill, tap and plug with allen head pipe plugs to stop the leaking.  My question is:  Does someone sell a kit with all the necessary plug sizes?  (2.0 ltr)  Or can someone tell me what size and how many plugs I will need?
 
thanks,  Paul
