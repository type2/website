Subject: RE: [T2] Oil Detergents - What are your feelings?

Running a quart of Kerosene has the same effect. It works. The only
possible problem that can possible arise is loosening chunks of stuff
that could possible clog an oil line. It rarely happens, but when does
it can cause major damage.

I watch the following oil bulletin board
http://theoildrop.server101.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php
There are lots of people on that board that love a product called
Auto-RX http://www.auto-rx.com/index.html It slowly softens and removes
crud that has built up in the engine. It's a multi step process. The
only thing is that since our engines don't have oil filters, there's no
place to collect the liquefied sludge. Its not a cheap product either.
I'm going to try it on my Toyota Truck. It may be a great thing for
people who have put full flow filters on their engines or perhaps the
manufacturer has a recommended process for engines without filters.

Last time I changed the oil I considered dumping in a bottle of "Oil
Detergent"
