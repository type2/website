<< I only have  liability insurance on my Bus , Through State Farm.
I value my Bus very much, is it worth getting full coverage, and what kind, 
and what company?                   Any suggestions will be appreciated.

You're gonna hafta do a little homework on this insurance...Regular com-
prehensive insurance is fine for a new car, but for a collectable (or clas-
sic, your choice) car the options may be different...An "agreed value"
policy...Where you and the insurance co. decide beforehand the $ value
of your Bus might be what you're after. It would include an inspection of
the Bus by the Ins. co. (for fraud purposes...you can't insure the parts
Bus and roll it over a hill to collect...)
Salvage rights are another point to consider...Do you want the remains
in case of an accident? Some policies require the co. to take possession
of the wreck and title to prevent it from going to another car...Again,
more so for newer or higher value classic cars than for a Bus (One wag
on another list pointed out that150 % of all Ferrari's were still on
the road...)
Talk to your agent, first...About what exactly you want, rather than just
what he may have available...
