Not that I know of, but stranger things have happened.  Measurement is
your best bet!

I've found that brake lines don't like to go in unless everything is
perfectly aligned, both in terms of position and angle.  I wiggle things
around and flex the line slightly until the threads grab, and then
(important!) make sure that I can turn the fitting in by hand before I put
a wrench on it.
