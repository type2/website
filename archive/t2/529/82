The marine bilge blower mod is not a good idea - unless your heating
system has other problems.

I installed a bilge blower (along with new heater pipe and insulation)
before heading out on a long Thanksgiving road trip (DC to AZ) in
November 2002. We had great heat for about 200 - 300 miles. Then the
plastic bilge blower melted into one big lump not letting any heat
through at all. And that happened when we really needed heat ...

If your other heating system components are marginal, the bilge blower
fix may work because you heat does not get hot enough to damage the
blower. If, however, you have good heater boxes and a tight heating
system, the days (or hours) of the blower are counted. Steve Dolan has
seen my lump of bilge blower remains before I disposed of them and can
attest to the inappropriateness of this device.

I still liked the increased airflow (I think 240 cfm). So if anyone can
suggest a heat resistant blower that would work, I would like to try
that. Has anyone tried the JC Whitney kit? I am afraid that it may
contain the same plastic bilge blower.

Thanks for the write-up.

I've been thinking about doing the bilge fan mod on my Bus as well.
