I'll take this opportunity to chime in with my recent tire buying 
experience... I recently purchased Korean-made Capitol SV-820 185R14C's 
for my Westy.  Special ordered them from the Firestone Tire Center in 
Berkeley, CA, so I would guess any Firestone shop could order them.  
They were quite inexpensive ($50/tire + mount/balance/etc.), and I just 
did a ~500 mile road trip on them this weekend and they seemed to 
perform quite well with the Westy fully-loaded with stuff (even on the 
REALLY curvy bits of CA-1 between SLO and Monterey).

I put up some info about these tires here just after I purchased them:

Hope this is useful.
