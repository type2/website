Subject: the doghouse cooler

i am pulling out an old functional doughouse style cooler shroud for my new
rebuild. it had a lot of silicone caulk on the front left [fif] pieces
where gaps appear. i've removed the caulk with a paint scraper, and it
seems by the folds in the metal that those gaps may well be intentional?
are they, or re-caulk?  -steve
