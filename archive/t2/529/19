Subject: Beetle tow bar on a '77 Westy

Hello Volks

I would like some suggestions about if I can use a Beetle towbar in my '77
Westy 1600DP engine, this towbar is "Y" shape with some holes to be attach
it to the rear suspension tube cross members using U bolts, then another set
of holes that are supposed to be used with the tranny base (beetle) and
finally a tongue to be bolt to the rear bumper.
Since the Westy does not have the chassis horn that hold the tranny in the
beetle, I was wondering if I can use some kind of strap, U bolt (huge)
crosslink or whatever around the bus tranny (mine has a cross member that
hold's the tranny from the top of the chassis)  as an additional support for
the tow bar.
I just planning to use the towbar to hold my bicycle rack until I finish my
trailer project ( a very long shot).

Thanks


Roberto
