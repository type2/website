Subject: RE: [T2] Question -- and short rant -- about archive

Thanx Gerald,

 

      My apologies to the list as I did for get to check the archives

 

Although I've been using the list since '99 or so, but lost my email that handled the T2 mail in early 2002, I just "relisted" last week, so I missed that thread...

 

      Gerald's proactive approach ( p-mailing me the info and mentioning the archives) is more helpful AND more welcoming to "new" and "New again" listers then the public flogging approach and will help keep the list active, diverse and relevant.

 

      Not to mention new members joining all the time bring new ideas, and new technologies to the list that WILL not be in the archives!!!

 

Thanks!!
