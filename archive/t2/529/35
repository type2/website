Subject: breakin in & heaterbox spring replacement

my neighbor made a great repair for me today. i opened my heaterbox [1600]
because the flap closed funnily. we went to the open hardware store
[open?sunday] there my neighbor bought a spring. he later matched it to the
two broken spring sections back in the carport..  those 35 year old cleanly
broken ones. and after sunday had nearly passed i wonder now what to put
between the two heaterbox parts for a gasket. ideas on what the factory
white stuff/ decrepitated crusty  was?  - steve
