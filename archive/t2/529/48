Mr. Cupples,

If what you truly have is a collapsed lifter then you have a decision to
make.  You can buy a can of oil cleaner or you can buy a new lifter.

Most oils these days contain complete detergent packages and I do not
believe that aftermarket additions will help.  I also do not believe that
any will hurt anything other than your wallet.

A new lifter
(http://www.busdepot.com/busdepot/view.jsp?model=42&category=15&group=12&prodgroup=124)
costs $14.95 and can be installed in less than an hour.

One further word of advice.  Be sure to check compression on any hydraulic
lifter engine after adjustment.  Especially if you have a collapsed lifter
there is a danger that you have over-tightened it and propped a valve
open.

                             OOK!
