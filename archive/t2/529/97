By the time you buy a big enough inverter to run a
desktop (would need at least a 300-400 watt inverter,
to the tune of $100 - $200) and buy an LCD monitor
(cheapest I've seen lately is around $250), you can
buy a good used laptop that should do everything you
need it to -  Lotsa used 700-800Mhz laptops on eBay
and the web for ~$500, and you can run them using a
$20 100w cigarette lighter inverter from Radio
Shack.... not to mention you can take it with you when
you aren't in the Bus, into the coffe shop, etc.

Don't know about Sprint - I tried unsuccessfully to
get my PDA & PCS phone to communicate with Verizon's
network (at the time it was Airtouch, they have since
merged with Verizon).  I know Larry at Roadhaus.com
has been using Verizon's wireless data service, which
is what I would probably go with (Verizon has the best
coverage by far in my experience).  More info at his
page or verizonwireless.com ...
