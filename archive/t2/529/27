Do you recall; if the push rod tubes are installed on the long block, is 
the tin that is between the p.r. tubes and the cylinders installed also? 
I don't have room to have two engines sitting around for long and would 
like to have every thing ready for reassemble when the rebuilt engine 
arrives.

As I remember from rebuilding the engine in my 75 myself, the injector 
seals and intake runner hoses didn't come with the gasket set. are there 
any other gaskets or hoses that anyone knows of that need to be ordered 
separately? The FLAPS around here don't know what air cooled means!

Thanks
Tom
