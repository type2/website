Subject: Re: [T2] belly pan, BA6 and painting

My Westy has the heater hiding behind the belly pan. The outside of the 
pan has undercoating on it but the inside does not, nor does the 
underside of the floor. I don't think this has anything to do with the 
heater though. If the heater is running and installed right it should 
not warm up the undercoating enough to worry about as long as you have 
some air flow clearance between the heater and any flammable materials.
