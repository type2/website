Hello Volks Folks, 

Well its that time again, time to get Anya, my '78
Sunroof Special out of mothballs and back on to the
road. The fact that I'm getting kicked out of my
apartment and need a place to live is also a
motivating factor. 

When I parked my bus last winter it was running fairly
well, no power but whets new. It did however, have a
nasty oil leak, a real pisser. Going through a quart
like a linebacker gulping Gatorade, (about a quart
every 30 miles for those of you still working with the
English measurements)

I think some of it may be coming from the pushrod tube
seals as I replaced them last fall. Also I'm beginning
to suspect the main seal which should probably be
checked regardless. I need the procedure for that. and
if anyone has advice on how to change tube seals and
have them stay sealed I'd love to hear it. 

Any random thoughts on other stuff I should check
before setting off welcome..

Thanks, 

Giles
