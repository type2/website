For the rest of us without Tefloning fathers-in-law......there is no danger
of getting anti-seize from the inside and outside of the adjusting stars
onto the brake pads.  No chance of the brake lube between the sides of
the shoes and the backing plate getting on the braking surface of the pad,
either, so long as you don't put it on with a spoon.

The sooner you get the brake adjustment "system" anti-seized, the easier
it will be to get apart.  I had to use a torch, to get mine apart, when I first
bought the bus...................
