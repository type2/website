Subject: Eberspacher BA 4 Gas Heaters for sale

I purchased a parts lot and in it were 2 BA 4 heaters in really good shape.  
One is complete with the fuel pump, the other does not have the fuel pump.  I 
am primarily interested in Stewart Warner heaters so I am offering them for 
sale.  I will sell them both for $125 plus shipping or $75 for the one with the 
pump and $50 for the one without.  All the wiring and other parts are there.  
I can send photos if you are interested.
Regards,
Al
