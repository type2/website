Subject: front shift rod bushing

I replaced the shift rod bushing less than 2 years ago and it's split on me
again. The reproduction item isn't well made so I'd buy a few next time you
go shopping online. This is the clear grommet for 74-79 shift rods.

OEVeedub has some Genuine VW ones (211-711-182). They are a lot thicker than
the one I bought from Bus Boys a long time ago.

I'll fit a genuine one and see how long it lasts (the original disappeared
after all).
