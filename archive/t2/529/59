Subject: RE: [T2] Oil Detergents - What are your feelings?

I have never added a detergent to my oil myself.

I have always been under the impression that _most_ (most-as
pertaining to commonly sold at gas stations, grocery stores, FLAPS,
etc..) over the counter motor oil for automobiles(in the U.S.A)
already have detergents in them.  I do not know how much or of what
kind.

Chemical solutions to motor problems can work, though the deck is
stacked against you a bit.  I have always been of the method of
thinking that mechanical tapping sounds are best inspected and
physically solved.  I personally prefer(I.M.O.) to use additives in
my motors for the function of improving running state and duration
of that state.  Not to solve pre-existing mechanical malfunction.
