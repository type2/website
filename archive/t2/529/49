Tom,

I am sorry to say that I do not remember.  But since I do not remember
pulling the pushrods and rockers either I think that the tin must have
been there.  That is something to ask each of the vendors.

A situation that is becoming very common.  If there were any full-service
filling stations left I would look for a near return of the day when the
attendant was at a loss for how to check for coolant.  O tempora! O mores!

The injectors and their associated gaskets and hoses are not considered to
be part of the engine" but rather part of the "fuel" system and thus the
gaskets are not in the engine set.  Those gaskets are available through
most on-line vendors however.  For example see:

http://www.busdepot.com/catalog.jsp?model=42&category=20&group=22

both the "Distributor Pipe Sleeve" and the "Fuel Injector Seal Kit" are
listed there.

                             OOK!
