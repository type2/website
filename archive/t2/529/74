I'm glad you brought this up. My 70 Adventurewagen bus probably had bias ply tires on it when new. I run 185R14 Reinforced Contis on it, and my speedo(according to Jamie Rivers) is out by like 7mph- When it reads 55, I'm actually going like 62mph. It's no big deal, but I wish there was a different speedo drive gear you could buy to make it right.(I know there isn't any such animal)
