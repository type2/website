Tom,

You can also go to a shop that balances the wheels/tires on the vehicle.
This is the old school method, but completely legitimate and in fact,
superior to balancing off the vehicle, as it allows for the entire rotating
mass on each axle, not just the wheel.

In the Toronto area I know of one shop, Dufferin Alignment Centre at
Dufferin & Dupont, which does this and they are an excellent shop.
