Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Bus tires ? Speedo reading error

My 70 bus which I bought new seems to overread. With a 70 mph indicated I am
being passed by everyone on the freeway. My tires are 185R14. When new it
came with 7.00x 14 8PR according to the factory manual although I don't
recall that they were 8 ply rated. Don't know the difference in diameter of
the 7.00x14 vs. the 185x14.

> I'm glad you brought this up. My 70 Adventurewagen bus probably had bias
ply tires on it when new. I run 185R14 Reinforced Contis on it, and my
speedo(according to Jamie Rivers) is out by like 7mph- When it reads 55, I'm
actually going like 62mph. It's no big deal, but I wish there was a
different speedo drive gear you could buy to make it right.(I know there
isn't any such animal)
