Subject: Bus Insurance , Company ? 

I only have  liability insurance on my Bus , Through State Farm.
I value my Bus very much, is it worth getting full coverage, and what kind, 
and what company?                   Any suggestions will be appreciated. 
              (bus is running great, and all the fan fragments are accounted 
for)
