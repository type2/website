Subject: Re: [T2] Balancing wide 5's.

i sought out on the vehicle balancing for one of my econoline work trucks
once.  here in the rust belt we have problems with the drums rusting so
much and the rotors some times too that they get out of balance.  the
rotors generally have to be replaced.  the drums on the other hand can
have balancing weights attached to them.  actually this is done at the
factory on large castings such as drums and rotors.  i installed equipment
at a kelsey-hayes factory and watched them do this.  they try to machine
off material first but if that doesn't work they stake or weld on weights.
one of the problems with these weights is that they are the first thing to
fall of from corrosion.  this sends the drum or rotor back into the
imbalance state.

anyhow the on the vehicle balancing went like this.  the tires and wheels
were balanced then they were installed on the van.  then the wheels were
rotated on the van, this detects the out of balance drum or rotor.  if
possible the drum or rotor can then have weights attached to it.  if they
can not or are deemed to far gone to be balanced they must be replaced.

Not sure if that's true or not but sounds like a hassle.

You can also go to a shop that balances the wheels/tires on the vehicle.
