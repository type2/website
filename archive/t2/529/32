Subject: silicon caulk

re the doghouse oil cooler

follow the air flow,

the origianl offset dog house oil cooler had a covering of black foam to
seal the edges of the oil cooler to prevent any air flow loss, The cooling
air has to flow all the way through the oil cooler fins and not around the
outside. There is quite a bit of resistence to air flow in those tightly
spaced oil cooler fins and so a small air hole leak on the outside lets a
lot of air flow by and bypass the oil cooler. I have never seen an intact
black foam gasket on a dog house oil cooler. I always use silicon caulk to
seal up the air flow. I put the caulk on the tin. It is much harder to take
apart, but I don't take my rebuilt engines apart except every 50,000 miles
for a valve job. You need to figure out the air flow so that you only apply
caulk to seal the "edges" of the oil cooler. Do not put caulk anywhere that
will block the air flow into and through the oil cooler.
