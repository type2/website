Subject: belly pan, BA6 and painting

I removed my belly pan for the first time today. Apart from the usual amount
of rust on the other side and the sandblasting media that just keeps turning
up I was quite shocked to see how my rust existed.

I was thinking of applying some undercoating but I thought about the BA6 and
was wondering if it will get too hot for the undercoating.

How have other people painted under the center of the bus with a similar
configuration?
