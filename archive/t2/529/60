Hi Folks,

One other thing to consider when searching for info:

Go to the Type 2 site, and select Type2 from the Mailing Lists section.
Select READ from the links, and page back through old messages and threads.

This is a third alternative to the Archives and to the Library.  If you 
remember some info in that message from last week but you deleted the 
message, this is a good place to look.

Good Luck!
