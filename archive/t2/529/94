Subject: Alabama Getaway Was a Success

The first annaul Alabama Getaway was a great success. There was at least 20
busses there, not all at one time however there was always at least 6 there.
We had non type2s also. It was a awsome weekend to not hot at all and cool
enough at night to have a fire. The trip is only 42 miles from my house so
not really a trip report there. We the "friendly face vw club" have decided
to have atleast three campouts a year. The next will be at the end of Oct.
in  the Talladega National Forest at the Turnipseed Hunters camp. Hope to
see yall there. The site www.afriendlyface.com should be getting its update
by thursday. There should be some good photos then. Hopefully we can attract
some attention to this overlooked part of the states. More later about the
fall campout...........
