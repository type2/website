Subject: Re: [T2] turbo your heat.

90% of the time when i work on a van with "no heat"  the problem lies in
missing ductwork, broken or non-existent heat cables, and or crappy seals on
doors and windows that just let in a constant draft.  Once these are
remedied, the van can get comfortably warm...........it won;t roast you out
of there unless you install a eberspacher or south wind, though.............
