Subject: Delayed starting, or no starting on cold morning??

I went to start my 77 Westy this morning, and the lights etc came on but nothing from the starter. I turned it off, and then back on again, and it fired up normally (momentary delay). It has been giving a brief 1/2 second delay for quite awhile lately when starting, but then fires up. Today was a pretty cold morning, is this  Hard Start Relay time? The battery terminals etc were all cleaned about a month ago. I did the HSR on my 70 bug, and the startup has been like night and day since!
