Hey Jon,

Thanks for the note. I'm going to be working with him, and his shop is about
200 yards from my office, so it makes it pretty easy to keep up on it. He's
a good body man, but hasn't done buses, so I'm trying to get as much advice
from the list as possible to help guide him. He is extremely open to
suggestions.

Man, 15k! Wow. It must look great.

Ned
