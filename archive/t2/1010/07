hello Phil    You being from down under and me from up here  . lets see 
exactly what you are talking about.  Steering damper. goes  across ways from the 
middle of axle to tie rod/   Shocks are on the  end and are vertical.  now the 
early buses and bugs didn't have a steering  damper , I want to think that they 
were added about 1958 models. these help with  the side way shocks.  
shouldn't really cause a ride difference.  Top  part of the shock housing missing 
would cause a difference in the ride. What we  really need to know is if you are 
talking about the shocks or the steering  damper  later  mark d
