	The desire for 'up to date' in the typical modern corporation 
is iften weaker than the desire to skimp $.04 in the service of 
profit.  The corporation called 'VW' today bears little resemblance 
to the outfit that made our beloved airhowlers.
	I know little of plastics, so I can't judge whether ABS would 
be best for this purpose; but I do think some plastic or other would 
be better, functionally, than the rather unyielding tin.
	What do Lycoming, Continental do for corresp air ducts in 
their modern flat-4s?
