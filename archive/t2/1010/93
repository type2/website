	Does that 'etc' include the earthing bolt from the battery to 
the 'frame'?  If not, the grounding bolt will do   ;-)   If corrosion 
has caused a high resistance to develop there, lights etc will work 
but a hundred amp or so for the starter will not flow. At least undo 
it a half-turn and re-tighten; better, remove & clean.
