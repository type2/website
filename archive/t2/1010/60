Subject: Parts from a '71?

There's a 71 deluxe at a? junkyard near me that I just came across.? The belt chrome is gone and the front and back lights/lenses and the center mat is gone, and there is not a center seat.? Otherwise it's pretty complete. 

They told me that they are crushing a bunch of cars before winter so I have about 2 weeks to get anything off of it that I might want.

As a late bay owner, I am not sure of any parts that are hard to find or are one year only from the 71 that I should think about pulling.

Anyone have any suggestions/recomendations?

Thanks!
