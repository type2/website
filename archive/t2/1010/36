Subject: 68 only wiper question

I am running an original set of '68 only wiper arms with a set of pristine
vintage Bosch wiper blades. Now I have a problem, the blades are done for.
The 15" blades don't have a refill number at my FLAPS. A regular bus 16"
refill blade won't fit and 15" stock refills are not listed. Anyone know a
part number for the refills so I can cross reference a TRIICO or Bosch
refill?

 

Thanks,
