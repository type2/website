Subject: Re: Delayed starting, or no starting on cold morning??

Do you think that it could be the ignition switch?  When you say it delays a
= second, is there just nothing?  Makes me think of a bad electrical contact
somewhere.  Id try starting with a remote starter and see if it gives the
same symptoms.
