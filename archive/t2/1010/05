Subject: Missing damper

The front beam on my van is poorly. The section on the passenger side that 
the top of the damper attaches to has broken off :-(

The rest of the beam is sound though but it will need to be replaced. 
Luckily I have a rust free Australian one in the shed I bought a couple of 
year ago. Being Aussie it even has the bracket on the side preferred by 
those of us who drive on the left.

However it's going to be a few weeks before I can get it in for replacement. 
In the meantime am I doing anything bad by carrying on driving short 
distances ? Since I put about 200 miles on before realising the reason the 
front end felt a bit bouncier than normal I'd guess that any damage has 
already been done.

Apart from the aforementioned bounciness the van feels OK. I'm assuming that 
the front suspension won't last quite as long without dampers but since it's 
going to be removed with a big hammer and a gas axle (assuming it has rusted 
in place and doesn't fall off when the bolts are removed) I'm no fussed 
about this.

Advice please. Thanks.
