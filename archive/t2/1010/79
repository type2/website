This isn't really a "dead simple" solution, but it worked really well for me 
when I went out exploring back country roads:

I have a little Gamin E-Trex Legend that I use for hiking. I fabricated a 
laptop stand for in my bus and plug the Garmin into my laptop. I run a 
program called GPSdrive (in Linux) and I can see exactly where I am on my 
laptop screen.
