Sorry, I  mean shocks. I understood that all they did was damp the springing
from the  torson bars in suspension, hence I called them dampers. My bus is a
'71 so  it has both but the horizontal steering damper (and driver side shock)
is  fine.

Thanks



hey Phil  I kinda thought that was what you were talking about.  shouldn't 
really be dangerous mostly cause you are down there and I am up here  LOL   . 
slow ,short trips maybe OK,  If you keep driving then the  torsion bar could 
break and bus would sit cockeyed and probably drive like  crap.  You might as 
well bitr thr bullet and swap out the axles.  I  would recommend to rust proof 
the inside of the axle in the housing where it  bolts to the body before 
installing the other one.  later  mark  dearing
