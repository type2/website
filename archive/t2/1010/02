 It just now occurred to me that perhaps the phonelic block is reusable,
with paper gaskets on each side? In and of itself, it sure is not going to
seal much, yet there was nothing on my engine, except the block, no paper,
no residue, or anything like that.

 If it also requires the paper gaskets, where do you reckon them come from?
I guess I will find out if what is in the kit, is the gaskets, and I have to
use the block that came out?

The block comes with a gasket attached to each side. Very thin. If your set
comes with 4 thin paper [greenish?] gaskets, you could glue them to the
blocks.

That is why they are so expensive at Bus Depot.

$7.68 each. I cannot understand why your set did not include them. Every 2.0
gasket set I have bought had them. And metal ones for carbed engines. What
gasket set did they sell you?
It should have been 071-198-009

EE is the blocks and they should have been in the set.

#1 here is the block. You can see they drew it thick.

Even if Bus Depot sold you this set:
