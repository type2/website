Subject: Re: [T2] charcoal canister

Richard asked:


 Can someone help me confirm whether or not the charcoal canister
 first appeared in 1970 or 1971?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Good question.......

My 68-72 paper parts book shows cannister number 113 201 801 A as fitting
buses with m code M 26.

M 26 is 'with activated carbon container   models 211-274 California'.

That tells a lot.....

So I looked at the hoses..... again the same footnote but it shows different
hoses for the type 1 engine to the end of 71 and the type 4 from 72.  For
the type 1 I would guess just 71 because it only says 'to Ch. no. 211 2300
000. Nothing is mentioned as from 210 000 001 etc.

But.... the 68-79 Bentley, section 3 page 5, shows the ventilation system
'found on 1970 and 1971 models' but no mention or picture of the
cannister....
