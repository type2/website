Subject: Bus Line Art

Does anyone know a good website or somewhere to get line art (outline style)
of our buses?  Bay Window only would be OK but even Westfalias would be good
too.  Basically, I would like to have views of the front, left, right, and
rear so that sketches and ideas for painting, etc... could be done.

Thanks,

Michael Martin
Montevallo, Alabama



PS - Thank you ALL for your help and advice with the tranny swap.  I finally
got the rear input shaft out and hope to finish the transplants sometime
within the next week or so.  Thanks again.
