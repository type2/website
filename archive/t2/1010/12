Subject: Re: [T2] the search for heat ends now .. Espar Airtronic

so,, I called around in the last few days,, Southern Ontario Canada is sort
of a cold climate,, I know that is relative... Winnipeg is C O L D...
we are actually about the same as Northern Calif...

anyway... The people I talked to knew right away what I was after.. and they
knew they didn't have any in stock... and they knew they were worth over $1k
new... so a working unit would be $800....or so.. if they got one in... and
they usually don't as folks transfer them to the new trucks..

that is about  $850 usa dollars :-)
