Subject: GPS again. :-)

Spent a half hour perusing the type2 archives, but no real names came up for a
cheap GPS to throw into the van's glove box. I don't need anything fancy, just
a hand held that will plot waypoints on the screen so I can go around the old
logging roads here on Vancouver Island. Anyone used a GPS that is dead simple
and plots waypoints and draws the maps on it's screen? Logging roads have a
habit of turning here & there, and forking off in all kinds of places. I
figure a simple GPS would make this more fun, than hair raising. :-) I see
tons of them on Eb** but a specific model and brand from someone who's used it
would be awesome.
Thanks,
Courtney
