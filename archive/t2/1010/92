Subject: 9 Pin Flasher Relay Questioin

Hi All,

Asked a question before on the 68 bus relay,? but a new symptom has come up.? The turn signal/flasher bulbs will all turn on, but they now stay on steadily- they will not flash.? They all had been working fine when suddenly #1 fuse feeding ignition power blew twice.? I ohmed out the light circuit for shorts and also checked current draw as it is now, which never goes above 4A.? Is the flasher relay likely bad, and if so, what is my best plan to replace it?

Thanks!

Ray
