People,

This person is already getting roasted badly on thesamba, wouldn't it be
better if we leave that nonsense off this list?

Those who understand what I am talking about will understand, those who
don't, can do their homework and find out more, or ignore the whole thing. I
am not defending anyone, nor am I trying to stifle free speech, but this
list is pretty good natured and I personally like it that way.
