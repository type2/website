Subject: [t2]excuse me while I scream.....

just an update or whatever if anyone even remembers. 78 2liter auto

but I finally got my Boston engine and it sure is purty, and then it
rains for about a week, now I know we need the rain but...

in any case finally got everything put  together this afternoon, (even
took off work to finish it) and go to crank it and the starter spins
freely???? huh.,  engine turns over nicely by hand, but with starter,
nada??  after much hunting I discover that the rebuilt torque
converter I put in doesn't have a ring gear? huh, I know there was one
on there when I sent it out for rebuilding?

needless to say the engine now has to come back out, what is this #6
on this job alone...  company that rebuilds em appologized profusely,
explains that they have to cut the ring gear off to rebuild it and
evidently they forgot to weld it back on??  seems they might have
noticed the thing lying around the shop??
mumble mumble mumble  I feel destined to spend money on this beast,
but never get to drive it......

think I'll go crawl under a rock
