Jim,

 

I'll snap some photos of them in the morning. I'll bet the trimming idea
will be the route to take.

 

Interesting trivia on the Fridolin. Now I can say I my '68 is 1/2500th Frid!

 

Thanks!

Jon -

 

If they are the "narrow" Bosch or SWF Blades, the 16" or longer refills from
Bosch (which are rubber only) will work, you just have to trim them down
with a single-edged razor.  With this style, the metal reinforcement strips
in the rubber (on each side) are removeable to re-place into the new rubber
refill.  I have a friend in the biz who now makes a "universal" Bosch style
22" (I think - might be longer,) rubber refill specifically made for
trimming down for the various wiper sizes. 

 

If your blades' reinforcement strips are a "permanent" part of the rubber
refill, they may not be original and require a "Trico" or ANCO replacement
refill.

 

Pmail a decent close-up photo of one end of the blade so I can see the
cross-section of the blade and help determine this.  Other photo views are
welcome to help if I can.

 

Part Number trivia:  68 Only Buses used VW 147 955 425 B Wiper Blade
Assemblies.  This was originally the wiper for the VW Fridolin :-)  For
those who don't know, this blade had a "narrow" attachment locker for narrow
hook arms - the only year Buses used these.  69-79 Buses used a "wide"
locker/hook arm. 

 

But if memory serves, when I use to sell the blade assemblies, these were 16
inches long - at least the replacements were out of Germany.  I use to sell
these like crazy 'cause I was the only one who had them at the time
(80s-90s).

I am running an original set of '68 only wiper arms with a set of pristine
vintage Bosch wiper blades. Now I have a problem, the blades are done for. 
The 15" blades don't have a refill number at my FLAPS. A regular bus 16"
refill blade won't fit and 15" stock refills are not listed. Anyone know a
part number for the refills so I can cross reference a TRIICO or Bosch 
refill?
