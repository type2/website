I'll  remember to treat the towers too - my cross tubes are solid but the

rotted where it attached to the tube. I blame the previous owners of  course.



hello Phil   what normally happens is that the towers will rust  from the 
inside. So you need to get some POR15 into the inside of each tower. I  think you 
would have to drill a hole at the top and a small hole at the bottom  that 
you could plug till the inside was full and then unplug to drain.   later  mark
