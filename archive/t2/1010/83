Lots of batteries will show they no longer hold a full charge in the Fall when
the temps go down. Your battery could be old and tired. Check your battery and
charging system before trying the relay.

With my 71 buses I was never able to get them starting 100% until I installed
the hot start relay. Or is it hard start? Either way that little gizmo is
really a godsend as my bus starts every single time.

I think starters are sometimes over-replaced and I don't think it's the
starter grease holding you up. My experience has been the original starters
will last a really long time and whirrr into life if it has enough voltage.
-Daniel>is this Hard Start Relay time? The battery terminals etc were all
cleaned about a month ago. I did the HSR on my 70 bug, and the startup has
been like night and day since!
