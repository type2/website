Subject: ADMIN: KILL THIS THREAD Re: [T2] replacement body panels

With all due respect, everyone here has been "warned" repeatedly.  The 
charter of this list does not include policing its members therefore I 
need to ask that everone PLEASE stop discussing this subject on the 
list.  If you want to discuss it with the admins, that is fine.  If the 
admins come to a concensus that something needs to be done, fine but it 
will be discussed offline or not at all.
