You are using the 86 Jetta clutch correct??? If so I'd stick with that  and 
get a 88-92 JettaGolf 16 valve pressure plate. The stock Jetta/Golf  clutches 
hold up good with the 16v heavy duty pressure plate. 



Thanks Ronnie I should have thought about that, I did have both a 16v GTI  
and Scirocco.
