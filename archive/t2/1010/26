Subject: RE: [T2] replacement body panels

Ned,

Kelly at Metwiz.com recommends using KlassicFab replacement panels. There is
evidence they are of higher quality and design. This will help with the body
work. Buses are not that difficult to repair the metal, but being unibody,
expect more rust than you see.

Paint chip is a good investment and there are no downsides unless the
prep-work under the chip guard is poor. Truck bed lining is really fantastic
stuff. The only downside is it will add weight if sprayed on too heavily.

My advice is be present as much as possible. Additionally be sure that no
more than a 1/16" of Bondo or plastic filler is applied in any area (when
reasonable). Make sure the windows/trim/bumpers/lights/doorseals/pop-top are
removed before paint is applied to get the highest quality of work. Also be
sure all seams between panels that are disturbed are re-seam-sealed.

5K is very reasonable for the amount of work you are describing, my '68
Double Cab was three times as much to fully restore and I did the majority
of the work.

Good luck!

Subject: [T2] replacement body panels

Hey all,

My body guy is going to redo the paint and body work on my 78 Westy this
winter. Does anyone have any experience with replacement panels? I'm sure
there is some quality difference out there. Specifically, I am looking for
the battery tray corner, a lower section just behind the driver's side door,
and the two front doglegs. Also, I'm wondering if anyone has a clean rear
door for sale.

We put the bus up on the lift, and overall, she's really solid. The front
wheel wells are in great condition, the only problems up there are the
doglegs and the step. He is planning on doing the bottom 4 or so inches in
chipguard, and using spray bedliner in the wheel wells, unless I hear advice
against it.

Finally, if anyone has specific recommendations for me, please let me know.
My body guy is a friend of mine, and hasn't done a bus, but is open to any
and all suggestions. He does great work. I'm planning on spending about 5k.
Does this sound realistic? Richard Atwell, I know you recently had your bus
redone, what were your costs like?

Thanks in advance.

Ned
