Hey Jon,

I think they only make panels for splitties, from what I can see. Also,
Brian is suggesting we use the body panel adhesive. He says they only weld
if it's structural. I know there's been opinions about this before, and it
would probably be fine for the rear corner, but I would think the doglegs
need to be welded.

Thoughts on this?
