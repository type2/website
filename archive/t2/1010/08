Sorry, I mean shocks. I understood that all they did was damp the springing
from the torson bars in suspension, hence I called them dampers. My bus is a
'71 so it has both but the horizontal steering damper (and driver side shock)
is fine.

Thanks

Phil

  hello Phil    You being from down under and me from up here . lets see
exactly what you are talking about.  Steering damper. goes across ways from
the middle of axle to tie rod/   Shocks are on the end and are vertical.  now
the early buses and bugs didn't have a steering damper , I want to think that
they were added about 1958 models. these help with the side way shocks.
shouldn't really cause a ride difference.  Top part of the shock housing
missing would cause a difference in the ride. What we really need to know is
if you are talking about the shocks or the steering damper  later  mark d
