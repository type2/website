Subject: vanagon clutch question

Not sure this is the right place to ask this  but  The customer  that I did a 
jetta engine conversion into his 85 vanagon wants to be able to do  some 
towing with it and would like a stronger clutch. I used an 86 jetta engine  with 
the 82 vanagon diesel bell housing, were would I find a heavy duty  clutch.
 
heres a picture of the vanagon , it sat since 1995 and was pulled from  a 
junkyard and the engine .
