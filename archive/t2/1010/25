Subject: replacement body panels

Hey all,

My body guy is going to redo the paint and body work on my 78 Westy this
winter. Does anyone have any experience with replacement panels? I'm sure
there is some quality difference out there. Specifically, I am looking for
the battery tray corner, a lower section just behind the driver's side door,
and the two front doglegs. Also, I'm wondering if anyone has a clean rear
door for sale.

We put the bus up on the lift, and overall, she's really solid. The front
wheel wells are in great condition, the only problems up there are the
doglegs and the step. He is planning on doing the bottom 4 or so inches in
chipguard, and using spray bedliner in the wheel wells, unless I hear advice
against it.

Finally, if anyone has specific recommendations for me, please let me know.
My body guy is a friend of mine, and hasn't done a bus, but is open to any
and all suggestions. He does great work. I'm planning on spending about 5k.
Does this sound realistic? Richard Atwell, I know you recently had your bus
redone, what were your costs like?

Thanks in advance.

Ned
