Subject: Rotisserie - More Info

I see there is a lot of info available on the web. One place demeans the layout of basically an engine stand on each end, but that may be close to what I want to do! I don't need it to lift - just to hold while rotating, basically. Not gonna do anything structural, so it doesn't need to be that solid.
