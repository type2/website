Hi Tom,

The Holy Trinity of troubleshooting a nostart condition is "FUEL, AIR. 
SPARK".  Put them in whatever order you want, but it won't start without 
all three present.

A cold snap could also mean ice is blocking a fuel line or filter. A 
pertronix failure is usually all or nothing.

Have a helper turn the key while you check the plug wires for activity. 
If there's no spark at the wire, move up to the coil. If no spark at the 
coil, the coil has died. If yes at coil but no at wires, then break out 
the points and condenser.

A fuel pressure gauge would help diagnose fuel delivery.... You also 
want to make sure all your vacuum hoses are in place. BAd motor mounts + 
reverse gear torque could = vacuum line disconnect.

Good luck with it, and Happy Holidays Everybody!!!
