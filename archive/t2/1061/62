Subject: Massive oil leak after cold weather?

Put the cable chains on my 77 Westy today, all pumped up to do some errands.
Started up the van, and smelled what I thought was rubber. Went to look
underneath at the back and there was massive drippage coming off the pass.
side engine block, down onto the exhaust header. Holy Smokes! So shut it off,
and resigned myself to the likelyhood of finding the leak. Does cold weather
bring out the beast in oil leaks usually? I'm thinking, thicker oil, so let's
blow a seal somewhere?
Questionally yours,
Courtney
(Now about to drive my 70 Beetle instead) :-(
