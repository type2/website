I would suspect the threads in the head are damaged/stripped from
previous abuse or just wear and tear. I haven't attempted it but it may
be possible to get an inspection mirror and a light in to examine the
threads on the front plug hole. If they are damaged you will need to use
a helicoil or similar to replace the thread. I assume this means
dropping the engine. :(
