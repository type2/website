Subject: My steering has alot of play....advice needed

Hello,

I have my 70 single cab on the road now, and have about 8" of play in the
steering wheel.  All the suspension parts are new, and the car was aligned,
thus i figure the steering box needs to be adjusted.  Can someone advise how
to do this, and how much play i SHOULD have?
