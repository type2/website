Subject: looking for heater accordion tube for 78 bus 

Sooooooo.. I was installing a my fancy shmancy new Dakota Digital CHT a 
month or so ago and while I was routing the cable on the underside I 
took off half of the accordion heater tube so I could get access above 
it.  Fast forward about 700 miles and a month later to me crawling under 
the bus this evening redoing my main battery wires.  I was cleaning the 
transmission ground wires and I noticed my accordion tube was not where 
it was supposed to be and had been rubbing up against the CV boot.  
Needless to say it wore through the boot and also wore a bit of plastic 
and metal off of the tube.  I put the tube back in place and I'll fix 
the joint in the next few days, but I wanted to see if anyone had an 
extra heater tube lying around.  I had a few way back when and threw 
them out figuring I'd never need a replacement - - just leave it to me 
to prove myself wrong!

The worn one is still completely functional but I thought it would be 
nice to have one that didn't have the wear marks on it.  If you have one 
you could part with, please let me know.

Thanks!
Mike
