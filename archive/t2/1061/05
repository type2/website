"This appears excessive to me." 

Sounds excessive to me too. Get another opinion from another body shop. Although the whole left and right rear sides including everything from the roofline to the ass cheek are available as one unit each.

"They appear to be possibly for drainage. The shop wants to cover them up. Is this a bad idea?"

Yes, its a bad idea. If you are looking at the engine hatch from the rear of the bus, two holes to either side of the bottomm of the hatch. These holes were for injecting rust-proofing, and had clear plastic caps on them from the factory. The same caps can be seen (if they are still there) above the mount for the rear-view mirror inside the bus. The PO covered up the left side holes on my bus, and it has since rusted out. That was less than 3 years ago. Have the body shop keep the holes, and get new caps for the holes.
