Here's a "how it works" bit:

The new product offering appears to be the real deal.  It isn't the "HPF"
product formally sold by Loctite/Permatex.  This is good news
for folks in the US as the only reliable source for the stuff seemed to be
at Harley boutiques.  Now a search for "permatex 85249" gets quite a few
hits including Amazon and Harbor Freight.

Uses are limited by one's imagination.  My Mexican engines came with
Hylomar on the center case seam and oil pump assembly.  I use it as a
gasket dressing.  It seals a bit like heavy grease except that it isn't
slippery and doesn't dissolve in oil or gasoline.
