<SNIP> Hi, could someone please explain to me what the story is with this relay?

The OEM configuration has the current for the starter/solenoid going all the way forward to the ignition key, then all the way back to the starter.  

This long run of wire naturally loses voltage...new wires with a new starter/solenoid will work, but if either gets tired, you will start to see problems starting. You will turn the key, and amybe hear a click, but no cranking. 

All buses will eventually have this problem as the wiring ages.

You will notice it first when the engine is hot, because the starter/solenoid windings will be heated from proximity to the engine. It will usually start if allowed to cool for 30 min - 2 hours...kind of annoying if you just stopped for gas.  In a pinch, you can tap on the solenoid with a hammer or screwdriver to try to free it up, and then try cranking again.

The hot start relay eliminates the long wire run. You still use the long run to the ignition key, but it only powers the relay which is installed by the starter. The starter current goes from the battery to the relay to the starter...skipping the long trip up to the cab and back.

Look in the type2 library for info on how to install. There is a kit available, or you can just buy a Ford starter relay from the flaps and make it work.
