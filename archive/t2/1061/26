Subject: Jig to hold car body & rotate

I have collected a few sets of photos of jigs built to support a bus or car body for easier access for body work - that allow rotating.

I have searched for a couple hours now and cannot locate any of them. If anybody has any pics or specs or ideas, I'd sure appreciate it if you would p-mail them to me at my busahaulic01(-at-)yahoo.com address.

So far the general idea is to build a separate framework for each end of the vehicle. Each frame will be like a book-end with wheels on the bottom. The bus body will be bolted (at the frame members) to a "turntable," possibly using truck spindles and hubs as supports, possibly just a large bolt and plates! I want one end steerable and will attach a trailer tongue to it so I can pull/push with another vehicle in/out of my tent.

There is simply no way that my old arms / joints are going to be able to work upside-down and if I don't build this sucker, the bus body will never get worked on.

So far, rough idea uses spindles / hubs / tire&wheel parts available from trailer parts supply places. Framework likely to be 1.5" square tubing with appropriate gusset plates. Probability of blocking the jigs off withe tires removed for steadiness and since once it's tipped, it should stay that way for extended time as I work my way around it.

Possible alternative using rear hubs / wheels from a FWD car, but probably will cost same or more and require adapting. Have not determined manner in which I will king-pin the steering end yet, but simpler the better and grease will make smooth enough (It aint going on the street!)

IDEAS! IDEAS! IDEAS! I have my own but welcome yours! Yes, eventually I will share!
