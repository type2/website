Subject: RE: [T2] Massive oil leak after cold weather?

The oil filter is on the driver's side....

Funny this issue came up today, it happened to me when I came out of the
gym. Oil all over the underside of the right side of the engine. 
I checked the level, it was low, so I added some. I cleaned up what I could
with paper towels and started it up. I let it run for a few minutes and
there were no drips.
I made sure the level was at the full mark, and drove home.
Once I got home I checked the level again, and it's way overfull and not
dripping.

I've had the seal on the oil filter blow out in these types of cold weather 
situations and cause just this type of oil leak.
