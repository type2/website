I agree with Mark on this regarding the Pertronix failure rate and I will
add the disappointing quality of Compu-Fire and Accu-Fire (cheep knock-off
of Compu Fire).  Since I've never used or know much about the "Hot Spark"
pedaled on The Samba, I have no opinion on those.  I think Mark meant to say
was the "Crane Units" are a better system and I have been using them on a
variety of VWs since the 70s (when they were known as Allison).  Sure, they
cost more, but ya get what ya pay for.
