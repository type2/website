Subject: Re: [T2] Second Smog Check

Good luck.  I am having trouble smogging my Syncro every two years in
California, even with tune ups, new parts, etc.  Now they've passed super
strict diesel emissions regulations on big trucks; may cause my husband to
go out of business or move elsewhere.  Wyoming sounds good!  Actually we may
start looking at Nevada - not sure that's a good option either.  I think
California really has it in for small business people - not real smart when
the state is looking at bankruptcy.
