If you're okay with what you're using then why switch? You don't have hydraulic lifters, so you aren't switching because of a lifter making noise. If something works good for you, why bother with what someone else says? I adjusted winter / summer and sometimes adjusted to get rid of lifter noise. Some of my engines liked thicker oil, some liked thinner oil. I generally run 20/50 but no longer run an aircooled. Last I ran the '79 T4 engine, I ran 20/50 or 20W/50. I can't imagine that in So Cal there would be a problem with flow with 20/50! In NW winters, I never had any problems running 20/50. I have had problems when experimenting with 10/30 or 5W/30 in maintaining oil pressure when the engine was at operating temp. Never had that prob with 20/50.

If I read your message correctly, IMHO your thinking is backwards on the issue. In climbing mountains an ambient 90 degrees, I would want 20/50 over 10/30! If I did that with any of my engines I would be waaaayyyy down on pressure when below 1000 rpm. Stick with 20/50.

I am running 10/30 currently but have startup oil pressure over 100psi and it holds good at operating temp, too. That's with a Subey in good shape.

 Search didn't turn up much on this...
 
 I've always used 20W50 here in SOCAL, a mechanic I use
 suggested that a few years back.
 
 The folks over on Samba seem to think that 10W30 is better,
 as it allows better flow.
 
 The manual says 20W50 or single weights (not going there). 
 
 Occassionaly I do a road trip and need to climb mountains
 on a warm day, but daily driving is more benign with
 OAT's never more than 90F or so.
 
 I'm contemplating Brad Penn 10W30, if I can find out
 where to get some.
 
 Thoughts?
