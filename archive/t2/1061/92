Mike,

I'm pleased to hear that cleaning up the key electrical connections worked so
well. I would add to your list, spraying each connection with some
anti-corrosive spray.

When I cleaned up the major terminals in my kombi I increased the voltage at
the ignition by 1v. I suspect that some hot start relays could be avoided by
cleaning the terminals, which could also dramatically increase the headlight
brightness! All for minimal cost and effort.

Martin.
