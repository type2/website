Subject: Re: [WetWesties] 205/75 14's fit on a 77 Bay?

No Scott, straight winter tires, this lovely B.C. winter on the Island has
ticked me off. I'm going to get a dedicated set of tires and 4 rims to use for
winters from now on. I'm using cable chains, but they're driving me nuts
because our roads are half clear and half ice covered. Poor road plowing
techniques around here. So 70's or 75's??

  a 205/70 R 14 isn't 'that' big a tire.
  as long as 14 inch rims are stock on your Bay, 205/70's will fit pretty
sure.
  Not so sure that's the very best size to run, but they'l fit I do believe.
  I've run those on a 56 Bus even.
  Must be you have a line on a good deal on some tires in that size.
  Not the best for wet or slippery conditions, if a the ones you are looking
at are a summer/rain 'all season' tire.
