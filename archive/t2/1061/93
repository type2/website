Subject: Permatex hylomar

If I remember correctly, people were saying that hylomar sealant was 
somewhat difficult to get?  Well, I just looked at the permatex site and 
they are now selling it:

What are some uses for this sealant?  I'm always looking to use the best 
stuff and everyone's always raving about this so I'd appreciate some 
guidance on where this would be an appropriate sealant.

thanks!
Mike
