The poptops were made from polyester resin.  An epoxy resin, such as West
System or System 3, would be the best.  Just drill out the existing hole one
size larger to remove any contaminate, then counter sink it so the epoxy has
some surface area to stick to to.  Then use some masking tape and tape the
bottom of the hole and fill with a thickened epoxy mixture, a syringe works
best for that.  It's kind of messy, but not too bad. 
 
You can't use polyester resin on cured epoxy, but you can use epoxy resin on
both cured polyester and epoxy surfaces.

I was talking to one of my boat repair friends about filling some screw
holes in my poptop and she said I needed to know whether it was
polyester resin or epoxy resin.  Apparently you can use polyester resin
to repair both polyester or epoxy glass but not the other way around..
or something like that.  Anyways, just curious if anyone knew.
