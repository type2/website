Subject: Dead Pertronix?

Began backing my Vanagon out today and it died. Haven't had time to
troubleshoot, way to cold out tonight. My first suspicion is the pertronix
unit in my dizzy. The only thing I have to go on so far is the engine cranks
and will only occasionally cough on one of the cylinders as if it's getting a
real weak spark. Similar to burnt points or a dead condenser.

I've never had one of these pertronix units fail on me so I don't know the
symptoms. Do they typically have an immediate failure like mine or do they
show signs of failing? Is there a good way of testing these things so I can be
sure it's at fault and not something else killing the spark (if it turns out
to be spark related)?

I'm supposed to be going out of town tomorrow to see family for the holidays.
I do have points and condenser to replace the pertronix unit with if need be.
I just want to prevent myself from going on a goose chase trying to fix this
thing.
TIA!
