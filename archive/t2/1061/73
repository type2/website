Subject: question about poptop fiberglass

I was talking to one of my boat repair friends about filling some screw 
holes in my poptop and she said I needed to know whether it was 
polyester resin or epoxy resin.  Apparently you can use polyester resin 
to repair both polyester or epoxy glass but not the other way around.. 
or something like that.  Anyways, just curious if anyone knew.

Thanks!
Mike
