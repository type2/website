Adjust the rear brakes first using the adjuster stars to compensate
for wear, then try to readjust your parking brake cable.

There are good write ups in the library and on Richard Atwell's site.

You might want to get 4 new adjuster star nuts and the corresponding
screws before you start if you've never done the adjustment before
because those things are prone to seizure. Since you're down there it
may not be a bad time to replace the rubber brake hoses too if you
haven't.
