Ok, you have the front tranny mount, then the two screws that hold the 
tranny to the rear tranny mount (above the tranny bellhousing), then 
there are the two studs sticking out of the engine into the tranny, then 
there is a bolt that goes through the top driver's-side of the tranny 
towards the rear into the engine compartment and then other odd sized 
one that goes through the starter into the engine compartment.  And then 
there are the two studs that hold the engine mounts to the mustache bar 
and the four nuts and bolts that hold the bar to the frame.  yeah, I 
think that's everything.  If you were having any trouble lining up the 
ends of the mustache bar with the frame, sometimes it helps to loosen 
the bolts that hold the ends of the bar to the brackets...
