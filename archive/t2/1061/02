Subject: Body Work Question

I'm having body and paint work done on this 1974 Transporter money pit. This
is a question for those of you who have been there. The body is in good
condition except for the rear wheel wells that are packed with Bondo and
can't be repaired. I got the shop two new wheel wells. They say that they
cannot be welded on because they will be too weak. They are asking for right
and left body panel sections going from the window seam all the way back to
the engine compartment following the panel seam. This appears excessive to
me. Do any of you have experience with this. Also, on all busses I have
seen, there are two holes to the left and right rear of the engine
compartment. They appear to be possibly for drainage. The shop wants to
cover them up. Is this a bad idea? Thanks a lot for any advice you folks
have.
