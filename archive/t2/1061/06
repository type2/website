<SNIP> Hi, could someone please explain to me what the story is with
this relay?

Before installing the relay I advocate disconnecting the ground and then
removing all the leads from the starter solenoid terminal used as a
distribution point, cleaning them and the post with a wire brush or
similar, reconnecting and coating with one of the various electrical
connection protectors. This point is critical to all your electrical
systems! After I did this the voltage at the front of my vehicle
increased by 1 volt which doesn't sound like much but it can be the
difference between starting and not starting or dim/bright headlights
(1v less can drop brightness by 20%).

Oh, and reconnect the ground before complaining that your bus doesn't
start now! ;)

Martin.
