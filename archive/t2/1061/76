Hello, The saga on my 70 Single Cab has taught me that the steering box has
noadjustment left. Anyone have a source for a new steering box? Maybe mine
just needs fluid? Maybe I could try that, but have no idea what sort of fluid
to add to it. I honestly do not think this box had ever been adjusted.
