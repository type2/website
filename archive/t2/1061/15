Subject: Second Smog Check

In November I had the "emissions test" done for the Guac. Passed, no prob.
However, a couple weeks before that I passed a roadside sniffer and got a
"High Emitter" tag (Gross polluter for you Cali folks.) I posted about the
crap when I got it in the mail.

Anyway, today was my "AIR" Program test.

The Guac failed.

How the (-at-)#$%^& can my number jump up from passing to horribly failing in one
month? Someones stuff is messed up.

Now I have to fix a bunch of stuff in 90 days or they will cancel my
registration.

This program is a load of crap.
