Good up to the point where the Ford starer relay was mentioned.  The Ford
relay is a high current relay that takes correspondingly higher current
from the ignition switch.  It's just about as bad as the VW solenoid
relay.  This bit of lore seems to have come from John Muir's Idiot Book,
but that book was written long before the Bosch kit became available.

Use the specified bosch relay and you'll be much happier.
