This is going to sound obvious, but is it possible that you failed to
correctly tighten those plugs down last time you had them out? Your
bus will probably still run with non-tightened plugs.

Anything else non-typical going on near those plugs? Like under the
plug CHT temp sender for instance?

How were the torque values on the other two plugs?
