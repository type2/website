Mine (84 Westy) only lasted 23 years (stupid Volkswagens).  It failed on the
way back to Southern California from Circle Yer Wagens in May 2007.  Good
thing I had a good used spare under seat/bedbox.  I-40 in the middle of the
New Mexico desert can get REAL lonely.  It's safely stored back under the
seat/bedbox because I upgraded to a euro only (025 906 021 F) Digijet ECU
for better performance with my 2.1 upgrade :-)  Whadda difference....

BTW, as Karl said...for a stock 1.9 Wasserboxer, the ECU is the same, manual
or auto trans.
