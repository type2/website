Subject: christmas

I love my 74 westie.
If I had to say thanks for something material in my life
it would be my 78 rubber duckie (rusty graveyard) and my 74 westy.
Taught me a lot about myself.

Merry Christmas Everyone.
I hope you have a safe holiday and count your blessings.
Sometimes the road is rough and steep. But you will get through it.
Love life, family and friends.
They will give you a push when you need it.

James J
