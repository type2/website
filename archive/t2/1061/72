Subject: Problem: No more adjustment left in my ebrake

I replaced all the stars on my van this year and they are easily available. 
I suspect the casting they sit in will be OK once cleaned up. LOTS of 
penetrating oil is the key with the suggested vice grips. You may need to 
put the oil on in the evening and then again in the morning.

On the original point, the adjustment should come from the star adjusters
first. Don't do the cables until you have done the adjusters. These make the
biggest difference.

Good luck.

 Phil
