Subject: Re: [T2] throttle cable freezing up

Try some motorcycle cable lube. I'm not sure if that will have anti-freeze properties, but that's what is supposed to be in there.

You could also try some 99% alcohol from the drugstore to deice it first.

The best thing would be to get a new cable (and boot), and flush out the the tube with hot soapy water and then shop air to dry it. If you really wanted to do a bang-up job, pull a pipe cleaner of some sort through with some twine or wire.  

Lube the new cable as you install it. You want something which won't get stiff in cold temps...cable lube or lithium grease. Regular grease will get stiff.
