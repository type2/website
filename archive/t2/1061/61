Try a large vice grips on the star - work it back and forth a bit -
that will usually get it moving enough for removal, but by that point
you will probably have munged up the teeth enough to warrant the
star's replacement. Penetrating oil is an option, just make sure to
keep it off of your braking surfaces. Hot wrench might work. The hot
wrench + wax trick almost never fails me. If all else fails the entire
unit that holds both adjustment stars+screws can be removed and
replaced, though I'm not sure where/if you could find one new. I could
pull them off my '71 parts pile if you need some used ones.
