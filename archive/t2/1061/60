So... What happens if one of the star adjusters freezes?  I tried
banging at it with a hammer and old screwdriver after soaking in wd40 -
no luck.  Felt like it was welded in place.  Does that adjusting
assembly come off as a unit if the star adjuster rusts to it?

You might want to get 4 new adjuster star nuts and the corresponding
screws before you start if you've never done the adjustment before
because those things are prone to seizure. Since you're down there it
may not be a bad time to replace the rubber brake hoses too if you
haven't.
