Subject: Which mount bolts go where?

Hi, Merry Xmas....and now the question.  On my '74 1.8 L, about to be
installed after total rebuild, I have forgotten, mounting bolt placement.
Moustache bar, at rear, I ,know..Threaded studs from bottom of  (front of van)
motor, through bellhousing to nuts, 'odd sided" bolts through top of
bellhosing, through motor, to nut on 'motorside' , and starter through bolt.
Is that it as far as "mounts go?  Thanks.
Syd
