I got some spray for the battery terminals:

but I used Caig's deoxit on the starter and other various connections:

That's probably the best stuff you can use for electrical connections - 
we use it on audio equipment at work and it's pretty awesome.

Yeah, there were quite a few things that started working better after 
the fix!  I would also venture to guess that the hot-start relay is no 
longer needed and I will probably pull it out because it's probably just 
another point of failure.  I'll probably also run a new wire up to the 
ignition as well, but that's a bit down the road :)
