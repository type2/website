Subject: Steering Box is shot

Hello,

The saga on my 70 Single Cab has taught me that the steering box has no
adjustment left.  Anyone have a source for a new steering box?  Maybe mine
just needs fluid?  Maybe I could try that, but have no idea what sort of fluid
to add to it.  I honestly do not think this box had ever been adjusted.
