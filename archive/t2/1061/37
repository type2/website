Not Washoe (Reno) or Clark (Vegas) counties.  Both have smog checks.

There used to be a requirement for any county of more than 50K persons to
have smog checks, but when Carson City (the capital) went past that number
the number magically rose to a higher value.  Seems the legislators don't
want to smog their cars any more than the rest of us.

You'd be safest to register vehicles in a cow county, though.
