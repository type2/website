Subject: re- [T2] My steering has alot of play....advice needed

I have my 70 single cab on the road now, and have about 8" of play in the
steering wheel.  Can someone advise how
to do this, and how much play i SHOULD have?

> I replaced my drag link and 90% of my play went away - adjusted the drag
link to get the steering wheel horizontal - very happy-
For 5 years I heard others tell me - look at the front end parts as I always
though the steering box was the culprit -everyone was right - it was the
drag link on mine. 
Have someone turn the steering wheel and look at the drag link to see if the
ball joints move -also look at the swing lever (up and down motion not
good!) The Muir and Bentley are your friends.
