Hi Dave,

Here's a link for you:
http://ecologicarchitecture.com/SoloHobbit/bustisserie/bustisserie.htm

One of our clubmembers locally built a rotisserie for his 58 sub-hatch 
westy, and it works quite well. He already has two takers lined up for 
it once he's finished with it.

I don't think you need to use bearings in the spindle. The rotisserie I 
have seen works fine using a simple axle built with one piece of steel 
pipe closely fitting inside another. IIRC he used pipe in around 2" 
diameter, and put axle grease between them.

If you're looking to do bodywork properly on a rotissery, you should be 
looking at removing the interior, glass, engine, transmission and tires. 
  That will lighten a 3000'lb bus to less than 2,000 lbs. Split the 
difference and you will have 1000 lbs of load at each end. Then consider 
that there will always be *some* counterweight, and the rotational 
friction isn't nearly as bad as you'd think. Since the center of the bus 
will be about 3' out from the edges, you have a lot of leverage 
available to rotate the bus.


Happy Trails,
