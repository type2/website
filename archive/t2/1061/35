Subject: Steering box on  the way out?

I have recently noticed that there is a "catch" about every 60  
degrees of rotation when I turn the steering wheel.  I wondered if ti  
might be dry in there, so I put some gear oil in.  It didn't take  
much.  It didn't help, either.  I'm guessing that there is a worm  
gear in there, and that it isn't meshing just right.

Anyone have experience with these symptoms?  What did you do?  Is  
there a rebuilt steering box ($$$$$) in my future?
