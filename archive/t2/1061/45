Ben,

This usually occurs when the plug gets crossthreaded when screwed into
the head.  

In my experience, if the plug *was* in fact crossthreaded, the 
problem re-occur and happen with increasing frequency.  The only 
"solution" is to pull and replace the head.  You can try to use a 
helicoil or other insert and it may lengthen the lifetime of your 
head but I wouldn't trust it - especially not for long hauls or heavy
duty.  (Search the archives for more info)

Cheers,
   Avo
   (back to lurking and finishing off horrendous work project)
