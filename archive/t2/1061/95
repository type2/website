Hylomar is a non-hardening sealant (it gets thick and sticky), and 
works great for closely fitting parts. It's often used for sealing VW 
case halves. I use it on valve cover gaskets (only on the cover side - 
the side against the head gets a thin layer of grease). If you ever 
take the cover off an air flow meter, it works great for sealing it 
back up.
