James and all:

It's funny you should mention that.  My custom made Christmas Card this 
year depicts a deserted lake on the Eastern Slope of the California 
Sierra.  It's deep blue and surrounded by untouched forests.  Of course 
without the Bus to camp in, I couldn't have gotten near this place as 
their are basically *NO* motels within a couple of  hours in any one 
direction.

Merry Christmas, Volks!

BEN
