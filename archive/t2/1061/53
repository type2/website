Subject: Problem: No more adjustment left in my ebrake

Volks,

70 single cab.

When i pull the ebrake handle to engage the ebrake, it comes way out, and
really does not have a strong brake action.  I had installed new ebrake cables
when i redid all the brakes a few years ago, and they are adjusted all the way
to the max.

Any ideas here?  I do not remember if we measured the rear drums for wear or
not....i hope my drums are not worn out.  This vehicle has excellent stopping
power, with its original drum brakes.
