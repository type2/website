I think replying to this email jinxed me!  Now intermittently the starter
spins without engaging!!

Or to ANY 12 Volt VW for that matter.  Every VW I currently own and have
owned in the past (which has been way too many in the past 30 years,) has a
WR-1 installed.  Afterwards, any that previously displayed any slight
starter problems all worked and continue to work better than new.  Don't
leave home without it.

YMMV

That relay does wonders.  The Bosch # for the relay kit is WR-1.  The kit
comes with the harness and installation destructions.  A good upgrade for
any Bus/Vanagon from 76.

Has anyone been able to access a Bosch catalogue to read this? I'm wondering
what it's all about? Here is the quote from the online jobber website for
the 77 type2 auto trans starter.
BEFORE installing this starter, refer to Application Notice #B-45 in the
Bosch reman catalog regarding low system voltage on this application.
Is this about installing a starter relay? Just wondering.
