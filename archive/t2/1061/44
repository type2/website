Subject: Holy Poppin' Plugs - Batman!

Here's a weird one.  I am driving home from church in the pouring rain 
(of course) in the Bus.  Suddenly there is a BANG and a clattering 
noise.  Pulling over, I see the front plug on the left dancing around 
the engine compartment tethered by it's cable.

I shut down the Bus, called the neighbor, got ride home, changed 
clothes, gathered tools, and back to the bus.  Replaced plug with a new 
spare from my parts box and it fired right up.  2 miles later, BANG! 
Clackety Clackety -- this time it's the *rear *plug on the left. 
Repeated above process, and by this time was dripping wet.

I got home torqued the plugs to spec and drive the bus 50 miles in the 
rain on a holiday trip.  Today I'm back and it's fine. 

But I am puzzled.  Why did this happen?  Are there any other precautions 
I need to take before I head for the shore next week?

Thanks,

BEN
