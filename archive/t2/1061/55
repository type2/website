Subject: Re: [T2] My steering has alot of play....advice needed

I will try  to turn the other way tomorrow. I hope it is not at the max 
already.

I have adjusted these in the past on beetles, and you are right they 
generally turn easy.  I just figured this may be the first time this one has 
ever been adjusted, and thus stuck in one spot..........
