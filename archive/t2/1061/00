It might not be gear teeth at all...

If you solenoid is worn, it might not be engaging reliably.

If your wiring is "tired", you may not be getting enough current to the starter/solenoid. If you still have the original starter wiring, it is certainly going to be less effective due to corrosion. Look in the library for info on how to install a "hot start" relay...this will avoid redoing all of the wiring, and will also allow the starter/solenoid to have a longer useful life.
