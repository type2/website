Subject: [T2] My steering has alot of play....advice needed

Here is where i stand now.  I found my Muir book, and had my son turn the 
steering wheel while i watched what was going on.  ALL the play was with the 
steering box...none with the swing lever or drag link.

Here lies the problem.  I loosened the locknut on the steering box, sprayed 
some penetrate on the screw with the slotted head.  That screw has a very 
wide slot, and it will not budge with a normal screwdriver.  I need 
something wider, to fit the slot better, so that i don't break the end off 
this screw.  Any ideas from someone down this road before me would be 
appreciated.
