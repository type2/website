there's a picture of my wife's 72 westy and you can see how they made the  
wheel well area out of bondo and how I replaced it with original sheet  metal.  
If you can post a picture of the damaged area I could better advise  what you 
need to fix it properly.

This  appears excessive to
me. Do any of you have experience with this. Also, on  all busses I have
seen, there are two holes to the left and right rear of  the engine
compartment. They appear to be possibly for drainage. The shop  wants to
cover them up. Is this a bad idea? Thanks a lot for any advice you  folks
have.
