....stop!   that screw should turn very easily.   It's not a "bolt" like 
you might think.

And 1/16 or 1/8 of a turn is a significant amount of adjustment.

Make sure your locknut is actually loose, and try turning the screw the 
other way...you may already be at max. adjustment.

Or your box is dry and rusted inside.........in which case getting that 
screw to move won't help anything.
