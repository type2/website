Subject: throttle cable freezing up

Subject says it all...It's 13 F. and the front of the cable (where it enters the tube) has frozen...I've?freed 
it with a heat gun but what could/should I shoot in there to prevent it happenin' later today...And yeah, the
rubber cap on the tube needs to be replaced...;-(
