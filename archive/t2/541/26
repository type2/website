Your odometer gear is probably broken / loose / missing.  If it's just 
loose or floating around in there, you can probably just push it onto 
the shaft and be done with it (I recently fixed the odometer on one of 
my spare speedos this way ... I like simple fixes :-)

If it's missing, you can buy a replacement (search the archives .. a 
source for these gears was recently posted to the type2 list), but the 
gear will not be cheap.

Probably cheapest would be to go to a junk yard and pull an instrument 
cluster from a junked bus / vanagon (depending on what you have) and 
use it for spare parts.  Each of my junk yard trips usually results in 
an additional instrument cluster sitting in my cabinet of parts.
