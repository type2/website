< Are you saying I needed to do alot of the prep you mentioned before
the powder? I thought, and I could be wrong, that the powder needed to
go over bare, clean metal. 

I think at least an acid bath with some metal prep would have retarded
any rusting.

This is the problem--

Sand blasting, media Blasting, bead blasting doesn't get it all--there
will always be something left behind in the pores of the metal.

The acid will---and it'll give you longevity on the finsihed product.

This is why I'm not really crazy about the powder coating.

You have to eliminate any sealer's / primer's to get the job done--and
this to me is an invitaton to the item refinished going to hell again--
