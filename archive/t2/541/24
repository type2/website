GGM replies,

It will take way longer than an hour, so doing the math
(I love the power of math)

How many miles does the odometer change for every hour of drill running
time?

the speedometer (odometer cable is connected to the left front tire)

everytime the tire turns one revolution, the cable turns one revolution

my bus tires measure roughly 26" O.D or circumference

C=(Pi) D

or C= (3.14)(26")  = 81.7"

that is the tire circumference in inches, but I want to get to feet

then how many feet does the tire roll to get one revolution

so 12" per foot or 1 foot = 12"

( 81.7" ) times (1foot per 12" ) =

the tire rolls 6.8 feet for one whole revolution of the tire

now how many times does the tire roll one whole revolution in a whole mile?

a mile is 5280 feet

(5280 feet per mile) times ( 1 revolution per 6.8 feet) =  776 tire
revolutions per mile

the tire rolls 776 revolutions per mile of odometer change

so if the odometer cable turns 776 revolutions the odometer will change by
one mile

checking another way

[please do not get confused with my poor math connotatios, I do not have a
blackboard, sometimes you do have to multiply or divide the numbers, it is
just easier in this email format to say ( n ) times ( n ) , please note that
when something is {per} that means it goes under the other number and you
have to divide]

but how many revolutions is that when you are going 70 miles per hour?

(the drill may turn faster than 70 mph, but I will address that soon)

so, (776 revolutions per mile) times (70 miles per hour) =

54,320 revolutions per hour to make the speedometer show 70 miles per hour

or when the speedometer shows 70 miles per hour it takes

 54,320 revolutions per hour to make the odometer change by 70 miles

or

(54,320 revolutions per hour) divided by ( 70 miles)

or

776 revolutions per mile change on odometer in one hour going 70 miles per
hour or going any miles per hour

(you can figure this problem out using any speed, I just chose 70 mph to get
a relationship between the revolutions the speedometer - odometer cable has
to turn to change the miles in an hour, this is just a redundant check)

I have some pretty heavy duty type drills that go slower than light duty
drills

You want to turn big diameter 1/2" drill bits really slowly, because the
large diameter bit has a large circumference and the far out edge of the bit
will be turning much faster that the far out edge of a small diameter bit.
Okay, it will not be turning faster rpm's, but the speed of the far edge of
the bit over the surface it is cutting will be faster. Think of a big old
fashioned LP vinyl record  The whole record is turning at 33 revolutions per
minute. When it is turning you can read the label because the lable, near
the center, doesn't look like it is going very fast because the lable, near
the center, is traveling around a small circumference. However, if you put
the label on the far out edge of the record, you couldn't read it, because
the far out edge has a large circumference and the far out edge has to
travel around in this much larger circle in the same time the center of the
record travels around a small cirle. Back to drill bits. If the surface
speed is too fast, the bit far edge cuts against a lot more metal and it
gets overheated and is ruined. My heavy duty big bit drills only turn at 250
revolutions per minute.

You want to turn a tiny drill bit very fast because you can get away with
turning it very fast. the far out edge of a tiny drill bit does not move
that much faster relatively than the center of the bit. If you move a tiny
drill bit very fast, it stays cooler and cuts faster.

So if you have a drill for tiny drill bits, your drill might turn as fast as
4000 revolutions per minute

that is a really fast drill

Lets get that 4000 revolutions per minute into revolutions per hour.

(4000 revolutions per minute) times (60 minutes per hour) =

drill goes 240,000 revolutions per hour

now how long does the drill have to run to make the odometer change by how
much?

lets say you run the drill for one hour.

you get 240,000 revolutions of drill

(240,000 revolutions per one hour running drill ) times

 ( 1 mile change per 776 revolutions of cable) =

309 miles odometer change per hour with the cable hooked up to very fast
drill

in ten hours drill time

( 309 miles change per hour drill time) times ( 10 hours drill running time)
=

3090 miles change in the odometer when the drill runs 10 hours

in 100 hours drill time

( 309 miles change per hour drill time) times ( 100 hours drill running
time) =

30,900 miles change on odometer if you run the drill 100 hours

so you only get 309 miles change in odometer when hooked up to a dril for a
whole hour

using these size tire diameter measurements and a super fast 4000 rpm drill

plug in your own measurements and your own drill speed,

your drill will probably wear out long before the odometer gets to zero
