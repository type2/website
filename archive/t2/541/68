Chris,

I have some of the same issues on some original vw wheels.

It's called the Faraday Cage Effect.  Where you have two surfaces with a 
"deep" corner, the powder does not get as electrostatically drawn in to 
the crack.

Powder coaters "nightmare"...found this...

I believe the answer is to use some of the "special" metal filler and 
smooth out the cracks so that the effect is not quite so bad or 
is elminiated.

Several powder coating companies sell such a thing.

BTW, you can see some wheels that I powder coated on my... ummmmmm... 
"other ride"(Brazillian Puma...also a vw) here.

The black is the powder coated part.  I have about 4 hours each worth of 
work in these wheels.  They are aluminum.  The last picture is a little 
fuzzy, but seeable.  Sorry they are so large.

BTW, I *did* clear powder coat the rear sides, but did not coat the
area where the drum/rotors will bolt up because of the difficulty of keep 
ing the clear out of the area where I wanted just black.  I have 
some others that were done at a shop and are completely covered in powder 
coat.

Chris, I *want* to see your bus on the road eating mustangs for lunch!!!

Cheers, dave
