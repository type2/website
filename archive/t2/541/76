Considering prepping wheels for painting:

Considering that the wheels have a sharp blind crack where the wheel
center joins the rim, how does one get all the rust and such out of that
crack?  Sand blasting is limited by the size of the media.  Chemical
methods are limited by the need to get the chemical out of the crack
afterwards.  Is there really any sure method of getting rid of the rust?

My  method, which seems to be sufficient for SoCal, is to wire brush and
repaint the wheels with rattle can paint each time the tires are
replaced.  The wheels look good, but this doesn't do much for corrosion.
