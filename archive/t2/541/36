Cut corners?  Maybe...but it is more likely that he didn't chemically treat 
the wheels before coating them.  Physical removal of rust on a visually 
inspected basis is only half of the job.  On a molecular level, there is 
still oxidation at work.  Without a zinc treatment of some sort, the cancer 
will arise yet again!
