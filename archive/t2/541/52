Subject: Re: [T2] Painting wheels with POR

As in the sheet metal on the body--any exposed, bare, naked metal should
first be treated with phosphoric acid--like Dupont's Metal prep--then
acid etched primed with zinc chromate, and then in my professional
refinishing opinion painted with a good urethane paint.

A base / clear coat with a flex agent in the clear coat would be an
excellent choice--and the wheels would look 3 ft. deep--

Marine urethane refinishing materials are notorious for their
durability,  and ease of application--and also an excellent choice--

No rattle can stuff now you guys--:>)


Take Care---
