Subject: Re: [T2] Painting wheels with POR

Phil,
 Brush on  zinc chromate acid etch primer---after you blast or remove
all of the current stuff you have on them wheels--

Sand smooth

Now--here's the trick for a slick, bullet proof, long lasting wheel
finish that can be rolled or brushed on---

Petit or Awlgrip urethane marine hull paint--available at any on
line---or local ships store.

The stuff flows out beautiful---and will outlast whatever the name of
that enamel you laid on the wheels the last time.

The POR sruff wold be hell so get a brush on slick finish--

The VW Bus community is the only place remaining on earth, that still is
into coach paintng--:>)



Take Care--
