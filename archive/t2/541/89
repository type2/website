Subject: Re: [T2] Roll Back Odometer , replacing engine....

I did this on my 75 but only because the odometer gear had been broken 
for years before I bought it. The Arizona Dept. of motor vehicles frowns 
on this procedure unless it is noted on the title that the true mileage 
is unknown. This is the states effort at preventing fraudulent Used car 
dealers from misrepresenting their products.

To roll back the miles you have to remove the speedometer from the 
instrument cluster. Then pull the odometer gear off it's shaft. I 
chucked a short pencil with a new eraser in my variable speed drill and 
pressed the end of the eraser on the odometer shaft. the eraser acts as 
a clutch and allows for a little misalignment of the drill. start the 
drill at a slow speed and slowly get faster. All I can say is use good 
judgment as to how fast you spin those numbers! Keep in mind how slowly 
those numbers click off when going down the road. I think I spun mine at 
about 1/2 total rpm of the drill with no ill effects.
