Subject: Re: [T2] vacumn readings

I have been getting 13-14" of vacuum on my type IV 2.0 FI motor that has about 15K since rebuild. Had a small leak at an intake manifold and fixed that, now I can detect no other leaks and the engine runs great as it always has.This motor has never missed a beat and gets decent gas mileage, I just got a vacuum gauge a few months ago and decided to check. Thats when I detected the small manifold leak, which I fixed. Perhaps I should check compression as I am perplexed as to why I would have such low readings at idle on a solid motor with no vacuum leaks. I am running a stock motor with the exception of a Webcam mild grind I think number 75 or something like that. Any thoughts ???
