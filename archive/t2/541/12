Scott,

ummmmm quite a bit longer than an hour.  Let's say you have an odometer
at 77,000 miles and want to wind it 23,000 miles forward to zero.

Also, that your drill will make the speedo register 100mph...that would be
about 230 hours(9.5 days)  or so to get back to zero.

Don't ask me how I know this!<grin>

I really wanted my 78 to start at zero again, but really didn't have the
time either.  At "44,000" , it was almost as bad forward as backward and 
just wasn't worth it to me.

Cheers, dave
