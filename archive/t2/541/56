No sh... errr snot!?! -- I never thought of that. I saw the way her '66 was
set up and thought this one would require some sort of rail as well. Hers
has a rail attached over the side doors that a larger "seam" along one side
of the tent slides into. 

I figured this one snapped onto a rail because it IS a driveaway tent but
the thought never occured to me that it uses the rain gutter.

Thanks Terry.
