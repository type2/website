Yes, there is.... you need a 68-70 L code lock and
have it recoded to your key or a 68-71 [71 is R code]
lock and have a different key just for it. 

There are two different style hooks, a curved one and
a straight one, so you need to find one that is the
same as yours. I will pmail you tonight and send both
pics of the hooks so you can see the difference.
