Subject: Re: [T2] Painting wheels with POR

One thing I have seen with my powdercoated wheels is the necessity of adding a bead of caulking to match the paint between the hub section of the wheel and the rim section of the wheel. Apparently the powder does not do a good job of getting into that crack and sealing the metal. Mine are unsealed so far but despite sitting outside for 2 years they are just barely showing any rust stains. I plan to add the caulk before I return it to the street SOON (I hope).
