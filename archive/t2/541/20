Yes, that's the blower to move heat from the engine up to the cabin.

I believe people have added marine bilge blowers to the ducting to provide
an additional, and more constant, boost to the stock setup.  You can
proabably find info in the Type2 or Vanagon "libraries" or via the archives.
Maybe try a search on bilge blowers.

Don't know.  The stock front fan just blows cold air.  You *do* get a fan
forced defroster with the current setup, but only via the alternator-mounted
fan.

The EGR valves themselves are NLA from VW.  The ones you find in junkyards
are usually shot (as are the filters) so the only viable source, absent
somebody with a "good used" stash are the vendors for the filters and, I
believe, one outfit that can supply rebuilt valves.

By all accounts stock distributor, with or without pertronix, is best bet
for these engines.

I've never done it but have seen lots of discussions on the list, so a
search of the archives should turn up something.

It may have been bypassed because it leaks, and these too are NLA.
