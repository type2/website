Karl says about type4 aux. heater blower/main fan:

>>No, not all the HEAT air comes from the plastic >>fan. That's just a helper fan to keep the >>alternator cool and send air up front at idle. >>Above idle, the big metal engine fan sends the heat >>up front.

Which is totally correct.  But Tom, despite the recent Von Salzen holiday decree, contradicts thusly:

>No, that's the cooling fan for the engine and has no >connection to the heating system.

Tom, you better take a look at the bottom of your fan housing and see the little rectangular ports that supply air to the heater boxes.  It DOES supply the majority of air to the heating system just as the upright fan did on the type1's.

It also does what you mention below.

>It pulls cool air in from the engine compartment; >the air circulates past the heads and cylinders and >exits below the engine. 

Wait a minute:

>The metal fan inside the plastic housing attached to >the alternator is driven
>"coordinated" with the cooling fan since there's a >belt connecting the two.

Well, its the alternator belt, which mainly turns the alternator, but the fan in the alt. as well, by default.

>As engine speed picks up 
>the heating fan also speeds up, sending more warm
>air up front.

Are you talking abou the aux. fan speeding up?
No it doesn't.  It is single speed on/off electrical in everyway.
