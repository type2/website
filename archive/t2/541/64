Wow Dave--

I have an awfully hard time believing that the finish on any wheel would
start flowing--
That's really crazy--

Think about all the litigation that would be going on if this was a
fact,
There would be wheels flying off all kinds of vehicles--the roads would
be lined with them--

I ain't buying that one--
And I do agree with you--them wheels never get that hot---

Maybe if you had a stuck caliper riding on the rotor all day--maybe it
would make the wheel awfully hot--but not enough to make any powder
coating run---

Have you ever seen any paint on any wheel blister from brake heat?

I sure haven't--and powder coating is tougher than paint--

More key board thinking from Jamie (?)--:>)_

See Ya--

Terry,
Whooo! Jamie Rivers(I think) and I had this conversation about a year
ago and his experience was close to personal. He blamed it on the fact
that the drum/rotor got very hot and caused the powder coat to flow
again.
I listened and paid attention and when I recently did some wheels in
powder coat, it didn't bother me at all...because! I have had to reheat
some already powder coated stuff and realized two things....it really
doesn't "flow" again except at about 400 degrees plus(and not even
really then). The second part was that I have a infrared thermometer now
and have checked my drums/ brakes after several hi speed stops...
The *rims*/lug nut parts never got anywhere close to that temperature...
So, I torqued mine down good and drove off into the sunset....
Cheers, dave
