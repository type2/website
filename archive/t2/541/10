Not True Chris--

The only problem with an hour meter is any time the ignition is on--the
engine doesn't even have to be running-- the time is ticking.

25 hour's?

Naw--about 100 average hours.

And again this all depends on how the vehicle is driven--in town or on
the road---

In town more hours--on the road less.

Just because your not going to be averaging 60 mph all the time
