Subject: Re: [T2] Roll Back Odometer , replacing engine....

Piston airplane engines are very similar to A/C VW engines... they use what's called a Hobbs meter to measure actual engine operating hours. Most hobbs meters are triggered by the engine oil pressure sensor to run only when the engine is running, and are used to charge hourly rental fees. All maintenance is scheduled based on the tach time (very similar to an odometer, but measures engine revolutions not miles). Tach time is usually less than hobbs (actual) time. Airplane engines get their oil changed at 50 hours.
