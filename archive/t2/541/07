Subject: Re: [T2] Heating questions

1) How does the electric fan mount? 

Dump the d*** Haynes manual. The Bentley manual is really worth it's salt... 

Mine had a large hose clamp that clamped the body of the motor to a tab welded to the top of the engine compartment. 

2) Does anyone know of a good source for the hoses that run under the length
of the bus? 

McMaster-Carr and Grainger has them. I'm getting ready to order them. Truck exhaust pipe is better and you can wrap that. Stay away from the PVC pipe. I used it and never smelled anything but I prefer to be safe. Works in a pinch. 

3) Does anyone know where I can find a good diagram of the heating system and
its duct work? 

Bentley. 

4) clam shell type

Don't have any to sell but you may be missing a couple important pieces. At the clam shell cover there are aluminum flappers that you'll need. This keeps the air flowing forward when the aux fan is producing more air than the engine fan (idle). Also look inside your aux fan. There should be two flappers in there. They are made from palstic and over time tend to deform and fall out. 

Lastly make sure your flappers (heater volume controllers) aren't leaking too much heated air or the system efficiency will really suffer.
