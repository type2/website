Subject: plugs and compression test results

I thought I would practice on my transporter before I hit
the westfalia tomorrow morning.  It's pretty cramped in there
but I learned somethings..

Anyway.
Cylinder 1 : 130psi
Cyl 2: 130psi
cyl 3: 125psi
cyl 4: 135psi

This psi is higher than I expected from Muirs book
Type 4 Fuel Injected 2 liter with elect ignition.

here is the positioning I used.

front of bus (ie steeringwheel this way)
2  3
1  4

I followed Muir's guide for 6 or so cranks.
And I also took pictures of the plugs.
have a peek please:
