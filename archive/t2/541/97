You might be able to buy a helicoil or similar product and install it yourself, but I would asssume that would be a temporary fix. A mechanic could maybe install an insert without pulling the head.
 
Another possibility would be drill and tap the hole for an oversize spark plug, but it would be tough to get all the shavings out of the cylinder. Maybe position it with the exhaust valve open and use lots of compressed air...
