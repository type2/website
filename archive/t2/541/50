Subject: 1970 bus for sale...cheap

Well, I took off the parts I need, and the carcas is now for sale.  It has 
the tranny, which I was told was in good shape.  I can't be sure though.  It has 
good glass all around, with the exception of a crack on the passenger's side 
of the windshield.  The lowback front seats are in pretty sad shape, but I 
imagine they can be re-upholstered.  The tires are in good shape and it has the 
block, carb, exhaust and heater boxes.  It has a clear AZ title, but the bus 
came from Oregon originally, so I was told.  It has some rust, but it looks 
repairable.  I have pictures if you want me to email them to you.  Make me a 
reasonable offer, and the buyer arranges pickup or shipping.  It is in Flagstaff, 
Az.  Thanks.
