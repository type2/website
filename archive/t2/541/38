As you are all (prob painfully) aware I've been looking for a good home 
for the 71;


<http://www.geocities.com/tberk(-at-)sbcglobal.net/main_page.html>


I posted to the rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled NewsGroup as well as 
Craig's List- <http://www.craigslist.org>, CL is a great place for lots 
of things, if you haven't yet looked it over, check it out.

I have extended the deadline w/ the roommate to this coming weekend, 
that's only a few days but otherwise it'll be left for scavengers to crush.

Anybody want to come save this thing? While I am hoping to cover cost up 
to this point, It's not about the money.
