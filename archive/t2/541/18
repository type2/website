Subject: Re: [T2] 1980 vanagon questions

I just carefully cut the short peices off, clamp and all , carefully
dremelling, then replace with 7.5mm Mercedes hose or 5/16? american fuel
injection and fuelie clamps.
This was done last to 1972 fasty, I have no experience if the 1980 is
much different, but I had an open loop injection system with tiny hoses
to metal manifolds and permanent style clamps.
Good luck
