Subject: Re[2]: [T2] side tent

And sometimes one gets lucky.

$50 worth of parts and most of an afternoon/night making poles to fit a
tent for a '66 is what I "paid" for this later model side tent.

I just set it up in the office for the first time yesterday to take
pictures and check for problems before it gets used at the Texas VW Classic
a week from now.

Now I need the rail to put on the bus for attaching it. I know I need one
for the '74. I forgot to look at the Riviera to se if it has one already.

I'm not sure what year model the tent is or if it is for a bay or a
vanagon.
