Subject: Re: [T2] NEW Front Axle Beams!

"The price is $399.95.  Again, they fit 1971 on"

And for the uninitiated... they will also fit 1970 buses.  Modifications 
necessary may include brake line changes(if you upgrade to the vacuum 
boosted braking system)/steering box bracket relocation(unless you plan to 
upgrade from the peg-and-roller steering to the later version).  I believe 
the '68 transporter(not the NCC-1701 version, B.T.W.) has a different 
location for its beam mounting holes.  Is '69 the same as '70?  I bought one 
of Ron's beams from the last round of sales, and I'm looking forward to a 
tight, new suspension/brakes/steering again!

P.S. CIP1.com has O.E.M. VW tortion arm seals.  Get 'em while you can!
