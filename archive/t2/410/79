Subject: double cab gates/seat pedastal needed

Hello all,
I am looking for a set of usable gates for a 70 double cab. I have a real nice set that are too nice
for the truck that I have. I am using it as a truck and don`t want to ruin them. I have a buyer for the nice ones. I could actually use just the passenger side gate and four hinge mounts that bolt to the body, I have a rear and a drivers side but if someone does not want to separate a set I will buy them all. I could also use a rear seat pedastal.
Thanks,
Dave Parsons
