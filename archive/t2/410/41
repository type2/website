Not such a good idea.  The metal line was there for a reason, because it
was more durable than rubber hose.

Steel brake line makes a good replacement for the fuel tubing.  I don't do
the Hoover trick, but just take a 2" wide strip of inner tube rubber and
wind it around and around the line to a size slightly larger than the hole
in the tin, then push it through the hole with an inch on both sides.
Much easier on the line than the grommet, lasts for a very long time, and
gives adequate warning of failure.
