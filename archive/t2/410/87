Subject: RE: [T2] Mexico VWs?

When I registered Krista she had Alaska plates on her.  We had
driven her down after living in AK.  DMV checked the dash and the
sticker in the door jam on the drivers side.  Was surprised at how
thorough they were.  But Oregon is particularly retentive.

When I registered Freddy he already had Oregon plates.  They didn't
even bother to look.  I muttered a bit about having to take a 76
through Department of Environmental Quality when the cutoff date was
74, but I passed with flying colors.  The crazy thing is that they
had never tested a VW bus that close to the cut off date before,.. I
laughed.  I guess other folks find other ways of getting around DEQ.
