Subject: Dust cover no longer available?

I would like to replace the small bellows shaped dust cover at the point where
the heater box cable comes out of its tube at the rear. I've tried all the
parts supply houses normally mentioned on this list and nobody seems to have
them. This might be a trivial item but to me it seems important. This is a
nasty area for water splashing around and the tubes slope downward as they go
forward. I would think that any water (or mud) that gets in here will travel
straight down the tube to cause corrosion problems. Does anyone know of a
current source for this part (or a replacement)?

Thanks,
Bill Moon
