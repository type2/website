Subject: Re: [T2] Stupid Tool-Box Question

My '79 has a locking engine hatch, and I keep that locked more than the
doors, up here...

Some low-life always needs a battery...  they probably don't recognize
the digital cameras.  ;-)

No good.

Where's the best deal online for a group 27m marine battery box, anyone
done that lately?
