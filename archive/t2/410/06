Subject: Re: [T2] Re:liquid repair for loose ball joints?

Speaking of ball joints... the only repair that should be done to a ball
joint is replacement. I've seen what bad balljoints can do to cars.

On the street where I work (Cypress Creek and I-95 in Fort Lauderdale),
there are a set of train tracks that run parallel to I-95 for some ways..
all the way down to Miami and as far up as West Palm Beach as far as I
understand. In any case... the tracks as they cross Cypress creek are on
what would best be described as an island. We have to drive over that every
morning.... and let me tell you, unless you're doing 10 miles an hour... you
REALLY feel it. 

In any case, on the way to lunch about a week ago, I was cruising down the
road and wondering why traffic was soo bad. Turns out a Honda Civic
(probably a late 80s Civic) had cruised over that island going kinda fast
(like most people do), but it's front-left wheel broke off. As I passed it
(trying my best not to rubber neck), I noticed that the front left wheel was
bent IN.. you could clearly tell that the upper ball joint on the control
arm had failed and that it was only attached at the bottom.

Kinda funny looking, but the guy was ok. I'd hate to see what something like
that would do if it happened in a Transporter.
