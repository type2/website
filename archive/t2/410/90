Subject: RE: [T2] Mexico VWs?

Okay,
If that black grill is for the radiator,(and I believe you on that,
it sounds right) do they run radiator hoses all the way back to the
rear? or is the water cooled motor moved forward?  I've seen these
on the road before and the nose of the bus is not extended any
further than the buses that we know and love.

If (the motor) it is moved forward, does a Mexican bus have a cargo
floor that goes all the way back to the rear hatch?  Next time I go
to Mexico I gotta check one of these out.
