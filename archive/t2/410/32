The same thought crossed my mind. There are aftermarket locking engine lid
handles. They are kind of spendy but most likely not as spendy as losing a
bunch of tools.

    If you volks are keeping equipment in an
  empty battery tray, aren't you worried about curious strays and the
  five finger discount(i.e. theft?).  Or is there some aftermarket
  locking latch for the engine compartment?
