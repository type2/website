Subject: RE: [T2] Mexico VWs?

I think they would know the difference...they are trained in the art of
suspicion...if anyone ever gets the cajones to do something like this I
would love to go!

"Of course, the border guards have NEVER seen a Mexico VW, nor a USA VW, and

they would not be able to tell the difference, and they probably don't know 
what you are trying to do, and they would not want to stop you just because 
you DID NOT have any peace symbols on the VW (opps, we forgot something.  
Break out the hippy stuff..  OK, how many leaves was that . .  ? ? ?.)"
