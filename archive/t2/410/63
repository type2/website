I always thought a very sneaky place to hide stuff would be behind that 
black round panel on fuel injected buses that covers the ecu and fuel 
hoses to the tank.  certainly not practicle or large enough for tools 
but just think of the things you could get away with...  you could slip 
a mexibeetle past customs or something like that (or maybe just fruit).
