Subject: Re: [T2] Aux. battery relay

I don't know that there is any advantage to wiring it to the coil except that
it is alot closer. In the diagram that came with the relay kit it says that 86
can be wired to any switched 12v source. Since this just powers the
relay(opens or closes it depending on the key position) I am assuming any
switched 12v supply should work which the coil is. On the  original relay it
looks as though the 86 lead was wired to the blue wire on the voltage
regulator harness, which by the Bentley goes to the dash alternator light.
That's where I tried it first but it was blowing the fuse there also. Dunno
I'm stumped.

  I've never seen the kit just the original relay which switches (86) by the
  wire coming from the alternator. What's the advantage of wiring it up to
the
  coil?
