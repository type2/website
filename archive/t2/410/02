The Westy wiring diagram says D+ (terminal 61) on the alternator is the wire
to use. Should the batteries be connected together if the alternator isn't
running? I suppose that can be debated.

It sounds like some kind of resistance in missing in the circuit. The
current that is drawn from the coil through the relay 86 to ground 85 is
obviously to be too much because the fuse is blowing. Someone else must have
had this problem...
