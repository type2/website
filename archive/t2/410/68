Subject: RE: [T2] Mexico VWs?

I asked this question last year and was told it was nearly impossible...yet
it can be done with a btlmex...I think it was basically an issue of cost.

I think 2001 was the last year of the Bay Window in Mexico.

Hey guys,

1) What was the last year they produced the "Bay Window" Bus in Mexico?

2) Is it legal to buy a fairly new Bay window Bus from Mexico, swap the vin
tags and frame pieces and call it an American 1973 Bus?
