Subject: Vac Hoses

My 75 FI bus has what looks like 2 vac ports on the throttle body - can
someone tell me what connections need to be made here- I believe the port on
the firewall side of the throttle body links to the distrib - does the front
port link with the pressure reg ?
Just want to confirm - used the colour diagram posted by Richard but my set
up seems slightly different from his -

Thanks
Eric
