Subject: RE: [T2] Mexico VWs?

Bob,
 Who is going to take the time to see if the all the VINS match on vehicle
crossing the border or when it is taken to titled and registered in the US? 

no it is an issue of "frame" the beetle has a seperate frame member with
the VIN on it and that part can be swapped, the bus (un)fortunately is
unibody and has no seperate frame to be the foundation for building a new
bus around
