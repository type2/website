Rob,

A few reasons you might not be getting spark:

1.  If you run +12V directly to the coil and you still don't have spark when
the engine is turned over, then the points are not opening and closing
correctly, or they are not connected properly with the condensor, or maybe
the condensor is bad.

2.  It is possible to have spark coming out of the coil but not out of the
distributor cap.  This happened to me last weekend when I was leaving town
on a roadtrip, luckily my preferred VWFLAPS was willing to deliver me a new
cap and rotor and I was on my way.  This cap was not very old.

3.  If your spark is not blue-white, but orange, you need a new coil.

4.  If your ignition switch is disintegrated, you need to connect a switch
to run the coil, and a momentary pushbutton to operate the starter.  I have
had a coil switch in (on the dash above the fusebox) for some time, and it
looks like I will have to install a pushbutton too, unless I can find a good
ignition switch.  If you get a $10 relay kit for the starter (solenoid), the
Radio Shack pushbutton will last longer, and you will avoid the infamous
hot-start problems.

Good luck,
