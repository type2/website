You might want to double check that line again. Sometimes they look OK from
the outside but they have swelled on the inside restricting the flow of
fuid. What year bus is it? It may be a blocked compinsation port in the
master cylinder also. I am assuming this is on the rear wheels since you
mentioned the hand break right?
