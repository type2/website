Subject: Re: [T2] ATV jackstand for engine drop

i use the red atv lift for dropping vw engines and it does make the job
very easy.  the only modification needed is to put a board over the 2 lift
sections as on a t1 motor if you don't it will bend up the tin.  i had a
rather easy time droppign and replacing the t4 motor and tranny together
with it also all by myself.

I was notified by email from harbor freight of an ATV/motorcycle lift that
was on sale for $59 today

It looks like it is custom made to drop VW engines. Has anyone ever tried
to use one of these things?
