Subject: ATV jackstand for engine drop

I was notified by email from harbor freight of an ATV/motorcycle lift that was on sale for $59 today http://www.harborfreightusa.com/displayitem_retail.taf?Itemnumber=02792
 
It looks like it is custom made to drop VW engines. Has anyone ever tried to use one of these things?
