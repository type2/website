Subject: RE: [T2] ATV jackstand for engine drop

At $59.99. go for it !!!

The web site has it listed for $99..99.  It can be found on the web site for 
$69.99 if you look for item 02792-3VGA

Be aware that it will be HEAVY.  The shipping weight is 75 lbs.

I looked at a comparable one at Sears, and the Sears one was too heavy for 
an older person like me to throw around just for the heck of  it.

I have a floor jack at 40 lbs that I only use sparingly..

I ordered the transmission jack.  It is just $49.95 in season but it is not 
hydraulic, but it does weigh a lot less.  If I could have gotten the 
ATV/Motorcycle jack one for $59.99, I would have bought it and called a 
friend each time I needed help ..

So, go for it.  I am sorry it was not available at that price when I was 
ordering the transmission jack.
