Subject: Re: [T2] Stupid Tool-Box Question

For a tool box, you could always use a marine battery
box. That way if someone decided to peak in there they
would not automatically suspect that valuable tools
might be in there. For the extra mile, you could have
a couple of cables coming out of it and tuck them into
inconspicious corners. It wouldn't be hard. Those
boxes are water resistant and it would fit in that
area perfectly.

It won't stop some people though. (Warning! Off topic
story) Some people have no decency and will steal your
stuff no matter what you do. Recently, Someone went to
one of our local fire stations and snuck in one of the
open garage doors. They proceded steel the station's
SUV and take if for a joy ride. The bad thing is that
the firemen were playing basket ball in the back yard
and didn't realize what had happened until they heard
it drive away... 

I have seen the black locking engine latches. Does
anyone sell chrome locking engine latches? Just a
thought. Take care!
