Yup.... we did one in a snow storm,

You have to remove the window glass and the vent window.
from the top of my head,,,,,
have the window glass unbolted and at the bottom of the door
vent window first
pull down the felt near the vent window
remove the philips screw
remove the 6mm bolt with a 10mm head at the lower pivot of the vent window
tip it back and out and up
pull out the window glass
take out the regulator
install the new one
put the glass back in
put the vent window back in
and everything else......
