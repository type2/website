Subject: RE: [T2] Mexico VWs?

I don't think I'd chop up my 73 to but a new Bus body on it. But I'm sure I
could go to Mexico and bring back a 2001 Bus for like $1,000 bucks or less,
put it in the garage, then buy a 1970 Bus from the junkyard (there's like 4
of them) try to get the original title, and swap all the identification
stuff I can from the old Bus, to the new Bus.

Bob,
 Who is going to take the time to see if the all the VINS match on vehicle
crossing the border or when it is taken to titled and registered in the US? 

no it is an issue of "frame" the beetle has a seperate frame member with
the VIN on it and that part can be swapped, the bus (un)fortunately is
unibody and has no seperate frame to be the foundation for building a new
bus around

Bob
