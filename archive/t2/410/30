Subject: RE: [T2] Stupid Tool-Box Question

This thread brings up an interesting thought.  I have always had
troubles with kids and such opening up the lid to the motor.
Usually it is just out of plain curiosity, and maybe once in every 8
years out of malicious intent.  It's why I removed my stock gas cap
and put a locking one on.  If you volks are keeping equipment in an
empty battery tray, aren't you worried about curious strays and the
five finger discount(i.e. theft?).  Or is there some aftermarket
locking latch for the engine compartment?
