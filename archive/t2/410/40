Subject: diagram???

Is there somewhere to find a diagram of the vacuum hoses for my 1800cc 
engine, a ledgible diagram for idiots that is.  I need to replace all of them but 
each one is a little bigger or smaller, and outside of cutting a little piece of 
each one off and looking like a moron, it would be nice to know wich is 
which.
