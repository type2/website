You may want to try www.pelicanparts.com under the Porsche 914 section here
http://tinyurl.com/fa4w  . They still stock some of those off the wall size
hoses. Also try BusBoys. Between those two I got almost all of the hoses
that I needed for my 2.0 FI engine. Not quite the same as the 1800 but worth
a shot.
