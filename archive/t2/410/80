You could I suppose but you'd be safer and better off waiting around for 
one of the 15K mile beauties that turn up on the list every once in a 
while. Cheaper than all of the court costs and seizure of the vehicle if 
you got caught. I'd buy (if I had $15K) a 15K mile beauty in a heartbeat. 
My Westy will have 215K miles on it soon... <grin>

>3) Did they ever produce the Vanagon in Mexico?

South Africa is your source. Stopped just in the past couple years. That 
right had drive setup might be a BIT obvious though...

>4) How about the Thing, and all the Type3 VWs like hte squareback,
>notchback, etc.

USA and Europe are all I know of them.

I think in the states like TN, AL, GA, MI and such the registration 
wouldn't be the difficult part but just getting it into the state...

Plenty of people swap VINs to save a GOOD old car. Good vin, bad body, bad 
VIN and good body.

You own the VIN donor and the VIN recipient so what's the moral problem? 
There are serious LEGAL problems with this though.

Another option might be to register a vehicle as a hot rod or something. In 
TN they assign NEW VIN numbers to hot rods. Not sure what they consider to 
be a hot rod. They have to assign new VINs because the original title is 
often lost on a 30's car or the finished custom is parts of 35 different cars.

Alot of folks buying NEW steel body reproductions (or fiberglass) of these 
30's cars and those cars may not have a VIN ever until it is registered the 
first time.
