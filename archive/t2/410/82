Subject: RE: [T2] Mexico VWs?

All I had to do in NC was to give the DMV proof of insurance, a VIN number
and get it to pass inspection...which if you have an old enough VIN would be
no problem since nobody physically inspects for that here when bringing a
vehicle into the state...in my experience any way. Not to mention they would
just take what ever VIN number I gave to my insurance company.

Here in Oregon, all vehicles that are registered from out of state have to 
pass a VIN inspection.  If the inspector was at all suspicious of a water
cooled 
VW bus that looked too "new", you could be in a bit of trouble.
