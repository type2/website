Lotsa different kinds of shimmy and shake.  If you disengage the
transmission and coast in neutral, does it still shake?  A tire
would still cause the bus to shake if that was the case.  You may
also want to climb under the front end and look at the beam.  Pray
for no stress fractures.  Is the shaking accompanied by any kind of
sound?  Is it a side to side shake or does it feel like you are
trying to drag a telephone pole over a BMX track?

If it only shakes when the drive gear is engaged, then your tires
are probably intact.  Maybe old and dangerous, but not a detatched
radial or anything like that.  Vehicles that sit for any length of
time get what's called checking on the walls of the tires.  It's
weathering of the rubber.  Lack of flex on the walls of the tires
and constant downward force on only one part of the tire(being
parked extensively) will cause irregular decomposition to the
integrity of that tire.  REPLACE THEM.  Tires with checking have a
nasty tendency to leak through the wall of the tire (unpatchable) or
blow out while you are cruising down the road. Do not pass Go, Do
not collect $100, game over.
Please be safe.
