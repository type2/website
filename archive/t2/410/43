Subject: Brake won't release...

Hi, wonder if anyone has experienced something similar.

 

Last year I had a nasty experience when my rear right brake jammed. I
didn't realise until it caused a blow out and the heat had seized the
cylinder etc. I had noticed before that under heavy braking, my van
always pulled to the right and countless shoes adjustments didn't clear
this up.

 

After the blow out there was no choice but to rebuild the whole brake so
I fitted a new cylinder, shoes and springs on both rear wheels and bled
everything. The result was the brakes seemed fine but I still
experienced the pulling to the right. I have my yearly UK MOT check
coming up so I thought I'd better try to sort things out.

 

I've fitted a new handbrake cable on the right but this doesn't help. I
got someone to activate the brake while I could watch the cylinder move
and noticed that it seemed slow to move out and then didn't return after
the pedal is released although if left for some time it does return
eventually. I've checked the brake line and can't find any blockages
close to the wheel.

 

Anyone care to suggest what might be the problem? I'm starting to
suspect the master cylinder..

 

Thanks

 

Al
