1.) Warm motor.  Shut down motor. Liberally spray penetrating oil on 
stuck plugs. (WD-40 is *not* penetrating oil. Kroil, Liquid Wrench, 
Chrysler/GM heat riser lubricant is.) Let engine cool. Spray again.  
Remove plugs. Loosen a bit, spray, tighten a bit, loosen a bit more, 
lather, rinse, repeat.  Slow and easy.  Worst case scenario: You pull 
the threads, but the motor needs to come out anyway. Easy fix with the 
motor out.

2.) Valve clearance and ignition timing are unrelated issues. '77 has 
solids, not hydraulic lifters. Check for .006/.008 all around.

3.) 60# compression is a valve seat or a valve failing. The head needs 
to come off.

If you friend is willing to get dirty, the fix could be done for a 
couple hundred dollars.  If not, $1000 isn't out of the question.

Good luck.

Jim
