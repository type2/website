Subject: 73 AdventureWagen questions

Just purchased my second bus: a 73 Adventurewagen with what I believe is a bug
1600 (single Solex) engine. It has some fuel flow problems currently, but I'm
looking for any/all info any other list members might have on this type of
vehicle. I know I'll want to swap in a larger engine (eventually), but what
was stock on these things? Any help grately appreciated.
