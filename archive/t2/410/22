Subject: testing Temp Sensor

I am attempting to test the #2 temp Sensor - I want to make sure that I am
doing this correctly because I am not getting any reading
Set my Ohm meter to 20000
disconnected sensor
touch red to sensor - black to ground
should read resistance-Correct ?

Should the ignition be on ? because I get a reading of  0
should I be going from the connection to connection ( where I disconnected)

Any help please- not very familiar with this - trying to follow Bentley

Bus is a 75 1800 FI - starts and idles for a while then dies - starts up
again same thing - shunts and jerks while driving - so been directed to test
this as a possible fault

Thanks
