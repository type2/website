 Ok guys, civics 101
 Ya walk into a store in LA to buy a pack of gum for a buck, clerk tells ya
 that'll be $1.08. Why, cause its a dollar plus 8% tax, will you get it
back?
 When pigs fly.
 Ya mail a package to the GWN and when it comes in, customs converts the
 value you declared into Canadian funds and charges you 7% tax (gst)goods
and
 services tax, will anybody get it back, see the previous pig. The tip is to
 use USPS and keep the declared value under 20$ cdn, it'll go thru with no
 charge.

 OK, now your a lumber producer in BC and you want to send 2X4's to home
 depot in LA, You,the producer, pay 27% on everything you ship. Thats a
duty.
 You the customer walk into that LA Home Depot and you pay tax on that 2X4
 you buy. Will anybody get their money Back, only when Bush can ride that
 flying pig.

 NAFTA exempts antique auto parts and a variety of other stuff from duty,
not
 from tax.

 Any time I have shipped Anything up to the land of eternal cold, be it
 via the PO, UPS or whomever, there is a box to fill in on the bill of
 laden of stated value of the contents of the item within.

 Every time I have shipped anything, or sold anything the buyer up there
 has pleaded with me to lower the declared value when the item is
 shipped.
