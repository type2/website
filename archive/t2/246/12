Subject: Dual Carb problems - can I drive her home?

I rebuilt the dual carbs on my recently purchased '72 transporter with 1700 engine. Dual Pict 32-34's were totally messed up with parts inside the float bowl and totally gummed up.
Put her all together and adjusted them to ear, figuring I would adjust them with synchronizer later. Took her for a spin today and she wouldn't 'kick down' from a high idle when I got to stop lights. About 3 miles into my journey she just quit. I was rolling so I bump started her and kept going. Next light she dies again and I notice smoke coming from the rear. The wire from the distributor (+) to the left carb was glowing orange and all the insulation was melted off. I grabbed a pair of pliers and yanked her off. Let her cool off and she had a minor difficulty starting but she did start. Still idling high and I drove the rest of the 1 mile to work. 
Question: 
1. Any ideas why she is idling so high? When I initially started her and played with her yesterday she was fine for the 1 mile test ride. 
2. Why would this wire start burning up? Obviously I did something wrong, but what?
3. What should I do before I attempt to drive her home this evening (4 miles/heavy traffic) besides waiting for traffic to die down. - I do plan on borrowing a fire extinguisher from my office.
Thanks,
