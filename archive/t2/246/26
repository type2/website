<quote>
 In a type 4 motor the flap on the 3 & 4 cylinder
side directs air through the oil cooler (the oil
cooler gets no cooling air without that flap).
They are an integral part of the cooling systems and
should not be left out.

Yes and no. The oil cooler will get some airflow but
not " as designed " So IMHO the flaps should be
installed in a type4. Even if the thermostat isnt
hooked up.. keep the flaps intact. They are spring
loaded in the open postion (max air flow).
