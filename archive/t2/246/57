52 is on the passenger side, 50 on the drivers side.  My engine stopped
working at 30k miles back in 1989.  Transcribed from a letter to a mechanic
passed onto me:

It had sat for 6 years by the ocean and in March 1988 it was given new
plugs, oil and filter, battery and muffler but the clutch had seized to the
flywheel and it was separated with the engine dropped.  Naturally, the
clutch cable rusted and broke trying to separate the clutch.

When it finally started the usual new muffler smoke came out but so did some
oil out of the pipe.  It was run once a month for 20 minutes until Dec 1988
when it stopped working and sat until Sept. 1989.

In 1989, *the* reputable VW mechanics in town, Ellis Motors (Victoria BC),
did the following rebuilt (from the receipt):

4 intake valve guides
4 exhaust valve guides
1 flywheel seal
1 intake valve
1 dip stick boot
4 exhaust valves
1 oil filter and 20w50 oil
1 piston ring set
1 gasket set
1 points
1 engine seal (old one deteriorated, not missing)
1 NPN used rocker arm

Parts came to $354.

Remove and install motor $140
Disassemble motor, grind valve sets, replace piston rings $400
Glass Bead heads and pistons $40
Hone cylinders $20

It's worked like a charm since.  You can still see the honing marks with a
flashlight.  It was an expensive lesson for the previous owner and hopefully
all gremlins were exorcised with the rebuild.
