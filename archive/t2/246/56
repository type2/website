Evening all

A friend of mine not on the list is doing brakes on his 76.  He needs a
master.  Is there any reason not to get one from NAPA, or other reputable
parts place?  I suggested he try one of the vendors, but he needs it now
rather than in a week or so.

Also, if the master is bad, will that make it seem like the booster isn't
working properly?  What it is doing is the pedal is soft and will fade, but
will pump up.  It also seems like regular brakes, not power brakes.

Thanks much.
