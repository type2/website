Subject: Re: [T2] Question for you'ze guys

 I don't have a sales brochure for the 71, but I have earlier ones:
 The 1968 bus has a vehicle weight of 2723 lbs.
 The 1969 bus has a vehicle weight of 2723 lbs.
 [this was curb weight, shipping weight was 2634]
 The 1970 bus has a vehicle weight of 2811 lbs.
 My 77 deluxe Westy curb weight is 3820 lbs. Add my weight and it is 4000
lbs!
 [curb weight is the weight of the vehicle in the ready-to-drive state] And
 that is not adding for additions like a tent, food, water, other passengers
etc.
 That 1000-1200 additional lbs. makes a BIG difference.

Wow! I think my question was more like comparing apples and watermelons!
LOL.
Thanks for the excellent answer, Karl!   Jan B
