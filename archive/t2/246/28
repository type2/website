Oh yeah.  You don't have enough advance at part throttle, for starters.  To 
test the theory you could set initial to 12-15BTDC and get back on the 
freeway.  Don't leave it that way though, and don't floor it.

Second consideration - what air correction jet are you running?  Try 
dropping it a few sizes to richen the mixture at higher rpms (like your 
60mph cruise).  This assuming your carb HAS an air correction jet - I'm not 
familiar with a Solex progressive.

Actually before you do that you should pull a spark plug or two and check 
the color.  If the plugs are white you will have confirmation that the 
temps are from a lean condition.
