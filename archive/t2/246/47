"Parts left out cost nothing and have an infinite service life."

Cute anecdote.  In my personal experience, I had a 1600DP rebuilt where they 
of course chose to leave out the flaps and thermostat.  The way I discovered 
that this had happened, was by the condition of my motor oil.  It became 
very sludgey and foamy inside the oil filler tube.  Subsequent research told 
me that this was condensation that was not being 'flash' heated out of the 
crankcase.  I'm not too sure what the eventual issues would be if left in 
this condition, as I pulled my engine and added the cooling parts, but I 
doubt that foamy oil does good things in your cooling system.
