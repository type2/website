I finally got around to doing a compression test on my 1700 dual carb =
motor.  Maybe someone can point me in the right direction on these =
readings?

Cyl        PSI        Plugs
#1        120        black/carbon
#2        120        oil fouling
#3        120        black/carbon
#4        96-100    blac/carbon


I tested #4 twice.  I am going to squirt some oil in #4 tonight and see =
what diff it makes.
If it comes to replacing the head, I have an unknown condition spare, =
how can I tell if my spare is any better?
