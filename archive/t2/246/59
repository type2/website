Subject: Re: [T2] Re: 50 and 52 stamped on heads...

Those numbers are casting numbers  and dont have anything to do with cc  
  of the  heads.  When i first saw this thread  i thought you were  
talking actual stamped in and not cast in numbers.  Itis  basically  
like a  batch number and shows what  mold was used for  the  casting.   
on type one heads they are usually in little triangles.  cc numbering  
is usually done by a rebuilder  and is on the other side of the head.    
most  dont  stamp and just use a marker  if  they mark at  all.
