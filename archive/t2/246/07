Well, I'm not so sure about this position.
I have two 1970 buses; both with original block engines and original heat 
exchangers.

Casper has no thermostat and no flaps, warms up nicely, and actually puts 
out more heat to the cab than NewBus. (more on this later = **)
Casper has been run in sub-zero temps and combined extremes of high 
altitude, wet, cold, low barometer.
He warms up fine, runs fine, and seems to have no complications at all from 
running without flaps or thermostat.
He has survived well in temps as high as 120 F with the road surface temps 
being above that, I would presume.

NewBus, on the other hand, still has all the original temp control stuff 
still mounted, and, interestingly enough, he appears to run a bit warmer 
than Casper here in the very hot Texas heat of Summer.

In about a month, I am going to pull the engine from NewBus.
At that time, I will install a doghouse cooler, larger volume fan, and the 
appropriate housing for same.
I will, most likely, remove the flaps at that time, as well............ 
Still undecided !

Getting more heat up in the cab of Casper may very well be a function of 
the flaps having been removed from the fan shroud. If that is the case, it 
leads one to wonder if "more heat/air to the cab" means "less air is being 
directed to the cylinder fins".

If so, I am not noticing any adverse temperature problems associated with 
the engine, and believe me, I have driven Casper in high and low temps that 
just do not make sense to be out in.

Of course - absolutely -  I may be way off base here according to the 
empirical calculations of the original German design crew,........... but 
success with the flaps removed is what I am experiencing with Casper.
