the automatic tranny was introduced in the 1973 model year so your bus
would almost need to be a 1973, what is your VIN #, the automatic was VIN#
223 2000 001 or higher  (camper/kombi 233 2000 001)

   there are actually two different auto tranny's used in the bus, 73-75
and 76-79 the later tranny will go into the older bus, the older tranny is
harder to get into the newer bus.   
   easiest way to determine the difference is on the older one there is a
vacuum cyl on the lower part of the tranny sort of under the right side
drive shaft where it enters the transaxle.    this is the vacuum shift
unit.   the later tranny does not have this as it has a centrifical
shifter.

the filter is a cleanable premanent filter, it is located in the sump,
remove the four bolts in the corners of the tranny sump and carefully
remove it (make sure it is drained and the fill tube is removed)  inside
there is a comma shaped plate about 6-7 inches long with two screws
holding it (gov shift) or a round screen about 3 inches in diameter
(vacuum shift) clean the screen and replace

yes and no, the rabbit tranny gearbox only is basically the same as the
govenor shift late auto tranny in a bus,  parts are still very hard to get

if you can find a decent torque converter, but they are usually the last
thing to go.

the torque converter as far as I know is an only a bus part.

there is a decent chapter on the auto tranny in the Bentley manual, highly
recommended

OH, the shifters are different between the early and late tranny so make
sure your front shift lever matches your tranny.  early tranny has
stops on the shifter as it determines what gear you are in, and the shift
lever on the side of the tranny will move fairly smoothly. the later one
has the stops or detents in the tranny and the lever on the side of the
tranny has positive stops in it's movement.

GEX should scare you

I one gram balanced when I rebuilt my 2liter and used top quality parts
and machinist and dropped just short of $2,500 I rebuilt mine more or less
stock
