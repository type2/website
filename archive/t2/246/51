are we talking pre vanagon or a vanagon westy.  the vanagon westy does 
not get
as good gas milage  with all the extra weight.  15 to 17 is what i get 
at average of  65 mph  at  this altitude.
  I found i do get a little better milage when i go down lower.  In a  
few weeks i will find out some more on a  little  longer trip to  hunt 
some wild chili peppers.
