Subject: Reluctant starter

After several weeks of flawless, but futile cranking as I tried to get my 78
Westy running again after engine removal and replacement, this weekend the
starter operates the crank one turn (maybe) and then just shuts off, while
the key is held in the starting position.  The battery is new and fully
charged.  The last things I did before this happened was to try to get dwell
angle, even at cranking speed.  The needle swung too wildly to get any kind
of usable reading.  Following Bentley manual, the red clip was put to
terminal one of the coil and the black to ground.  Next I tried to recheck
the timing with a powered strobe light.  This is when the engine would not
crank for more than a second.  Disconnected the strobe, but still the same.
Starter is being electrically cut off.  A bit later I had the bus towed to a
mechanic who admits to working on air-cooled VWs, but not usually the NEWER
stuff.  I left him my Bosch F.I. and Bentley and Haynes manuals.

I thought I would tap the collective wisdom of the list to see if anyone has
had a similar problem and what the cause was.   I am perplexed as the juice
is clearly getting to the solenoid and the starter or it would not crank at
all.

Thanks for any ideas
