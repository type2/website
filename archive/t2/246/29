I am running Castrol 20w50 and I haven't hooked up my CHT gauge yet so I 
don't know about the temp.  The oil pressure sender is the VDO idiot light 
and gauge dual hookup combo unit.   I did look in the archives using the 
search string "HIOP" as someone suggested and got a wealth of information on 
what seems to be a common problem with these engines.  I am not new to 
aircooled as I am a Corvair enthusiast but this is my first Vee Dub.  
  Even though they are air cooled engines, much of the cooling is really 
provided by the oil and it seems that with the hotter oil temps, the pump 
wear that I have, the (very slight) main bearing wear that I have et al. in 
an almost 30 year old engine that this is par for the course.  I am seeing 
the warning light come on because the VDO sender switches at a higher (10psi) 
pressure.  I haven't quite decided whether I might try boosting her pressure 
up a bit, hate to do that because it seems like a quick way to blow out an 
oil cooler seal or worse.  I appreciate all of the help given by everyone 
here!  Any more thoughts or ideas? Keep 'em coming!
