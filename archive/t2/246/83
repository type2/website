I wouldn't bother with the sodium valves.  They are expensive, hard to find 
and the jury is out on whether or not they are actually a benefit.  Some 
people have said that the stems are prone to breaking.  Manley SS valves 
are fine.  The Porsche 914 heads have sodium valves but they have larger 
diameter stems and thus are more reliable.  These heads are pricey and rare 
but will make good power.  They also require 3-bolt intakes instead of the 
4-bolt bus ones.

As it should.  Jake Raby has stroker engines but he doesn't sell the parts 
separately.  You might consider just buying one of his engines.  He has a 
good rep but of course it won't be cheap.  And you won't get hydraulic 
lifters (he doesn't believe in them).  If you find a source for 
counterweighted 2L cranks, please let me know - I want one.

Talk to WebCam (www.webcaminc.net).  I'm probably going to go with the 107i 
grind.

Don't know, but I am considering those rings also.
