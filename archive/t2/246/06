I bet Busted Bus would have that piece.  They are one of the first pieces 
of tin to be lost on a bus, it seems.

Mine has the drop too but the filter is always tight.  There is a leak 
coming from somewhere North of there, either the oil cooler or the oil 
pressure switch.  Check the pressure switch first as it is much easier to 
get to.  In my case it seems to be the oil cooler.  :(

Probably.  I've seen people seal (or try to seal) that seam with RTV.  I 
don't think it has a chance of working since the tube will move a bit every 
time you remove the cap.  The plastic tube can become deformed if it was 
installed improperly at some point in it's history.  If you take it off and 
look at it, you'll notice that it is designed with an inner tube that goes 
a short distance down inside the metal tube to prevent leaks when adding 
oil.  If this inner tube is messed up, that is likely the cause of the 
leak.  Also the plastic tube is designed to fit down into a notch in the 
metal tube so that it won't turn.  Make sure the plastic tube is completely 
seated in this notch and that the clamp is sitting in the recess that was 
designed for it.  I had to scrounge the junkyards for a replacement because 
my original was mangled and leaked (though it looked okay from the outside).
