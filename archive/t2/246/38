Theoretically, yes.  In practice though they seem fairly independent.  CHT 
(and exhaust temp) is a very good indicator of mixture/combustion problems 
while oil temp seems to be more load/rmp dependent.

For me it took several years of reliable bussing before I completely 
trusted my engine again after I dropped a valve back in... 1989?  Of course 
I've learned a lot since then and the dropped valve was partly my fault for 
trusting parts with an unknown history.  Even gauges will not save you in 
that case (I have had the same CHT, OT, and OP gauges in my bus for 14 
years now).
