Theoretically if the engine was running lean and creating excess heat=2C =

would the cylinder head temp affect the oil temperature=3F  =


I have the oil temperature sensor installed in the oil drain plate on =

the bottom of the engine=2E Shortly after I bought my bus it dropped 2 =

valve seats and I=92m overly cautious now=2E I believe I=92ve corrected t=
he =

problems which caused the dropped valve seats but it still makes me =

worry=2E

On a trip from Tennessee to Michigan this summer the temp remained =

under 235 degrees=2C Cruising speed about 65mph=2E No cylinder heat temp =

gauge=2E Oil pressure remained OK=2E
