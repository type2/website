I may have remembered wrong while posting...it could very well have been 5 
after...there is a red dot on the dial that I was setting it to.

I've been setting the timing with the engine shut off and with a volt meter 
measureing where the distributor got power...is this the wrong way??



>DOES the inboard pointing hose have vacuum at idle?

The vacum hose that goes to the dome side has vacum...the hose on the flat 
side doesn't...should it??

>If no, trace the hose back and find out why.
>If yes, does the timing change when you disconnect it at idle?

The idle speed changes when I disconect does this indicate a timing change??
>If no, then you have a bad vacuum unit.

Thanks for any help
