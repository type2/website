These don't sound too bad.  I wouldn't like to see more than 40 psi 
differential or so between cylinders.  See what it does with the oil in it to 
check your rings.  A really great diagnostic tool is a differential 
compression tester.  This pressurizes the cylinder (at TDC) with a measured 
80psi (or more) of air and then with a second gauge measures how much is 
leaking down past rings or past valves, etc.  A really quick way to find 
cause of low compression, spot a cracked head, burnt valve, a bad valve guide 
(done by rocking the valve in the guide in a sideload with pressure on), bad 
piston etc.  Tells you a lot by where the air is coming out, i.e. exhaust 
pipe, intake system or breather.
