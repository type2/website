Subject: accelerator pump questions

hey list, just installed dual 34 PDSIT's on 74 single cab with 1700 CB 
engine.  Runs very smooth except it doesn't accelerate as rapidly after 
about 2000 rpm as it did with the dual webers.  I have a 2 month old SVDA 
distributor on it from aircooled.net and timing is set at 7.5 BTDC.  I have 
noticed that one accelerator pump only has about half the stroke of the 
other one.  Would that cause the rather slow acceleration?  the thing runs 
perfectly accept for the slower acceleration, it's almost as if it's 
lagging a little....tia, greg
