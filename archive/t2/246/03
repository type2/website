Subject: Generator and Regulator Checks

After the multitude of problems experienced this weekend at BNNTA,  I'd 
like to be able to figure out how to troubleshoot my generator and regulator.

I have a 1971 bus. Can someone explain in layman terms how field check the 
generator and regulator? What equipment would I need? What are the procedures?

I would also like to thank everyone that helped get my bus back on the 
road. Matt and Dan Soiney, Pat Hoffman and Everywhere Ed. You guys are 
great! I think almost every one of the DBG group had their fingers inside 
my engine compartment at one point or another. You guys are all great! Hope 
everyone had a safe ride home. I would also like to thank Bill and Kathryn 
Bowman for putting on such a wonderful event!
