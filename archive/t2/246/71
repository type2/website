they make fuel line clamps yes, I'm not sure I would go to a much larger
fuel line because the pump has to move more fuel to presurize the larger
line, probably not a problem but it will be moving more fuel around and
around the loop.  

as long as the clamps don't damage the hose and don't leak they should
work however that being said I would make sure they are actually fuel
injection hoses.   

As probably everyone on this list and myself included would say, change
all the fuel lines anyway...fuel line is cheap insurance and more buses
have been lost to leaky fuel line fires than anything else.
