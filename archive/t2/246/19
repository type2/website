My non-flapped Type IV engine had oil temps, oil pressure, cylinder head 
temp gauges.

It did not run hot but the temps did go up and down based on engine speed 
and ambient temps and the load on the engine, etc.

I can't help but worry about all of that. Or course the 911 engines did not 
come with flaps. Would be nice to know for sure.
