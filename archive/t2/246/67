More important than flaps is the bottom cooling tin that assures an even
flow of air over the cylinders.

Having flaps brings the engine to full operating temperature sooner. This is
useful when the bus is used for short trips, say 20 minutes or less, but if
you are using your bus for longer trips.it probably doesn't make much
difference.

Also, the absence of flaps should have very little if any effect on the
bus's cabin heating system as this is controlled by air passing through heat
exchangers and drawing heat from hot exhaust pipes, not the temperature of
the engine.

In warm weather I feel perfectly comfortable not having flaps. In cold
weather I let the engine warm up for several minutes before driving.

All that having been said I still plan on installing them next time I have
the engine out. But if you don't have them yet don't panic. But do make sure
you have the bottom tin.
