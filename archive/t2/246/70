Now you are comparing apples and oranges. Your 1st question asked: " What kind
of highway mileage might one expect to get from a 2L FI engine pushing a
full-dress Westy with pop-top tent?"

You cannot compare this to a '71 T2 "transporter" with no extra equipment.

I don't have a sales brochure for the 71, but I have earlier ones:
The 1968 bus has a vehicle weight of 2723 lbs.
The 1969 bus has a vehicle weight of 2723 lbs.
[this was curb weight, shipping weight was 2634]
The 1970 bus has a vehicle weight of 2811 lbs.
My 77 deluxe Westy curb weight is 3820 lbs. Add my weight and it is 4000 lbs!
[curb weight is the weight of the vehicle in the ready-to-drive state] And
that is not adding for additions like a tent, food, water, other passengers
etc.
That 1000-1200 additional lbs. makes a BIG difference.

Your question should ask "What mileage does a person get with a 76-79 deluxe
Westy being pushed by a 1600?"
