Yes I am a Board member of NADA

According to NADA a "LOW" condition vehicle is an ORIGINAL Vehicle requiring
just
minor reconditioning--or an older restoration--"Low" according to NADA is
Not a beater--I am still working on the 1967 VW and earlier values--Have Not
gotten to the 1968 and newer--Also I am NOT the only person upgrading VW
Values--I will take what ever "Heat" there is out there.--When an update is
due, NADA send me a form--So just keep letting me know--Remember we Must
have a way to protect our older VWS!!
NADA Is a legitimate source--Also in many cases you will not get your 100%
investment back  Keep ALL receipts--take photos--keep 100% records--and it
will help in court--Keep on Truckin-, uj
