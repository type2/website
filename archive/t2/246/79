I bought a Beetle MC in 1995 from Advance Auto only to have it fail a year 
later when I took the car off the road. Was in storage for a few months and 
failed.

I would buy one from NAPA or other store where the pros shop. I would not 
buy one from Advance (worked there for 6 months of evenings) Auto.

That said - buying from the vendors ensures their survival and we need them 
for window rubber and other weird VW stuff.

I understand though that you need it now and for those times I shop local too.
