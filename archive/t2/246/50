Subject: 10% Brakes

A word to the wise,

If your brake warning light comes on take care. It means that one of the two 
hydraulic brake circuits has lost pressure. Most of us know that.

What I didn't know was that loss of one circuit meant that the remaining 
circuit might not be fully functional.

Bentley claims that the VW dual circuit "is so designed that leaks in one 
circuit cannot affect the other.". Another vendor, Datsun, only claims that 
if one circuit fails, "braking action will still be available on two 
wheels". VW and Datsun use a similar master cylinder design.

While trouble shooting a problem on a Datsun dual circuit system I found 
that:

1. With failure in one circuit the pressure in the other "good" circuit fell 
to 10% of its measured maximum pressure. (300 psi vs 3200 psi).

2. Fluid from the good circuit was leaking past a seal in the master 
cylinder into the failed circuit. This means that after X number of pumps 
the good circuit would go dry and I would have zero pressure in both 
circuits.

3. This was a rebuilt master cylinder I had just installed.

4. The vendor(A1 Cardone) support technician claims this is normal.

5. This master cylinder works fine under normal (no system leaks) 
conditions.
