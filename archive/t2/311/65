Subject: FS: AC adapter bracket 

[...]

For anyone that may have been interested in the Bus Depot's
AC Compressor adaptor, I bought one for Pokey but wonbt be 
needing it now that I bought a Syncro. I will actually be
returning the bracket to Ron but will be hit with a restocking
fee and shipping to do so. Rather than doing so I would rather
see a listee get a bdiscountb equal to the hit Ibll take.

The adaptor unit is $70- US INCLUDING basic shipping (this 
thing is heavy) within the continental US and Canada. Take a 
look at this thread if you need some more info on the bracket:

Thanks,
Chris

I posed this question to the manufacturer, and was told that 
the thinner belt will work with the Sanden pulley.

The mount is basically a "cradle" that bolts onto the
existing compressor mount, and modifies it to accept the 
cylindrical shaped Sanden compressor instead of the square 
York one, using the stock mounting location and pulley.

My adapter kit is designed to use a Sanden SD508 (found on 
Vanagons thru 1985, as well as on many VW cars), not the 709 
used in the '87 Vanagon. Not that a 709 couldn't be used, but 
I don't know if anyone's tried it.  It is a bit larger (as I 
recall) and somewhat less common than the rather generic
SD508 that the kit was designed for.

Basically this kit consists of brackets and hose adapters 
that are specifically designed for mounting a modern rotary 
style A/C compressor (SD508) to a type 4 ('73  thru '83 
Bus/Vanagon) engine.  This compressor is more efficient than 
the original York compressor, so it puts less of a strain on 
the engine.  Since the A/C in aircooled Busses and Vanagons 
was dealer-installed, no two were exactly the same.

Therefore, even though the major parts are included, some 
fabrication will almost certainly be required, and exactly 
what you have to do may vary from one van to the next.
You may find that your existing hoses do not have push-on 
style connectors, which means you may have to have a garage 
install push-on connectors onto your existing hoses (or run 
new ones). You may find that you need to add an extension for 
a hose or reroute it slightly. You will certainly have to
modify the engine tin slightly to make a good seal around the 
new compressor, since it is a different shape.

As another alternative, I do sell original replacement York 
compressors - so if all you need is a working compressor, you 
can just pop one of these in without much hassle (but with no 
improvement over the original design).
