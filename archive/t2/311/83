Subject: How much noise should the clutch throwout make?

And now my van sits on the side of the road. It went very quickly from
shifting fine when I pushed in the clutch to not even disengaging the engine
from the transmission in about 4 pushes of the clutch pedal.

This is a 1983 aircooled vanagon.  I'll tell you that I had a leaking clutch
master cylinder about a month ago. It still shifted but leaked fluid onto the
floorboard so I replaced it with a new one from Bus Depot. I have driven it on
an off this past month, probably only 150 miles but all city driving with lots
of clutch pedal movement.

I bled and re-bled the clutch slave cylinder. I have checked the level of the
reservoir. When I installed the new master cylinder I did not change the
adjustment on the plunger because I didn't think I needed to. Is this one
thought the root of all the current evil in the Bell Housing?

I can give you one more hint.  I sat there and open/closed the slave bleeder
bolt whilst someone else moved the pedal during the bleedings. I noticed that
I could hear the throwout moving and springs stretching with every pump. Could
I have some new problems with the clutch plate (ie. broken springs or
fingers)?

Any help on this would be appreciated.

In Idaho where it is going to start snowing by nightfall so I better get this
vehicle off the road or the plows will have their way with it.
