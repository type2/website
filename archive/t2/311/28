Motorworks is operating under Bankruptcy protection, and has downsized
significantly.  At one time they had nearly 200 employees, but I've heard
it's down to a couple of dozen now. Similarly, their catalog distribution
has been downsized (which is a smart cost-saving move in my opinion, as it
always seemed to me that a new catalog every month or two was a bit
unnecessary). But as far as I know they do still have them. They send them
via bulk mail, though, not first class as we do, so perhaps yours is just
slow in arriving.
