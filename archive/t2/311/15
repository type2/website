Subject: Highest miles on an upright engine?

I've been wondering of a 100,000 mile upright
engine is realistic in a bus(and cost effective
even if it is achievable).  What kind of miles
you guys have gotten out of an upright bus
engine?  If it's nonstock, please let me know the
mods.  

Thanks,
Ray
