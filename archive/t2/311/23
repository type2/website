Subject: '72 Dual Carb Install

I won a set of "recently rebuilt" (we'll see about that) original Solex
carbs for my '72 this past week on Ebay to install in place of my worn out
Brazillian Webers (which I can no longer get parts for).  Assuming that the
carbs are complete and ready to go, do I need any gaskets or RTV to mount
these to my engine, or is it just a "turn a couple of nuts" type of install?
The carbs were recently removed from a running 1700CC type IV and come with
manifolds and the original linkage.  I am putting together a Bus Depot
order, so I want to be sure to get all the parts I need all at once.
Also, does anyone have a good picture of these carbs installed on their
engine showing the linkage setup, or know where I can find one on the net,
or even better, scans of a Solex manual?  I am also converting back to the
OEM style aircleaner setup to get away from the ill fitting paper cleaners
that are on my carbs now, so I may need some hints about setting this up in
the near future as well.
