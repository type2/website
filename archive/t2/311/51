Sure we are Brother Nemo---
And that's why I am interested in learning how undercoating causes rust.

This new phenomena is totally the opposite of what I have ever
experienced.

This throws GM Bulley's, Zebarts, Rusty Jones, Waxoyl's, creosotes, zinc
chromates, gear oil, roofing tar,Kool Patch, or any other rust
preventitive process out the window ---

I'm a sponge---I want to absorb some more---

I'm all ears---:>)

Later,
