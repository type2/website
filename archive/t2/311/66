Alex,

Sounds like you have covered just about everything there is.

My 78 with 132k miles is in much worse condition and  runs about 
15.  It will also run 75-80mph on the interstate with no problem!

I know it is nasty in Nashville right now, but I think you should
*drive* it for at least 30 minutes before testing again...hi idle is just 
not the same.

2nd suggestion....and the one that always occurs to me when everything 
else looks good...

Is you gauge *really* right????????

Maybe someone else on the list knows how to test/calibrate the silly
things....

Cheers, dave
