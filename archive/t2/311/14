	Hi George,
	Gojo is playing both sides of the street... the container
I have is labeled "Gojo Natural Petroleum Free Citrus Formula"

Its ingredients list starts, "Water, D-Limonene, Linear Alcohol, Alkoxylate,
Aloe Extract,..." 

no "Petroleum" but plenty of stuff besides rain water.

	Conclusion: read the fine print. I stand by my recomendation
of this version as both a good degreaser and fair to rinse off over
your lawn. Parafin and mineral oil I would not rinse over the lawn.

	Happy motoring!
	Bill
