Subject: Patch material softening

Chris,

	I think hanging a heat lamp over this material would soften an area
which you could then press down, and it would conform to the shape of
the panel and stick.  Then move the heat source to the next area and
repeat.  I have been able to heat the plastic fuel tank on a syncro
enough to reshape it this way.  You do have to be patient, and it works
faster and over a larger area if the room temperature is 70 than if it's
20.

	You can get heat lamps and fixtures at the lumber yard or farm supply
stores.  They sometimes come with a red glass filter.  These are less
bright to work around, and heat just as well, but cost a little more.
