	Yep. If you've got half a cup of gungy oil on the outside
of your engine and you clean it off, you've just dumped the half
cup of oil whereever the rinse water went. Ick. If the outside of
your engine and tranny ISN'T more or less dry and more or less clean
then something is wrong. 

	My oil-drail-plate-torqueing technique isn't what it could be, I
often get seeping on all six studs. :( Yes I change the copper crush
gaskets, yes, I put one paper gasket on the top of the screen flange
and the other on the bottom. Maybe a click-type torque wrench instead
of the Sears cheepie with the indicator bar would help. Maybe 'about
that much' with a combo wrench would be better... but I haven't got
the nerve for that.

	But other than that, my engine and tranny are tight and dry on the outside.

	Bill
