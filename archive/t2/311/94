There is a new kit on the market which has been mentioned on the list
before. It is made/marketed by empi and is a dual kadron kit designed for
type IV motors. I think the carbs are made by brosol/solex? Not sure about
that. It is sold by CIP among others.

At any rate, the empi kit is made for the type IV motor, the jetting should
be correct, and I have heard one very good report on an installation on an
aircooled vanagon. This was done by John of John's Bug Shop up here in the
great white, and he feels the kit is very well done, gives good performance,
mileage and drivability. I believe it solves two of usual problems with
putting duals on a late bus - lack of a cold start device, and no provision
for power brakes -  by employing electric chokes on both carbs, and a vacuum
port for the power brake booster. There is no icing issue because the
intakes are short. Plus it is a purpose-built kit, which is better than
having to assemble the bits and bobs from various sources.

I prefer fuel injection myself, but dual carbs can work pretty well, too.
