Subject: Re: [T2] Engine vacuum readings

Thanks for all your suggestions

Yes I have changed the injector seals and the injectors are lined up
square in the manifold holes. 

I did think my gauge might be incorrect and attempted to rent one
from the local auto store, but they do not rent gauges any more :(
The only idea I have to test my gauge I have is to buy one of those 
hand held vacuum pump testers.  So I guess that leaves me with the 
option of buying another gauge and see what reading I get.

Richard you mentioned the vacuum reading when up when you did your 
valve adjustment.  How are you adjusting them 1, 1.5 or 2 turns 
past contact?

Also this article at Boston Bob's web site on adjusting Hydraulic 
Lifters to correct low vacuum problems is interesting...
I might try his suggestions and see what the results are.
