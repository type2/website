Subject: Re: [T2] My Heat Exchangers Have Tailpipes?

Yep, those heat exchanger tailpipes are exactly that. My ' 78 has 'em too. 
Came from the factory that way. Vents the hot air from the exchangers to the 
rear of the bus, instead of under the bus. Late mod's did not have 'em. Guess 
they didn't make much of a diff in eng. temp. The exhaust pipes also make 
getting to the valve covers a real joy.
