Subject: My clutch is growling!  RRRRRR.....

Hello listees, here is today's problem.  A couple of days ago while 
depressing the clutch pedal I started to get a growling noise which 
stops when I  let up on the pedal.  I have no trouble shifting and it 
does not pop out of gear.  It only makes the noise in first and reverse. 
 I have an appointment to have this checked on Tuesday, will it hurt to 
drive it gingerly to work till then?  I searched the archives for this 
type of problem and found a few queries on this type of thing but not 
much.  Any thoughts?  Thanks, Beth in NJ and the 78 Bus
