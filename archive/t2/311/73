     What do you think the chances are of the Activated Carbon material they 
sell at pet supply stores for fish tank filters working well as a 
replacement for the carbon in these canisters?  I know you can get it in 
different sized pellets and such, and activated carbon is all the same, 
right?  What do you use to refil these?
