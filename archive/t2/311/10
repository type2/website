Subject: Cylinder stud loos

Hello Volks

Since my engine had an oil leak, after toke it out and found that the leak
came from the crank shaft main seal, I decided to replace all the seals I
could. When I was taking the heads out, one of the cylinder #3 stud loosed
from the crank case.
May I just tight it back ?
May I have to take it to the machine shop ?
I also found a little carbon build in the heads and the piston top; May I use
a drill with a bronze brush to clean it up.

As usual any help will be highly appreciate, and thanks in advance.
