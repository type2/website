Subject: Headlights went out?

Took a ride tonight in my Westy and the headlights started flicking a little
then they went out. Parking lights are working, turn signals are working,
rear and side lights are working. Flipped the switch on and off a few times
they came on one of the those times, started to head back home then they
went out again. Got home, came in to send this email. Help...Any ideas where
to start?

71 Westy with halogens head lights. 

Dirty switch?
Bad switch? 
Don't think it's a fuse.....
