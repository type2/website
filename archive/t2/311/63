Chris,

I can't imagine if you did the floors and up the side panels a foot or
so--how any condensation--water could possibly get behind it from the
outside panels.

It may be able to leak up from the floor seams, but I doubt it--

If you were to do the inside ans well as the bottom of the Bus-it would
be like sealing it in a baggy---and I don't think in your lifetime any
water could possibly get past this stuff---

If you ever run ito a pickup with the bed liner in it--try and dig your
thumbnail into it---or try digging at it with a screwdriver--

It's pretty tough stuff.
