Chris--

Be calm here --I wasn't working you over---I just wanted to know how you
came upon this knowledge--

The best that you could do to prep an older vehicle on the bottom
anyway--is run it up on some ramps--and hot water pressure wash all the
garbage off the bottom---let it dry good--and if a person was real
energetic--wipe it all down with some fast drying enamel reducer--

Now there is also another product I use to paint old semi dump
trailers---
Flash Bond.

I blow a coat of this onto a clean as possible trailer dump body--and
paint away--\It causes the paint to stick without falling off without
sanding--
It works real well--

This could be done to the bottom, or the inside panels prior to
undercoating---

Waxoyl is good stuff--but not cheap---

I know a few gentlemen who had there recently new pickup trucks done in
Rhino Hyde bed liner---the inside of the bed--as well as the complete
bottoms---
And it's guaranteed not to fall off.

The Morton urethane spray on bed liner I used on my 85 GL 4 years ago
hasen't fallen off chipped or flaked--it's still there.

And I did the inside's of the doors and panels with the stuff---it just
will not come off --even with a pressure washer--

I do know if you get the stuff on your hands--it's there for at least a
good month.

The reason the bugley rotted out in specific places, may not be the
fault of the undercoating--if the moisture may have come from the
reverse side of the panel, where there wasn't any protection, and rusted
out backwards--

This is my thoughts on on this---


Later,
