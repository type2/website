First question should be is how old are the batteries and how much use on 
them.  Figure new sets of batteries every 2-3 years if its used heavily. 
(daily driver).

Professional or garage conversion?

Closeup photos of all the connections, wiring.

Mechanical integrity of the battery mounting assembly.  In a panic stop are 
you going to find half the battery tray sitting in the passenger seat?

If I think of more, I'll fire them off.  Talk with Harry Hauck after BBB 
and he should be able to add some more for you.

In the mean time, check out this one.
