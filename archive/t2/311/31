Chris--

Please elaborate on one point you made--

" Undercoating Traps Moisture"

So the Wax undercoating on my perfect 74 has trapped moiture nad caused
it to rust away to nothing, even though the underside and the floors are
as new--
Same with my 325 BMW, and one of my Vanagons--the other I did with
urethane bed liner myself--and no rust yet after 4 years.
 
I want to hear more on this bonkers theory--
