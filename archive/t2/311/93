Subject: Engine supplier (Use & rebuilt)?

Hi volks,

In case of a total breakdown (blown engine core)!!! I'm looking to have 
a list (Address, phone, website) of engine (Rebuilt or use) supplier and 
used parts dealer along the east coast, southern and southwest part of 
the USA. (Another solution will be to buy a complete working bus! Take 
the engine! And scrap the rest of the bus.)

Place like Boston Bob engine, www.importmotor.com, Bus depot...
My rebuilt 1.7L is not finish and I won't have time to do so before the 
first of February.

I'm looking for a 1.7 or 1.8L as I won't have the carbs and other 
missing parts for a 2.0L conversion. I hope I don't have to do so, 
but!!!! Just in case!

I have a $2000 USD budget for that matter!

Am very anxious... and nervous! I've worked a lot on this bus, 
especially around the engine but not internally!!! So it's a mid life 
1.7L and I only did 1500miles so far on it since I got this one in 
September. So by the time I reach Florida, GA or Louisiana I should have 
a good idea of how this one is really working.

A special thanks to you guys and this great list for all the good advice 
and help you gave me so far! No need to name anyone!

If you have any info on good local engine supplier, use part dealer, 
please e-mail me the info on those one

Best regards, Ben

enough time!!! That all I could get!!!)
