Have you watched the movie "Apollo 13"?   Watch it and see where the 'step by

 I am working on a documentary film titled "The Original Idiot" about John
 Muir's book: How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive, A Manual of Step by Step
 Procedures for the Compleat Idiot.  The film has been in production for a
 year now, and I plan to wrap it up by September 2003.
