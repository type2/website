Subject: About Rustproofing's!

Well, am in the worst state/province in North America (Quebec) in 
regards of winter salty road, instead of using sand or compressed rock 
like so many other provinces to give traction under icy condition, we 
still use salt (even salt won't react under10F) to melt this one, and we 
use a lot of this shi*. When I say a lot, it's a lot!!!! We (in the 
family) have a 1989 Honda (and they rust easily) still in perfect 
condition with original paint, it as been use every winter since 89! 
Maybe you will say that 1989 is not old, but in the country of salty 
road and snowstorm, it's very old!!! Especially with the original paint!!!
This car as been treated EACH year ($100) with a product call DURA TECH, 
it's a chemically engineer oil (see the site below) that consist of 2 
parts, one for under the car (undercoat) and one for inside the body 
structure, they drilled hole everywhere and shoot the product under 
pressure. BUT, It's a mess in springtime, cleaning the car can take half 
a day at least!!!

Here area a few link (in English) if you want to read about it:

And the very famous rust-protection paint POR-15, that every westy (and 
other) owner I know use when rebuilding a Bus:

About the undercoating subject!
Before I bought my 73, I saw 18 bus from the northern east coast 
(USA/Canada), mine was the only one that had the black thick undercoat, 
and the only one with NO undercarriage / frame rust, at all!!! All 
others had medium to severe frame rust problem, including rusted 
cross-member, doghouse, axle beam and so on. Many didnt have the rear 
cross member and most of them didnt have any of the 4 Jack point 
left!!! Before I bought this bus I scraped some of the black undercoat 
in many places to see if the metal was still there, it was shinny like 
new! I also still have the original heater tube that goes from the back 
to the front! So I truly believe that a well-applied undercoat (not on 
rust of course) is a very good investment!
