Search icing.  That will give you almost all the
carb threads because it always comes up in the
discussion.  

Summary:

FI:  highest component costs, highest labor cost
to maintain, highest gas mileage and best
driveability.  But I see many, many "Won't start
mechanic doesn't know why" threads.  But rather
than spending hundreds of hours on putting a new
induction on your bus, you should consider
putting many hours to learning how your fuel
injection works and how to maintain it yourself. 
Not an option for most vehicles, but this list
makes it possible.  Start with Muir FI section.  

Factory duals:  most if not all are shot and
parts are almost impossible to find for the areas
of greatest concern (throttle shaft etc.)  If you
find a set,  still troublesome to balance, usual
carb issues with regard to changing temps and
humidity.  Relatively worse MPG vis a vis FI.  

Aftermarket duals:  someone who knows carbs
(tried to find one lately?) must rejet for you. 
Difficult to maintain and balance.  Usual carb
issues and worse MPG/driveability.

Single progressive:  isn't jetted anywhere close
to what any VW needs.  Most run very very rich. 
Bad dizzies (009 or purely mechanical aftermarket
050) will make it worse.  Lotsa tuning/jetting
necessary.  No preheater and no warming tubes on
the intake so many icing problems in anything
except arid conditions.  (It's the humidity, not
the temp, that causes icing.)

Happy hunting,
