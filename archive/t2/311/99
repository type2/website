Subject: Sad, sad day for Lurch   :-(

Hello everybody

Haven't posted in a while.

Lurch died this morning.

It was 9 degrees out and I was going to run an errand.  Lurch started OK, but 
after about five seconds, it quit suddenly.  After that, it would just barely 
crank.  Hmmm....

Hooked up the battery charger to warm up the battery and give it a full 
charge and then went in my other car to do the morning chores.

Came back and it would just barely crank.  I put a heat source under the 
engine to warmitup (500W halogen work light).  Aftet an hour or so of that I 
tried to start it - it would just barely crank.  Got out the socket wrench 
and tried to turn it over by hand using the generator pulley.  [that sinking 
feeling - sympathetic nervous system discharge - SLUD (salivate, lacrimate, 
urinate, defecate)]  

Not a freewheeling puppy any more.

I fear that something dire has happened to the internals - 
crankshaft/camshaft/bearings.  It appears that a complete teardown is 
inevitable.  The Dead o' Winter Campout is not in my future.  Having spent th
ousands of dollars on a new computer for my wife for Christmas, my bankroll 
is in no shape to spring for another engine.  

I have a spare block with a holed piston in the garage that I could perhaps 
rebuild - it's got the big fat studs (the guy that did my last rebuild 12,000 
miles ago didn't like the looks of it and opted for the case with the skinny 
studs).   The rebuild never ran just right.  It had lousy MPG (11-14), and 
idled poorly/noisily (stuck valve?)

Oh, well.  I've vented enough.  

Advice?  Sympathy?
