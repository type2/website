Subject: FI to carburetor conversion 

I have owned a 1977 bus since it was new, and have periodically had lots of
problems with the AFM (I'm on my fourth).  There is so much information on
this site regarding the problems people have with the AFM and FI in general,
I'm considering converting the engine to carburetion. I've searched the
archives, mail list and libraries for information on such conversions and am
surprised I have found nothing.  Perhaps I'm searching for the wrong words.
Can anyone tell me where to look?  Anyone with experience doing this care to
comment?  Thanks.   Clay Patrick
