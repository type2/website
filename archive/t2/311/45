Subject: Cylinder head studs source, type IV 2.0 L 

Anyone know of a source for type IV cylinder studs? VW part numbers 025
101 143 (longer 222 mm stud) and 025  101 143B (shorter 172 mm stud).

Had to remove mine to have the case shipped for machining. They are not
exactly straight and I would like to get some replacements if possible.
No luck with the online catalogs for Bus Depot, CIP and Bus Boys.
