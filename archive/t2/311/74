The lambda loop(79 CA)can maintain a desired air/fuel ratio in spite of 
small air leaks but a small leak at one of the injectors would cause that 
particular cylinder to run leaner than the others. Some leaks are more equal 
than others.

I don't see how the lambda loop would have any impact on idle vacuum.

T4 engines running lean air/fuel ratios are like people on speed. They grind 
their teeth and feel good and then they crash.

Spend $25 and have your idle, pre cat converter, CO checked after major 
engine work. Better still invest in a CO tester ($150) and keep track of CO 
as a regular maintenance test along with the vacuum readings.

Good luck.

Chuck
