Subject: single cab metal panel search

I'm having a hard time finding a maker/vendor of metal replacement
panels for my 1971 single cab.  Please make suggestions.  I'm also
looking for a few other parts for the s/c.  Note that I live in Canada
and don't like spending too much American money or travelling too far to

get the stuff.  Thanks so much.
