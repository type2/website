Subject: 2L junk FS

I'm still tripping over a 2L engine from an 81. Have the case, cam, crank, 
rods. Still assembled. Also have the heads if anyone wants them for the 
price of shipping (some cracks) and a mostly complete fuel injection and 
induction system.

Most of the FI stuff works all the way back to at least 77.

I need to yank out the halfshafts as well, if a person is looking for 
cheap spares, and some dash parts.


I realize I said my last for sale post was my last, but this time, I 
really mean it *grin*  Being out of work is starting to cut into my parts 
stashs.....
