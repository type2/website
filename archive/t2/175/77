Subject: T4 engine first time pull, need advice

Hello everyone,

I need to pull the engine in my 78 Automatic 7
passenger bus.  I have never done it on a bus before. 
I need some advice.

It has ac, do I need to pull the compressor off? 
Remove the coil, what about the engine tin?  Just take
the FI stuff off and a few wires, right?  What about
the exhaust?  Moustache bar? How ro get that out. 
Take the air cleaner and AFM off first?  

The reason I need to do this is for many reasons.  I
have a ticking passenger side head (I hope it is only
the head)  All the pushrod tubes leak.  The front seal
leaks and the gas tank is real rusty.  So I might as
well pull the whole thing and fix the rust in the
tank, put a new sender in, and fix all these gaskets,
replace the head and address the low power.

Anybody have any advice on what to do?  I checked the
archives but I haven't found exactly what I need.

Anybody wanna spend a weekend in Blacksburg and help
out?  Beer money and food would be offered. 
Otherwise, I go it alone.

Thanks and Kindest Regards,

Mark
