Subject: [T2] vredestien tyres

Here we go AGAIN!!   185/75R14 are the WRONG
size. The correct tire size DOES NOT have an
aspect number in the middle.

He's right.  Mea culpa.  Good max load and max
pressure but your tire is a little smaller than
stock.  Your speedo may be off some because of
this.  

Does everyone have totally selective reading
habits????

I do.  It was very late and I have ADD on a good
day.   

Thanks, Karl.
