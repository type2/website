Bingo!  The rear brakes must be adjusted snugly for a firm brake 
pedal.  Need proof?  Try this test.  With the bus rolling, pull out your 
emergency brake until the brakes grab enough to slow the bus, now let the 
ebrake go in 2-3 notches.  There should be little-to-no resistance from the 
brakes at this point.  Now step on the brake pedal.  Notice now firm it 
is?  How high the pedal is and how it doesn't sink in much at all?  That's 
because your e-brake is taking up all of the slack in the rear 
brakes.  Drive around the block a few times and test the brakes just to be 
sure it isn't a fluke.  Once you adjust your rear brakes to where there is 
no slack, the pedal will feel exactly the same without the e-brake out.

>are there other possibilities?

Yes, but they are only 1% likely whereas your rear brakes being out of 
adjustment is 99% likely.
