Regarding the recent thread on cross border car sales......US dealers are 
doing it already. Auto Spies just posted an article on a federal crackdown 
taking place to control cross-border grey market vehicle sales BY 
DEALERS.....US dealers get these cars and sell them as new American cars, 
at huge profits.  The vehicles are coming into the USA through Canada and 
Mexico. Huge price differences exist between similar models sold in the USA 
vs those in Canada, especially for the Chrysler Caravan. Ten thousand 
dollars less in Canada. Big incentive to dealers in the US to participate 
in grey market sales. They can get a Canadian Caravan for $6,500 less than 
they have to pay for it from the US distributor.
