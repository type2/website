My mistake, this is not correct info. There is no stud
supporting the oil pick-up tube, it is a bolt and it is
already removed. Had to actually go look !
You only need to make a reasonable attempt to
line up the case perimeter studs, with  some attempt
to mesh the cam and crank gears, just remove the
cam and crank bearing shells that have fallen with
a magnet, then join the case halves close enough to
remove the pistons. They will not go the final 1/4"
due to misalignment of the dowels, but this is good
enough to remove the piston pins. I can only
imagine how frustrating this can be, we have all
felt this kind of pain at one time or another.
