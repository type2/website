Subject: Re: [T2] coil question

Is the coil getting a full 12 volts?

Are the points working? Are they burned or pitted.

By the way the voltage regulator has NOTHING to do with the ignition. If 
the bus has enough juice to crank merrily over then it has enough juice to 
fire the coil sufficiently well. The regualtor isn't even doing anything 
until the engine is running over 1000 RPM.

Buy a Muir book and read the chapters on the VW that won't start.

Holler back if you are still having problems.
