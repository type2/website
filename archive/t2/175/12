Subject: brakes question: part 2

Hello Listers,
I wanted to let people know i appreciated the tip on disc brake bleeding for 
a 77 bus (wisdom gained: use the top bleeder valve). However, after 3 rounds 
of brake bleeding with the Mityvac and 2 rounds of brake bleeding with the 
old 2 person hose-in-jar method, i am still noticing that my brake pedal 
takes one "pump" to be where it should be. The bus stops fine, but i 
remember how the brakes were once-upon-a-time with only about 2 inches of 
pedal compression. the disc brake pads are new and the drum brake pads have 
less than 30k on them. the brake system does not leak a drop. and i had all 
the bubbles out of the line when bleeding....
So, what's the next step? am i needing to adjust out the rear drum pads? or, 
is the hose that goes off the top of the brake master cyl kinked? are there 
other possibilities?
Today's bus verse "oh what can it be now?"
Thanks,
Jeremy
'77 Westy
