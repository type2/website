When you say case bores I assume you are thinking along the lines of a
typical water cooled engine in which the cylinders are actually part
of the case/block. This is not the case w/ vw aircooled engines. The
case bore is large enough to accept the lower flange of the cylinders
so I know for sure that it is large enough to let a piston (which is
much smaller) through. You have to seperate the case from the
cylinders (those fin things). Take daves advice & make sure you have
the small piece of tin removed on the underside of the cyls. they
really don't like to move w/ that piece attached (as me how I know)
