Try the Original German vernacular.
This repair really depends on the value of the part and
the location of the stud, along with access to it.
Perhaps you could offer a more detailed description.
( We actually enjoy  hearing these stories :).
Otherwise, cobalt is brittle, and you might consider
fracturing it and removing it in small pieces. I would
also use the largest drill bit possible , with a flatter
tip angle, to make a larger more shallow  dish in which
to work. It will be achieved in small gains, but it will come.
I wouldn't count on drilling it out.
