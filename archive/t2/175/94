Just curious about what tricks a machinist
might use in this sitution that couldn.t be
applied by a human bean.
I've never understood the name "Easy Out "
insofar as it is one of the most difficult repairs
to remove a broken one. I would only use an
Easy Out for loose fasteners broken in shear,
they do not support the torque required to
remove a frozen stud.
