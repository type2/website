Subject: Thing wanted / VW sighting

Howdy!
I passed the Volkswagen illness on to my sister. She
and her boyfriend would like to invest in a VW Thing.
If you have one for sale or know of a place where I
can find one somewhere near the eastern part of U.S.,
please tell me.

In the '80s horror movie "The Stuff," on the
interstate is a white T1 single cab, right before the
main character meets "Chocolate Chip Charlie." Heh,
heh...                         Thanks,
                               Paul Deatherage
