Subject: Problem with idle (Please help)

Hi,

I have a problem with my engine idle "hunting".

It revs to "normal", stalls a bit and comes back again.

The rearmost right hand cylinder had it's spark plug wire cap cracked
open. It has the last "bump" where it goes on to the plug cracked off
and open. Manufacturer, bugpack. Put them in at -40C.

I also found the choke wire to be broken right off. Further
investigation found a rock in the pulley, obviously this stressed it to
it's breaking point.

I removed the pulley for the moment to get length for the choke and have
hooked it up again. It is still "hunting".

Replaced all plugs and am proceeding with tune up.

Please help if you can.

Alan
