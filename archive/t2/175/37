Question for the list...
In the back of my mind, I seem to remember someone
once telling me to use 2nd or 3rd geard when trying to
push start a vehicle.  At the time, we were pushing a
Ch*vy or a F(-at-)rd.  Is there a preferred gear for push
starting a VW?  Is there any harm in starting it in
either 1st, 2nd or 3rd?  Just curious.  Have a great
weekend.
