Pull the piston circlips and tap the wrist pins out.

You'll have to support the other side with a block of wood or put the 
piston near something that won't move like anothing upright that you clamp 
to the edge of your work bench.

You can use a 3/8" socket extension to hammer on.

Don't hammer - just tap.

Good luck.
