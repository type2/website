Subject: Ticking bus still won't start.

Ok, as you may remember I put my engine in after changing my clutch, but bus will not start.

Symptoms:

Acts like a dead battery.
When you turn the key to on the idiot lights come on dim. If I turn on the radio or CB or anything else they all get dimmer or just go out. 

The first couple times I turned the key to start it ticked (the starter I believe).
With each attempt less and less power.

What I've tried:

Cleaned Battery Terminals and starter terminal.

New battery - Same thing starts out with the tick and ends up with dim idiot lights at best.
Battery was still good.

Unplugged wires to coil.

Unplugged wire that I know not where they go.

Took out fuses one by one.

Screamed while running in circles. 
(This seemed to help a little)

Turned engine by hand to see if it was jammed.
It was not.

No results.

Could moisture somewhere be causing this?
I am out of ideas.

Thanks all
Jason

If any care to look in person I live in Pa. a little south of Pottstown or north of Downingtown.
