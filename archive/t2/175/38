Chris, Thanks for the reply.

*That* is the problem; if only I could pull the circlips and pins. As I wrote 
in my initial post, the cases are split and separated by nearly 3". This 
means that the pins are down inside the bore where they are inaccessible. 
And, the cases won't rejoin, so I just can't get to the clips and pins.

If i can't get the case halves to rotate back into alignment, I'm going to 
have to hacksaw the rods... all of them, to get the cases apart.

I've taken a break from the job and will wait until I have help tomorrow. I 
think if someone else holds the cases up on end (one set of pistons down) 
maybe I can find what is causing them to lock out of alignment. Then, if i 
can get the cases to rejoin, I can get to the pins.

Cheers/Don
