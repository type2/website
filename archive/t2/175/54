Subject: Re: [T2] Ticking bus still won't start.

I cannot remember where the main fuse box cable attaches so bear with me.

It will be either the positive battery terminal or it piggybacks the main 
starter cable.

Either would be electrically the same.

Do you have the wire in the right spot? Is the front of the bus getting a 
full 12 volts?

Is the terminal tight and clean? Can you start the vehicle with a 
screwdriver - be careful and don't get run over. Probably better to have a 
helper hold in the clutch, be sure it is in neutral, stand on the brake, 
and you lay in-line with the bus.

You should be able to connect the main starter terminal with the main 
solenoid terminal and get it to fire off.

If it won't crank I would suspect that the starter is faulty, the engine is 
locked up, or the wiring from the battery to the starter or from the 
battery to ground is faulty.

By using this test you eliminate the wiring from the battery to the 
steering column and back.

You could roll start the van and verify that the engine is free.

Did this engine swap involve fitting a new engine? I'm wondering it the 
flywheel is different size before and binding up on the starter or the bell 
housing. Also are we sure the input shaft of the tranny fit the clutch and 
bearing in the end of the crankshaft/or gland nut? Did the engine slide 
right on the tranny or did you have to force it to tighten up to the 
bellhousing with the bolts?

This dead bus project is another good troubleshooting procedure found in 
the front of John Muir's Idiot Manual.

Good luck.
