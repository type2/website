The case alignment may be easier if you can rotate
the crankshaft so that the rods are horizontal. This will
provide more room to play with the case, as they will
be at full extension. Until the crankshaft is free to rotate,
you will not be able to remove the pistons. You may
have to pull the case apart to the 3""  clearance you
got previously.You may have also dropped some lifters
into the case, and maybe some cam bearings. ( use a pencil magnet ).
Find the washer that goes on the bottom of the dizzy drive shaft.
There is also a small coiled spring that belongs in the top end of it.
