Way back in the early '60s when I was learning to drive I was told to 
put the transmission in second to do a push start. I didn't know why, 
the old timers told me to do it and they seemed to know what they 
were talking about.

A few years ago a mechanic told me that a certain gear is the "road 
gear", one generation between the engine and axle, almost like a 
direct drive. This would probably be the gear best to use for push 
starting.
