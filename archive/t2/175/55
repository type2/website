Subject: what is that noise? the other noise...

I'm hearing a rattling /knocking noise at speed,
regardless of gear once RPMs hit about 3K
my shifter starts rattling loudly....

just started  (about a month ago)
if you touch the shifter, even lightly, the noise stops

I've already pulled and greased the "innards"

any Ideas???
what steps should I take to find/resolve this??
