Subject: brake light bummer

hello folks,
the tock is clicking and we're heading for wyoming in
10 daysin the new 69 bus (new to us) i've got a few
things left on the hit list.
one is brake lights.  o.k.  so it's not the bulbs
cause running/blinker/flasher lights all work.  Muir
says to short otut the stoplight switch and if the
lights go on the switch is bad.  did that lights went
on but it's not  a bad switch i replaced it and still
no go.  here's where i'l be specific there is a wire
running from the stoplight switch toward the front of
the bus and then through the frame toward the drivers
side. it's a black wire with a yellow stripe. it has
been cut off and there is nothing to tell me where it
went. 

does annyone know where that wire should go or if it
is the culprit????  fuse box????

thanks in advance!!!

mick
