Alabama to California in a Honda Odyssey.
Smooth ride and cool air, silence and isolation.

No tooth grinding, 
no automotive hypochondria,
no impromptu stops in Tucumcari, NM,
no sunburn on left forearm,
no desert dust caked on sweaty face.

No grin on my face, no waves.
No stories to tell.

I miss my bus.
