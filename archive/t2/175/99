Subject: exhaust system rot problem

When I removed my cover tin to reveal the thermostat, I discovered my
tin around the exhaust port coming from the heads to be completely
rotted off.

I took it out, but am wondering if I should not have left the "remains"
in there as I know everything in a VW engine has a purpose.

Any suggestions?

Alan
