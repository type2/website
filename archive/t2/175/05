Hi all,

I'm a lurker on this list (from Australia), and recently 
I landed in Dallas,TX for work & I'll be staying here for the next
month or so ... so, I'm seeking some local knowledge
on what might be happening around here

- recommended bus parts shops?
- any planned meets nearby soon?
- things a bus enthusiast should go and see within a 500-mile radius of
Dallas
etc

If anyone can shed some guidance for me, I would be
mighty appreciative. Pls respond off-list as I only
get the digest version and am several days behind in
reading...

Thanks-in-advance,

Mark Wrigley
usually in Melbourne, Australia
but for June & July, Dallas Texas
