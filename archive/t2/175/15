...have you, and i could be missing something here, but...have you removed
the cylinders?  They pretty much slide right off of the pistons, away
from the side of the case.

They may require a bit of a tap with a rubber mallet, gently straight down
into the fins so as not to break them...

With the cylinders off, you should be able to get things apart.
