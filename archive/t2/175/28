They may have found the problem!

After two weeks of me trying to find it and two weeks of them working on it,
preliminary reports are that the mechanics have isolated the draw and that
it's coming from the Regulator... (again, I'm a newbie at this... that's
what I was told...  Is that possible?)  AND they found and fixed my oil
leak!  I may have my baby back today or tomorrow!  *does the happy camper
dance...*

Now I can get back to work on the other STUFF!  Hopefully I'll get all my
backorder stuff from the Busdepot soon too... lol
