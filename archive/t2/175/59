I was at Busfusion in Almonte Ont Canada, having a Great time again this year!... when I heard about a camp out next year,
I have always wanted to travel to Iles de la Madeleine near Prince Edward Island,, and I think this would be the best opportunity!!!
Some one could kindly pass this on to Vanagon lists etc,,,

 Jamie, the Quebec Westfalia Club's Madeleine Island event is now scheduled to start on Monday August 11, 2003 and wind up
on Sunday August 17.  There will be three points of departure for the Island, Montreal, Matane and Prince Edward Island.  Details
are still being resolved so stay tuned.  More information as it becomes available can be found at the International Westfalia Camping
Car Club's website, IWCCC, they do have an English version so make sure you go that direction from the beginning. http://www.westfalia.qc.ca/CIW_English.asp The ferry from
Prince Edward Island has a website at www.ctma.ca.  The ferry is able to hold 120 campers per trip.
