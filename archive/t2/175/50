If when you say pops you mean backfires through the exhaust that is due to
a blown exhaust seal somewhere in your system. If its a type IV the source
is likely to be your exhaust manifolds where they connect to the head.
Unfortunately the fix for this can often end up leading you down a slippery
slope of broken exhaust studs and having to remove the head. Check for
exhaust leaks...

Not having owned my westy for long, is the following normal?

The engine pops on overrun when coasting in first gear.
