Dave,

I'd go further... "Easy Out"s are designed specifically to separate the
new mechanic from his money.  I am certain that there is some use for
them, and maybe your loose fastener broken in shear is it, but I have
found that any fastener that will not come out with a left hand twist bit,
will not come out with an Easy Out.  Certainly, they should be requires to
state in bold lettering on the package "Not suitable for removing broken
studs" as they are certainly not. I am certain there is someone,
somewhere who has gotten a broken stud out with one of these, but it
certainly ain't me!

I learned long ago that when I break a stud, I take it to a machinist, as
Dr. Tim suggests.  If you bring your head to a machinist with a bit of
stud, unmolested, sticking out of the casting...  he will be so shocked
that he may well do the removal then and there out of pure gratitude.  If
you bring him a head with a molested stud, drilled for the broken
extractor that is snapped off deep in it, he will keep it for a week and
charge $1-200, just to teach you not to repeat the error.
