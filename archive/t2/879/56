Todd,
      I recently replaced my alternator and as part of that work had to
rebuild the harness portion that connects the VR, starter and Alternator.
As long as the plastic connector is in good shape, you can get replacement
terminals.  I got mine at a local VW shop here in Seattle and they worked
perfectly.  it was a little trouble to get the old ones out but with some
patience and a jewlers screwdriver you can get those buggers out.

Sadly I don't have the part number for the female spade connectors that you
need.  You can't use standard ones because they don't have the little
retainer clip that keeps them in the plastic plug.  I don't have a part
manufacturer or a source other than my local shop, but if you need some let
me know, I will pick some up today as I am stopping at the shop on the way
home anyways.
