  What are you doing for the fuel return? A Tee in the line near the tank? How are you mounting the airbox? 


I bought a used FI tank that I will install in the truck.  For the time being, I'm just using a gas can on the garage floor with one line coming out of it and another going in (return) (with all safety precautions of course)  When I get the engine back in the truck, I will mount the airbox one of two ways, either install the airbox bracket that came with the FI system or do as another on this list suggested: hang it from the room of the engine compartment.  greg
