I have tried to reply once, forwarded the reply a 2nd

Because the alignment needs to be precisely the same
as when it is on the hub. Lets say they get "perfect"
alignment of the rotor alone while in the lathe. Put
that rotor on your hub and it's not "perfect" anymore.
It now turns on the axis of the hub which may or may
not be the same "perfect" as the rotor alone in the
lathe.

Thus it is very important to be certain the bearing
seats are clean and the bearings seated squarely in
the bore. A bearing not totally seated will cause an
uneven turning on the lathe and will possibly seat
some miles 'down the road' - may be one, may be 10,000
- and suddenly the rotor is wobbling!

I just went through this with a brand new rotor. It
was waaaayyyy off! Brought it back with the hub and
they did it again - "near perfect!" They wanted to
just use the retainer screws but I insisted on using
lug nuts as well.

Our stuff is way overbuilt by todays standards, but on
a modern vehicle, if your lug nuts are not torqued to
spec, your brakes may squeek or grab!

Short answer = It's not a perfect world!
