Subject: Tail-light Wiring

Hey guys,

     I'm a bit confused with my tail light wiring. I purchased an original OEM wiring harness for a 1972 VW Bus. I'm trying to match it up with the diagram that's in my Bently manual. Althogh most of the colors do match up, some of them do not, and it gets rather ambiguous with respect to how the side lamps are wired. 

The harness I have is OEM, so I know it belons. But... I have a couple of questions that I was hoping you guys could answer...

1 - Brown IS used for ground, correct? And Black is the positive 12 volt?
2 - How many wires come off the harness to go to the side rear marker light. Is it JUST ONE wire? 
3 - And then is there a seperate wire that goes to the negative and then to the ground point on the body?
4 - The middle light, the one that has two circuits in it... which side is for what? One prong is a lighter color (more silver colored) and the other prong is a darker color (more copper looking). Any idea which one is which? It doesn't really explain that in the Bently manual.


FYI, this is a 1973 that's being retro-fitted with ALL new 1972 wiring.


Thanks!!!

Todd
