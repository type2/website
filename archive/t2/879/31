Dumb question-you take off the hub with the rotor, the stub stays 
behind, yes?  Where do they get a matching stub to fit the hub and spin 
it for a true grind?
Also- there is no return spring on the front disk brake pistons-what 
lets the pads pull back from the disk?

You need to have it turned ON THE HUB!

Because the alignment needs to be precisely the same
as when it is on the hub. Lets say they get "perfect"
alignment of the rotor alone while in the lathe. Put
that rotor on your hub and it's not "perfect" anymore.
It now turns on the axis of the hub which may or may
not be the same "perfect" as the rotor alone in the
lathe.
