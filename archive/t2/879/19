Subject: RE: Help!! SOLEX carb kit needed..

Hey, I haven't seen too much response, so I took  four pictures, if this
will help to identify the carb.

I am searching for a rebuild kit.  Perhaps a few SOLEX kits would be fine??
I have a few PDSIT kits plus many left over parts, if I can't find an Off
The Shelf kit.

Can you ID this carb????  Where can I get a rebuild kit???

TIA
