Chai, did you try adjusting your mixture?  That solved the  dieseling on mine.  1/4 turn CCW at a time on the mixture screw to  rich it up, then 1/4 CCW on the throttle to idle it back down.   After a few times, mine shuts off right away at any temperature.   Probably ended up being one whole turn on each one.  I was running  too lean and had the throttle open too much at idle which allowed gas  to flow for a second or so after shut off.   Might give it a  try.  Mine has never run better.  Cheers...KR

  the only problem knock on wood LOL i think is going on now is the  stuttering and not wanting to shut off like a old t model would do only  when she is shut off after runnning during the hot hours of the day....
