From Mad Uncle Dave:

Hey y'all
I work at Advance Auto parts.  We used to be able to get rebuilt CV
axles for $60 (less actually but round numbers will do).  Last week one
of my customers called and asked if we had them and I told him of
course, until I looked in our catalog and it said Nu-uh.  Does anyone
out there know of another chain that carries the almost universal manual
transmission axles for about the same price?  I'm gonna stock up.

Instead of rebuilt, EMPI makes new [all new parts] complete axles.

JCWhipme sells them but I have seen them cheaper. A few years back, EMPI in southern Calif had a open house
and I went on a tour of the plant. Pretty impressive, that was all they made.... axles for just about any
vehicle.
