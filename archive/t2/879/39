Subject: Steering wheel removal

Hi to all,
   
  I am trying to remove the cracked steering wheel on my 1970 Westy.
  I've tried spraying various lubricants including: Kroil, WD-40 etc. and tapping the 
  underside with a hammer but the wheel seems seized. Is this a common problem?
  I know VW made a special tool to remove the wheel but don't have access to one. Should I use a gear puller? Ideas and suggestions are welcome. Thanks in 
  advance for your brilliant solutions and expert advice....:)
   
  Andy
