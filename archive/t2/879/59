Greetings,

The starter doesn't click or attempt to turn over -- I get nothing.  (Of
course, when it does start, it starts right up as if nothing is wrong.)

I'll try the meter-on-the-battery, just to be sure all is well.  I've been
having a false sense of security about the battery, though, as the
headlights are "on" during each and every crank.  (O.K., O.K., headlights
being "on" doesn't necessarily imply good voltage/current available.)

Regards,
David

does the starter click or attempt to turn over or do you get nothing?

i would stick a meter on the battery first just to be sure its good.
rather sounds like the starter solenoid is either not getting enough
voltage to kick it over or is itself bad.

remember you have 35 year old wiring from the battery, to the ignition
switch, to the fuse block, back to the starter solenoid.

Could be a connection, ignition switch, battery or the starter itself.
