Subject: Ignition switch replacement

Just ordered P/N 171 905 865MY from the BD.  Assuming "MY" is for Meyle
brand.

I plan to use Brad Clausen's writeup on Ratwell.com and the new Bentley I
ordered.

One thing I didn't see is the replacement bolt size to use when you replace
the tamper-bolt.

Anyone?

Any other gotchas?
