Subject: rebuilt 2.0 oil leak

Hi, I rebuilt, with some help,  my 78  2.0 engine and installed it.  Had 
the engine and short block balanced and assembled.  I installed the 
cylinders, heads, etc.  Good news it runs absolutely great with only one 
oil leak.  The oil lead is from the flywheel/ bell housing area.    What 
are the possible leak sources?  Crank seal, and case mating areas?  any 
others? 

Thanks in advance.
