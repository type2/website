Subject: tubing to carry away exhaust gases

Can anyone recommend a product to slip over the exhaust pipe on a T2 
to carry exhaust gases out of a garage when it is necessary to work 
in an enclosed space?
At gas stations, during the winter, I see a black flexible tubing 
that does this.
Thanks, Jack
