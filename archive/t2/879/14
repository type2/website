Consider multiple causation, Mike, and don't overlook the brake pad 
stabilizing spring clip.  My 76 Westy had a front wheel that squeaked and 
rumbled and I found several things to correct. The clip that stabilizes the 
front pads was cracked (almost invisible crack) and barely functional. 
Replaced the clip and squeak stopped but the rumble  continued. I inspected 
the front wheel bearing and found it to have an eroded and pitting race, so 
I replaced that also. Now the front wheels are much quieter. Incidentally, 
I replaced the brake pad spring clip on the other side also, because it was 
cracked....but not making noise.

(relatively new), no recollection of damage to that wheel.  Goes away
upon light touch to brakes, may stay away, then come back.   If I get
this turned, is it done with all on the bus, or must rotor be taken off?
