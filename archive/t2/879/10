Subject: Help!! SOLEX carb kit needed..

I have a SOLEX carb coded  C34 TCIC / 13  090, made in Italy

Yes, I thought the first character would be a "0", but this is definately a
"C"...  And the "C" character is at least 10% larger than the "34" numbers.
And it is a different "C" than the other pair of "C"s

It is a '2 barrel' carb, with two air intake, and just one of the air
intakes has a choke.

I want to put this on a test engine to run the setup on the garage floor .
I have the runners and all, so i figured if I rebuilt the carb, I could get
a decent test setup.


THIS IS NOT for the road, and I am not concerned about 'icing'.

Thanks all.....
