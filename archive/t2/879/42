Give us a "scenario" - What is it you're planning to
do with it? Do the seats need only function for
socializing when parked or do they need to be
road-worthy safe? Is it a camper and needs a
convertible bed? What's the functionality?

I went for years without cabinets and then decided two
days before a long camping trip that I needed to build
something, even if it was wrong - as a starting point
to see what to change and make it "right." I make
signs for a living, so I cut up old "Proposed Landuse"
signs to build them. Using wood has made it a bit
heavy. I did learn what I think will work for me. I
also did studies of camper layouts in wrecking yard. 

Future holds spiffy aluminum extrusions for framing
with lightweight composite materials for paneling. The
"nice" wood articles I have in the bus require more
maintenance to keep looking good than I care to spend!
I have some photos but really they're bed-oriented. -BaH
