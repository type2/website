Subject: Re: [T2] windshield replacement...

I've replaced a couple in the past year and even new they are tight. I've  
used 2 different types of rubber. Both were tight but one had a wider outside  
lip and covered the windshield frame very nice and the other seemed to barely  
fit the bottom edges. What breaks the glass is hitting the rubber to seat the  
windshield. Good luck.
