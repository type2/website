Subject: I Should Have Posted This...

   ...about a month ago.

   I am negligent in not sharing this with the group after putting you all 
through the drama last September. Our beloved '69 Westy "Patience" is back 
in our possetion and running after breaking down on the first third of a 
cross-country move from Oregon to North Carolina.

   The rough story and pix are here:

   As always, endless thanks to Troy and Leah who not only towed my bus 
across Colorado and put me up in their home for a week, but then towed our 
poor, broken bus another 2000 miles to get it back to us. Huge thanks to Don 
also for great sacrifice of time, energy, and a very nice muffler!

   You all rock!
