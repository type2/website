I just this weekend converted my 74 single cab from dual PDSIT's to Fuel Injection, bought an entire FI system from Jake Raby.  It was easy to tap the head to accept the temp sensor.  I used the small screw hole where the sensor would normally go.   I believe it required a 9mm drill and the tap was 10mm by 1.0 pitch.   
  Engine has never run as smooth as it does now.  Plus it's sitting on the garage floor.  That's always fun to be able to crank one up on the floor and tinker with it to get it just right before final installation.  Greg
