Subject: Brakes Broke

Hi All: I bought my first bus last fall, and it has been sitting in my side 
yard waiting for me to get to it. Well Today I started her up to drive into 
the garage to start work on it.  Was a yard driver last fall. The brakes 
need to be redone (pedal to the floor)  Parking brake was working.

Well I stupidly left it for the winter with the parking brake on and they 
are STUCK  SOLIDID now.

I attempted to pull the rear drums, this is where I have run into trouble. I

pulled the wheel, removed the castle nut and tried to pull the drum, won't 
go! Tried heat, vibration everything it won't move. As I said this is my 
first Bus am I missing somthing? Is somthing else holding the drum???

Thanks
John
