Andy,

Our early bay have a different shaft and wheel than the later bays, and as
you've found our ours are hard to get off.
Do you have access to an electric heat gun?  What I've done is to heat up
the steering wheel hub until it's very hot, using an electric heat gun, and
then use a puller to get it loose.  It's worked for me and I hope it helps
you.
