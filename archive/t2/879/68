Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition switch replacement

One thing that happened after I wrote that article was that the switch I 
bought and installed from BD became very intermittent.  I had to do it all 
over again a month later, but this time I installed a used original VW 
switch.

It's been working fine for many years now.

Scoot Lyons indicated the bolt size:

Tamper screw is m8 x 1.25. An allen hex screw is a good replacement.
