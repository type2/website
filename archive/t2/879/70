Subject: Re: [T2] tubing to carry away exhaust gases

Home Depot had 3" aluminum flex pipe (stretches like an accordian) for 
thru-wall gas heater duct- I used this around the tailpipe (easy to 
reduce) and created a hole in the garage door that lets the pipe exhaust 
outside; at least 3' is outside.  I crack a rear window to make up for 
the lost air.
