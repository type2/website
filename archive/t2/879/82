Subject: Hi I'm new here

I'm in Santa Monica,Ca. and would love to find a decent VW mechanic  
in SANTA MONICA AND A PLACE TO FIND GOOD USED VW Bus parts, via a  
local mechanic or a parts place here.
If anyone knows anything that would be helpful,please let me know.  
Westside VW is NOT a place I want to go. I feel there mUST be someone  
else near by in Santa Monica. Thank type 2. Judi
