Subject: Steering wheel / ignition lock

Hey guys,

     I received my new ignition wiring from Bus Boys and I'm really happy with it. I realized though, that my ignition key is almost ready to break (only have one). I am going to order a new lock cyl, and it raised a couple of questions. I have to remove my steering wheel to get that component out that says "Goverdomma, sliding door... etc..." or something in German. It's also the component that holds the ignition lock and the wiring. 

I'd like to take it off so I can paint it and replace everything with more ease. Do you guys know where I can get a NEW sticker, and also... my horn button / steering wheel cap is cracked... do I have other options other than the standard black one? Can I put the Wolfsburg steering wheel cap on there?


Thanks!!!

Todd
