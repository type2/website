Living in the PACNW is a dream.   I see at least 1 or 2 vanagons and a few
bays every day with a eurovan or splitty thown in for variety now and then.
Plenty of bugs too.   I gotta say the temparate climate, lack of salted
roads and community up here in seattle make for a very positive airhead
vibe.
