They use what is basically two cone-shapes. Visualize
a shaft sticking out toward you. On the shaft is a
cone, small end toward you. Slide the hub (minus the
bearing races) onto the shaft and as far as will go
onto the cone. Take another cone, small end away from
you, and slide it onto the shaft as far as will go
into the hub. Put appropriate spacers and a big nut on
the shaft to tighten the cones toward each other and
hold the hub/rotor assembly tight.

Basic idea on the pads is that they are always in
light contact. Reality? Perhaps a very slight gap. The
only springs are to hold the pads snugly against the
pistons. I don't think they exert enough pressure to
act as return springs - just slack keepers. -BaH
