Subject: Pressure Relief Valve 74 Westy

I went to do my first oil change on my 74 Westy and accidently loosened 
the pressure relief valve by mistake.  When I went to tighten it up it 
kept spinning.   I have also attempted to pull it out, and it in 
similar fashion just spins continuously.  
 
What I have learned is that the valve is designed to bleed pressure 
from the oil system, and the valve stays closed until the pressure in the 
gallery above it overcomes the spring pressure holding the piston in 
the seat.  If the seat and piston are not smooth, pressure will bleed 
past the valve continueously, similar to a leaking cylinder head. 
(correct?)
 
This said, I need to go about fixing and/or replacing the valve.  I am 
not sure of the consequences that will occur if I add oil (which I have 
not done yet) but am guessing there will be a leak.  
 
I have also noticed that people have replaced the relief vavle with a 
tempature sender.  If valve serves a important purpose, how can it be 
replaced?
