Subject: Grease'l

Tony in NJ raises some good points.

We have a few friends down here in the Lowcountry who run their busses 
on grease'l instead of diesel.

Notably, our infamous FMBC founder Snoopy who stockpiled used oil from 
KFC to Hunan Gardens, and everywhere in between to run one of his 
busses.

I know he was having some further work done on one of his diesels to 
get it to run better...and I think he's smart to take this line.

I think the funniest part is the exhaust smell, of course. Everyone 
behind one of the busses suffers from a Pavlovian response and all of a 
sudden desires French Fries...beats the smell of petroleum based 
products, of course.

Should be interesting when Snoopy gets back to see how much progress 
his mechanic has had with the bus.
