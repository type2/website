Unfortunately, that article was a puff piece for the modification company.
The only way that they came up with the 250MPG figure is to ignore the
electric power used.  They could have driven the vehicle for
shorter trips and advertised infinite mileage!  The article also quoted
the cost of the electricity as about 25 cents, but some simple
calculations shows that, at best, this much electricity is good
for only a few minutes of crusing speed.

One fair way of evaluating this sort of data is in terms of miles per
dollar.  You have to factor in energy costs, maintainance costs, and
depreciation costs, not just the energy cost.  By these criteria, our
buses come out far far better than any "modern" car.

George  <-- livin' good with 20MPG!
