Subject: excessive negative camber, 1 rear wheel

I am experiencing 1 rear wheel with proper camber and
the other with too much negative camber (or
"splayed").  The one that is the problem is on the
passenger side.  I picked up the bus only a year or so
ago, and when I did, it looked to me like it could
have been hit on that side (with the camber off), near
the wheel (arch looked a little bent inward, etc). 
Hub, wheel bearing seem good; just replaced the
shocks.  The one wheel has the appearance as
busses/bugs do (and other cars similarly 'suspended')
when they are carrying a load - but that normally
involves both wheels "splayed" out - this is just the
one wheel, with no real load.  Any ideas?  I think the
only thing I'm really faced with safety/structure wise
is that the tire will likely wear prematurely on one
side - but otherwise it seems solid.  It does look
goofy though and I would certainly give fixing it a go
if I had a sense of what the issue might be.  Could it
be the torsion spring?

Thanks,
Greg ('78 Westy)
