Italy also had/has a taxable HP chart. It was based on engine size and not actual HP so the Italians have long wrung every last HP out of their tiny engines. My Fiat 500 was 500cc, my Autobianchi was 900cc, my '72 Super Beetle Beetle was 1200cc, my neighbor's Rabbit/Golf was 1000cc. My US Spec '84 Rabbit was a 1800cc and my Italian friends looked at it like we do muscle cars here. Mama Mia! It's just not that fast guys... Gas was extremely expensive at $4.75 a gallon in 1994 when I lived there, now ??? Heard $7.65 in England last week.
