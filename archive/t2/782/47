Subject: Re: [T2] Type 2 in France and Switzerland

Ironically i specifically avoided "diesel" and "gas mileage" in my
original message in an attempt to avoid drifting away from bus
content. Looks like these have to come up when we talk about european
cars.

Let me ask again : which type 2 busses came with type 4 engines in Europe ?

Side note 3)
One day -for fun- i should check how hard it would be to import a
peugeot or renault from Mexico to the US.
