Well, I think that is the proper and main concern. I agree heat is the
main cause of dropped seats, and that if monitored and well taken care
of, there is no reason for dropped valves. Some are very conservative
and consider 50,000 miles as the time to change heads, but I've also
heard a properly rebuilt head will not drop valves and can last
100,000 or more. Richard recently posted a note about the difference
between sintered and solied valve seats, so if you have sintered
seats, they can go sooner than the others.

 why, but that is how it is.
