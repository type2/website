Subject: Re: [T2] Sticking door locks

I second this, I've had to replace both of the springs on my bus, it's a 
pain getting the new little spring in place, but using the writeup in the 
archives it can be done in an hour or two. It sure makes a huge difference 
in enjoying your bus, nothing quite like spending a minute fumbling with the 
damn door locks every time then giving up and going in through the sliding 
door... http://type2.com/rvanness/lock.htm

<Keep in mind that this fix won't work for a broken spring, a common
problem with our buses.  Continuing to force the lock open will result in
a broken lock cylinder.  Personal experience here!
