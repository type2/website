Subject: Re: [T2] excessive negative camber, 1 rear wheel

FWIW my '78 also has a fender opening that sways inward. Maybe the metal stamping? Also have 1 wheel that tilts in a bit more than the other. It however has badly worn wheel bearings also. In fact it has axial play of 1/8". No danger, it is off the road in the garage. It has 180K miles so I plan to replace all the bushings when I set the rear end up a notch to compensate for the heavier Corvair engine/tranny (75 lbs.). I don't see why the loose bearing would cause tilt to the wheel but worth a check so you can get everything back to A+.

let us know what you find so in my case I'll know which of Dave's hints was right.
