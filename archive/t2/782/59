Augh!! :-)

Don't say that, I have only lately adjusted to the idea that so long as I
don't overheat or stress the heads, I probably will be okay. A valve seat
drop is something I cannot shake from my mind as I travel.... <g> I almost
have the $120 for a sender and gauge, but not quite yet, so I drive
carefully, and take lots of breaks on long trips with extended mountain
passes.

Would you mind to expand a bit on what happened. Could you have been running
hot previously, and done most of  the damage, but not all the way to where
you would notice, then the next time it got a little warm, it dropped the
seat? Do you have a head temp gauge, or an oil temp? I sure would like to
get the warm, fuzzies back about that, as I was just feeling good about it.

As far as I know, heat is what almost always does the damage. Is that still
a true statement?

Thanks all. I appreciate this list and what I have learned from reading all
your experiences.

Mine is an 81 Vanagon air cooled, and at around 200K, it just keeps
chugging. I don't put many miles on it anymore, but the valve seat is the
thing that I seem to have settled on as the one thing that I dread. Not sure
why, but that is how it is.
