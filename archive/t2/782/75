Subject: Re: [T2] Grease'l

"Greasel" (with or without the apostophe, as you prefer) is coming close
to teaching a number of people a lesson in applied economics.  For so long
as the demand os smaller than the supply and restaurant owners have to pay
rendering plants to come and take it away, waste grease will be cheap, if
not free.  As soon as there is any demand beyond that, price will rise
exponentially or worse with no increase in supply.  No one is going to
generate more waste grease to supply the "greasel" crowd.  The price will
quickly rise to the price of diesel at the pump minus some amount for the
hassle of collecting and filtering the "griesel" from restauruants.

Not that it may not be a good idea on a personal level for a while, but as
of now, no waste grease is not used in industrial products (see: making
soap) and there is no net environmental or economic benefit to diverting
this waste stream to transportation.

OOK!
