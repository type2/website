Subject: Brakes are NOT RIGHT

I got in my 69 Westi after a huge thunderstorm here in Tulsa, Oklahoma & my bus breaks screamed & the bus pulled to the left w/ a nasty grinding sound.  I continued to drive & to 'test' the breaks & the screaming stopped sorta but the pulling is still there & I do have stopping power.  My bus has never done this before, but it's my new addition to my VW addiction.  I've gotta take a 160 mile trip at the end of the month & this is got me on edge. 
 
I've searched the archive on where to start trouble shooting but am getting overwhelmed w/ info.  I read every post daily since joining the list just to learn more about type 2's.  I cant afford to take the bus to the bus boys here in town.  
 
Where should I start 'trouble shooting'?  Im off to read my 'how to keep your vw alive' manual since its help me keep my 71super beetle on the road for 15 years.
 
any help will be put to use guys & girls!  Thanks in advance!
