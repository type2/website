Subject: A lesson

Well, as if pulling the Safare top off my '73 wasn't enough I was  
really really clever last time around and I put some great weather  
strip on to stop wind from howling through and making it nice and  
snug. HOWEVER the stripping has fused my Safare top to the bus  
stronger than the screws ever held it on so I have spent the last 3  
days with solvent, exacto and putty knife getting the dang thing  
off ! Sliding little wedges of cardboard under to stop it from  
resticking as I go... and thats just so I can bring the bus into my  
garage to do the actual work I need to do ! What a headache. I had to  
share.

I really miss my tall garage. Next time I buy a house I will pay  
attention to garage height for a Safare and not the fact its got a  
tilled floor.

sorry for the bandwidth, had to rant.
