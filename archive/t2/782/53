Subject: Re: [T2] excessive negative camber, 1 rear wheel

Greg,

Torsion "bar" not "spring".

probable causes

reference drawing here:  http://www.bus-boys.com/rearaxle6879-2.gif

bent spring plate  "L"
bad torsion bar bushings "M"
bad "a" arm bushing "V"
Bent "a" arm
broken torsion bar "U"

Bent torsion tube housing(or part of it)

Take a good look...and then bite the bullet and start pulling parts off of 
it and checking them

Cheers, dave

he one wheel has the appearance as
 busses/bugs do (and other cars similarly 'suspended')
 when they are carrying a load - but that normally
 involves both wheels "splayed" out - this is just the
 one wheel, with no real load.  Any ideas?  I think the
only thing I'm really faced with safety/structure wise
 is that the tire will likely wear prematurely on one
side - but otherwise it seems solid.  It does look
