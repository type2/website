But who keeps their cars that long anyway. My mom's Toyota's battery is
covered for 10 years. She will keep it 5 at the most.

I have done the math for a full electric car for use in my area. As of two
years ago, it would cost 50 cents per day to charge it. I cannot remember the
exact figures, but that is what the final cost was. That is just for the
electric. The car costs about $10,000 to build if you have to purchase
everything, including a Rabbit to convert.

Not sure how long the batteries will last and cannot remember their price. You
have to figure the price of replacing the batteries every few years to be able
to compare it to the cost of gas. Although with gas going the way it is,
batteries are looking better and better. Until supply and demand raise the
price on them also....
