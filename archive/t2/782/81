Dave,

Lordy, why is it that having a lawyer absolves people of having *any*
sort of intelligence or common sense.

If the seat mounting method looks unsafe, then don't do it.

What it seems that no one remembers is that it is *not* the seat that 
holds you in, but the seat belt.  The seat mounting only needs to be 
strong enough to hold the seat in place in the event of a crash.

And, if you are not wearing a seat belt, then having the seat come behind 
you as you fly thru the windshield is probably not going to make one iota 
of difference about the injuries you may or may not sustain.

Bus content: I have replaced my seat belts with the same kind shown in the 
picture....and I still have my stock uncomfortable(but pretty) seats.

I hereby absolve everyone on this list from any liablility whatsover 
because I installed  81 vanagon seat belts in my 78 as shown by several listees.

I take personal responsability for the fact that I did it safely and 
correctly and totally believe that the belts themselves will break long 
before the mounts do.

Cheers, dave
