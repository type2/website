Subject: #3 intake tightening up

Howdy,    Just recently back from my road trip with my '77 bus and it's new 
rebuild, with about 7000 miles on it.  All went fine until the 2nd week of 
my trip and after only about 2000 miles or so.  What can I expect is 
happening if my #3 intake valve continues to tighten up?  The last 5 
mornings I would have to adjust my valves after being plagued with a low 
idle, which told me something was up.
        The #3 intake was tight each time and I had to loosen it.  Then the 
next day...same thing all over again.  And again....
           What exactly is going on here do you think??  It's now just off 
warranty, but I think I'll be headed back to the rebuilder with my (your) 
ideas as to what sort of problem I'm having.    Any ideas or explanations 
greatly appreciated, Thanks!
                     Kevin  Snow
