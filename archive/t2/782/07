I used a grey ribbed rubber type, came in a big roll from Home Depot  
too, about a fingers width wide. Its a nightmare. I don't know if its  
because it was sandwiched down between the body and fiberglass or if  
its the various temperatures it went through, either way I'm NOT  
using it again. I think I will go the foam type route.
