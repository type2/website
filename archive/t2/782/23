Subject: Re: [T2] Brakes are NOT RIGHT

If it is pulling left, make sure the right caliper is not stuck, overheated and thus contributing nothing to your stopping power. Been there, done that... 

Also make sure that the ALL the rubber hydraulic lines are replaced. My '78 has the originals I think and I KNOW that one of the fronts is dead. Fluid goes in, gets trapped (like one-way valve) and that keeps the caliper on that side "ON". No matter as it is a garage queen right now but a big deal when I try to push it around or if I were trying to drive it somewhere. Just replace all 4 lines and be done with it - that way you know they are good and won't burst during a hard stop.

The noise you may be hearing maybe hot brakes. On my Honda CR-V if I ride the brakes down the mountains around here pulling my trailer they start to rumble. Causes heat ridges I think on the rotors/drums whch causes the rumble. All that goes away once they cool down. My Westy's brakes squeal alot (calipers and pads rubbing).
