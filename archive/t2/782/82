John,

Thanks for the info.  Knowing that, I need to take care of the spinning 
nut dilemma.  If the valve is inside, and the nut is spinning, how 
would I go about fixing this?  I can't seem to pull it out or tighten it. 
Also, how is there a trick to  accessing the valve? Then once it's out I guess I 
need to check the valve, retap the hole (?), and reinstall it.

You need to distinguish between the pressure valve and the cap. You
can replace the cap with a temp sender, but the valve is deep inside
above the spring. The valve is crucial to your motor.
