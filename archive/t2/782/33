Yes. Park it. NOTHING on my bus has broken in several years now. Of course I haven't driven it for several years now either... <grin!> 

You need some instruments - temps for head and oil and pressures. Buy good stuff. 

Are you dropped valves because of aged parts or heat? Well you can rule out the heat with some instruments.
