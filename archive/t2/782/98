This only happens in the morning or if my bus sat for 8+ hours
while at work.

So the 2.0L has one to protect the oil cooler, since thats probably
more important.

I just have this feeling that either the required air is not getting
to my oil cooler or my oil cooler is not getting the normal amount
of oil (being bypassed). This would account for my normal head temps
but high oil temps.

Can I get to the flaps and oil cooler without pulling the engine?
