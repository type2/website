Subject: Type 2 in France and Switzerland

Back from my annual vacation in Europe. I drove about 2000 miles on
the French and Swiss roads and tried to spot as many VW busses as
possible.

I saw
- one Swiss type 2 (BE plates) with a > 1973 body type which sounded
like it had a type 1 engine. It's freeway speed was also more aligned
with that of a type 1 powered bus (90km/h - 56mph)
- one early type baywindow that formerly belonged to the swiss army
and was painted green. It was parked and i noticed it's type 1 engine.
Crap i should have taken a picture of the rear lights !

- a dozen of Vanagons, mostly with German and Swiss licence plates.
The Westfalia has "Joker" stickers on the front doors there. Many have
bike racks on the top or on the back.

- no split window bus.

I creeped under an orange baywindow with >1973 body : it had a type 4
engine. That got me confused since the UK list member was writing on
this list that all type 2 busses sold in Europe until 1979 had type 1
engines. Where and when were the type 2 busses fitted with type 4
engine in Europe ?

Side notes
1) I drove my dad's 1991 Citroen BX with hydropneumatic suspension.
The confort is fantastic.The look is another question.
2) Cars over there look really good in my opinion, esp Citroen C4 and
Renault Megane Coupe. The peugeot 607 is a beautiful vessel.
