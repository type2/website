Subject: Sticking door locks

I've got a 69 Bay coming out of storage... It seems the rear of the sliding 
door keeps popping out.  The lock does not want to engage, thought it was 
working normally a couple of years ago when the vehicle went into storage.  
What are the first few things I should look for?   Thanx.......
