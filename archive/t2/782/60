<Diesels are both cheap and long lasting, but only available in cars from VW and Mercedes (pretty
sure about that...)>

I worked on a project for a Chrysler supplier which will allow Chry-Co to market a turbo diesel PT Cruiser next year. Now whether they will sell it to us is another thing. Our cars are so wasteful compared to what alot of Europeans drive. I remember seeing one Italian fellow in Naples using a basic Oldsmobile as a wedding limo. Was just a 4 door Olds with V-8/auto tranny/a-c from the 80s. 

<BTW II, I've done some reading around and it seems that the
push on hybrid engines is mostly on getting more horsepower
on the same gas mileage rather than regular performance with
better mileage... ;-(>

Typical American marketting. More power!!! Well, I'm happy to report that for 20K miles now I've been getting along just fine with 115 HP in a VW Cabrio. Actually less than that b/c the max HP is at a much higher rpm than I use. The torque maxes out at 3500 rpm or something like that. I hate spending $30 to fill up it's tank but I would plenty happy to see American drivers return to more realistic rides. Yeah that's me saying folks driving more cars like mine. 

<BTW III, some guy in California has tweaked his Prius ($3,000
worth of batteries, etc...) and gets 250 mpg...And, yes, he does
plug it in to augment the gas engine's charging, but hopefully the
utility company is more efficient...>

Got a link? Sounds awesome! I am plenty happy to drive a bit more efficiently or sedately to keep a bit more cash in my pocket.
