My Mexican heads closed up a bit in the first 2000 miles and then have
been remarkably stable ever since.  I check at 2000 mile intervals and
seldom have to change more than one of the valve setting on both heads!

My advice is to give the heads a few thousand miles to settle in before
worrying about them.
