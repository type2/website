They were all built over there so it was most likely available as an
option.

But, much of Europe insures and registers based on size AND engine
displacement. Anything larger than 1.6L starts jacking up your insurance
rates substantially (at least in Ireland which is the one country I have
info from relatives and friends on).

The bus could also have been a re-import sale from a US owner to a Euro
buyer.
