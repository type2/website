Symptom of a broken spring:  Door lock is easy to open if you don't pull
the trigger first, but difficult if you do pull the trigger before
attempting to open it with the key.
Also the door will not automatically unlock itself if it is closed while
it is locked without the trigger pulled.

If you are "nursing" a broken spring, remember to _never_ pull the trigger
before using the key.  Always lock and unlock the door with the key.  Fix
it ASAP!
