Usually it goes out right away: 1-2 seconds. I've found that with  
hydraulic lifters the light will stay on longer (5 sec) if the  
lifters don't pump up immediately.

Seems normal.

OK.

The second valve limits overall oil pressure. The solid lifter  
engines have two, the hydraulic lifters engines have one.

There is a better photo of this diagram on page 40 of Wilson.
