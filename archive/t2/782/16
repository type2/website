Subject: Re: [T2] Sticking door locks

A locksmith at HCBF showed me this trick for a temp fix on a 75-
Unscrew the upper large screw that is around the corner from the lock,
on the narrow face of the door.
Using the squirt aiming tube, Squirt a solvent like wd40 or Kreul into
the hole, aiming down- work the key or lock knob as you do this.
Re lubrication- he said the secret ingredient all locksmiths use is
TRI-FLOW, a chain lubricant for bicycles.
