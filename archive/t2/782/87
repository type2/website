Subject: oil pressure

Can someone tell me if the following is normal?

1979 Federal FI 2.0L

Cold engine. Takes 5-10 seconds for oil light to go out
and gauge to register pressure. Oil pressure goes to 60psi at idle.
Pressure stays 55-60 psi at speed and at idle as long as oil
temp is < 180F. As the temp approaches 180F, the idle pressure starts
to come down. Once engine is warm, oil pressure at idle is 15-20psi.

Does the 2.0L engine have 2 oil pressure valves?
If it has two, I know one is to prevent excess pressure from going
to the cooler and the other is to bypass the cooler when the oil
is not hot.
