Subject: Stoopid vs. muffler

did muffler installation on my '68. using good german
muffle from bus depot.

Went nuts trying to force fresh-air heating tubes in
it. Tried heat, cold, filing edges, seven kinds of
lube...

On 5,000th attempt, a metal cap/plug popped out of the
hole. Examining it, i saw instructions in english and
german. "REMOVE BEFORE INSTALLATION." Wut a knuckhead
i am.

Pried the other cap out. Then, a  little tapping with
a plastic hammer, the tubes went in.

For the record:
1. Using a German muffler makes life easier, worth any
price difference over Brazilian, Tasmanian, Sri
Lankian whatever. 

2. It's easier to get the lower clamps on if you put a
jack under the engine and lift it a half inch off the
"moustache" bar.

3. I did the parafin lube trick by removing the tin,
then smooshing a tea candle onto the nuts and studs.
Then I drove around the block melting it. The nuts did
not exactly "fall off", but they came off easily.

3. The Ernst german muffler burns off its gray paint
with a nasty smell and enough smoke to cause alarm. (A
U.S. Forest Service ranger followed me last weekend
because he thought i was on fire. Actually, he was
more worried about the forest than the bus.)

4. Enjoy the rubix cube-like challenge, the
instructions amount to a fuzzy picture of the muffler
taped on the box. Copper nut or plated? Which washer
where? (Bentley helps.)

Tnx to list members who offered advice and solace.
