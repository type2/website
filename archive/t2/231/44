Waxoyl or an oil spray into every exterior nook and cranny every year or so.

That means the inside of the rockers, fenders, front door steps, the doors, 
inside the nose, etc.

Keep the body drains open - not clogged with debris. Don't park under a 
pine tree which deposits needles all over your car.

Keep it washed and a Florida friend told me to wash my vehicle every time I 
came back from the beach when I lived down in Orlando... Use a car wash to 
hose the bottom down.

Deal with every bit of rust as it happens, not later when you have time. 
POR-15 is good for this I'm told. I have used Extend with good results but 
you have to paint over that to make it last.

Good luck!!!
