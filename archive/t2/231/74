Don't feel too bad...Years ago I bought a rebuilt clutch set up
from the local FLAPS and put it in a '71 bus. It got halfway 
out the driveway when a noise like the hammers of hell came
from the back when I depressed the clutch...Backed it slow-
ly to the work site and dropped the engine again. Wut a mess!
There were shipping/retaining clips on the diaphram that I
missed...D'uh...:-(
