--Duke,

consensus is that a good bus costs 5000 whether you pay it up front or put it in yourself.

depends on what part of the country too. If you're getting it in cali for 500, that's about average. East coast or rust belt? Hell of a deal.

Sounds like at 2900 (your estimate) it's not too bad if you've got the cash/time to spend.

My thoughts,

Billy
