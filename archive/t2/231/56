Set the timing with a gun. check the idle speed with a tach. Check the 
dwell with the dwell meter.

What do you mean you couldn't adjust the #3 valve? Exhaust or Intake? 
Couldn't reach it? Adjustment was different everytime you ran it or???

If that valve is too tight it may not close completely and this will cause 
the idle to be rough.

Is it missing on one cylinder or randomly? Pull each spark plug lead while 
the engine runs and see which cylinder isn't performing. Is it #3?

Check compression.

Use WD-40 or carb cleaner to spray every potential leaking gasket while the 
engine idles until it smooths out, slows down, or speeds up. Once you've 
found a leak each squirt should cause a change in the idle quality.

Is the carb clean? Do the idle air screws make a difference in the engine 
speed or idle quality?

Check the idle jets and see if they aren't clean.

Muir has a pretty good beginner's procedure if you have never done this.
