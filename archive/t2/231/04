Hey,
 I know the car is new but if turning the adjusting screws makes no
difference and you cant find any leaks then maybe the carb is a lemon. BTW
do you have the vacuum line connected right?, Well anything ask the shop you
bought the carb from to lend you a spare carb to try, If all else fails try
different parts. I could lend you a 34 pct 3 that I know works, you sound
like a trustable guy.=)
