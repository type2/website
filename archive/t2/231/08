Everyone,

Well, I've had my 71 crew up for sale on the samba.com for two months now and 
have only had people outside te USA who are interested. Is there anyone on 
this list that lives in Florida? I'm only asking $3,950 for this truck and it 
is one of the most rust free trucks  I have ever seen. No, it is not RUST 
FREE, but it only has a few minor areas to repair. check out my website and 
the samba ad (for more pics). http://members.aol.com/vwdude1957/vwtruck.html
I really need to sell this truck. Any help would be appreciated.

Dave
