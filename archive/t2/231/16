RJ,

I didn't see plugs listed as replaced?
Did it run this way to start with?

Time to go back to basics.

Spark plug test...remove one by one and note any change in idle.
Do the same thing, but drive it a block or two and see if
that plug/cylinder is contributing anything to power.
Spark looks good? or not.


Engine off....pull the aircleaner and watch and see if your 
accelerator pump on the carb is working...after warm up/or choke open, see 
if you get a stream of gas shooting down into the carb when you rotate
the accelerator linkage.

30-35 max is bad....something is seriously off...you already knew this 
though.

Got a dwell meter and/or compression gauge?

Is the coil connected properly...if backwards, then weak spark.
Exhaust restriction of some kind?  How does the exhaust feel?..plenty of 
exhaust coming out?

If you move the advance on the dist around does it get better? or 
worse...not too much...just a little to see what happens.

Does the vacuum advance on the dist really work?  Suck on it and watch.

Vacuum for the dist really exsist at the carb?  or blocked?

Cheers ,dave
