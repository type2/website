My sister owns a 1971 westie, has a 1600 in it. It was backfiring she told me 
and then could drive it over 30. So I stopped by to check it out. We set the 
points which weren't that far off and checked the inside of the cap, it was 
loaded with carbon build up on the tips, so we cleaned that. Then I noticed 
the lead plug on the front of the carb had dissapeared, leaving a gapping 
hole the size of a dime. So plugged the hole sealed it up and it fired up. 
Runs but the idle is speratic and it seems to be popping or spitting a little 
out the exhaust until you get on the gas then no problem.. Any ideas...thanks
