Subject: 70 westy curtain stuff

how do the curtains hang on the little metal hooks over the sliding door
and both front doors?
i have successfully sewn and hung the curtains that hang on the rails.
all i have left are the kind that hook on... oh, and the one behind the
cabinet. someone told me there were just 3 or 4 screws holding it in. one
in the closet and the other 2-3 in the back... HA! there were 2 in the
closet, 3 in the back and ONE ABOVE the cabinet where i cant get to it
without a midget screwdriver... rrrrrr.

anyway, it is so neat to have curtains! even if they arent all there. oh
well, give me time.

tell me something... the driver side middle and rear curtains in my bus
appear to have had an elastic cord along the bottom instead of the metal
rod like the back window. is this normal? it looks normal, the pieces of
elastic that are still attached to the bus look like they could be 30
years old, but why would they use elastic on these curtains but use rods
on the back hatch? just curious. they probably didnt have a reason for
it.

thanks guys,
chris
