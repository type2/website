Subject: Re:70 westy curtains and such 

Chris,
    I made new curtains for our bus, a '71 westy, a couple of years ago and
it wasn't hard at all.  On the driver's side windows and the rear hatch
window the curtains are a 2 piece set up.  The curtain that covers the
sliding door window is one piece and I made one long curtain to cover the
windshield and both front door windows, for use when we are camping.  I used
1 inch wide nylon webbing with snaps installed to hold the curtains in the
open position.  Then each of the straps is screwed to the interior wall of
the bus.
    I remember that someone on this list a couple of years ago had a real
nice write-up on making curtains.  that's what inspired me to do ours.  If
that article isn't in the type2 library check the archives.
