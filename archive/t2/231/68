Subject: musical bus?

is there any reason the clutch would sing when idling? i have started
hearing this whirring sort of noise when i am sitting at a stop
sign/light. if i start to let off the clutch, it changes. when i am
driving, i dont seem to hear it... then again, it is hard to hear much of
anything over the exhaust leak noise.

is there a fuel pump inside the gas tank in the 70 bus? could that be it?

1970 westy
newly rebuilt engine (5 weeks running)
valves were adjusted
oil was changed once
bus had been sitting at least 15+ years prior
apparently has an exhaust leak

cant think of any other symptoms to list... whatta ya think?
