I wanted to send a muchas gracias to the list for trying to help with my turn signal question the other day...I am the prototypical "trying to learn" person.  I printed off all the suggestions and after hours (literally) trying to fix this problem, most of the time spent looking like a confused dog with his head tilted, I was ready to give up.  It took a kind soul to come and rescue me...in the true spirit of "old VWism".  Jim came and fixed the problem and even appeared to care about my car being back on the road...anyway, a VERY NICE thing happened due to 'the list' existing...

thanks
