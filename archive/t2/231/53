>> I had an inkling to just bring the bus to an RV center to get
 the tank filled and then splosh soapy water on as much of
 the system as I can to check for leaks. could it be that simple? <<

yes! thats exactly how the pros check for leaks (or at least i was
told that by an old-timer that used to be in the business)

i think the best thing to do is just call an RV shop. of course, they
might balk at the sight of a baywindow, say your system is too old, &
refuse to fill it if the inspection on the system is not current.

then of course you are stuck with a chicken & egg kind of deal.
i.e., how can you test for leaks without propane and how can you
get propane by knowing its leak-free?

good luck Pete!
