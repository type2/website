Just received my order from The Bus Depot today and am pleased with =
there service and the quality of there products. It only took one week =
to get it and I live in Canada, and nothing was damaged. I ordered =
engine compartment seals for my 70' and 74' bus. along I also ordered =
the rear cargo area floor, both left and right halves for my 74' bus. =
They look REAL close to the original and with a bit of trimming and =
welding you probably won't be able to tell that they were replaced. The =
part # for the floors are 885006 and 885007 if anybody is in need of =
these hard to find items.
