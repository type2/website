karl, is there no end to your vast knowledge? i never realized there were
3 different models... did they make 3 models every year or just after a
certain time? my 70 has the camp stool and all your usual poptop stuff
but i have no stove. i didnt think they installed stoves until later.

btw- where can i look for this P#?

mine is called a "campmobile", little sticker on the side of the sink, i
think. but i have heard of one called a "day camper". would this be what
the hard top westy would be called? or was it a later year thing? perhaps
it was a vanagon thing? i know i have heard of them, but now i am curious
just exactly what they are.

bowing to karl's superior intellect...

ps~ have you ever considered being on "win ben stein's money"? write to
them and tell them they need to have a VW episode... *giggle*
