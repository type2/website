y'all,

on the freeway today, high speeds, high temps, bus "popped", lost power and died.

will turn over, wont catch.

small puddle of fuel on top of #3 under manifold. not a leaking fuel line, i just replaced them all and they're tight.

plugs are in tight, dizzy ok, wires all connected.

Karl, checked that case ground for the f.i.

popped hole in manifold? 

what?

Billy
