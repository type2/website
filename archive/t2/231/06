Jamie,

With FI, what Jason said is the beginning and end of the answer to the
question "Why will it idle with the throttle cracked but not with the
throttle closed?" I would check the vacuum, certainly, as I think he
is correct on what is wrong with your engine but...

With carbs there is an additional possible answer.  In a carb, there are
really two separate fuel supply systems, one for idle and one for running
(and a third, the accelerator pump, for acceleration).  If you have a bit
of grit (shaken loose while you were bumping the carb about) lodged in
your idle circuit, it can also cause the symptoms you are experiencing.
The solution is to take the carb apart, clean it, and blow compressed air
thru all the passages and be sure they are CLEAN clean.
