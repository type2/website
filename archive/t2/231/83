My guess would be that nobody's likely to lean on the back hatch, but metal rods would be uncomfortable to people, and people would be dangerous to metal rods, leaning on them and bending them. May not have been the reason, but it seems plausible to me. 

because the rear is a hatch and lifts up, the rods keep the curtain in
place
