I will second that. You can get decent busses for cheap, even off of eBay.

I bought my 76 westfalia last year from someone just north of San Francisco 
for $410.

Granted, I put money into it, but I drove it home and around town for two 
months beforehand. It was running and ready to go.

Of course, it helped that they posted no pictures, no description other than 
"sleeps 4" and spelled it 'wesphalia'

I drove up to check it out, and sat up till the auction ended at 4am to make 
sure I was the high bidder.
