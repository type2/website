Going to have to determine if it is an electrical problem or a mechanical 
or a fuel problem.

I will assume it is not mechanical (compresison test).

Pull and injector and see if it will squirt. If it won't then consider the 
easy stuff - air meter connector fell off, points slipped, fuel pump not 
pumping, vacuum hose off.

Worst case maybe the computer died but I would not worry about that one yet.

Get out your Bentley.
