Subject: RE: [T2] Engine Pulling Experience/ ATV Lift

I'll second that. Got my ATV lift on sale at Sears for $119.00. Now that's
their regular price. I bolted two 2X4s to it to extend its reach. It makes
engine/tranny pulls a one man, no sweat job. Its nice and stable. Just make
sure you get the engine as far back on the lift as possible so it won't tip
forward. You can easily wheel the whole transaxle around and even use it as
a test stand for running the engine.
