Subject: Dizzy Woes

Alright All, I have a 71 westy that has had the 009 dizzy on it since I got
it. I found what I thought was the stock vac dizzy at a swap meet, a 205Q
which is the first number listed for my bus on the oldvolokshome dizzy spec
page.  
So, I turn my engine to TDC and remove the 009.  Then when I install the 205Q,
the rotor does not line up with the notch on the lip of the dizzy, which
indicates where #1 should fire at TDC, it looks more like it is lined up where
the #2 will fire, yet the engine is DEFINITELY at #1 TDC (i took out the #1
spark plug and felt with a pencil to confirm TDC)  So, what the hell is goin
on here? Is it just as simple as changing the plug wires around to match the
dizzy TDC mark?

Peace, John Baker
