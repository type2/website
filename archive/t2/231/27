Backside connections many times have little physical location 
correllation with the front fuse positions.  i.e. pin 22 may be located 
physically behind fuse s3 but actually be connected to fuse s2 or s4 or 
s5.  Will do it the hard way by pulling and confirming terminal 
connections.  Probably better that way anyway.  then i an make sure 
there are no other sneaky surprises in this wiring
