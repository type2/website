Subject: Re: [T2] fuse block info needed

The Bentley schematic will show which fuse terminal each wire goes to on 
the fuse panel.

I think the fuses are labelled S1 through S-something. Also at the bottom 
of the page the fuse panel is pictured showing visually which fuse handles 
a particular circuit.

The schematic I have is a copy of the one from Vintage Bus.
