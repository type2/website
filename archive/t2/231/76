<< Hi everyone

I'm planning on moving to the coast and was wondering how this was going to

affect my 74 Westy.  What kind of changes am I going to have to make.  My

Westy has very little rust on it and is in very good shape so what do I do

to keep it that way?

Thanks a lot

Other than keeping an eye on everything, my first best guess would be to
POR-15 as much of the underneath as possible.
OTOH, you could do as Irv Gordon does with his '66 P1800 Volvo...He's
got a sprayer in his driveway that washes the undercarraige of the car.
BTW, Irv's Volvo also has 2,000,000 miles on it...Engine was rebuilt at
680,000...
