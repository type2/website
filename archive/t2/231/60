Subject: dwell vs. good ol feeler gauges

So I have a fancy snancy point/dwell/tach meter.  Here is my question:

I adjust the points perfect.  Put it in.  dwell says 35 degrees.  So I'm off
my about 15.  Do I readjust?  The points were adjusted super good, honest.

My dwell-o-meter has a switch called "points".  Any clue what THAT means?
