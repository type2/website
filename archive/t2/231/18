Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Pulling Experience and Questions

This may be of little help to the original question, but I was wondering
about something I saw at Sam's.
They had a "Motorcycle/ATV" jack for $100. It looked like it would be great
for dropping a VW engine.
It has 2 long, but narrow jacking platforms that are raised at the same
time. That should keep the engine balanced while raising and lowering.
Also it raises b/n 2.5 and 14 or 18 inches (sorry I don't recall the
specifics).
It would free up my other jack for the trans. No more ciderblock and 2x4's.

So has anyone used one of these?

Later,
