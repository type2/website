Subject: Re: [T2] fuse block info needed

[...]
the lack of markings of any type is what struck me when examining it 
with a very bright light to make sure there were not markings on it 
somewhere.  Was very confused at first when i started to suspect the 
problem but wiring definately matches the later year.  Just got through 
with digging in parts diagrams and listings and just realized that I 
have two variations of parts for the 1972 bus.  It  is now looking like 
the wiring diagrams are not going into model specific details.  With the 
same fuse block in the same year I can get three different combinations 
for emergency flasher, turn signal, and other relays.  The wiring 
diagram would look the same as the 73 on one of the variations.  This 
vehicle has seen time in Canada, US, and probably Italy as a PO was 
military and looks like he took the vehicle with him on his travels.
