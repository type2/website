The cap is indicative of an ignition SYSTEM problem and the same stress the 
cap gave into puts stress on the other system componencts. Replace the 
cap/rotor/points. Pull the plugs. Contaminated?? Worn?? Replace them. 
Verify HT wire continuity. Excess resistance in any, replace the set. And 
do I need to say it? Bosch parts only please with Super plugs.

But even before ignition, verify compression. Look up the last compression 
test and valve adjustment in the service history. (HaHaHaHaahhh) 
Regardless, a compression balance should be verified before moving on to 
the ignition system.

Always verify mechanical SYSTEM first, then ignition SYSTEM. When those two 
are right, the only thing left is the fuel SYSTEM. The popping and spitting 
could be fouled plugs, bad valve gaps, leaking valves, cracks or holes in 
the exhaust.

You will identify the problem without missing the culprit if you will first 
verify maintenance is complete and up to date. This will solve glitchy 
problems over half the time. If a problem then remains, you already know a 
whole bunch of things that it's not.
