Thanks Karl. I also wondered where the stool and front table.

My Canadian model's m-plate says P22. It seems it's the same as the US model
but it has the original stove.

It looks yellow to me, like my own cloth.

The 76 dealer brochure seems to call this Orange Plaid while 77 dealer
brochure calls it Green Red.  I think it's the same fabric as long as it has
the red stripe in the pattern.

I emailed Vincent Molenaar a while back and he said the European models had
names like Helsinki.  Does anyone know all the names and what they
designate?
