Subject: 70 westy curtains and such

hello all westy people...
i am making curtains for my westy and i am trying to figure out how they
open and get tied back. the original curtains were replaced in my westy
and the replacements were made of a less than durable fabric, so i am
having a hard time figuring this out. 

on the long window side (in 70 that was the driver side) there are 2 big
windows. are there 2 full curtains? front pulled to the front and rear to
the rear (little vent window would be in the way of pulling it to the
front)? or do each of the big windows have a separation in the curtain
like you would find at home (pulling half to the front and half to the
middle, half the rear curtain to the back)? on the rear hatch, also...
one big curtain pulled to the side or two half curtains?

to tie them back...
there is one snapping strap just behind the driver and front passenger
doors. i assume these are for the front door curtains, correct? there are
a couple of small screw holes very near where these straps are screwed
on... do one of these holes belong to a strap for the middle curtain? if
not, then how are the rest of the curtains held back, out of the way?

i know alot of people drive with their curtains closed, but i am still
getting used to the reduced vision of this vehicle as it is... i dont
need more obstructions.

thanks for your help,
chris
