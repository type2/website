Subject: RE: [T2] engine swap

It won't bolt right in because you're going to be putting a type 4 engine in
a type 1 engine bay, but since you have all the conversion parts necessary (
your wrecked bus), it should't be too difficult to find a welding shop that
can do this. Swap both the engine and trans to keep things simple.

Buy that ATV lift we've been talking about to make the job easier.
