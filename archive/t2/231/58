Subject: Who turned out the lights?

I hopped in my bus last night right around sunset to go drive to a concert
and realized as it got darker that all of my lights were out (tail lights,
instrument lights, etc.) except for my headlights.  I took the long and
cop-free way home from the show and this morning tried to figure it out.
It's not a fuse or a wire-eating rat and I haven't changed anything in the
last couple weeks that would have this effect.  I've been meaning to change
the dimmer relay to get my high beams working but I haven't gotten around to
that.  Does anyone have any ideas what could cause this?  I have a
multimeter and I'm ready for that oh-so awkward working-under-the-dash
contortionist position.

Thanks!
