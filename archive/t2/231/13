The Dell carbs are worth about $300 so you could part this puppy out if you 
had to.

Do you feel confident that you can do the work or pay somebody else to do 
it. If the van is complete but showing it's age and simply needs new 
rubber, paint, and veneer then I say okay! If the body needs paint and a 
few bumps and dents fixed then I say okay! If there is significant rust I 
would start scratching my head.

What's missing? Tables? Stove? Fridge? Trim?

What works? Electrical system? Steering tight?

Has it been hit?

Where's it rusting? Where has it been stored?

Count on a full rebuild on that engine. He may have run it lean with those 
carbs and burned the piston up.

Assume the worst on the parts of the bus that you can't test, that way you 
aren't disappointed.

Comparison: My wife and stopped to look at a '78 (?) Westy parked on the 
side of the road here in Cookeville. The interior is ratty, filthy, veneer 
peeling or broken. It had a DPD (?) a/c system complete. Needs paint and 
unknown amount of mechanical repairs. Dunno if it runs. There is little of 
the engine tin sealed b/c of the a/c compressor sticking through. I 
recognize this van to be a fellow's work van. When I saw it last it was 
1997 and this van was full of tools and junk. No wonder the interior looks 
so ratty.

Catch this: missing the interior spare tire door, rear bumper and sliding door!

Price? $3000. THREE THOUSAND BUCKS!

Are they kidding? The bus is worth $600 tops.

We laughed the whole way home....
