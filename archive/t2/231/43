Anyone got a right rear drum brake shoes push bar for a 72 Bus? =
BustedBus only sells the 68 through 71 and the 72 is different. No one =
else that I can see offers them and I dont have enough bug repellent or =
a Sherpa to guide me through the dense jungles that are my local rust =
yards right now.

Thanks for the help!
