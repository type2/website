Subject: Re:  starter thread 

Hi all,
I'd like to add my 2 cents on this subject.  To get reliable starting I 
service the starter system once a year.  This way I get to do it on my own 
terms.  Sure beats having to crawl under the bus at night in the rain to 
bang on the solenoid.
  I take out the battery to clean it and add water as necessary.  Then I 
remove the starter and disassemble it.  I clean everything, make any 
required repairs,polish up the commutator, and reassemble it with a little 
grease on the mechanical parts and some light weight oil on the solenoid 
shaft.  Next all terminals on the battery, starter, and wire ends are 
cleaned until they shine.  Now reinstall the battery and starter and I'm 
good for another year.
