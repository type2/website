Subject: dual stock solexs and Muir's suggestions 

Hello List,

The archives re down so I hope you don't mind if I ask
a common question. I have a set of dualstock solex 34
PDSIT-2/-3 carbs on my 73 bus that is missing one of
its 3 electromagnetic cuttoff switches. The left carb
has the central idling system's electromagnetic cut
off valve (the larger one with the large obvious
stopper), but is missing its electromagnetic idling
cut off valve (the smaller one with no protruding
stopper). The right carburator has its electromagnetic
idling cut off valve (the smaller one). I am getting a
replacement cuttoff valve for the one that is missing
Thursday. 

<QUESTION>

should I do what Muir says and make these valves into
plugs by cutting off the ends of the valves or just
leave them stock if they work? I know that Muir didn't
like them. He also suggested disabling the choke
except in the winter. What do you think about that?

Thanks for any answers given!
