I too need to thank Doc Stephens and Karl vS for the assist with my new
bosch starter. I went with a NEW bosch to avoid headaches. It comes with
only a single spade connecter on the solenoid.  You connect both the
ignition and FI wire to it using a push-on splitter. I added the bosch
hot-start relay kit for good measure.  It was cheap, can't hurt, may help,
and for the first time in years,  the bus starts on one try.  I DO have to
give it some gas and crank for a bit, but she fires on one try!
What should I check to make her start with no gas pedal, on the first try as
it should? She has brand new, (all bosch): plugs, wires, cap ,rotor, blue
coil, starter, cold-start-valve, thermotime switch, hot start relay kit.
Ideas? I'd like to get it perfect!
