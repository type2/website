If you had the time/money to buy one loss leader $39 "rebuild" and one
genuine Bosch corp remanufactured unit, and took them both apart for
inspection, the differences would be patently apparent. I had one DIY'er
here with a BMW that went through 3 FLAPS rebuilt starters in as many
months before we put in the real deal and solved his starter problems. Not
everyone has results this bad. Perhaps one of ten of the low bucks units
was a good core return misdiagnosed and got cleaned only before resold and
functions well for many more years. If your lucky that's the one you get.
It's a lottery with these low bucks specials. 

Bottom line: If you haven't got the time/money to do it right the first
time, where will you find the time/money to do it over?????

Of the hundreds of genuine Bosch Corp. REMAN starters and alturators I have
installed in the past 10 years I have not had a single come back. Not one.
And in every case the originals lasted not less than 15 years or 150,000
miles, in EVERY case. I have a starter replacement scheduled next week for
a 62 Porsche 356 6 volt. It got the original replaced last year with a low
cost wannabe VW unit. That's original equipment = 38 years, wannabe = 1
year. And since he doesn't have the original core worth $60 and the VW core
is worth $20, he must pay the difference in core values as well. This is
not the way to reduce your cost per mile.

These are just some of the facts of life. I can't hold the wrenches right
with my fingers crossed hoping for results.
