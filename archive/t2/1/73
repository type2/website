Subject: paint under nose

I wonder if my capmer has been repaired before?  The nose took a hit up 
front from what appears to be a 4x4 pickup or suv bumper.  Someday I will 
fix it.  But poking around under my dash to r&r my headlight switch I found 
that the nose sheet metal is light grey/blue underneath.  Is this normal?  
My Camper is white otherwise, everywhere that I can see.

John
