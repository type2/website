Subject: Not Vanagon, a virus warning.

I recently got a virus from either the type2 list or the vanagon list.
It came as an attachment to an E-mail and I'm not sure if it attached
itself to outgoing mail or not.
The virus name is w32/SirCam.gen(-at-)MM, it came to me on July 23, 2001 ay
10:39 AM.
The file size is 137,216.
It corrupts or creates a file in the Windows/system or Windows/system32
directory.
The file to look for is SCam32.exe
You should run your virus program if you've gotten pmail from me.
If you find this file is infected you can get a stand alone fix from
McAfee named scrmove2.zip that effectively removes the virus.
