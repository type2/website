Subject: My poor bus needs things!

Hello fellow listees!  My 78 bus Prudence has been running very well
lately, knock wood, but there are two things I need to get hold of prior
to October when she is due for the lovely state of NJ inspection ordeal!

1. A new windshield.  My six year old son and a golf ball, need I say
more?
2. A new passenger side exhaust manifold.  I am speaking of the very
first piece of pipe coming out of the head.  I have done a lot of
searching for this part myself to no avail, so I am pleading for you to
wrack your collective brain and help me out here.  I don't understand
why all the other exhaust parts are available from places like
Motorworks, but not this one.  My bus is a California bus, but that
shouldn't make a difference since this part come before the catalyst
does, right?
     If anyone can help out, let me know.  I will be glad to pay for
anything you might dig up.  Thanks, Beth in NJ and Prudence

P.S. The lovely artwork painted on at Everybus 2001 stayed on for WEEKS,
thru several rainfalls before it started to look ratty and I had to wash
it off. Everyone back home loved it, thanks Girls!
