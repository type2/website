Subject: Timing (again!)

I know there has been much discuassion here about timing and had I paid
attention my questions were probably answered already.

On an 1800 with a progressive Weber and a 009, where should the timing be
set?

On which side of the zero on the timing scale are "before" and "after" ?

Thanks,
