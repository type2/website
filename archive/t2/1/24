Subject: Generator Light

Hey y'all:

I've been trying to find technical info on what makes the generator light turn on, and I can't seem to find any.  I've checked Bentley, Haynes, Muir, and can find no technical explanations as to the operation of this light.  I know there are some EE (electrical engineers) types out there on the list, so if one of you cares to explain, I'd like to hear it.  The reason I want to know is because I'm converting all my dash lights to LED's, and this is the only one I need tech info for.  My guess is I'll need to design a comparator circuit for it, but it would save me some time if somebody can tell me how it works.

Thanks!
