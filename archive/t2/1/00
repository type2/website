Subject: my tire rack

Hi Gang,

It appears my tire rack was allowed to poke through the front of the 
Van. I also assume this was caused by either "Bondo" or metal 
fatigue.

As a result, does anyone have any suggestions on how to make it 
stronger? Perhaps having a bar welded across the unibody chassis 
and then I bolt the tire rack directly to that, bypassing the body 
itself?

Can I remove the front facia of my bus?

Anyhow, Got a big time rock crack from a turd driving a white 
sports car at 120 Kph down the road to Ft. Rae, passed me at light 
speed and threw a rock, now I have a spreading crack, bummer 
with that gravel highway.5 more years and it will be paved to YK.

Cheers,
