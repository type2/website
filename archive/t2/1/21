Subject: No front brake drums!  '68

Hi,

Many people seem to be having problems finding front brake
drums that fit '68 busses. We had to get new ones so had to
buy 'custom' seals through a seal manufacturer in order to
get these new wacky drums to fit. The '68 seal doesn't fit
and the older bus seal has an inner diameter that is too
small to fit onto the bus. 

Any other '68 owners out there having a problem and had a
solution?? What is up with these new drums that don't
fit???
