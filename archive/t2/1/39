There are several things you can do to insure that you get a "tight fit" on 
your exhaust system...
1) Make sure that the ends of the exhaust pipes are flat and even too each 
other...take a long/flat file for metal and file the pipe to head surface.  
File them together at the same time in long even strokes.  This will bring 
them into the same plane surface again as the pipes tend to warp slightly 
with age (sounds like a personal problem, eh?).  File until the surface is 
shiny on bothe pipes which will indicate that they are  now in the same 
plane...don't overfile.
2)  You can make the alignment of the gasket to the head easier by drilling 
out the holes on either side of the pipes of the heat exchangers, say one or 
two drill hole sizes bigger than the existing holes...what this does is 
simply give you more manuvering room when sliding the heat exchangers up into 
the head...this also helps "seat" the gaskets.
3)  Use the VW copper exhaust studs.  They will not freeze on.
