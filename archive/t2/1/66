The reason that aircraft pilots are so concerned about this is that they
have a very VW-like heating system (heat muff around the exhaust pipe) but
with the difference that they don't have the heavy cast section in the
exhaust pipe.  for some reason aircraft manufacturers don't want to carry
50 pounds of heat exchangers around!  :)

The chances of a exhaust leak are much less in a VW than a plane for this
reason.  Still, it pays to be careful!
