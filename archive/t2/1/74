Subject: also under my dash...

Also while I was under my dash I located some soft and hard plubming bits 
and what appears to be a refrigerant thermostat behind the passenger side 
kick panel.  The plubming goes back to the driver side of the engine 
compartment, under the floor.  Since I don't have the original engine and 
there's no vents or control box anywhere to be found, is there a build sheet 
or something that could tell me what these parts might have been for?  The 
plumbing passes through the floor support "bulkheads" very neatly through 
lined holes and looks to be factory (or perhaps Westfalia) installed.
