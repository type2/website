Forget about Muir.  Go with the stock configuration.  I've never had
any problems with the cut-off valves.  Choke always worked when
adjusted.  The only problem I ever had with a choke was on my 67
Beetle where the pin that stopped the choke was underdesigned and
would bend causing the choke to jam.  WV fixed this problem with the
34.  Muir is a confidence builder not a repair manual.  Follow the
Bently.  My gut feeling is that Muir new very little about the Type
IV engine and fuel injection.  The early editions of Muir didn't
include the Type IV because the Type IV didn't exist when it was
written.  My impression is that the Type IV stuff was added by others
to keep the book selling.  But that's just my opinion.  I could be
wrong.
