Wow, T.P. Stephens!  You certainly have a way of ruining the man's
moment.
 I'll try to remember not to post any of my heart-warming moments.

>This doesn't diminish the fact that you get what you pay for. I've seen

many originals still functional at 20 years. 150K virtually enshured.
What
you got is the GEX of the rebuilt starter world.

>Keep those guarantee papers. You will need them every time you replace
it till you finally figure out how to afford to stop having to replace
the starter
every few years.

>The AutoZone units are DESIGNED to be CHEAP, that's why they are. They
don't resolder all the armature wires, they don't replace overworn
commutators, they just cut them down then put in brushes that don't ride

right. That's why they run hot and can't last like the real deal.

>>>I posted a few days ago that I was sick and tired of crawling under
my bus to whack the solenoid in order to start it, decided it was time
for a new starter.  I was all set to pay $100 plus shipping for one from
RMMW when a list member, a couple of listmembers actually, let me know
about re-manufactured starters from AutoZone, $39 with a lifetime
guarantee.  I called my local AutoZone up and they had one in stock.
Twenty four hours later and I have a new starter in my '66, It starts
every time!  So, I don't want to sound cheesy or mushy but, I LOVE YOU
GUYS MAN!! And for any rookies who are trying to decide whether or not
to tackle this job (as I was a day ago) I say go for it, it's a pretty
easy job, except that one bolt in the front of the engine compartment
was a PITA!!!
