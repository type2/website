Subject: Re: [VB] Generator installing

thanks again clara,

I pulled it apart, but that bearing was frozen on.

I had a spare with fan attached, installed it, but it was the wrong size,
about 1/2" to long :(

Bought a rebuilt.

QUESTION?
On the fan end, order of parts?

1. Plates attached with small nuts.
2. Slotted piece, where the woodruff key is.
3. Shims, how many?
4. Slotted locknut.
5. Shims?
6. Final large 36mm nut.

I have looked for diagrams for specifics with no luck so far.

thanks
