Of course I don't hate you for asking - you have to start somewhere.  As
far as I can tell my timing is on, my points are fine (checked with
dwell meter), my valves are fine, etc.  I haven't checked my compression
for quite some time - since I first bought it nearly 2 years ago, and
then, if I remember correctly, everything was tolerable. Plugs, wires,
dizzy are new.  And yes, the carb is on right and the manifolds are on
well.  I haven't checked for vacuum leaks lately, so I should do
that....  It's too damn hot to sit in front of an engine.

Hello Robert,

You might hate me for asking this but have you checked
your timing and points lately? If you have a Bently
Manual and/or a How to Keep your Volkswagen Alive book
by Muir? I would check the basics like
timing,points,valves,compression,air filter before I
would start changing out parts. Also, make sure that
your carb is securely attached to the intake manifolds
and make sure that the manifolds are bolted tightly
against the heads. One other thing, check for vacuum
leaks.  if you have major vacuum leaks it can make
your carb do weird things. I may not have been much
help but that was the only thing I could think of.

Have a great day!
