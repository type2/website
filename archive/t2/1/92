Subject: Re: Fuel Injection Fuel Tank 


Hello folks,
   Recently Todd said
"I plan to install a complete 1978 L-Jetronic fuel injection system into my 
74 loaf......Would it be possible to add a T-fitting to the standard fuel 
port on the bottom of the tank?"

I know someone who has done exactly that, and it works fine.  First install 
a short section of fuel hose to the tank outlet fitting and then put the tee 
into that hose.  Then, one side of the tee feeds the fuel pump and the other 
side accepts the return fuel.  My friend has been running a setup like that 
for about a year now with no apparent problems.  And of course, don't forget 
to put a clamp on the end of every hose.
