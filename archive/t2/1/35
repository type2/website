This doesn't diminish the fact that you get what you pay for. I've seen
many originals still functional at 20 years. 150K virtually enshured. What
you got is the GEX of the rebuilt starter world.

Suspect you'll be addressing that PITA bolt in the front of the engine
compartment again within a few short years. By then, if you work hard, you
can afford one that will save you time/money in the long haul. Keep those
guarantee papers. You will need them every time you replace it till you
finally figure out how to afford to stop having to replace the starter
every few years.

The AutoZone units are DESIGNED to be CHEAP, that's why they are. They
don't resolder all the armature wires, they don't replace overworn
commutators, they just cut them down then put in brushes that don't ride
right. That's why they run hot and can't last like the real deal. 

But you do have to watch out. Some people sell those $39 wannabees for over
a $100. I never got the impression that RMMW would do such things, but I
sure would confim what comes out of the box from them or any supplier to
insure I got what I bargained for. I know I got a set of wheel bearings one
time and paid for German and got a few Chinese in there. Yeah, all at the
same price. That doesn't qualify as a SET in my mind, much less a way to
keep clients.

to whack the solenoid in order to start it, decided it was time for a new
starter.  I was all set to pay $100 plus shipping for one from RMMW when a
list member, a couple of listmembers actually, let me know about
re-manufactured starters from AutoZone, $39 with a lifetime guarantee. And
for any rookies who are trying to decide whether or not to tackle this job
(as I was a day ago) I say go for it, it's a pretty easy job, except that
one bolt in the front of the engine compartment was a PITA!!!
