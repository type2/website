Subject: 009 Distributor

I recently found a 009 Didtributor in a wrecking yard. It looks to be in
good working order with a tight shaft and minimal vertical slack.
I'm currently running a stock vacume distributor on my 2000cc Type IV.
Is there any advantage to using the 009 distributor in a Type IV ?
