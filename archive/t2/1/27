Subject: Taillight Problem

Greetings to the List,

I had planned on installing European taillights in my 70 Bus.  I say, "had 
planned" because when I went to order the bulb housing, lens, and seal 
Wolfsburg West (who had them listed in their catalog) told me they were out 
and they wouldn't be getting any more.  A quick search of the usual places 
turned nada.
So Listerinos, does anyone out there know of a source for European taillight 
bulb housings?  I figure I can scrounge the lenses and seals.  Sure would 
appreciate a lead on this one!

TIA

Mike
