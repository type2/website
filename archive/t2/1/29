You guys in Europe get all the good stuff. Friend of mine just got back
from a few weeks in Europe. He was impressed with many vehicles common
there but not available in the US. Indeed, this is an international list
and questions will come on a variety of differing modles. That's why it is
always good to define year and modle, including whether Euro or US or
Mongolian delivery.

These early VW's are recognized universally as good transport.

Know nothing of stock jet sizes for STOCK Euro specs. You could of course
tear down a known stock 2.0 carb to determine original jet sizes, if it
comes to that. I suppose a good dealer parts man with savy in the early
VW's is as hard to find there as here in the US, but if you can find one,
not only will he be able to identify the proper jets, he just might be able
to order them. Otherwise, it could be just experimenting with the jet
reamers and hope for the best.
