Subject: Re: [T2] Acc pedal probs

Just wanted to say a quick "Thanks" To all who responded about my sticky gas
pedal.  I thought I was gonna have to replace the hinge at the bottom of the
pedal, but Jim kept telling me it was a leverage issue. Finally I decided to
listen. I welded a washer on my s-shaped bar so it wouldn't slip around,
then used his idea of an e-clip to hold stuff on rather than the springs.
It's so nice to have the pedal right up high where its supposed to be and
feel nice and smooth.
Thanks again,
