all short shift kits are the same. the 6 dollar one will work in a bay bus
no problem. it doesn't do much, though.

the only way to get really accurate shifting IMO is to get a berg shifter.
you have to bite a big $ bullet, but you will not believe the difference it
makes to shifting, like night and day. it is important to replace all the
bushings and the linkage at the nose cone before installing the berg, or the
expense may be wasted, as even the berg will not correct problems caused by
worn bushings or other linkage issues.
