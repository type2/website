Subject: looking for T2-microfiches

Hi,

Last year a fellow VW enthousiast here in the
Netherlands (Caspar de Lint) gave me a
microfichereader. I am still very thankfull for this
gift. Now I can finally read the repair manuals that I
had lying around :-)

At 'Le Bug Show' in Spa (Belgium) I bought a few
microfiches of the T2 partscatalogue from a German
guy. Among it is also a US-fiche from 1976.
Unfortunately it doesn't give me all the information I
am looking for (info on newer parts for example). So I
am wondering if anyone here on the list has a newer
microfiche with the US-catalogue on it and might want
to part with it. Please let me know!

Or if someone can tell me where I could possibly get
such a microfiche, that would also be nice.

thanks in advance!
