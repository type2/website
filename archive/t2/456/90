Interesting....as my AVP rebuild(346 miles so far) came with
AMC heads...same brand that aircooled.net offers...may not be the same
exact heads, but same manufacturer.

My AVP rebuild seems to be doing well...no oil leaks after an 85mile run 
at 70-80 mph both ways.

Temperature at the oil filter on both runs was 215 degrees at about
70-80 degrees ambient.

I will be watching to see how AVP handles the return.  


Cheers, dave
