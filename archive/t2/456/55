Should I start my bus and let it warm up (how long?) before changing the
oil and why or why not?

Meg,

This is suggested in all cars because warmer oil flows easier and therefore
you get more out when you drain the sump and it flows faster. Cold oil will
take longer to drain and you won't get it all out.

Usually, just take her out for a drive to warm up to normal operating
temperatures and then come home and open the sump.

This is for all cars, not just the VW.
