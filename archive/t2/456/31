So, I skipped pulling the entire throttle body, opting just to get the 
boot leak fixed for now.  Now that I've had this apart once (and 
reoriented the clamps so they're easier to get to), pulling the 
throttle off will be short work for another day.

Here are updated photos and descriptive text:

While I was in there, I replaced the throttle vacuum hose; the old one 
had a crack on the bottom at the fitting.

I got everything back together, turned the key, cranked it over, and 
after a couple of tries, it started, idled a bit high for a few 
seconds, then sputtered out.  Subsequent attempts to start it resulted 
in not even a sputter.  I gave everything another look over, and 
everything was connected to its proper place.

Anyone have ideas on what the starting problem might be?  It idled fine 
before I pulled the AFM and throttle boot off.

Thanks!
