Hello

thanks for the input,

I wasn't clear enough in my explanation

the goo was everywhere on every fuel-air or exhaust surface, symetrically
distributed about the engine.

I suppose that there very well could have been a

{"blob" of varnish somewhere}

remaining in my tank. I sure thought I had cleaned it out. I worked on it
intermitantly for over a month waiting for parts. I threw away (hazardous
waste recyclying center) about 15 gallons of gasoline  (5 gallons of stinky
stuff drained from tank with siphon) and 10 new gallons used at 1-2 gallons
at a time as soaks and flushes.

so the gelled gas explains the sticky valves in their new fitted honed
guides, but what of the soft swollen new rubber fuel lines (yes they were
really fuel lines and not egr or coolant or ?? lines)

I am for sure pulling the tank before I stick the re--rebuilt engine back
in.

thanks

bye
