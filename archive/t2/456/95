Rob,

He is talking late model T4 engine I believe...not t1.

Otherwise, the foam seal is a maintenance part that wears out just like 
spark plugs and points.  Buy a new one from your favorite vendor and put 
it on.  It will eventually fail also.  I have never seen any alternative.

One vendor has "oem german" $19.95......mine looks great and seals well.

Cheers, dave
