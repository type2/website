Hi,

My old man always used QS in his '65 Mustang. I remember being a kid 
(back when nickels had bees on them :) and we used to go to Western 
Auto and pick up some Champion spark plugs and a couple quarts of QS. 
Remember when you had to open the can with an opener and put a spout 
on it?

Nostalgic mode off!

I use Castrol, the guy who built my motor sways by Penzoil, and 
everybody else has there own favorite. I like the idea of you using 
straight 40 at least in warmer weather and straight 50w when it is 
hotter the hell out.

As for the screen? Clean and reuse as often as possible. Clara used 
to say she would look for old used German ones because the screens 
were tighter. It is a good idea to have the kit with two paper 
gaskets, 6 crush washers for the plate nuts and a new crush for the 
plug. I had a pile of these leftover from EB one year and they are 
great! You may be able to get them at a VW dealer.
