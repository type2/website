Subject: Re:What type of OIL, question?

From what I understand, the VW Motor is SUPPOSED to
use 40 weight oil,
correct? Or is it supposed to use 30 weight oil?

40 weight is correct..
Never,Never inner mix different weights of oil, in
hotter weather run 50w or so.

as to your light, change oil and see..
