there is no "switch" per se, as the switch is integrated in the lever
assembly itself. when the middle lever is moved all the way down, it grounds
a brass contact on lever frame.  there is one wire which comes off this
contact and leads to the relay circuit.

the best way to see all this is to remove the gauge pod and look from the
front. with the lever in the up position you should be able to see the small
brass contact and the wire coming from it, or if the wire is missing, the
spade terminal will still be there.
