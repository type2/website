Hi all...
Don't know if I can post this ad here but I'll try...I have a 1978 
transporter van 7 seater...
morotr runs or I should say it did...good restoration project...all there 
...I'm looking to make an even trade for a VW beetle 1971 or older for a winter 
restoration project...I'd keep the van and restore it myself but I have a 1980 
vanagon that I'm restoring...and the boss [WIFE] said that either the van goes 
or I have to go ...I kind of like it here... so I guess the transporter has 
to go so I can make room for my beetle ...sooooooo if anyone out there can help 
...  drop me a line...I'm located in Broadalbin NY ...thats 35 miles west of 
Albany NY ...3 hours west of  NEW YOUR CITY ...
thanks in advance to all ...
