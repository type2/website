Hey there,

I learned (from someone on the list, can't recall who tho') that the best way
to grease the front beam is like this.

Count the number of pumps it takes to cause the old grease to start come out of
the beam. Once that happens, start counting over again till you reach the
number again. This way you'll insure that all the old grease is out, and the
new is in.
