Not windshield-specific, but has anyone tried the/any of the newer
panel bonding compounds for repairs? I've read of the stuff but only
in factory/perfect use or the usual hype from the manufacturers...
I'm assuming it does work, since some manufacturers are using the
stuff, but I'm curious as to real/backyard success/failure...
