Subject: Bus Short Shift Kit?

I would like to find a short shift for the factory shifter on my bay.
The magazines are full of $6 short shift kits for beetles, but nowhere
can I find one that says it will fit buses. Is there really a difference
in the shifter base between the bus and the beetle? Is the buses'
shifter base larger?

Also in my latest RMM catalog, I noticed that they selling shifter
assemblies for $20. These include the shifter, spring, baseplate, etc.
Are these really in stock? I was under the impression that these kits
were discontinued. I noticed that bus depot had them in their online
catalogue also.
