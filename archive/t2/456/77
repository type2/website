Snoopy,

85 Goes to Earth (ground)
86 Goes to a 12v power source that is "hot" only when the bus is on, 
Ignition Switched on, this is to activate the relay. (Spare spot on 
coil perhaps)
87 Goes to the Pos terminal on your AUX Battery
30 Goes to the Pos terminal on your MAIN Battery

I have sent you a diagram off list.

Steve
