Hey guys,
       
        The foam that surrounds the tin-work in my Bus is completely
shot. I'd like to replace it, but I want it to be something that provides
a little bit more of a seal. Are there any after market replacements for
these? What about something possibly made of rubber? The one that I have
disintegrates with a mere touch of the finger. Is there a better
alternative? I assume a new one won't be this weak, obviously, but how
long do they normally last?

What kind of tape do you guys use to seal up the small holes and such?
Should I use the metal muffler tape?

Thanks!

Todd
