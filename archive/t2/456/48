Subject: 914 or 411?

Thanks everybody for the info on my mystery engine. Now, I have another
question. Did the 914 engine cases have the VW stamp on the bottom of them?
I'm trying to figure what distributor to use on this thing. It has  one
ending with 009. Where would I look to ID the heads? Thanks.

Dan
