Subject: What type of OIL, question?!

Ok, I hate to start a war thread off of this, but I'd like some opinions
(and facts).

When I bought my Bus about.. 5 months ago? I immediately changed the oil.
It was a BRAND NEW rebuilt motor, it had been run maybe 10 miles (after
breaking in the cam). It then sat for 3 years.

So I had it towed home, changed the oil, etc. 

Now, 5 months later and about 300 miles later, I just changed the oil
again.

Originally what I was using was 5W-30 (regular oil). When I dumped it
out, it was nasty, very black, and had a slight reflective property to
it, which tells me that the motor is breaking itself in.

The oil I replaced it with was 10W-40 with the suggestion of some of the
people here.

From what I understand, the VW Motor is SUPPOSED to use 40 weight oil,
correct? Or is it supposed to use 30 weight oil?

The reason I'm asking, is because now whenever I start the Bus, it takes
maybe an additional second or two before the oil light turns off. Is this
because of the temperature viscosity 10W, instead of 5W? 

or is it because I switched from 30 to 40?

For a BUS motor that has less than 1,000 miles, WHAT weight oil do you
suggest I use?

And would it be BAD to mix in a quart of 5W-30 Synthetic with 3 quarts of
10W-40 Synthetic?

Just as an FYI, before when I started the bus, even with the nasty oil,
the oil pressure light would turn off within a second of starting the
Bus.



Thanks,

Todd
