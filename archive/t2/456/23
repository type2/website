Yes, that's right, that is where the switch is. If you
take out the instrument panel then you can see much
easier how it works.

Just pull out the levers, disconnect the speedo-cable
and take the four screws out. It is wise to disconnect
the battery cable before you remove the
instrumentpanel. The metal plates in which the screws
are mounted may drop when you loosen the screws. If
they drop on the wiring you might get a short-circuit.
