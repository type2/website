"Count the number of pumps it takes to cause the old grease to start come
out
of

the beam. Once that happens, start counting over again till you reach the

number again. This way you'll insure that all the old grease is out, and
the

new is in."

When you force the grease out aren't you just blowing out the seals by
pumping too much grease into the beam? I was under the impression that
there were grease seals to keep dirt and water from getting into your
torsion arms. When you pump all this grease through there arent you just
forcing the seals to blow out thereby destroying your moisture/dirt
barrier? Also does the grease in a front end with good seals really go bad
under normal service?
