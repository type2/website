screen, I use them untill I can't get a good seal with
them or they look bad. The Quakerstate oil hummmm... I
used it 40 or so years ago in my race cars , found
that I got a lot of buildup(GUM)in and on everything,
I shifted to Havoline and haven't had any problems
with it, they may have corrected the problem by now.
