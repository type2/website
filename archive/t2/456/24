Thank you so much for your responses so far.

This morning I replaced the front shocks.  I see that I need to replace
the steering dampner, so I'll order one Monday morning.

Found the problem with the overheating wheel.  It was a case of dragging
brake pads.  On both of the springs holding them onto the slave each one
had a busted off end.  I'll replace them tomorrow.  And try to adjust my
brakes again.

Found the missing grease zerk.  It took a monumental effort to pump grease
into it and I never did get any to push out anywhere.  I'll try again
before I take her off the jack stands.

Took the cowling off of the stearing mechanisms.  Don't really know what
to do about all of that stuff.  I'm still studying it.  I see that the bar
that runs from the stearing box to the tie rods seems to be slipping
around on it's stern side.  I see a set-type screw on the thing but it's
frozen in place.  Super Blaster is working on that now.

Got to pick up the rear shocks and get them in tonight.  I love working on
this thing.

Jennifer
