If you will go to:
http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring/bus-76.jpg
and look at current tracks 48-56 you will see the wiring diagram for the
turn signals.  There is a connector labelled T3a on this diagram where
current from the turn signal switch meets current from the emergency
flasher switch.  It can be located by following the black/white and
black/gree wires emerging from your steering column.  I would unplug and
replug that connector.  I understand that you have a 1977 and that the
wiring diagram for that year is slightly different
(http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring/bus-77-78.jpg)
but the T3a connector is still there and I suspect it.

There ought to be a black plastic sheath on the cable at that point.  Some
cables do not have the sheath or it may have slid back into the tube.  You
may wish to preemptively replace the cable with one that has the sheath
and save the old one for emergency repairs.  I assure you that you will
need it eventually.

If the sump is merely "quite warm" then you are doing well.  The ideal
temperature for oil is 100-105 with a high limit of 120 (210-220 and 250
in fahrenheit).  The case temperature will be substantially lower than the
oil temperature but if your oil is overheated then the case will burn your
hand.

                             OOK!
