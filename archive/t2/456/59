Subject: Re: [T2] oil change question

My procedure:

Adjust valves.
Set timing.
Start and drive at least ten miles to stabilize oil temps.
Slide a drain pan under it and drain oil and change filter.

Why hot?

The hot, recently circulated oil has a tendency to gather more of the 
particulate matter than oil that has been sitting over night 
percipitating those selfsame particles out. Hence, (AFAIK) ALL 
manufacturers recommend that oil be changed hot.
