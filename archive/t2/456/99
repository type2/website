Subject: Re: My continuing vacuum saga

Oh, where will this end (at the beginning ? ? ?)

If there was a leak at the oil breather gasket (Hm... could a leaky oil 
breather gasket cause a . . .), would that be a vacuum leak or an exhaust 
leak??

If (1) vacuum = negative (relative) pressure; exhaust leak = positive 
(relative) pressure, then what is the nature of a leak at the oil breather 
gasket .  And a leak further (sorry, furthur) down the oil breather tube...

If (2) a leak occurs prior to the throttle, when the vacuum measured at the 
throttle body is 'negligible', is it a vacuum leak, or only additional air 
that has not been accommodated for at the AFM, like the Aux Air 'thing'


(3) if a leak at the EGR valve:air mixture box (plenum) is a vacuum leak, 
what is the nature of a feed back of the exhaust gases thru the EGR valve at 
normal RPM??

(4) a leak at the exhaust elbow pigtail IS an exhaust leak, right??
