Phil,

I had exactly the same experience with QS and some others like it.
On one engine that I rebuilt, I used havoline and when I went to check the 
valves some few miles later, the valve train was actually *cleaner* than 
when I put it back together...I was amazed...been using Havoline ever 
since(30+ years).

Cheers, dave
