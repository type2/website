Subject: Re: bonding as panel "welding"

Talk to Tim Hayden, who makes "Franken-busses" using a combination of
welding, riveting, and epoxy bonding to make his creations.  If you
showed up to NJ's Westies in the Woods, LIMBO on Long Island, or to
Woodstock, you'd have seen his splitty/Toyota van hybrids.  I'm sure he
will be at the Blue Rocks campout (Oct 11).

in factory/perfect use or the usual hype from the manufacturers...
 I'm assuming it does work, since some manufacturers are using the
 stuff, but I'm curious as to real/backyard success/failure...
