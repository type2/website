I think I know this weird little item. But I am not
sure what it is used for. I have seen it on European
1600cc engines fitted in late 70ties baywindows. It
looks as if you can connect a diagnosis tool to the
rubberplug. The wire ends at the spot where the engine
connects with the transmission. I think may be this
thing can be used to measure something on the
flywheel.

Perhaps it's usefull when you need to know the amount
of revs it makes per minute? Although I would say it
might be easier to measure it on the ignition.
