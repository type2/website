I must have missed the beginning of this one, but I can guess what it's
about :)

Five or six years ago I was on a road trip in S. Texas in my 73 Westy.
About half way through the trip I started leaking oil pretty bad (turned out
to be the main seal).  It was doing a real nice job of coating my back hatch
and window with a fine oily mist, but because of where it was leaking from
it wasn't smoking.

Anyway, I was cruising along about 70mph when a late model Corvette came up
behind me.  There was plenty of wide-open passing zones, but he opted to
stay VERY close behind me.  I even backed off the gas a little on a couple
of clear straight aways to encourage him to go around, but to no avail.  I
did notice him using his windshield wipers quite a bit.  I wonder if he ever
figured out it wasn't raining and the reason he was getting a smeared
windshield was because he was getting an external LUBE JOB!
