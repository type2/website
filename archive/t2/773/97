Subject: You know it's time to quit for the night when...

You find yourself about to do something really stupid and that will do
much more harm than good to the bus.

Example: I found myself trying to figure out just how bad of an angle
I would get if I tried to drill out the intake stud holes with the
head still on the engine and in the bus.

Time to quit for the night. I'm taking a hiatus from the bus. Sat
morning it gets its head pulled. Sigh.
