Hi Kevin,

The function of the fibreglass isn't as a heat shield, it's used as  
an air duct. It'll work as well as steel does for that. function. As  
for how well it would hold up; that would depend on engine vibration  
and how well it's fastened down to the engine. One thing I can say  
for sure: it certainly isn't going to rust.


Happy trails,
