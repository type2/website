I'm making this same change myself. Here's some advice from John Connolly 
from the type2 archive:


"they come with the wrong size jets out of the box. You can solve this by
going to 60/140. Changing to F5 emulsions also helps (the F78s in them have
a massive flat spot at 2-2500).

Of course, set fuel pressure and float level before jetting.

My weber ict 34s were secondhand and came with 60/140 idle/main jets 
installed. I haven't checked the  emulsion tube, fuel pressure and float 
level yet but I DO have a big flat spot when the revs get up!

I'm not sure what distributor you have. Mine is a single vacuum, dual 
advance style and seems to work ok with the vacuum from one of the carbs 
(the other is blocked off).

Cheers,

Martin.
