Richard had a few questions/suggestions:

We were expecting--and got--some cold weather in northern Maine.  With 
temps in the low 40s, I worried that 15-50 might be too thick.  My VDO 
OP gauge showed 60+psi on cool mornings with 20-50 (non-synthetic).  I 
was getting nervous about blowing seals.  Maybe it's just the 
experimenter in me, why not 12.5w40 :-)  I've been very pleased with 
the blend's pressures.

It seems like a good system.  If we ever have a bus as a "keeper," 
we'll definitely swap.  I was surprised at their condition, though, 
because the Lucas points in my Land Rover were usually just beginning 
to pit every second oil change (~6000mi)

What is accepted practice for adjusting to different elevations?  We 
came from 3500 feet in Missoula, through the mountains, and now are at 
sea level in Maryland.  I'm sure we're a little lean and don't want to 
pay someone with a sniffer to tell me that.  What is the AFM mixture 
screw really doing?  Maybe I'll tinker and run up and down the road, 
listening and watching the CHT gauge.
