Subject: Can anyone recommend a body shop in Seattle

Eastside if possible, but I don't mind driving 20 or 30 miles if someone
has a good recommendation.



A couple weeks ago I got rear-ended by a guy after we had both been
stopped waiting for construction for about 5 minutes.  Apparently he
fell asleep, foot came off the brake and when he woke up slammed on the
accelerator.



I have a 77 Westy that is in very good condition so I was hoping to find
someone reputable who has experience with buses.



Thanks,

Glen
