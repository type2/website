This adapter was made for me by a kind listmember:

http://homepage.mac.com/ratwell/.Pictures/Tools2/48-LeakdownAdapter.jpg

Figuring the exact height for the tool is tricky because #3 is so close to the firewall (don't make it too long) and #2 is very deep and not quite lined up with the hole in the tin (too short, can't easy thread it; too long, can't twist).

I don't use it for compression testing because it lacks the shutoff valve that the compressor tester hoses have.
