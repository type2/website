Subject: Stud sizes?

I haven't seen anything yet spec'ing the thread size and pitch for the
intake studs on my 1700. Are they the same as the exh studs?

I want to make sure I have the right helicoil kit for my stripped
intakes. (Yes, several. All the install/remove/install/remove cycles I
guess.)

Thanks!
