Subject: Wanted/Needed: Awning

Hello everyone, I am new to this list, but many of you who are on the
WetWesty list will probably recognize/know me. I am going on a month, or
two, possibly three month long trip in my riviera starting mid-September. I
will be traveling from Portland, OR to union Oregon to attend the WW
Re-Union, then either north to the Olympic national forest, or south into
California, Arizona, New Mexico, and maybe Mexico. I desperately want to
purchase an awning for my bus, and have looked at the awning options that
are currently out there. I do not care if it is a brand new awning, and
would prefer not to pay the new price.
 Does anyone have an awning they are willing to part with? I would prefer
the bolt-on type like the Shady-boy or fiamma. Please keep in consideration
that i have a Riviera, and when down the top is very close to the rain
gutter. I would appreciate any leads on used awnings, if I cant find one I
will be forced to purchase one new....and break into my trip funds ACK!!!
 Thanks in Advance!
Happy bussing,
