Hi Jen,

Remove the entire system from your bus. It didn't take me but a few
minutes to pull the entire thing off and plug the ports.

 smog pump was disconnected when I bought this

 increased if I put a belt on the pulleys and ran
 the smog pump....

Or, would it be better to plug all of the vaccum
 lines that lead to the pump?
