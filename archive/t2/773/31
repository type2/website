I got a battery clamp from my FLAPS - it has 2 long
rods with hooks at the lower ends, and a piece of
angled metal that has a hole at each end and spans the
2 rods. Wing nuts tighten the angle piece down onto
the battery. The seam inside the battery tray already
had a hole in it, and the other side hooks into an eye
bolt that sticks up from the bottom of the battery
tray.  The eye bolt was already in my westy, but i'm
guessing it wasn't original...
