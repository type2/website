Not that the 78 westy that I left North Carolina heading to  New  York in for 
the GrassRoots festival made it (long story to be told soon) But  there were 
at least a dozen bays, mostly westys and a 67 pop top and 1 21 window  there. 
Now upstate NY doesn't seem to be the place to find parts when you need  them 
put I was told of a lot of people that still had buses. I think you will  
always see them at hippie gatherings, you just might have to look a little  
harder. And know the net time I'm taking MY 67westy.
