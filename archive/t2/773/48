Subject: 73 bus smog pump

hi,

smog pump was disconnected when I bought this
bus (belt not going from pulley on crank to pulley
on pump)...  I got a closer look at the engine today,
and I am wondering if performance would be
increased if I put a belt on the pulleys and ran
the smog pump....

Or, would it be better to plug all of the vaccum
lines that lead to the pump?

Jen
