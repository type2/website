I took the problem carb out of the vehicle, posted
pics at:

The solenoid that stripped out the hole in the
carb won't reach anything in the carb...  There is
nothing for the actuator to push against.  Is
there supposed to be something that gets
put into the passage before the solenoid screws
into it?

ANyone have complete parts breakdown for
solex carb?
