Subject: Valve Adjustment Redux

I'm redoing my valve adjustment ('76 Westy, 2.0L, non-cali), I think I 
may have done something wrong the first time.  But I just realized an 
assumption I made the first time may be incorrect...

Muir's book says "Push down with your left thumb on the bump on the 
lower end of the No. 1 exhaust rocker arm to tighten up the valve 
train".  Then it shows a picture of a guy with four hands adjusting the 
valves...

Now, some of my valves seem to behave differently than others.  There 
are two behaviors as I cycle around the cylinders:

1.  I push on the rocker lightly with my thumb, it "clicks" open just a 
little bit, and stays open when I remove my thumb.  Then I can measure 
with the feeler at my leisure.

2.  I push on the rocker really hard, and it "springs" open, quite a 
lot.  When I let go, it springs shut again.  Thus, I have to maintain 
pressure on the rocker with one hand, and use the feeler with the other.

For example, when I have the engine lined up for cylinder #2, the intake 
valve "springs", while the exhaust valve "clicks".

The Bentley manual doesn't even mention pushing on the rocker.  Which 
should it be, should the valve stay open or spring shut?  I'm afraid I'm 
pushing the rocker too hard and thus tightening down the screw too much.

Thanks,
-Charles
