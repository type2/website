Subject: Re: [T2] 73 bus carb cutoff solenoid?

Don't think it has dual setups in it, but for general reading and

Solex tuning manual at the obsolete air cooled documentation project.

A good resource overall, also home to Without Guesswork for earlier bays, and
the split bus exploded parts lists (with part numbers, God bless them!)
