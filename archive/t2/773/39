Most compression testers have a long rubber hose with
a screw-on end that stays tight. On the end will be an
0-ring to seal against the head. Hand tight is fine.
This Harbor Freight set-up works very well for the
home mechanic:

The only drawback is the way the long hose is stored.
The hose needs to be laid out in the sun before you
use it to get the bend out of it. With the bend, you
have a tough time starting the threads on #2 and #4.

 I have had a lot of questions today..... I have a
 compression gauge at home
 that I tried out the other day. My current bus seems
 to run fine, but I
 thought since I was changing the plugs that I would
 check it out. I was not
 able to get the threaded piece tight. The sheet
 metal blocked me from getting
 a wrench in there and the tube on the end of the
 tool would not allow any
 socket. I was getting 50 psi on some and 0 on the
 other, so I am guessing that
 I am not getting it tight. I am trying to tighten it
 my just twisting the
 rubber hose and turning. Not working.
 
 Any adapters or tricks to get these to work? People
 always talk about getting
 compression readings, so their has to be an easier
 way...
 
 This is on a Type 4 engine.
