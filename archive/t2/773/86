I use thick paper gaskets for this joint.  Never seen one with asphalt
cooking out of it!

Metal gaskets work too.  I put a _very_ light smear of hylomar (_not_
RTV!) on either type of gasket to seal up any scratches.

The other danger is that you (or the next owner) won't remember why some
bolts have multiple washers.  This happened to me on the rear mount bolts
and I was lucky that I noticed that the bolt had bottomed out before the
head made contact.  I now shorten any bolt that bottoms out so that the
proper number of washers will work.  It's helpful to get a few paint
pencils of various colors so you can color-code which bolt goes with which
hole.
