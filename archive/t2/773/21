Dave,

The price I got was the complete kit price. Redline/Weber sells all the
individual pieces for performance tuners, turbo guys and dragsters so it can
get confusing.

There are three kits offered.

1. Complete FI w/o distributor (around $1900)
2. complete EFI w/ distributor (around $2214)
3. Complete EFI w/ distributor and harmonic balancer timing pickup. (for
computer controlling advance) (around $2400)

My kit was #2 for $2214. You do need a specific model of MSD ignition, but
you can use others. The only exception is the Comp-U-Fire, which I lament
because it has worked so well on my other DC. I bought the distributor from
Redline/Weber because their price is market.

Mostly I bought their kit because I don't have a lot of time to go rooting
through the junkyard to find a 19.2mm fuel injector from a 93 Ford
Extinction and a fuel rail and computer from a 82 Oldsmobuick... :) I just
like things to work the first time.

The main sales rep is really a stand up guy. They accidentally back-ordered
my distributor and he called me right away. When it came in they FedExed it
next day air at no cost. He has also called me twice to see if I have any
questions on installation. His name is Tom and his number is 800-733-2277 x
7345. Tell him I referred you.

I am pretty sure that the EFI system will work better than your 48 IDAs
tuning and Fuel Economy wise, but you would probably have to order some
larger injectors to match that amount of Fuel/Air. I mean DAMN, a 5.7 0-60
time? That is insane and in Corvette territory!

The knock detector input may be built into the Redline/Weber computer. I
think I remember reading something about it.

You should come up and check out my system before it is all bolted together.
You are in Highlands Ranch right?

Give me a hollar-back,
