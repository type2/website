Subject: Re: [T2] Oil temp sender install - lessons learnt

Bizarrely coincidental post...I had those instructions printed out and took it to my local VW machine shop to have them drill it. They did exactly the same thing! Fortunately, I had the PREVIOUS plate, which I had drilled myself, but had "wallowed out" the hole a little, causing a leak (when installed) which was more than I could accept.
 
So yesterday, after discovering the machine shop error, I reworked the one I drilled, smearing a minimal amount of gasket sealer around the base of the sender. This should do the trick, and I am about to find out, as soon as I button it up, fill with 20w-50 Castrol and fire it up (crossed fingers)!
