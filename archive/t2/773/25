That sounds like you have hydraulic lifters and the lifter is soft. The
valve spring cannot be compressed by hand so I can only assume it's the
spring inside the lifter.

I've heard this noise when the push rod hasn't properly seated in the cup of
the rocker arm and move when you rotate the engine.

You should push on the knurled part of the rocker arm with a screwdriver and
there should be no movement no matter what kind of lifters you have.
