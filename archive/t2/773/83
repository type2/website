Yes.  Just let the engine turn (in neutral) while tightening the nut.  The
motion lets the belt "ride up" the pulley while the pulley halves come
together.  You can feel when the halves come together tightly if the belt
is sufficiently loose.  At this point, you can use a screwdriver to hold
the pulley for final tightening.

At this point, you can wiggle the belt to test for tightness.  1/2 to 3/4
inch of play is what I run.

As you can see, it is best to start with too many shims between the pulley
halves and to remove them one at a time until the play is correct.
too loose is better than too tight.  You'll probably need to
re-adjust a new belt after 100 miles or so.
