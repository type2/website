Subject: Replacing steering coupler: pull the column housing?

Hi Folks,

I'm in the middle of, or actually just starting, the process of 
replacing the rubber steering coupler in my '70 bus.  In other words, 
I've got one of the cotter pins out and am now searching for a second 
13mm wrench to crank on the nuts.  It looks as if there won't be enough 
clearance to pull the bolts out unless I remove the base housing on the 
steering column.  Since the two bolts that hold that housing are rusted 
tight, I'm looking to see if anyone has figured out a way to replace 
the coupler without lifting the top.  Grabbing at straws here.  Any 
thoughts?

Best,
Jerry
