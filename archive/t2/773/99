Dawn can be slow at times, but you will get your order....eventually, and it
will be exactly what you ordered.

Hi all,
 Should I be
worried about not getting my order? Has anyone else had the same
experience with PLF? Does anyone know what could be the reason for no
response from PLF?
Thanks
Kevin
