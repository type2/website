Subject: voltage regulator on 71

hi,
How does the voltage regulator
in the VW bus work?

alternator has 3 connections.  DF,
D+, and ground....

D+ is voltage output.
DF = "field" input.  This is voltage to the
coil in the alternator that creates magnet
required for electricity generation
ground-- this is the negative side of both
D+ and DF

the voltage regulator has 5 connections,

1)DF,                                 field voltage output
2)D+                                  +V input (from alternator)
3)ground                              negative side of everything
4)battery +                          OUTPUT (regulated) to battery, also INPUT
                                          (for DF field voltage)
5)Generator warning signal   this is the same as D+.  The output of the
                                           alternator.  Used to
activate light on dash.

Question:
How does the regulator regulate?

by varying strength of DF, which
would change the input to the field
coil, and vary its' output voltage?

I was hoping to use it as the regulator
on a solar charging system, IE connect
a solar panel (20 volts output) into
D+ and ground on the regulator.  the
regulator convert 20v into 12, and charge
the battery with this voltage.

Any insight into the charging system on
the VW?

if using the regulator isn't going to work,
any ideas on a 20vDC to 12Vdc regulator
for cheap?


thanks,
Jen
