Subject: Phenolic blocks for intake gaskets?

Eh?

I just called Painter's Grinding and they have both the normal
aluminum gaskets for my intakes, as well as phenolic blocks.

The leaky head I have in my garage also has this spacer thing on the intake.

What are they and what purpose do they serve? My 73 has no such things on it.
