Jenny,

You don't say how large a panel you intend to connect. Smaller panels 
(<10w) can be directly connected to a car battery without requiring a 
regulator as the current they produce is small compared to the battery 
capacity. However, a small panel like this is only good for keeping the 
battery topped up between drives rather than running appliances. That said, 
this setup can keep a couple of fluorescent lights going for a few days 
without leaving you stranded, if your requirements are modest.

If you are looking at a larger panel you will need a regulator and probably 
a second battery! The cheapest way to get a regulator is to make your own 
either from parts or a kit. Pretty easy if you know your way around a 
soldering iron.

The only other thing to bear in mind is if you get a second battery, sealed 
lead acid batteries must be charged at a lower voltage than wet cell lead 
acid batteries (eg. standard car batteries). I can't recall the exact 
values off the top of my head.

Cheers,

Martin.
