Subject: SVDA install troubles

Hi Im installing an aircooled.net svda dizzys in my 1976 2.0 type four and
there is no way I can get the distributer to align itself in the same manner
as the old one.In trying to  get the notch on the edge of the distributer to
point in roughly the same place as the old one I find that the vacuum can
willhit the engine tin.With it installed so the vacuum can doesnt hit
anything the notch is pointing in pretty much the opposite direction.Also
the condensor wire supplied with the kit is much to short on a type four
application so I just installed a new condensor that I had.I left the
allready installed points in there.Is this Ok?How do I deal with the
position of the notch?Thanks
