Subject: RE: [T2] One more question

The one I have has the O Ring, and I know it is getting close to sealing but I
do not get good readings. I get 50 psi on #1 and #3 and 0 on the other two.
The angle and depth of the other two do not allow me to get my fingers on the
metal part of the adapter at all. The other two allow me to just barely get a
hold of it. Maybe it is the gauge and not the adapter at all? I will try to
test it this week and see if what I get. The Harbor Freight model is cheap
enough to replace mine if the gauge is bad.

Thanks for the ideas from everyone.
Corbett
