My experience is with an alternator system ('78),
where there are only 3 conenctions to the regulator
(D+, DF and D-), with the "battery" conenction coming
straight off the alternator itself, so this may or may
not apply to your setup -

Basically, in my system, yes, the regulator varies the
DF voltage in order to vary the magnetic field in the
alternator, and therefore vary the output voltage
generated.  I know this works, because I have taken
advantage of it by including a diode in the DF
circuit, thus "tricking" my alternator into generating
an extra 0.6V. This is to counteract the 0.6V drop I
get across my RV-style battery splitter, which also
contains diodes.

However - I'm not sure how you're proposing to drop
the voltage from 20 to 12? if you connect 20V to the
D+ and ground terminals, then where do you get 12V
from? AFAIK, the DF voltage is not necessarily
regulated to 12V - it's used to drive the magnetic
field, it's not the output voltage as such (although I
may be wrong). Another thing to watch is overheating -
my regulator gets pretty hot in normal use, so using a
20V input might be too much for the poor thing :-)
