Subject: Re: [T2] SVDA install troubles

Often the different distributors are indexed differently. Here's how I
dealt with the issue:

With the orig distributor in, set to #1 TDC. Rotor should point to notch.
Pull dist.
Install new dist so can clears. Does rotor now point to the new notch?
If so, you will have to rotate the wires around on the cap. Going from
an 009 to a stock dist on my 73 I had to rotate one postition.
If the rotor does NOT point to the notch you need to call ACN.
