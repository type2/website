Subject: pop top hole in 73 bus

Is the location and size od the hole cut in the roof for a pop top bus
different in the 73 than in the 78? I know the roof pops up in a different
direction, but is the hole the same? I am more interested in the distance from
the top of the windshield to the start of the hole. I have a 73.

Thanks,
Corbett
