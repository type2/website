Hi John,

Will the DTM fit around the rear engine hanger on a bus?

I saw the DTM in action (running on a stand) at last year's June  
jitterbug. It was being set up for a porsche speedster.  It looks  
like a very well thought out product, but I don't know that you could  
pot one in a bus, as there may not be room for the rear hanger. But  
I'd love to be wrong about that.

Happy trails,
