There is a write-up on how to convert to run ethanol more efficiently
in Mother Earth News a few months back. I believe you have to supply a
bit more fuel (change your jet), mess with the timing a tad, but your
MPG goes down as it is not as efficient a fuel. Head down to the
library and dig back a few months. If I find it laying around my house
I will post what they recommend.
