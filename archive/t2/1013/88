Subject: Re: [T2] Cork for insulation?

Hi Ron,

Back in 2005 I refurbished a riviera camper that had a wooden  
subfloor and a leaky vent-wing window. The subfloor on the driver's  
side had turned completely to compost.

I wouldn't recommend wooden insulation.

Happy Trails,

I just had a wild thought. How about using cork wall/floor tiles for  
both
sound and heat insulation? It is lighter than dynamat so it won't affect
your gas mileage as much,  eco-friendly, durable, absorbs sound,   
provides
heat insulation, and can probably be found at a reasonable price  
especially
if you don't mind seconds. You would probably have to do do a thin  
subfloor
to avoid the floor ridges though. Thoughts?
