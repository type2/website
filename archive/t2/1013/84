Jules,

<That's a type 4 engine in a 68? How'd you do that, besides moving the
cooling system from a type 1 engine - what else is/was involved?>

Yeah, 2L w/ hyd lifters.  I did a "cali" conversion, invented by Joe Cali.
He sells a guide to get you going, giving all the right ideas on how to do
it and what is involved.  There was lots of sheet metal fabrication, and
figuring out on the way.  I made a generator stand, oil dipstick tube, trans
mounts, engine mount bar, and lots of sheet metal work... (home made
tailpipe, altered a pair of junked (free) heat exchangers to accommodate
stock muffler, thermostat mount & rod, the list goes on.)

< Do you have an oil cooler under that shroud?>

Yeah, there is a stock type 4 oil cooler under there (more sheet metal work
in the front of the shroud.) I run all day packed and loaded at about 200 -
220 F in the summer.  With a strong head wind, maybe 230, but that only
bothered me on one day.  The oil lines are a worry point, but I don't think
you can  do any better than what is on there, unless you hard plumb it in
there.  They have never showed me any issues.

< Any challenges mating the engine to a early model transmission or did you
swap a later transmission in there?>

I put the trans out of my '72 in there.  I like the idea of being geared a
little lower, as we pull a little trailer when we camp.  There would have
been issues with the 68-71style trans, as it is used to mating to a bug
style engine, and I didn't want to bastardize anything.  I did have to swap
the front trans mount from the 68 trans to the 72 trans, but it was a direct
bolt up.  The big challenge was the trans mounts, as there are none in the
68.  I just mimicked the 72 -79 set up as best I could.  It has worked out
great.  The only body mods I made were 2 holes in each frame rail for the
trans mounts.  I didn't want to hack up the bus to do this either.

<Any heat/cooling problems?>

None to report so far.  Head temps run around 250 - 300, and oil we
discussed earlier.  It has been on and running for two summers now, and we
have two "big" trips and several "few hour" trips on it, and no complaints
whatsoever.  I'm in western PA, and we went to the tip of cape cod this
summer, and to assateague island last year.  It has been a pleasure to
drive, after that worn out 1600 DP that was on there.

It was a project that I didn't think I could do, but, I did.  And it is a
lot easier to work on the engine, in my opinion, with the upright cooling,
than the stock pancake layout.  

Good luck!

Mark,

That's a type 4 engine in a 68? How'd you do that, besides moving the
cooling system from a type 1 engine - what else is/was involved? Do
you have an oil cooler under that shroud? Any challenges mating the
engine to a early model transmission or did you swap a later
transmission in there? Any heat/cooling problems?
