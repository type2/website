Subject: inside doors 7 quiet car paint

Well I just finished the 3rd coat of quiet car paint inside my door panels.
I'll post some pics tonight on thesamba.

The stuff is pretty goopy and thick. It is like a pudding. It applies pretty
easily with a regular bristle brush, and cleans up real easy with water. I
taped off areas on the door, so that it will look a little cleaner when I
remove the tape. There are obvious brush marks in this stuff using a brush.
I figure it is inside the door, so it will never be seen, and the extra
ridges should help break up sound waves, right? I think the dynamat type
peel and stick adhesive may be easier, as you basically cut, peel and stck.
Total time pretty fast. I didn't want to put too much of this stuff on the
doors, I kept it away from seams as I didn't know if it could cause problems
there.

I had a question about a couple things-
1. I  notice the seam at the bottom inside of the door-it looks like wate
can get easily trapped here. Is there any reason not to put some sort of
seam sealer here, or to just caulk it with silicone caulk. As long as all
drain holes are kept clear, I would think this is the best way to save the
bottom of the door.
2. There are bent pieces of metal, that I assume add rigidity to the door
panel. On one of my doors these are not attached to the outside door skin.
They are supposed to be attached, right? I was just going to try to reattach
with some sort of high strength adhesive. 
3. The quiet car paint supposedly doesn't' achieve top performance until one
week after application, no idea why that should be, anyone else know?

Thanks for listening.
