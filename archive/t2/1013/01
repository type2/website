 I have to clean up the sloppy shifting in my bus.
I was wondering what opinions there are out there about aftermarket
shifters?
Just wondering if they are worth the money.

99 out of 100, the slop is in the tube. Putting in an aftermarket? or
another bus shifter still leaves you with slop.

Have you replaced those bushings?  15 or 19 in the front and 31 in the back
[the whole assembly]. 13 and 16 in the middle are normally OK and the ones
available do not fit.

On that 31 assembly, the new ones need to be 'fixed' first because they are
cheaply made. It is pressed together and they loosen up. Where 24 and the
round hub go together [17 screws into the round hub], you need to add a
couple of tack welds where it is rolled over. Otherwise it loosens up and
you get slop.
