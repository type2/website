It is. Even the design of the horn at the end of the air filter is  
designed to minimize the noise level.

About 4 years ago I gave someone a ride in my bus who had been riding  
in VWs for decades but had never been in a camper it seemed because  
he couldn't believe how quiet it was. He would not believe me that I  
had done nothing extra to reduce the natural sound level.

Anyone wanting a quiet bus to drive, should start with a 74-79 Westy  
with Type 4 engine, stock exhaust and hydraulic lifters.

I personally find that highway driving at 70mph for long durations  
requires me to use a pair of earplugs.
