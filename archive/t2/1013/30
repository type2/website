Subject: Intake manifold "gaskets"

Hi, I missed a thread on this item awhile back, and now need to know.  I have
2 gaskets, that look like opera glasses, that I think go between the head and
the intake manifolds.  My engine is a 1800cc, and  think my new heads are for
a later model, because they have 4 bolt holes, and the originals have only
three, therefore, I assume I should trade these 3 holers for some 4 holers to
make everything right, since they surely must be used?  Thanks
Sid
