Subject: Soundproofing and draftproofing

Four or five  years ago I used roofing patch products to reduce noise in a double cab. I used a 12" rubber roof patching strip with aluminum backing called Cool-Patch as a cheap Dynamat substitute. Also used a Henry water soluble roof patch goop brushed into the interior surfaces as a rust preventative and vibration absorber. It worked pretty well, quieting a '63 DC to the noise level of Karl's '77 Westy as I remember. Doors shut with a solid clunk. 

I'm glad there's some competition to bring the Dynamat technology down to bus driver budgets. It's physics, not magic. The bug and Ghia used thick tar paper to reduce noise. Should work today. I recommend the clay, water based Henry roof patch from a hardware store, no petroleum outgassing and easy clean up.
