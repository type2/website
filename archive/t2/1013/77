Subject: R profile steel key blanks

Bus Depot has them again:

These are OEM steel blanks with the same look and feel of the originals:

For those in Europe that have noticed that VW offers their own key  
cutting by code service, I have not been able to get them to cut a  
key that actually works in a lock. They are unable to stamp the code  
into the key either.
