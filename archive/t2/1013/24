You can get the replacement bushings and just replace them without pulling the trans.  When I first bought my bus those bushings were gone, so shifting was an adventure.  I check that connection every time I go under my bus now.  Paranoia, maybe, but I'd rather not lose the bolt that goes through there.
I put a SCAT short-throw shifter in shortly after replacing the bushings.  The DPO that sold me the bus bent the original shifter trying to change gears.  Funny what people will do instead of looking for the problem.  Love the short-throw.  Not so thrilled about the chrome, but the reverse lockout is nice.  Cost $100.
