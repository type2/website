Subject: Re: play in rear wheels

An FYI Id like to throw out:

I did the rear brakes on the 71 this summer. When I attempted to break
loose the axle nut I broke my = drive flex shaft, it was Craftsman so all
that cost me was a trip across town.  I then went to the local ranch supply
and bought a > drive 1 13/16 socket and > drive 20 long sliding T
handle.  I use an 8 foot piece of black pipe as a cheater, popped that nut
w/o too much complaint!

Buying the Pro-Craft brand at the ranch supply, approx $25 for both, was
cheaper than just the socket at sears.  The quality is sufficient for
something I might use once every year or two.

Nice friday posts guys. Your play in the rear wheels is most likely bad
wheel bearings, but I'm sure once the gang gets done posting "rear wheel
play" shots someone with more info will chime in... Bearings are not too bad
to do once you get the axle nuts off. Make sure to replace the races too.
