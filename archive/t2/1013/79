Subject: Cork for insulation?

As I reported a couple of weeks ago, I have a bunch of cork left over from
doing my house.  It's in approx. 2' x 1' sections and is approx 1/8th +"
thick.  It's coated with 3 coats of varathane insulation on one side.  I
plan to put 1/8th" closed cell foam on the floor, with 1/4" plywood on top
of that and then glue the cork on top of the plywood with contact cement.
That's how I put it down on the floor of my house (using contact cement).
You just have to be very very sure of your placement before you let the cork
touch the floor because once it touches, it's there!

For sound deadening, the rubber contact cement as a method of attaching it
to the metal would preclude any encroachment by moisture..
