Not sure which windows or which seals you are talking about. But I hear " 
temporary solutions" as a property of the reply. I'm going to make a few 
assumptions: Perhaps they are crank-up side windows in the doors and the 
seals are the rubber scraper strips that run horizontally at the bottom of 
the window opening. On one of my cars, the scraper seals were old and hard 
and cracked, and I used painter's blue masking tape applied horizontally at 
the junction of the scraper rubber and the glass. It kept the water from 
running down inside the door and lasted for months. Be sure to apply it to 
clean dry surfaces. Using another assumption, If you are talking about the 
fixed glass in the rear side windows, then maybe the tape would deflect the 
water until you get a more permanent solution. If you are talking about 
some other type of window, maybe the tape idea will offer an temporary 
alternative to caulking.
