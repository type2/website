Subject: Re: [T2] play in rear wheels

There is one other cause of play in the rear wheels I haven't seen
mentioned. On a very high miles '69 Deluxe I had. the holes where the
bearings sit had ever so slightly wallowed out. When I replaced the
bearings, the play was the same. I went back in and added strips of
feeler guage material to take up the slop. That bus went to 430,000
miles before I sold it: original transmission, second front end (shock
tower rusted off) and the original bottom end went 290,000 with two
valve jobs. Timo
