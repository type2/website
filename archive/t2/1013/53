Subject: Is winter driving in an air tight bus possible?

Hey guys,

My 69 Westy is a little breezy his time of year.? When I hit about 45mph my fiberglass roof lifts just ever so slightly allowing the nice chilly outside to rush right in.? The rubber seal on the outside is in great condition (I replaced it about 2 years ago).? I have tried to get a tighter seal but nothing seems to help.? I thought about duct taping it shut but that a little extreme! 

I will admit that canvas tent in missing (dont ask I think the previous wanted to make a sunroof??) I am planning to replace it sometime this winter, but will it make that much of a difference.? Or do I need make other improvements to prevent from get frostbite this winter?

Any thoughts,

Brian
