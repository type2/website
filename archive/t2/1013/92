Subject: Front Door Window Seal Install?

Howdy,

I'm trying to install new window seals on the front
doors...these are the inside seals on the windows
which crank up and down.  It was a little hard getting
the old seal out, but getting the new ones to snap
into place seems almost impossible. 

Anyone know any tricks to this, or do I just need to
remove the windows  :0(

Thanks,

Rick
