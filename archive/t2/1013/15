Subject: Aftermarket shifter?

I can't recall if the trans or engine need to be out to replace the universal type connector (#31 in the diagrams). I will say that when I did this all of the slop was removed from my shifter. The urethane or plastic portions of #31 were shot and the whole assembly there was floating around creating all the slop. It was so bad on my old '72 that I was the only one who could find gears. Got in a little trouble with the law as a kid once for having beer in the bus under age. The fuzz tried to move the bus out of a parking space and couldn't find the gears. 5 of them tried, funny as hell. Me and my buddies laughing at them. Finally they tell me to move it. I hop in it pops right into gear and I move it no problemo. Whilst the cops are busy watching me my buddies recover all the beer and stash it in an alley. We had a fun night. Anyway I think I had my engine out doing the clutch when I replaced #31 and it made it shift like new. The bushing that Don replaced up front I did
 later as mine was gone too. With out it the shifter would vibrate around some and make noise. Those 2 bushings fixed all the slop and made the bus easy to shift for all.
