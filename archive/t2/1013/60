Subject: kick panels

I got some new kick panels, but I don't see how they could possibly fit. The
fit seems incredibly tight. Any suggestions on installation? I checked the
archive, and see one post on installing them, back in '02. Adam had trouble
installing, but I don't see any responses to his query.

 

This is for a '69 single cab.

 

I can't actually tell exactly how these things are mounted. I  see a groove
at the bottom of the cab, and on one side(near the door). I'm guess somehow
I am supposed to bend the panels until they fit in these two grooves, but
then how is it held in place at the top and center sides?
