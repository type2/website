Drafty seals up top?  Find some sheet closed cell foam shipping material that's 1/8" to 1/4" thick as a gasket. It's used to cushion dishes and such. You want a waterproof, airproof crushable material. If your hinges and holddowns are toast like Karl mentioned, find some brackets and clamps that will fit on the rain gutters and push the top down on the "gasket" until spring.
