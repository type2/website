Hey, thats what I am driving, nice.

Here is my update on the whole dB thing, I got a piece of rubber to put down on the back deck, at the company where I design speakers we call it 1/4" clay filled red rubber, at Gasket Specialties on Airport Way they call it the most inexpensive gasket material they sell, I got it for free but I think the 4'x5' piece would be around 50 bucks.

I am very busy and don't have a lot of time to get right on installing it but I folded it up like a tray and stuck it in the back and put the matress inside of the tray formed by the rubber.

The difference was amazing, I went from 86dB to 81dB at idle, thats 5 whole decibels!

I dropped 2dB at all speeds and driving conditions, from 102 to 100 on I-84's concrete, and 98 to 96 on normal pavement, it may not be obvious to many people but 2dB is a huge difference.

You can now talk to people in the back seat and it isn't even installed, my brother in law that drives a nearly identical bus thinks I need a tach now because the motor can barely be heard, I think the motor is still louder than heck but that shows you how much of a difference it made.

Try tapping on the outside skin of your sliding door today, does it thud or ring?
