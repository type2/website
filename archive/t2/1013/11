Subject: Again... has anyone photos?

Has anyone "pics" of a carb setup, of Del 40s, on a 1800cc, or 2000cc motor,
in a van?  I would really like to see the whole setup, since I am stymied, by
what I have, and where I am at!  Just can't figure out what goes where, as
well as 'vacuum port' for intakes for booster!  Pictures would be great!
Sid
