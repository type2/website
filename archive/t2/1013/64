The canvas tent will make a surprising difference.  Without it you
pretty much have nothing to keep the outside air from blowing through.
Just like discovering your fly is unzipped on a cold windy day :)

Your best bet without a canvas in place is to get a thick, fluffy
comforter and fold it such that it fills the gap between your roof and
your, well, roof.  Don't make it too thick 'cause you don't want it
pushing the poptop up, but you want it to fill the gap completely.
Top-to-bottom and side-to-side.  Even in a bus with a good canvas this
can make a difference.

Cheers.
