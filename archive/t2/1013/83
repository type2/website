Subject: Need a quick fix for leaky windows

The rain hit hard this weekend and I've discovered several window leaks.
Not sure if it's caused by bad seals, rusty sills, or both.  I don't have
the space or time to pull out the windows and seals to find out.  Hopefully
I can get to that next Spring/Summer.  I need a fix in the meantime.  Caulk
seems like a decent, quick, cheap fix.  From what I found in the archives it
sounds like I should use caulk w/ urethane and avoid ones w/ ammonia
(promotes rust).  I want something that will seal well now, but will be easy
to remove later when I can do the job right.  I'll be working outside under
a car port so I need something that will set properly in temps between
30-50.  Anybody have words of wisdom on the topic?  One specific question I
have is should I caulk the seals from the inside, outside, or both?
