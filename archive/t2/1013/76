For the passenger's side, putting the skins back on was actually
pretty easy. I straightened out the ridges and increased the gap just
a bit were the ridge fits. It was a little tricky, but overall, it
wasn't much different from changing a bike tire. Two flatheads and
some patience and I got it all together. Next I just beat the CRAP out
of it with my rubber mallet to get everything fitting right, then
cinched it all down with a pair pf pliers.

I have not gotten to the driver's side yet as the curves will make it
a little more time consuming and I am more or less over being covered
in grease and dirt for today. I will however get that one started
tomorrow as I need to get these done before my muffler gets here.

The REAL fun part is going to be trying to figure out how to
effectively remove the old gaskets without having to grind the
fittings too much. We will see when we get there.
