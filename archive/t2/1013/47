Subject: Re: [T2] Oregon Bus Parts Query

Autosports International in Hazel Dell / Vancouver
used to be very good. Averre's VW auto wrecking in
Longview is one of the biggies (was, anyway!)

I saw VW buses scattered around at several wrecking
yards in the Longview area when I was looking for
Subey parts (wouldntja just know it!) Averre's used to
be excellent.

Of course, there's Beaver Creek Bob out on the coast
(Beaver Creek / Cloverdale area)
