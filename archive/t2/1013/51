Subject: door latch

Hello again, guys.  Came back from my trip after 6 weeks and the bus turned over 3 or 4 times and fired right up!  But tonight I had a problem.  I never felt anything break, but my door latch on the driver's door doesn't do anything when I try to lock it with the key.  I can still lock it and pull the handle in and it will lock.  But I have to open it from the inside.  I never lock it that way, so I'm not worried about locking my key in the car, but the door lock just swivels freely with the key.  I have locked it and unlocked it a couple of times in the last week that I've been on the road.  What's the problem and the fix?  Thanks...KR
