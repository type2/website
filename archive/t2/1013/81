Mark,

That's a type 4 engine in a 68? How'd you do that, besides moving the
cooling system from a type 1 engine - what else is/was involved? Do
you have an oil cooler under that shroud? Any challenges mating the
engine to a early model transmission or did you swap a later
transmission in there? Any heat/cooling problems?

peace
