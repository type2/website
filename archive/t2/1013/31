Squid said:


 Hi, I missed a thread on this item awhile back, and now need to know.  I
have 2 gaskets, that look like opera glasses, that I think go between the
head and the intake manifolds.  My engine is a 1800cc, and think my new
heads are for a later model, because they have 4 bolt holes, and the
originals have only three, therefore, I assume I should trade these 3 holers
for some 4 holers to make everything right, since they surely must be used?
Thanks

3 hole heads are 2.0 914 heads.  Very valuable!

All bus and 411 and 412 and 914 1.8's are 4 holes.
