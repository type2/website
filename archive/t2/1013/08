Subject: Available: Sundial cabinets

With the other split-window Westfalia stuff, I got some disassembled
Sundial cabinets. I'm keeping the Westy stuff, but make me an offer on the
Sundial stuff. The wood on the cabinets looks a bit water damaged, so
buyer (I am inclined to give this stuff away if you pick it up. If you
want me to ship, it will cost, since it would be a PITA).

Im located in Albany, OR.

Jon
