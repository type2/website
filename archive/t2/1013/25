Subject: Again... has anyone photos?

Sid,

I have that set up on a 2L type 4.  But it is an upright conversion for
cooling fan, but that shouldn't matter.  I do not have power brakes so there
is not a hookup for the booster.  I'll try to get the camera in there to get
some shots this weekend.  Anything in particular you would like to see?
