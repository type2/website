Kevin,

Thought I would pop onto the T2 list for a while and see what's shakin'.

If you want to see some major db drop, you most likely need to coat the 
entire interior. Don't forget, it needs to be 2mm thick minimum. You get max 
effectiveness at around 3mm. You might also want to invest is some Dynamat 
extreme or some Damplifier to put on before the quiet paint.

Once that stuff is inplace, you need something to absorb on the door panels.

Most interested in your success. Post up the db drop when you get a chance!!

Chris
