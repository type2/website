Subject: RE: [T2] flasher relay?

This is for a '69 single cab. Sorry, I forgot to put my signature in the
last email.

When I first got my bus, I wanted to replace the radio-as the one installed
had been trashed. I figured to do that I should first review all wiring,
clean connections, etc. So I took the speedo cluster off, and took out each
dash switch one at a time, and cleaned all the contacts on them with a brass
brush.

I am not sure which item behind the speedo cluster is the relay, or if it is
contained in the switch itself somehow.
