Subject: play in rear wheels

	I've just been knocked back for my 6-monthly Warrant of 
Fitness (a legal requirement to stay on the road in NZ), on the 
ground "play in rear wheels".
	This is novel to me.  Can anyone essay an order of likelihood 
for the causes of rear-wheel play?  	Gear-groaning noises have 
emanated from the rear in most gears at most speeds, but are no worse 
recently.  137,000 mi, probably about true.

thanx
