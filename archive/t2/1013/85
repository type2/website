Hi Shana, 

You asked about caulking your windows from inside and out.I definitely
recommend against doing it on both sides, unless you are absolutely sure it
is bone dry between. Otherwise you can trap moisture inbetween the caulikn
g, and your bus will continue to rust out.

I would recommend just sealing from the outside, if you need to. This will
keep the rain out. I'm not sure the best product to use. You could get some
type of window flashing tape, if it is just a temporary patch. It won't look
pretty, but it should work.
