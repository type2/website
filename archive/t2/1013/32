Subject: Re: [T2] hot start relay failed

Yes - I have had a couple of the Chrysler headlight
relays that I used to use eventually give up. I think
that in a better (cleaner) environment they would not
have failed. The ultimate solution to the starting
relay problem was placing a momentary (starter) switch
in the engine compartment. ONE TIME ONLY did Bussy
ever try that crap on me again! After I'd driven him
hard, he'd wait until I was parked over a mud hole or
a big oily mess and then refuse to start. It was his
way of getting back at me. The first time I walked
around back and pushed the button to start the engine,
that was the last time I ever needed to! Really! It
did come in handy for setting points though. -BaH
