John,

For me, a big selling point to converting my '71 to a TurboDiesel ( a 
process which is finally "almost ready to finally proceed") is the fact 
that after 7 years of owning my '71, I know what's wrong with it and I 
know what I've fixed.  Purchasing a new-to-me bus represents a whole host 
of unknowns: when were the brakes last done and/or flushed?  Is the 
steering box any good?  CV joints?  etc.

So while a significant portion of the decision to convert is "emotional 
attachment", having a good knowledge of what's wrong vs. what "may 
fail in the near future" helps ease my mind.  And yeah, the '71 is far 
from perfect, but it's really hard to find straight, well maintained buses 
out there for anything less than the mint i'd spend tiding up mine.

:-)

Happy Friday!
