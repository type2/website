Subject: Re: [T2] flasher relay?

Hiya Kevin,



Hmmmm.............I'm not sure exactly where the flasher relay in a 69 is located.? I believe the fuse box was changed for 1970 and the flasher is a plug-in atop the 1970 fuse box.? However, I do think you have the 215C flasher relay as I do.? The full VW parts number for that relay is 211 953 215C.? The flasher itself is a black plastic box about 2.5x2x.75inches.? It will have 4 male spade connectors lableled -31, KBL, +49, and 49a.? Even if a PO has changed out the original 215C for an aftermarket replacement, that replacement should have similarly labeled spade connectors.
