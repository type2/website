Subject: Cork for insulation?

I just had a wild thought. How about using cork wall/floor tiles for both
sound and heat insulation? It is lighter than dynamat so it won't affect
your gas mileage as much,  eco-friendly, durable, absorbs sound,  provides
heat insulation, and can probably be found at a reasonable price especially
if you don't mind seconds. You would probably have to do do a thin subfloor
to avoid the floor ridges though. Thoughts?
