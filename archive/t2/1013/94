Subject: Re: [T2] Cork for insulation?

You know cork is different in that regard, it floats, doesn't tend to absorb water even without treatment but can always be treated in some manner (though so much for eco friendly then.)  Is it a good choice, well I don't know, will say that almost ALL classic ice companies in WV (places in existence from the early 1900s sort of era) used cork to insulate their big walk in coolers, several (8-15) inches of it.  It is nice flexible, natural, but of course it might rot eventually I guess for the same reasons, doesn't ever seem to in those places though.  And I don't think a little 1/8"-1/4" or so layer will do much for someone, likely have to be some thickness to it, like the floor or ceiling tiles.  It is however also recently back in vogue and pretty pricey for floor tile for first run stuff at least as my mom thought about it for a kitchen remodel.  Personally I've always used the closed cell foam on foil backing that JC Whitney has sold for years (I assume they still do
 but it's been 6-7 years since I ordered any) for van insulation.  The cork is an interesting idea though.

  
I wouldn't recommend wooden insulation.
