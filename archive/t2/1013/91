Cool, I'm giving lock advice to someone named "Slaymaker"  :)

They can be rekeyed to match.  All you have to do is take the cylinder out
by removing the phillips screw at the inside end of the cylinder.  Put a
key in the lock before you pull the cylinder out.  Disassemble on a clean
surface.  There are a series of wafers that line up with the cylinder to
release the lock  Each wafer has a small spring under it.  Often things
are gummed up with old grease.

All you have to do is rearrange the wafers to match the key you have.
Grease lightly with white grease and reassemble.
