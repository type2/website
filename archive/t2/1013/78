Subject: Fwd: [T2] Cork for insulation?

I had thought about that, but modern cork flooring is supposedly sealed
against moisture, else how could they use it on a floor that will
undoubtedly be spilled on and mopped? I was thinking in the walls, it would
be cork, fiberglass batting, and a moisture barrier under the visible walls.
The floor, I'm still figgurin'...
