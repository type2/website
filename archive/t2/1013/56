Being water based, it wouldn't be suitable for doors if the water  
component wasn't volatile. From the application notes:

"Drying Time: Being water based, QuietCar needs to dry by evaporation  
during the
cure cycle. QuietCar that has been thinned excessively will take  
longer to dry.  Water
will evaporate more readily when the following conditions exist:  
Elevated
temperature, increased air circulation, lowered relative humidity.  
These conditions
along with layer thickness contribute to drying time."
