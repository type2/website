Subject: Re: [T2] flasher relay?

Hiya Kevin,

It would be helpful to know which relay (and year of bus) you're dealing with.

I know that on my 70 (an original 215C mechanical flasher relay) the relay?can seem to work better when the the electrical system is pumping more juice.? For example, my indicator light?may miss a "flash" or two at idle.? But when I rev the engine (and pump some more juice into the system via the generator) it will flash just fine.? I'd attribute this to the flasher unit starting to degrade; perhaps dirty or corroded contacts inside the unit.? All external contacts are bright and shiny.? When I replace my current 215C with another, I'll pull the old unit apart and check it out.
