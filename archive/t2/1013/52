Subject: Steel Fuel Lines From Tank

Todd-
A week ago in your reply you discribed your fuel line setup. You  
mentioned Steel fuel line fittings to the tank
<<< There ARE fittings that you can buy to screw into the bottom of
the factory fuel tank (if you remove that nipple) >>>

Where can I get these fittings?

Over the years I have had some small fuel leaks from time to time, I'd  
like a secure strong connection to the tank with a shut off valve.  I  
park my bus in my garage which is in my house. With the fuel line  
attached to the bottom of the tank a leak could drain the entire tank  
on the floor.

Thank you.
