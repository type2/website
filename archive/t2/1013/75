You mean, as in "Beaver Bob?" Naw. He's Beaver Creek
Bob. Beaver Creek kinda meanders along through there -
then there's the forks. I know we've had the
discussion of what town he's just outside of and it is
Beaver but his mailing addy is Cloverdale. Has quite a
stock of used parts for all kinds of VW's. Mostly he's
got a wealth of knowledge learned, I suspect, mostly
the hard way! I don't know if he's currently working
the shop or if he's back to working a "real" job. If
you see him, tell him Busahaulic says Hello. When he
asks who that is, tell him the brown bus with the
Subey and the fake spare tire radiator!
Beaver Creek Bob's 24215 Hwy 101 South Cloverdale, Or.
97112 P-mail me for his phone #. -BaH
