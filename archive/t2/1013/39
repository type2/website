Subject: sound deadening in doors

Well I bought a sound meter from Radio shack, and was hitting about 95-100
db while driving about 50 mph.

 

This weekend I am going to be putting some quiet car paint inside the doors
of my single cab and install door panels, and speakers..that is the goal
anyway. I will try to take pictures of the process, and find somewhere to
post them.
