I understand what you wrote. Thanks for the tip, it makes a lot of sense,
and I wouldn't have thought of it until to late.

Subject: cutting holes for speakers

 

A quick tip when you cut the holes for the speakers. After you locate where
the speakers are going to go,make a mark of the template on the vinyl door
covering. DON"T cut a hole in the vinyl,instead you want to cut and x in the
vinyl so you can fold the vinyl over the hole

you cut in the fiberboard and fold it over the edges and tape/glue the flaps
to the backside

of the board. This will keep the covering tighter,help keep the edges of the
fiber board from 

being exposed, and keep things looking neater. It may require cutting more
than just an

x for the flaps,you might have to make several cuts from the center to the
edge. You might end up with ten little flaps wrapped around the back of the
panel. Practice on a piece of cloth over cardboard with the same size
speaker hole you need to get a feel of what I mean.

The flaps need to be small enough so you don't get wrinkles and the flaps
dont need to go

al the way to the center of the hole. Sorry for the confusing rambling,but
hopefully you get

a picture of what I mean. Its hard to put into words...
