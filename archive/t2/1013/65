 My 69 Westy is a little breezy his time of year.? When I hit about 45mph my
fiberglass roof lifts just ever so slightly allowing the nice chilly outside
to rush right in.? The rubber seal on the outside is in great condition (I
replaced it about 2 years ago).? I have tried to get a tighter seal but
nothing seems to help.? I thought about duct taping it shut but that a
little extreme!

 I will admit that canvas tent in missing (dont ask I think the previous
wanted to make a sunroof??) I am planning to replace it sometime this
winter, but will it make that much of a difference.? Or do I need make other
improvements to prevent from get frostbite this winter?

Sounds like your front hinges are shot. The 68 to 72 hinges were made of
tubular aluminum and they plain suck!  The 73 hinges are the ones you want.
They are flat stock steel. 73 only.

You also want to make sure the center locking hook is there and adjusted
correctly. They hold the front center down. They look like this:

The long piece is riveted to the top. The lower short piece is bolted to the
roof and is slotted for adjustments.
