John,

I did like the looks of the vanagon rear mount.  I thought about that as an
improvement on the existing mount.  I spent too much time adapting the type
4 hanger to bolt right up to the 68 - 71 mounts that existed on the bus, and
I was on a schedule that led me to stick with what I know.  I wasn't aware
that there is no trans mount in the rear for the vanagon.  I haven't spent
too much time with those.  As far as why didn't I just get a 72 -79?  Well,
I like the type 4, and I love the 68 bus (so easy to pull the engine), and I
like to try things.  I have 4 kids, and one might like a bug to drive, and
I'd surely put a type 4 in there..  I can't explain it, I guess.  Just
trying something new.  Oh, plus on Jake's site he advises against doing such
a conversion.  So, I had to do it! Plus it is completely reversible, so
unbolt the type 4 and trans, and bolt in the the stock set up, no problems.


Happy Bussing!
