Subject: flasher relay?

I've been trying to figure this out for some time. My turn signals and
hazards do not work all the time. It seems if I try to use them when I first
start driving they don't work. If I try to turn on the hazard lights, they
may flash once, then stop. The wipers always work.

 

After driving for a bit, when I go to use the turn signal, it works. I am
been unable to ascertain if there is a relationship between the driving time
and the turn signals working. Sometimes when I use the turn signal if it is
not working, I turn on the wipers and the hazards-this seems to help 'jump'
the relay, or push it into working. I think they all use the same relay, is
this correct?

 

Any suggestions on diagnosing/fixing this appreciated.
