Subject: Heat Exchanger "refresh"

In anticipation of getting my new exhaust system, I decided to take
off all the exhaust components and do what I could do to start
cleaning my heating system.

I don't know if pulling apart the heat exchanger is a big "no-no" or
not... too late now, but I wanted to know what the fiberous matter is
that I have come across that wraps the exhaust enclosed in the
exchanger housing?

One side look alright I guess, but the other side is pretty burned up
and dark. Is this common? Have I just shot myself in the foot?

I just want to get my stock heater working as well as I can and after
seeing what Stiles did with his, I am felling a little inspired...
