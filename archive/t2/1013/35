There's nothing special about that relay.  Just pull it out and swap it
with another automotive one.  I think they cost about 6 bux or so...

If it works, it was the relay.. if it doesn't, then you know it's
something else.

Or, you can test it.  If you put an ohm meter across the 85 and 86
terminals, there should be low resistance (I'm guessing under 20).  If
it's infinity, the coil's bad.  You can also just hook up 12v across
those same terminals and it should click - if it doesn't, it's bad.  You
could also test for continuity across 30 and 87 while 12v is applied to
85 and 86.  If there's continuity, it's good, and the problem is
somewhere else.

Here's a diagram of one:

Yours may or may not have terminal 87a, but that's ok, because you don't
use it anyways.
