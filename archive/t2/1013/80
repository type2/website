Sid,

I posted some pics on the samba of the carbs and the engine compartment for
you to see.  Check out the link below.  You mentioned the linkage being at
an angle, but mine is pretty much parallel with the fan shroud.  If there is
anything you would like to see closer, let me know.  

Don't make fun of my unpainted fan shroud etc.. I did this all to see how it
would all work out,  and am now on winter #2 that "I'm gonna pull that
engine and paint all of that stuff".  If you guys / gals rib me enough,
maybe I'll be shamed into it!

Mark,
