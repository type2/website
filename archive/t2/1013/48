Subject: Re: [T2] play in rear wheels

Do y'know what they are calling "play?" Is it
rotational play or axial play? Rotational is almost
certainly CV joints whereas axial is likely wheel
bearings. There is the possibility of torsion bar
bushings - that'd be more aptly "rear-end-wag" though.
Rear wheel bearings are not adjustable like the front
wheel bearings. They're a bit tougher to replace, too.
There is a cheap and easy method for loosening the
axle nut - it's a "wrench" cut or stamped out of about
half-inch thick steel plate with a square hole at one
end for 1/2" drive tool plus hammering surfaces; the
cutout at the other end fits the big axle nut. Much
cheaper and I feel, easier than conventional breaker
bar and socket. The sockets tend to want to climb off
due to the pressure being applied at the end of the
socket. The tool I refer to puts the breaker bar
leverage directly in line with the nut - plus, the
hammering surfaces can be persuaded with a sixteen
pound sledge hammer if needed! -BaH
