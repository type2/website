 Hello again, guys.  Came back from my trip after 6 weeks and the bus turned
over 3 or 4 times and fired right up!  But tonight I had a problem.  I never
felt anything break, but my door latch on the driver's door doesn't do
anything when I try to lock it with the key.  I can still lock it and pull
the handle in and it will lock.  But I have to open it from the inside.  I
never lock it that way, so I'm not worried about locking my key in the car,
but the door lock just swivels freely with the key.  I have locked it and
unlocked it a couple of times in the last week that I've been on the road.
What's the problem and the fix?  Thanks...KR

Sounds like screw came loose that holds the paddle to the tumbler.
When you turn the key, the paddle is what moves the lock linkage.
Here is a picture of the paddle:

The outer handle comes off with a long 4mm allen after you remove the door
panel.
