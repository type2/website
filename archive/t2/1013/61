Subject: Re-keying locks

I will be taking the front door locks out to clean/lube/repair them and 
was wondering how much trouble it would be to re-key them to match the 
ignition switch.  I know it would be easier to re-key one cylinder (the 
ignition switch) than four, but I want to keep the only key that is 
original VW issue.  I have spare lock mechanisms that I could use for 
parts.
