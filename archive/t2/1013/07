Wow!  I've been absent from the type2 list for over 3 years,
re-subscribed just yesterday, and already I see my name in lights.  That
sort of thing ought to scare the pants off a fellow!

I don't have a bus anymore - I sold my 73 Westy w/5-speed tranny in 2004
(after 14 years of ownership!) and sold Zorm the 58 single cab in 2003
(I had him for about 5 years).  I still have my 914 (for 16 years and
counting) and that just about keeps me busy.

I doubt if I can offer much in bus-specific help anymore, but I'm always
happy to toss in my 2-cents worth and join the fun.  Mostly I've just
missed the camaraderie of the list and thought I'd try to keep up for a
while.

If it's still OK by the list's charter I'll probably post a few oddball
bus items for sale over the next few weeks while I clean out my garage.
More details to come.

Anyway, greetings to all from a used-to-be.  I look forward to hearing
from some of the folks who remember me and meeting some of the rest of
you :)
