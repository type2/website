OK, not a VW trip but I just got back from a long cruise.  Basically Hawaii to Miami and a couple of times around the Caribbean hitting a lot of great ports everywhere.  I've missed most of the posts as it gets expensive on the ship but I've read the ones with topics that grabbed me.

I saw lots of late Bays and Bugs but not one Westy.  I'm sure if I'd stayed any length of time in one port I would have.  Lots of Beetles and a few Bays used as cabs in Acapulco.  But it seems that everywhere in the world now the Toyota Corolla is cab of choice.  RIP Checker.  I went to Colombia for the first time.  If anyone has any money to invest, that's the place.  Civil war is almost over, the drug cartels are on the run, and I saw whole beaches you could buy for a hundred grand.  Not one person tried to sell me dope!  

Now I'm reading more of the posts but it looks like I'm going to be gone again sometime next month.  Just wanted to say hi and let everyone know that I'm thinking about them and monitoring as much as I can.  

Gotta boast a little:  Last cruise was a jazz cruise (I'm a jazz saxophonist) and I got to hang out all week with some of the greatest.  It was a gas.  Hi-octane.  Cheers...KR
