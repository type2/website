MY HEAD IS SPINNING? I HAVE A 78 T2 THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR THE PAST 
TWO MONTHS. FIRST I GET A MOTOR (2L FI)OUT OF AN 81 WESTFALIA AND WAS TOLD IT 
WAS REBUILT? I WAS TOLD THAT THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE PERSON WHO REBUILT IT 
FORGOT TO BLEED THE LIFTERS.  NO PROBLEM EASY FIX. I PUMP THEM UP IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH BENTLY. LOOKED GOOD REAL CLEAN LIKE IT MAY HAVE BEEN REBUILT? 
AFTER CHANGING MOTOR MOUNTS AND TINS, I INSTALL ENGINE. WON'T START? I CHECK 
FOR SPARK, GOOD TO GO. SO PULL PLUGS, ALL DRY AS A BONE, ALL FIVE INJECTORS 
ARE BAD, PLUGGED UP. SO I USE THE ONES OUT OF MY 78 2L. NOW I HAVE FUEL AND 
SPARK AND IT RUNS ON TWO CYLINDERS. WIRES WERE 180 OUT, GOT THAT FIXED. 
STARTS UP RUNS STRONG BUT MISSES. WHEN I SHUT DOWN THE MOTOR I HEAR A LONG 
HISS NOISE, COMPRESSION LEAK SOMEWHEREPLUS OIL ALL OVER EVERWHERE. SO I 
PULLED THE HEAD ON THE DRIVERS SIDE, SOFT RUBBER SEALS ON TUBES, NEW VALVE 
COVER GASKETS LOOKS LIKE NO GASKETS ON BLOCK (SMALL END) END OF CYLINDER 
SLEEVE AND THE NUTS WERE NOT TIGHT? MAYBE THERE ARE NOT SUSPOSED TO BE 
GASKETS ON THE BLOCK SIDE? PISTONS AND SLEEVES LOOK NEW. SO I PULL THE HEAD 
ON THE OTHER SIDE. HARD BRITTLE GASKETS ON TUBES, OLD SLEEVES AND PISTONS 
WITH GASKETS ON BOTH ENDS OF THE SLEEVES? PLUS NO RETAINER SPRING TO KEEP 
PUSHROD TUBES FROM COMING OUT ON EITHER HEAD? SOME REBUILD JOB? GOOD PART IS 
I ONLY PAID $200.00 FOR THE WESTFALIA, ENGINE AND ALL. THIS IS THE THIRD TIME 
I HAVE PULLED THIS ENGINE. I FEEL THIS IS THE LAST TIME? DOES ANY ONE KNOW IF 
THERE ARE GASKETS ON BOTH ENDS OF THE SLEEVES? THE REPAIR MANUAL DOESN'T SAY. 
SO THE OIL WAS BLOWING BY BETWEEN THE BLOCK AND NUMBER THREE SLEEVE, AND THE 
ROCK HARD SEALS ON THE PUSHROD TUBES ON THE OTHE SIDE. IT IS SO NICE TO HAVE 
AN EXTRA ENGINE THAT YOU CAN USE FOR PARTS. DOES ANY ONE OUT THERE NEED OR 
WANT AN 81 WESTFALIA FOR FREE? NO MOTOR, JUST A PARTS VEHICLE, THE INTERIOR 
IS COMPLETE ALL CABINETS AND SINK WITH FRIDGE IS THERE BODY IS ALL THERE SOME 
RUST. CANVAS FOR TOP IS ROTTEN. BUT IT IS FREE. NO TITLE, BUT I CAN GET IT.
