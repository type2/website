Subject: Jerome Still On? And Oil Cooler Revisited

Despite the current events afflicting our country, I felt it necessary that
ask if Jerome is still on as planned. I am driving over 1000 miles for this
show, and I would to have to chance to back out if Jerome is canceled.

It will not be business as usual for this weekend, but I can't think of a
better way to spend a weekend than with fellow volks. There is an unusually
strong sense of family with this community, and I consider you all as such.

For more Bus related content. Got my oil cooler mounted. I ended up using
the tube style as I had it in my posession, and thought, though not as
effective as a plate cooler, this _supplimental_ cooler should be up to the
task. It was not until I was running oil lines back to my sandwich oil
filter adaptor that I realized that the way NO WAY this sucker woudl fit
both filter and hoses in that tiny Type4 filter hole. It should have been
obvious. So I have chosen to forego the hookup until after Jerome, so I can
locate the right parts and spend the time doing it right, instead up rushing
it 5 hours before I leave.

God Bless America. We will survive through this.

Wonder how much it'll cost me on a 2000 mile trip at $4.00 a gallon . . .
