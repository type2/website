Subject: Re: [T2] [Admin] National Disaster

OK folks, now this topic is hitting the bus community in a direct way.
Gasoline prices in this MIDWEST small town have hit over $4.00 per gallon.
I have never seen gas above $2.29(ok I'm lucky) and you cannot get ANYWHERE
NEAR A FILLING STATION.  The lines were over 50 cars long this afternoon and
many stations are out of gas. It seems everyone watched the wave coming when
prices skyrocketed in the neighboring towns and we all tanked up.  It is
said that prices will be over $5.00 in the morning.
I hate to stray from normalcy here but this puts a bind on me with my 68
mile one-way commute to work.  Looks like the days of stealth camping in the
employee parking lot are here again.  I don't care how you look at it, the
terrorists see this day as a huge victory, even if the t2 list does not talk
about it!
Please pray for victims, families, EMS, police, security, armed forces,
America.
I'd better go air up the bike tires!
Take care.
Jay
