Just to clarify, I never said to sandpaper/steel wool the covers.  I
recommend spending some time with a little steel wool on the sealing
surface of the cylinder head only if the surface has leftover bits of old
sealant stuck to it, so that it's no longer perfectly flat.  

It won't seal very well if the sealing surface isn't flat and smooth.
Buildup of old sealer and gasket pieces will prevent you from getting a
good seal.

I usually use a screwdriver blade to scrape off any funk that's stuck on
the inside of the cover itself.  Note I only ever have to do this once,
which is the first time I take the valve covers off after I buy the Bus.
From then on I use wheel bearing grease only on the gasket and therefore I
don't have these problems of stuck on gunk on subsequent removals.
