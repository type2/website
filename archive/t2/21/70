Hey all,

I just installed a Berg exhaust system on my 71 1600 DP and am quite happy
with the craftsmanship, fit, and sound.  It also ducts all the exhaust to
the passenger corner so I am no longer being followed down the road by a
cloud of carbon monoxide!

Only problem is, is that it flows more than the bug muffler I am replacing.
Berg suggests a one to two jet size increase.  Anyone know what size the
main is on a 34 pict 3?  Do the sizes change in 2.5 increments?  Any
suggestions on where to get the jets?

Thanks to all.
