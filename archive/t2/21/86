Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Torsion Bars aged


I personally have adjusted the torsion bars on my 71 twice (only because I
didn't
follow George's procedure correctly the first time ;) and they have not
broken since either adjustment.  Knock on wood.

Would definitely recommend adjusting them if you rear end sags.

Such has not been my experience.  The only broken bars I have seen were
the result either of off-road abuse or of bars being switched from one
side to the other.

If you use new bars, you will likely have to adjust them twice, once on
installation, and once after they take a set.  the settings in the
Bentley manual are for used bars.
