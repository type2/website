Don't fall for it???  What should I do?  Demand that they sell me gas for
$1.50 when there are 50 cars behind me.  Not falling for "hysteria" has
nothing to do with what I am being charged for gas.  If you suspect
correlation and not causation as I did, the station mgrs are saying this is
"due to the events of today."
If your water company suddenly starts charging you 5 times the ordinary
rate, will you "not fall for it" and send them a check for whatever you
want? Makes me thirsty just thinking about it.
Let's not be hysterical OR ignorant here.  Two things I can't stand are
liers and thiefs.  I am neither!
If the facts displease anyone, look elsewhere for an apology.

PS: Three things:  3)terrorists.
Not one fire dept was attacked either-somehow several firemen are dead.
OK, *NOW we're off topic.
