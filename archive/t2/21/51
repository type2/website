Hello all,

I know this may seem trivial in light of today's events, but I'm sure =
it's not trivial to who it happened to.  List member Shawn Olsen had a =
fire at his home last weekend which destroyed his bus (69 Dormobile, if =
I'm correct) and garage, severely damaging the rest of his house.  It =
was sobering for me, thinking about all the flammables I have in my =
garage attached to my house.  His bus was parked about 10 feet in front =
of the garage and burned completely except for engine, tranny and BN4 =
heater (fuel tank did not ignite, luckily).  The heat melted the =
headlight lenses and completely burned an aluminum ladder he had in the =
bus.  His bug parked on the street had some blistered paint as well.  No =
injuries as his son got out of the house in time and Shawn wasn't home.  =
I dropped by and chatted with him yesterday; a big mess to clean up and =
figure out, but spirits are OK as no one hurt.  As tragic as this is, it =
does force one to put things in perspective as to what is really =
important.  Still, it made me cringe when I saw the burned up bus.  He =
thinks the fire was electrical and started around his compressor in the =
garage, right by a cabinet with paint.  Fortunately, he was properly =
insured.

Just thought I'd let the list know, as it's probably far from his mind.  =
Also, might not be a bad idea to evaluate what flammables you have in =
your garage and their location with regard to potential ignition =
sources.  Sure made me think. =20

Include him in your thoughts and prayers as well as those who've =
suffered tremendous losses in today's horrible events.

Give blood if you can and make it a regular habit if you don't already.
