Subject: Re: [T2] misadventures of a vw mechanic wannabe

Had a roommate that insisted that cigarettes couldn't start fires with 
gasoline. These were 'goodolddays' when we were in the Navy and beer was 
generally involved.

He would always insist on proving it when he had a few and I hadn't and I 
was cleaning parts (hands in gasoline sometimes).

This led to many hot conversations!!! (no pun intended).

Another episode, another friend, BMW that had sat for a long time.

I am cranking the engine over with the key, pumping, some popping through 
the carb. Friend thinks more gas from bottom will help. It popped again and 
lit the carb, the bottle, and him. He dropped the bottle, gas/fire 
everywhere, and ran away.

We were in Italy and I quickly realized that I did not know the Italian 
words for fire (Fuoco). Couldn't ask for a fire extinguisher at the shop we 
were working beside. Grabbed a mechanic who saw the situation and threw me 
an extinguisher. The BMW was gridlocked between other cars so now we had 
several cars with fire under them.

Got the fire out, got my friend out. No damages beyond soot and some 
blisters on his right side - head to toe.

Took him to the Navy hospital. They took a complete report. Navy gave my 
the Navy Achievement medal. I didn't want it (for that), told them, and 
then slept through the ceremony (worked 12 hours night before).

Department was very pissed, several other guys got retirement and 
advancement certificates but no me. Wanted to write me up but they decided 
the paperwork would read a little funny.

<grin>
