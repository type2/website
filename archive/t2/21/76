Subject: Wanted: Bus or Beetle in San Diego

Hi,

Want to buy vehicle in San Diego !

I am trying to find a way home to Canada. Trains, busses and planes are not an immediate option. If you know of a decent bug or bus for 2000-3000 that is both reliable and worth keeping 
please respond ASAP. Need to get home. 

Bob
