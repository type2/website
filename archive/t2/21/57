Subject: Vent on late model Double Cabs?

I just bought up a rusty, but complete, 1979 RHD Double Cab (Model 268) to
do up as my regular transport & toy.

It will be necessary to cannibalize the 1975 RHD Double Cab for the gates,
rear door, engine hatch, rear seat pedestal etc, plus a few body panels, but
it should be a MUCH easier job to make a goer out of the '79 (luckily).

There was one significant difference between the '79, and any other DC I've
ever seen, and I was wondering whether anyone could help me out with it? On
the rear driver's side (Right) corner of the cab, there is a vertical line
of louvers above the window line, they're about 1 1/2" wide, and the line is
about a foot high. Does anyone know whether this is cabin ventilation (my
friend's belief ), or something to do with the induction system?

I can probably trace it when I pick it up next week, but if anyone could
provide a definitive answer on what it's for, it'd be appreciated.

Thanking you in anticipation.

Regards,

Neale

NB: Can't really complain on the DC front, I've picked up two for $1000 AUD
( rusty 1975 shell with reasonable gates, good rear door, pedestal etc for
$400, and rusty, complete 1979 DC with the 2L engine, 091 tranny, good
seats, all electrics etc for $600 ), AND my ex, and her sister are letting
me store both at their place for a couple of months until my house is built.
Given the deplorable events in the world at the moment, something like this
has to be classed as a GOOD thing, in my book.
