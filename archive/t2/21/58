Subject: Vanfest News - UK

This just in from Just Kampers-

Dear KamperNews subscriber

VANFEST IS ON - it has NOT been cancelled.

Reports are reaching us that erroneous news of VanFest's cancellation have
been whistling around the internet. These malicious reports seem to be aimed
mostly at visitors from Europe planning on coming over to the UK for the
weekend. These reports falsely state that because of yesterday's autrocities
in New York and Washington the UK is under marshall law and visitors are
being refused entry to the UK.

Once again I would like to state that VanFest 2001 is ON, it is NOT
cancelled.

We look forward to meeting as many of you as possible in the Just Kampers
marquee over the weekend.

We are aware that this email list is subscribed to by van enthusiasts in the
USA and therefore Just Kampers and the organisers of VanFest would like to
extend their sympathies and condolences to the victims and their families of
yesterday's terrorist attacks.
