Subject: Re: [T2] Valve Adjustment question!

Folks, John Muir has all that info in the 'Idiot Book', once tdc for #1 cyl is
established, use a stick with paint on it, align across the bottom pulley and
make a paint mark on the bottom of said pulley(T-1 only!). then rotate the engine
backwards(ccw() to find #2 tdc. you adjust valves in the opposite of the firing
order, 1-2-3-4 instead of 1- 4-3-2.T-4 requires a little bit more work, but the
same idea still holds.

My .02 1/2.

Chris
