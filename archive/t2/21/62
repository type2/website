Subject: Jerome Jamboree XI

Yes Jerome IS On-- we will be having some special things going on regarding
the tragedy- We also ask all the people coming-- to please respect what has
occurred in America, Jerome Jamboree is noted for being a very happy place
for all, regarding seeing friends we have not seen in a year and starting
new friendships--Please be considerate
in your actions this year--This Raffle bus is perhaps the finest one ever
done yet by the Arizona Bus Club--Again as a member of the ABC my thoughts
go out to all of the people effected by this tragedy--My Father was a
fireman for some 33 years--Lets all of us do our part to bring everything
and everyone back to what makes America strong--
Caring for others--and showing it-- This Jerome Jamboree will be a very
special event--uj
