Subject: alternator 55/70

I replaced the Alternator in my 76 camper today. The old one was 55 amp I had 
already bought a 70 amp replacement. I was told that duel batteries campers 
where 70amp. It was a battle to install but its in and it works fine. My 
question is the cooling tube to the alternator. The 55 amp was oval shape the 
70 amp is round. All I could do was to fit the oval tube inside the round 
alternator opening. Is the round cooling tube available???
