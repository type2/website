I finally got my refer in my 77 Westy to work on AC power. After performing 
all of the diagnostics from the tech pages it should have worked. Net result 
was it would work for a while and then stop. The fuse in the converter did 
not actually "blow" it more appeared to slowly melt at each end. 

In frustration I took a wrench and banged the converter, guess what? It has 
been working perfectly for 4 days. I put a bunch of bottled water in the 
refer and they are now partially frozen. Wow!
