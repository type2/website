Subject: Brake caliper

Hey Blake,

I recently bought a used caliper like the one you described in your recent
query to the type2 list (for 71-72). The problem is that the seller did not
know, nor can I determine for which side the caliper is designed. There is
no part # on the caliper as far as I can see. Is there some way to determine
on which side the caliper goes by simply looking at it?

Thanks
