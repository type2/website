Subject: Re:Horn Wiring

Hi Frank,
   I just saw your post to the type2 list about horn wiring.  When we got 
our present bus (also a 71) the first thing I did was fix the horn.  The PO 
had a big ugly botton duct taped to the dash and wires running down throught 
the hole in the floor where the brake pedal goes through.
   Since I'm at work and don't have my Bentley manual handy I can't give you 
wire colors.  The electrical flow goes like this
1.  From the fuse (not sure which one) to one terminal on the horn.
2.  From the other terminal of the horn to a small metal tab on the steering 
tube (the outer tube that the steering shaft runs through)
3.  The electricity runs up the tube, through the bearing and spring at the 
top and contact on the bottom of the steering wheel.
4.  When you push the horn button, the metal, spring loaded, cup in the 
center of the steering wheel touches that contact built into the wheel.
5.  A ground wire attaches to the cup in the wheel and runs down through the 
shaft and attaches to a bolt on the steering shaft/box coupling.
6.  Electricity goes to ground and the horn sounds.

I hope that helps, if not ask any question you like and I'll look up the 
details in the manual, when I get home.
