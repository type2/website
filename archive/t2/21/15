Thermocouples are made from dissimilar metals (2) joined at
one end. They produce a small unique voltage at a given
temperature. IF you add regular copper wire into the ckt
make sure it is the same size for both legs. Splice it in
so that you are going into your meter with the thermocouple
wire.

the splice(s) should be in an area where there is no large
temperature difference between them. This insures that the
splice error contribution cancels out.

  In Short : A thermocouple produces it's own voltage. It
is  a thermoelectric voltage produced at the junction of
two dissimilar metal wires when heated/cooled and is
interperated by a thermocouple thermometer (guage).
  Don't add on regular wire at the end. Splice a length
into the overall length and run thermocouple wire into your
guage.

As a matter of fact, it is nuclear powered. Seriously, I 
don't know what
powers it, but no 12 volt power is required.
VDO has a website with instructions for all their gauges.
