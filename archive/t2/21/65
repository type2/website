A while ago I found a great little heater for your bus
camping pleasure.

  Mounts OUTSIDE of a bus or tent.

My type 2 site will be a single page only for a while.
Normal ops will return when my disgust and outrage level
evens out a bit.

Think for yourself and let others enjoy
the privilege of doing so too.
