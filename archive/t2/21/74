The "cargo floor" you describe, if it's above the engine, sounds like a PO
field modification; my Bus didn't come with one and no Bus I've ever seen
has one. 

If you like this cargo floor except for the lumps, and it does sound like a
good thing (it would help cut engine noise, anyway), I would remove the
masonite, cut a piece of blue-foam insulation board to the shape of your
cargo floor and put that in place, cut a sheet of half-inch marine plywood
to shape and attach that over the blue foam, then carpet it with boat
carpet.
