Subject: Rear Torsion Bars aged

Hi,

I have a '78 type 2 and it is squatting down in the back.

I am told that this is due to the the torsion bar age, however, it also has extreme camber, like about 15 degrees worth on the back end.

Perhaps this is normal, but I do see abnormal tire wear after 20,000 KM.

Alan
