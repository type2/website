Jerome is still on. There has been discussion on vintagebus about this and
should have been cross posted for those that drive the bays.

Ronnie, head bowed for those that died in yesterdays tragedy.

Despite the current events afflicting our country, I felt it necessary that
ask if Jerome is still on as planned. I am driving over 1000 miles for this
show, and I would to have to chance to back out if Jerome is canceled.

It will not be business as usual for this weekend, but I can't think of a
better way to spend a weekend than with fellow volks. There is an unusually
strong sense of family with this community, and I consider you all as such.

For more Bus related content. Got my oil cooler mounted. I ended up using
the tube style as I had it in my posession, and thought, though not as
effective as a plate cooler, this _supplimental_ cooler should be up to the
task. It was not until I was running oil lines back to my sandwich oil
filter adaptor that I realized that the way NO WAY this sucker woudl fit
both filter and hoses in that tiny Type4 filter hole. It should have been
obvious. So I have chosen to forego the hookup until after Jerome, so I can
locate the right parts and spend the time doing it right, instead up rushing
it 5 hours before I leave.

God Bless America. We will survive through this.

Wonder how much it'll cost me on a 2000 mile trip at $4.00 a gallon . . .
