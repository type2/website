Subject: Re: [T2] hot springs trip report

Stayed at the Hot Springs, NC about 3 times now. The first time I woke up (sleeping in a tent, motivating around on a Kawasaki Concours motorcycle) to hear a deep rumble of a huge diesel engine and a headlight coming towards my tent... TRAIN!!!! 

Fumbled for 3 seconds (felt like 30 minutes) for the tent zipper, found it, jumped out, only to realize it was a slow coal train and I was sleeping on the outside of a gentle curve... Whew! Trains are not bad and move really slow. No horns. 

Great campground though! French Broad River on the one side, small town on the other and it feels like I'm 500 miles from nowhere. The springs are nice too!
