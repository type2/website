Subject: Buffalo to EveryBus vis US219

Hi Volks,

I'm looking at the map and considering US219 as an alternate to 
I-90/I-79/I-77 down to Round Hill VA on the way to Everybus. There are 
possibly 6 Aircooled VW buses taking this route.

I would love to know about road conditions...

Is the highway pot-holed to within an inch of its life, or fresh and 
smooth, or somewhere in between.
Does this go around the Allegheny mountains or straight up them? Then a 
stop sign at the bottom!
Do all the gas stations close at 5PM? Do they charge foreigners 
$5/gallon? Do they have nice clean washrooms? (as if!)
Do the white-tail all like to play chicken with hippy buses?
Is there a "dug-up section with a detour from hell" that MapQuest isn't 
telling me about?

I don't mind 55MPH, (My bus LOVES it) but if the route is more 
strenuous to the point where it's risking the bus then I'll certainly 
reconsider.

All opinions gratefully accepted. Recent firsthand experience is 
particular desired.


Happy trails,
