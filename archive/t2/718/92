AKA K&N filter. 

You won't gain much clearance by lowering the engine but you will gain a great deal of clearance (a few inches) by removing all of the intake. 

Replace the injector seals and all rubber hoses and gaskets as you put it back together, assuming that they are a decade or two old... Most of those parts are FLAPS parts.
