Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch

Hello Mike  doesnt sound like a clutch problem to me  The first and reverse 
are your lowest gears and will be the first to show a clutch problem not 3rd 
gear , On bays the bracket inside the nose cone will break causing all kinds of 
problems also the coupler and shifter being off can cause problems  later and 
have fun    Mark Dearing
