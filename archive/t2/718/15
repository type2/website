sounds like what I did when I was in the military in Germany, shipped my
Beater beatle too Germany, while in Germany I put a special "no export" S
engine in it, lots of other goodies many not "legal" in the USA into the
car which was officially an American car. and when I left I shipped it
back to the USA and it was at least on paper the same American VW I
shipped to Germany two year earlier...
  however I would not reccomend joining the military for a couple years
just to get a new "BUS" to the USA
