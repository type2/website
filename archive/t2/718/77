Subject: automatic trasmission linkage to throttle needed.

I installed the engine in my 78 automatic today and discovered the PO
had not included the linkage between the female threaded rod which
passes through the firewall to the throttle -- not a huge surprise as
Temp Sender 2 with standoff and the distributor seem to have missed the
bus as well. I'm in a rental car until I get the bus running and would
love more than most things the linkage. Ideally, a linkage which could
head my way overnight at my cost would be perfect. I'll ring Joe(?) at
Busted Bus and Mark in the morning. Is there anyone else whom I should
contact directly, or does anyone on the list have the part and the time
to get it shipped tomorrow?

Thanks bunches in advance,

jack
