 Back in January I started a discussion on whether it was "OK" to
 torque only the four nuts accessible from under the rocker arm when
 torquing the heads on the type1 engine. Most told me that it was not
 how it was done but one list member told me that this was fine, his
 mechanic was doing that.
 
 This time I dropped the engine and found the four upper nuts loose
 also. They are now all torqued and we shall see if the oil still dares
 to drip :)
 
 Conclusion, torquing half the nuts solves half of the problem.
