Okay folks, who's going to buy up all these Brazilian busses and store them somewhere in a secret warehouse until 2030? 

Get them off the floor, air down the tires, overfill the engines with oil, drain the tanks... <grin>

I'd be inclined to leave it foreign registered, drive it across the border once a year and come back in at a different location. 3 day vacation or something. We had to do this to buy an Italian spec car and then register it in the military vehicle system. Took it to the Naples port, hired a broker, on paper he exported it out of the country and then reinported it (300,000 Lira fee) and then we could drive the "new arrival" to the Navy base where I registered it in the military system. The whole process would have required a repeat in reverse to sell it to a local. As long as it stayed in the military system I just had to maintain the annual registration or sell it to another military person or send it to the crusher (as is - as in I mean complete - new tires and stereo included).

US government does NOT regulate whether you can have a Mexican or Canadian registered vehicle. They do regulate if you want to bring it into the country. I drove an Italian spec vehicle for several months (registered in Torino I think) and the Italian gov't could care less as long as the road taxes were paid (registration) and it was insured.
