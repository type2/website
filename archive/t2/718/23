Subject: Re: [T2] Engine compartment sound proofing

I used to be the I.T. manager for a local RV
manufacturer, Country Coach.  The on-board generators
(usually Onan's) would startup on their own beneath
the master bed.  But you would not hear it.  You could
FEEL it, but not hear it start or run.  Outside, you
could hear the motor start, but not inside unless you
had the window open.  The sound-proofing material they
used was "leaded foam."  It was very, very heavy, had
a layer of lead (plumb) sanwiched between sheets of
open-cell grey-colored foam.   Once installed in the
engine and generator compartments, the sound did not
travel.  Curious.
    
If I were to embark on a sound proofing quest for my
Bus, I would seek to use the same material the RV
Manufacturers use; that leaded foam product.  I
imaging it is expensive though.  
     
And then there is the environmental issue of using
lead for anything.  All too often, the perfect
chemicals for specific tasks are hazardous to our
health.  Asbestos for brakes and heat insulation. 
Lead compounds as drying agents for paint.   Remember
the bulk & cheap degreaser / solvent Carbon
Tetracloride?  Or the Wood Treatment Penta
Chlorophenol?  And this Lead sound deadener.  Go
figure.
