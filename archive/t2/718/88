Greg,

In PA 219 goes right through the Alleghanies.  In regular cars it is
extremely slow going, lots of hairpins and 2 lanes.  It is a great drive
and very scenic and since you are not in a real hurry......

It comes right to Giles County in VA at Narrows, VA (local call it Nars),
there the fastest route would be to take 460 west for 20 miles and catch
I-77 to I-74, then to I-40 to follow directions to Hagan Stone from there.
 More scenic route is to take take 460 east to Route 8 in Christiansburg
(my town), take rt 8 south into NC then catch Rt220 there through
Greensboro to Hagan Stone. Rt 8 goes over the Blue Ridge Parkway through
the hippie/new age town of Floyd, VA.  Also a very scenic route.

If you want, I live not too far off of rt 460 in the next county south
with 45 acres available for an extra night or two.  Then I81-I77-I74 to
I40 would be the route.

Email for more details.

Mark
