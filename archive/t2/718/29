Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 engine sounds

Seriously, that's what a sound database is for. 
Richard, are you geared for storing the sound of a couple dozen (sick)
engines ? Would you care to include type 1 engines ?
I would be really cool to be able to hear engines of all the
listmembers ! Like an e-bus-event, anytime, anywhere.

Steve :  Anyone want to hear what a slappy piston sounds like on startup ?
Don : You're gonna make me go buy a digital voice recorder just to record
how crappy mine sounds aren't you?
