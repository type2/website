Subject: firewall removal 

If the wraparound lip at the bottom of the firewall isn't too deep, then maybe
the foam engine compartment seal has enough give to get the lip down and
forward without lowering the engine. I can foresee see colorful language and a
couple of busted knuckles, but skin grows back, right? And it's not like the
neighbors don't know the extent of my vocabulary by now.....

Tank or firewall? I got the firewall out recently w/o lowering the engine.
It took a lot of jiggling and cursing, but it came out.
