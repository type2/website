Subject: fire wall removal trick

Hi there,

This is a question about my 76 Westy, stock FI. I'm trying to remove the fuel
tank to inspect it for something blocking the output to the fuel pump. I'm
still trying to track down this
increasingly-more-common-shutting-down-while-driving problem. I'm trying to do
the job with the engine still in the bus. I've disconnected (and carefully
labelled) all of the FI stuff that seems like it would be in the way. I've
removed all of the screws for the firewall, but it won't budge. I even tried
to put a small screwdriver behind and pry, but still no dice. I'm fairly sure
that it's supposed to come out from the bottom first, but I can't get it to
move. Is there a trick to this???

Also, what does it mean when I find the intersection of the Air Intake Elbow
and Throttle Body wet on the inside? It smells like gas, but the bit of ooze
left in the TB has the consistency of oil. Could this be related to my bus
shutting down intermittently?

BTW, I read the archives on this. Dave Burgess mentions lowering the engine a
bit, but I don't understand the bit about removing the engine compartment
insulation with a wood chisel (?), and I only found 6 screws, not 8.  There
were 3 along each side and none in the top or bottom.

Thanks for any help y'all can offer!
