<It's the senders that are at fault. All those gauges are ok.>

Good to know. Maybe I missed a post that explained it but did anyone tell us whose senders were good and okay to use with the VDOs? And are the cylinder head temp gauges good or just the senders are junk? 

I swear I miss a day's posts and I miss good info! 

THANKS!

Chris
