Subject: RE: [T2] July/august bus events

The only one I can think of it in Windsor, Maine.  Very close to Augusta.
Usually early in August but can be the 30th of September this year.  Not
announced yet on their site but keep looking on their site. I usually attend
this show.

there
are any Bus events planned for those months close to the Maritimes?
