Subject: RE: [T2] Brazil--via Canada 15 years old

In Canada you can import any car from anywhere as long as it is at 
least 15 years old (1990 or older)
(in the US it's gotta be 25 years old).

Once in Canada, you can easily register the vehicle in Canada as a US 
resident to use "when you visit Canada".  (I've done this in BC as a 
US resident).

You then visit Canada.

Perhaps you decide to "visit" one of the northern states and drive 
across the border in the Canadian registered car.  No problem, 
totally legal.  Once you get into the US you can drive the car 
anywhere in the US.

You will have a Canadian license plate and you may violate your local 
DMV laws, but there is nothing illegal about driving a Canadian 
registered vehicle into the US.
