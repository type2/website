Subject: Valve adjustment intervals

List,

How often do you adjust your valves?

I can usually hear if mine are in need of adjustment by how
the motor idles when it is cold.  Currently I'm messing with
my valves about every 6 months or so, approximately.

What are your valve adjustment maintenance calendars like?
