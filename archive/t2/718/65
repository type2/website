Subject: windshield install resolved

thanks all those concerned! i got the glass in tight. i took the area where
wrist meets hand and gently bonked the top of the glass in. i hit on the
gasket only. i felt it dropping down as i put my left hand on the glass
whilst banging. much recommended fun. funny thing that it is a junkyard set
up - used gasket and old glass, milky around the perimeter. it is a temp
until i find a nice new deluxe gasket. i saved the old metal strip hoping
someday i'd get correct rubber.  - steve
