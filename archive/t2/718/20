Hi Arnaud and others,

I found a significant noise reduction putting R-blox, a dynamat type
material, on the vertical wall. I have not removed the cardboard with
holes yet, I am going to put R-Blox underneath that, for double sound
deadening. I found the R-Blox on e-bay. Here is a link to what I did.

Hope it helps
