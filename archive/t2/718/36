Subject: Speedo repair/KONIs

I'm looking for the name of a good place to have a VDO speedometer 
repaired.  This is for a '80s MBenz.  I know I've heard one mentioned 
on this list in the past.

Mandatory Bus content.  Yesterday, I got my bus out for the first time 
since October.  Tried out the new KONIs.  I have them set 1/2 turn in 
from the softest rebound setting.  There was a noticeable difference 
from the old 15 year old Monroe's that were on there.  I really need to 
take another test drive after I take all the cooking gear out of the 
cabinets to reduce all that clatter before I can judge whether the 
KONI's have made a significant difference in ride.

I did have a lot of trouble getting one of the shocks onto the lower 
mount of the front on one side.  The metal sleeve inside the rubber 
mount on the shock was not the proper size.  I had to ream it with a 
rat-tail file to open it up slightly to get it to slide over the mower 
mount-stud on the trailing arm.  The other front shock was fine.  Has 
anyone else experienced this?
