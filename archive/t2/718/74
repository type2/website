Hi all.  I've needed to put a starter on for some time
now.  Have to hit it with a hammer ever more
frequently.  Anyhow, I banged on it so I could turn it
around in my driveway to get to work on it and it
started being starved for fuel and dying.  I'd crank
it, it would die, I'd crank it, then the starter would
end up in that place and I'd have to crawl under it
and bang on it again.  I figured out that the fuel
pump wasn't working.  Puralator electric 2-3.5 lbs.  

It didn't sound nearly as loud as normal, there was
plenty fuel in the in-line filter I put in in front of
it, the filter on the out-bound side was only half
full of gas.  I went to O'Reilly's, bought a $37
no-name, put it on and it worked fine.  Then I tested
the puralator with a battery and it is pumping just
fine.  What's up with that?  The crimp-on connectors? 
Spent the whole afternoon on that and didn't even get
to the starter.  What's up with that?  Didn't need to
spend the extra $37 bucks right now either, though I
had planned on buying a spare fuel pump to have on
hand.  Guess I have that now.  Oh well, I learned to
land a hang glider today.  What a freaking trip.  If
anyone wants to know how to put a good ladder rack on
top, I've got the solution.  Thanks...KR
