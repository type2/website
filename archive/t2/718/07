I had the same problem, Heres the procedure I used
when installing the windshield on a 72 a few years
ago:
1) Get the glass mostly seated, with the exception of
a 3-4 inch piece of seal that just wouldn't go.
2) Get your wife\S.O. out there so you have soemone to
yell at when you get pi$$ed.
3) Wrestle with the glass for about 2 hours.
4) Smack the the glass with the palm of your hand
until a VERY LARGE CRACK forms and shoots across the
width of the glass.
5) Curse un-controllably while you hit your head on
the garage door repeatedly...
Of course, your mileage may vary ;^)
