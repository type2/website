Steveo,

Use the flat of the hand(like you were spanking it on an angle).

And never at the edges.  Learned this from watching an "old timer" install 
a new windshield in my 79 convertible.

New deluxe gaskets and metal are available from Wolfsburgwest.com

I use the same thing noew to lubricate as the "old timer" used....

Plain GOJO(from walmart).....really slick, easy cleanup, seems to make the 
seals grab harder after it dries.

Cheers, dave
