If your engine is in good condition, it should hold a valve adjustment for
6k miles or so, which is about how long (maximum) you should have for your
oil change interval, depending of the type of miles. 6k all city miles is a
lot harder on the engine than 6k miles when you are traveling 300 per day on
the highway, so if you do only city miles, shorten the intervals.

That said, I usually look at them when doing an oil change, which for me is
usually twice per year, I might do one before a long trip just for good
measure. There is such a think as "too much maintenance", which I used to
practice but don't have time for any more. I make it a habit to write down
the measured gap of each valve when doing the valves (before doing any
adjusting), it goes in my little log book that lives in the glove box. You
can notice potential problems before they become serious if you do this,
like maybe #1 intake is always tight, means the seat is probably sinking
into the head. If your engine is working properly, the valves should be a
bit loose when you adjust them. This is for solid lifter engines.
