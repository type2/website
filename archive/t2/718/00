Subject: Re: [T2] No power sheet metal cutting

 Personally speaking of legal/ethical circumstances I would take my torches and
tanks to the site and cut plenty wide, to allow for the distortion that results
from flame cutting.  With any of these approaches on sheet metal, it would be
wise to have a couple of buckets of water on hand... ;-))

Here in Fresno, Calif and every self-serve yard I know of in Calif, NO torches are allowed.
Even when I worked at a real wrecking yard back in 1970, we could not use a torch to remove rear 1/4's etc. We
had to use gas powered cut-off saws. And even then the sparks caught a lot of stuff on fire.

Almost all the self-serve yards now allow generators. Renting/borrowing one of them and a sawzall we work the
best.
