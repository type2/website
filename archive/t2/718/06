I agreee about the futon. I did it with a pile of laundry... <grin!> 

Inspect your engine and tranny mounts. I discovered the mount over the bellhousing on our bus had broken the rubber mounts allowing the whole thing to shift and make metal to metal contact transmitting 100% of the mechancial noises to the chassis and consequently my ears. 

Try making a vaccum in your bus... <grin!>
