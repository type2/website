This has been done, but beware that the Feds can still come and get you if
they get wind of it.  They usually get wind because some "good citizen"
(read, someone who has something against you) reports the violation.

The feds take the vehicle and if you are lucky you end up with nothing.
If you're unlucky you end up facing charges/fines/etc.

For the price, you could buy a nice bay and restore it!

On the aircraft side of things, it is perfectly legal and commonly done
(in the US) to buy a vintage airplane's paperwork and data plate and
build an entirely new airplane around them!  TANJ.
