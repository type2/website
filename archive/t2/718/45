>Good to know. Maybe I missed a post that explained it but did anyone tell us whose senders were good and okay to use with the VDOs? And are the cylinder head temp gauges good or just the senders are junk? 

The CHT senders are all largely the same: ring terminals with varying lengths of thermocouple wire. Only Dakota Digital has a gauge with cold junction compensation and thermocouple wire run all the way to the gauge. What this means is accurate CHT readings no matter what temperature the engine compartment or outside temperature is. It's only a little more than VDO which is a total waste of money in my opinion now I've found a better gauge.

As for oil temperature and oil pressure, all of the senders have poor/lazy accuracy. Even Dakota uses VDO senders for OT and OP. They are still useful to view and I would invest in VDO for the low cost.
