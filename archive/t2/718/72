Subject: Re: [T2] Needed Fuel Line Diagram for 78 Westy CA FI

Pretty much what you see is what you get.  Everything is in plain sight 
except for the one line that runs above the transmission.  I'd just pull 
them off and replace them one by one if you want to make sure everything 
goes back in its place.  Nothing too complex.  The only weird one is the 
line that goes between the filter and the pump.

I'd say the hardest part of the job is draining the tank.
