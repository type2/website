radical - what is the difficulty, did you do the work? i haven't seen one
out of the seal yet, but i suspect its flimsy.   i'm saving my old metal
strip. i intended on placing that into a deluxe wolfsburgwest seal when i
had the scratch. some research shows placing the metal in the seal first
which may give less room for error if it is to line up correctly.  - steve

Steve.......California Imports sells a new windshield seal with groove for
trim strip
for 39.95 and new metal trim strip set for 19.95.   I replaced both on my 71
deluxe
and it look  great. Be warned....replacing that aluminum trim strip into the
rubber
molding seperates the men from the boys.......
