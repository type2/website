Subject: Needed Fuel Line Diagram for 78 Westy CA FI

I am looking for a fuel line diagram for my Westy, 1978 FI CA Standard.  
Not in Bentley and not where GOGGLE said itwould be.  Looked on the Type 
II page, lots of articles but no diagrams.  Richard? Anyone else, can 
you assist me?  I'd like to see a picture/diagram before I go mucking 
around under the Van replacing lines.

Many thanks,

BEN
