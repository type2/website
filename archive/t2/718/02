<I towed a splittie that had loose lug nuts and almost lost a wheel had 
to rob some lugs off the other whells, also didnt have the cotter pins and 
axle nuts started to come off...>

We DID lose a front wheel on a parts car Super Beetle once that I was towing with my Super Beetle on a rope. Comical but could have been very dangerous... 

Oh to be young and inexperienced again ...
