There was a similar one I saw in Nevada, Iowa (that's town of Nevada, in
the state of Iowa) when I went to college in Ames, except that it had
two real axels, not three.  It had a V8 engine mounted dead in the
center, and they used the engine housing as a table.  The rear was a
separate bedroom space.

If it were up to me I would put a pair of poptops on the roof, one with
the hinge towards the front and the other towards the back...
