Thanks to everyone for the tip about the lower two screws! So, I can lower 
the engine a little without unbolting it from the tranny? I've only ever 
pulled the engine from a splitty.

I'll compare the hoses with my 77 Westy parked nearby, but I think they're 
going to the right place. I don't know where you could accidently hook up 
that size hose... I'll look tomorrow to see where the hoses came from. BTW, 
what's the little gizmo immediately to the right of the distribution box and 
behind (front is FRONT) the intake runner for cylinder 2? It has hoses to 
the Air Intake Elbow and the air distribution box and wires going to it.

I still have the original-type pleated paper air filter in the big black 
box. No sign of oil or gas there. Not sure what an "oiled cotton air filter" 
is. Do you mean the oil bath air cleaners like the early, upright engine 
bays?

Glad to have finally caused so much commotion,

Alex
