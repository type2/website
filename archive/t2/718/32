I just went through that same problem with my L-Jet injected EC motor. After
consulting this list and going through the methodical troubleshooting of
that FI system, the culprit was the pressure sensor not, as I thought, the
gas or tank or filter. So keep an open mind with that.

> I have the same problem with mine.  The gas has been sitting for a few
years.  I mixed some good gas in with it hoping that would help the problem,
didn't tho.  My engine runs until the gas is depleted from the gas filter, I
have a clear filter.  When it stops the filter fills back up and I can run
it until it gets depleted.  So, my next plan is to replace the filter and
see if that solves it.
