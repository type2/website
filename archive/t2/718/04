Subject: Re: [T2] No power sheet metal cutting

I use my Milwaukee Sawz-all and 120v inverter. My inverter is a bit underpowered for the job (300 watt with 600 watt surge) but if I limit my starting current with a slow pull of the trigger and no load starts, it goes just great! 

Have cut the front end off of a Corvair, motor mounts off of an early baywindow for my Corvair implant, chopped a Beetle in half, cut axles and mounts to remove a Beetle drivetrain. 

With full power available that saw can do wonders... With 300W inverter power it is slower but still a jewel.
