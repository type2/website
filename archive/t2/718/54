While we are at it...
Any opinion on the Gene Berg dipstick oil temp sensor for the upright engine?
No gauge to add there, it uses the stock oil light, but makes it blink
when oil get too warm and stay on when too hot.

What this means is accurate CHT readings no matter what temperature the engine compartment or outside temperature is. It's only a little more than VDO which is a total waste of money in my opinion now I've found a better gauge.
