I have the same problem with mine.  The gas has been sitting for a few years.  I mixed some good gas in with it hoping that would help the problem, didn't tho.  My engine runs until the gas is depleted from the gas filter, I have a clear filter.  When it stops the filter fills back up and I can run it until it gets depleted.  So, my next plan is to replace the filter and see if that solves it.
 
HTH, rudy
