At other occasions in addition to the soapy stuff,  I have used a thin
thread tied all around in the middle of the seal. When the thread is
pulled out of the seal with the window close to the frame, it lifts
the seal's lip and makes it jump on the right side.

 Wet the whole thing down with soapy water. You might use a plastic
knife to roll the seal edge back and allow you to floor the groove
more.
