have driven the section between Johnstown PA and Oakland MD within the
past year or so.
.  Johnstown to Somerset.  Good road you will make good time, be sure and
stop in Johnstown and ride the "incline plane" in your bus. very unique
experience.
.  Somerset to I-70  decent road Somerset is a 24/7 town with lots of gas
and grub. even reasonable motels and some even decent.
.  I-70  you know, no changes from last year
.  I-70 - Mchenry, good two lane road. can be crowded at times Deep Creek
is a resort town.
.  Mchenry to Oakland.  road deteriorates a bit, twists and turns but
can't remember any really steep hills. the route thru Oakland can be
confusing.

don't expect any real services to speak of between Somerset and Oakland.
except for a few short stretches you will be closer to 45 than 55mph

also have driven it between Davis and Huttonsville couple years ago.
steep, twisty and can have logging trucks, speeds closer to 30mph. can
still have snow in the Cheat Mountains at this late date.

rt 219 is a beautiful drive from what I know but it will take you
considerably longer than the routes you have taken in the past, it is
along the backbone of the Applachian mtns.

unfortunately I won't be able to make it to Everybus this year, conflict
in my schedule.

have a great trip and eat some chili for me.

Bob
