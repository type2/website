Subject: engine tin needed

I am in need of the two flat pieces of engine tin for a later pancake engine,
the two pieces that attach to the heater boxes and go below the push rod
tubes. These are the smaller square type pieces, not the larger ones for the
fat early heat exchangers.

I could also use one of the little connectors that connects the heat exchanger
to the fan shroud, the little piece with two holes. It essentially squashes
the bottom of the heat exchanger to the fan shroud outlet.

If any of you have these I can pay and pay for shipping them.

I appreciate any help or leads!!
