> Only Dakota Digital has a gauge with cold junction compensation and thermocouple wire run all the way to the gauge. What this means is accurate CHT readings no matter what temperature the engine compartment or outside temperature is. It's only a little more than VDO which is a total waste of money in my opinion now I've found a better gauge.

Hi Richard , 

3 questions:

1) if you need to have one and only one gauge it your vanagon, what would it be,  temp guage, oil temp, oil presure ?

2) Which model did you install from Dakota Digital ? I found  SLX-11-1 (guage) &  SEN 11-4 (sender unit)

3) Do you think we can mixed VDO guage and Dakota sending unit.

thanks ;-)


Vanagon 83
