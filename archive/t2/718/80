Subject: Re: [T2] windshield install resolved

Steve.......California Imports sells a new windshield seal with groove for 
trim strip
for 39.95 and new metal trim strip set for 19.95.   I replaced both on my 71 
deluxe
and it look  great. Be warned....replacing that aluminum trim strip into the 
rubber
molding seperates the men from the boys.......
