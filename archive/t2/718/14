Subject: Haul available from Roanoke-Knoxville-Chattanooga-Charlotte to 

I will be picking up an ebarf find this weekend and I have an empty 16
foot trailer available for a haul from my area near Roanoke through either
of two legs.  1st option, Roanoke-Statesville-Charlotte to Atlanta, the
2nd option, Roanoke-Bristol-Knoxville-Chattanooga to Atlanta.

The trailer hauls busses and other cars just fine.  Two weeks ago I did a
haul for Jamie Auch to Salem.

Contact me for any questions.
