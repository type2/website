It always seems that the people who have the ability to graft of cut down 
buses always have poor taste in paint and rims.

If this bus had one less set of rims, was a couple of feet shorter and was a 
nice 2 tone VW color I would probably be knocking people over to get a look 
at it. I have to admit I'd like to see what lies inside between the bed and 
the windshield.

Lastly I wonder how many people know that Cher sang a song called half breed 
hehe

"Gotta love the vintage
Cher artwork, though".
