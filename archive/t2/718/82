Subject: poptop: deep cleaning or painting

Hi anyone,

I could not really find any answer of my particular case in the 
archives, I think I've seen some answer in this list but they are too 
recent to be shown in the archives yet.
Here is my problem , I want to clean and change the seal of the poptop 
of my Vanagon 83
the poptop is in a fairly good condition except the edge where the seal 
was laying. The edge of the poptop is deeply rusty and need to be sanded 
for removal ( unless you have a miracle product to remove the rust)
I basically would like to sand the edge and only the edge because the 
rest of the poptop area is OK, apply locally a Marine gel coat 
(fiberglass) where I used to sand and use a 303 aerospace protectant on 
the rest of the surface fiberglass.

Does anyone have a better protocol ?  I would like to avoid painting the 
all poptop.
but in case I have to paint the poptop (Instead of using the 
protectant), is it ok to use my poptop as it is now (without sanding  
it) as a primer for a Marine gel coat ?

Thanks

Chris
