Check for:

spark plug wires arcing to the engine tin. 
Carbon tracks in the distributor cap
dwell (set your points - my #1 guess)
faulty ignition switch
loose coil wires or frayed wires

If it is sudden off and then on I'd guess ignition. If the power comes and goes gradually then I'd say fuel or vaccum leak.
