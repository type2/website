I would pull off every single hose underneath your tank and change 
them.  In doing this, you can also check all the metal lines and make 
sure that they are free from clogs.  It's something that you should do 
if you can't verify that it's been done before.  I found a few of my 
metal lines were smashed when the mechanics clamped the fuel lines.  
Also, if all of your lines are clean, then you might have something 
inside the tank.

to remove the firewall, there are the obvious screws that hold it to the 
front vertical side of the compartment - those are in plain sight.  The 
two that you can't see are from underneath.  You'll have to lay under 
the car with a flashlight and find 'em.  If I remember correctly, 
they're near the big metal supports that run under the bus.  If you 
compare where the firewall hits its lowest point on the left and right, 
you can see where the screws should be when you're underneath.

I doubt it will come out bottom first as I think the engine tin is in 
front of the firewall at the bottom.  I actually dropped my engine a few 
inches to make pulling the tank a little easier.  If you're going to do 
this pull I would also plan on changing *all* the vent lines in the tank 
compartment while you're going through the hassle.  You might also want 
to change the filler hose and the filler elbow as it'll make changing 
those parts much easier.

It might be oil from the crank ventilation.  Maybe you're getting some 
backfires?  I'm sure there are a few others that might have more insight 
on this.

yes, if you lower it a few inches, it makes it much easier to get the 
tank out.

Yeah, you definately missed those other two.  Go crawlin' under the bus 
and you'll find 'em.  nasty little buggers.

no prob.
