Wow, this sounds exactly like what I'm going through with my 76 Westy right
now, only I'm running stock FI. I'm in the process of pulling my tank to
verify there isn't something blocking the fuel outlet intermittently. I'm
starting there (after having verified that all the FI components are connected
to each other and aren't losing electrical power) because it's cheaper than
replacing FI parts. Start with the cheap and easy, and then cheap and PITA
(like the fuel tank), and then expensive (or give it to a real mechanic). ;)

Game on!

Hey list, need your help on a diagnosis. As always, pmail is welcome.
symptoms: cutout at speed started Friday. Usually on hills, but
sometimes on no-load downhill slowing. Sounds like engine skips a beat
but the wheels get engine spinning again. Stopped dead Friday in front
of my house. popped engine lid and checked the oil. not low, little
warm.

Sat morn, checked gas guage, seemed fine... started motor. puzzled,
checked fuel filter - almost full. hmm.. conclude I'm deluded and
paranoid, so I checked timing. So, the question to the list is:
does this sound like a dying fuel pump? a marble in the fuel tank?
simple clogged fule filter? something totally unrelated, like an
exhaust leak? Vapor lock caused by too much heat at the fuel pump (if
so, how would I fix that)?
All advice welcome,
Pail Manning
Lake Oswego, OR
1972 Westy (Hapy) 32/26 Weber on the motor, dual Solexes in a box -
maybe its time to reverse those conditions.
