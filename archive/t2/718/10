AKA Yellow fiberglass insulation?

OEMs are still using jute padding, foam covered door panels (with upholsterey over that) and tar panels. If you add enough your vehicle will be much quieter. Line the walls and floors with the tar panels. Overlay with the jute and carpet on the floor, foam door panels and fabric on the walls. It will be much quieter. 

Never as quiet as a Lexus I doubt due to the flat steel sides (drums) and all the exposed wood (nothing to absorb noise).

I still worry about massive quantities of foam and fiberglass in the walls. Rust makers... 

Of course fix all your exhaust leaks, muffler problems, and mechanical noises first. Fix those worn motor mounts. 

Also kill all the wind noise you can with new seals. Kill all leaks which might promote rust under all the additional interior material. 

Visit a junkyard and take a peek behind the upholstery and under the carpet of a luxury car or two. 

Consider alternatives to Dynamat. Too expensive. (Archives). Research some of the "spray on" noise controllers. Converts vibration (nosie) to low level heat the makers say. Maybe coat everything out of sight with that.
