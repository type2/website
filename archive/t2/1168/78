not quite the same  FI hAS THE INJECTORS DOWN AT THE HEADS SO NO GAS  
MIXTURE IS FLOWING THUR THOSE LONG RUNNERS TO freeze .  they also used  special 
gaskets at the head to manifolds. 
 
I have seen a couple of ways to increase the heat for the weber system,  
build air boxes around the manifolds , sucking hot air off the bottom of the  
engine,  another way was to wrap the intakes with heated seat pads.   later

What  does VW do in the real world to solve your
Weber centermount carb issue?  The intake design for fuel-injected VW
buses on our Type 4 style motors is  nearly identical to what you have
for your carb - long curved runners with  a center plenum. What did VW
provide to prevent icing on these runners when  their product is
running around the world in temperature extremes from ice  to desert?
