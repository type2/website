Subject: RE: [T2] Resistor Spark plugs & wires & Radio Static

I put a retrosound radio in my bus (new/modern), but the antenna is the
original antenna(I believe these were actually dealer installed). My orginal
radio - the 6V AM, actually was very good at picking up stations. Now I am
12V, and modern radio.

So does the quality of the radio affect the ability to pick up stations, or is
it the quality of the antenna or both?

I think it has more to do with the quality of radio and antenna.
