"Obviously the only thing that can prevent the fuel from going into the 
cylinder is if it is frozen onto the manifold walls under icing 
conditions. So now you are worried about overheating when it's freezing? 
We have already discussed temperature concerns. You have too many cooks

Long intake runners - isn't it about the fuel falling out of suspension 
in the air? What I don't know is if it is due to bends in the intake or 
a temp change. I know from experience that the long intakes as found on 
stock Beetles will freeze up if the intake preheater (tubes that bolt to 
the exhaust) is clogged up or disabled. I have had the same problem with 
a center mounted Weber on a bus. Both the Beetle and Bus freeze ups were 
on mild days. FWIW none of the car factories did centermounts as far as 
I know without some intake heating. You can preheat the air going to the 
carb or heat the intake. I think heating the intake is preferable with a 
bit of heating the air for cold weather starts.

Anyone want to add to or correct this?
