Where's the physics? Where's the law of conservation of mass? Where is
the fuel going? Did Capt Kirk authorize Scotty to transport it out of
the manifold so he could restart the matter-anti-matter reaction? Did
the Borg come and siphon it out so they could rekindle their dying
civilization?

Obviously the only thing that can prevent the fuel from going into the
cylinder is if it is frozen onto the manifold walls under icing
conditions. So now you are worried about overheating when it's
freezing? We have already discussed temperature concerns. You have too
many cooks spoiling your soup!
