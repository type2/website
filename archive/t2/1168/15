Subject: Re: [T2] Title Help needed

Tennessee is  a notoriously difficult state.  In GA, you can register a 
car with a bill of sale.  Not so in Tennessee.  Many years ago, my 
neighbor found a beautiful T-bird from the late fifties in a field out 
in the country and bought it for a song.  He rebuilt the engine and did 
a bunch of other stuff before looking into getting it titled.  He was 
never able to do so and basically just parted it out.  I'd call the 
state and ask a lot of questions.  Good luck....
