You said it still runs horribly.

+ Here is what he said he did at the shop ...

+ 2-discontected the vacuum tube to the  brake servo, brakes don't
+ cause the = engine to stall now, but the have NO brake assist 

Did he PLUG the vacuum port at the valve cover or just pull the hose
off? That's a GREAT BIG vacuum leak if that port isn't plugged very
well.

If he just pulled the hose off then "tuned around the vacuum leak"
you'll never get it to run right.
