Subject: Re: [T2] Third Seat in westy Floor?

Thanks Jonathan and all who have replied on this. I have no intention of
dismantling my interior. The question was posed by a gentleman this weekend
who we showed the bus to and I did not have the answer. I suspected the
anchors would be there but did not know for sure. As soon as I am able to
correct the title issue I have with the bus I will get some info out to the
list and some photos. Below is what I have been able to think of so far on the
bus. She has been a loving member of my family for nearly 10 years but we are
moving on our sailboat this summer and must sell everything. 
 
Bus is in
excellent mechanical condition but has
poor paint and some surface rust. No
cancer. Rust is primarily in doors of
which I have a clean rust free set.
Asking $4k. Happy to answer any
questions.Below are a few details I can think
of right now. 
Mileage: 100,500- Odometer just rolled over
and I cant believe
its the second time for this bus.
Engine: Stock 2.0 FI, built new 8 years ago
from case halves up
about 30k miles on engine to date. All parts balanced,
reground crank, new P/C, new
webcam grind 73
http://www.webcamshafts.com/pages/automobile/volkswagen/install_data/tc_00169
3_000544.html solid lifters so valves need adjusting. New SVDA dizzy from
Aircooled.net with
Electronic ignition. New valves and seats. Tons of other
engine stuff I cant
think of but if asked should be able to recall. Running
Mobil 1 full synthetic
since engine build. 
Fuel
Lines: All replaced last
year, regularly inspected. 
Interior: All original except front seats are from
'87
vanagon, brown dash, dash has been drilled to hold 3 VDO gauges below
stereo, Oil
Pressure, CH temp, Oil Temp. All westy kit except the leg for the
rear table.
Sink/Stove in great shape gas not connected. A few chips on
cabinet doors.
Fridge works but is not practical. Stock 120 volt plug and
battery charger. Have
stool and small table that goes by the dash. New poptop
canvas, pop top Seal could be
replaced as is starting to separate was replaced
a few years back. Brown plaid fabric in great shape, brown
OEM carpet in great
shape. Jealousie windows work well, one screen with a tear.
Snap in screen for
back hatch and kids cot for over front seats. Stock heat
works well but is not
super, inline bilge fan blower added which helps. 
Exterior:
Front doors have
rust as does back hatch, I have a set of these 3 doors in rust
free cond. Some
surface rust under windshield seal, in rear lower corners, and several other
areas.
No rocker rust or floor rust frame and wheel wells are all solid. Rear
section behind bumper below engine lid has
rust and should be replaced. All
rust has been treated with converter. Rear bumper is not terribly straight and
is not chrome (should be for champagne edition). Paint is brown below beltline
and white above. 
Tires: Yokohama Super van(?) Load rated D. 
Brakes: Replaced
all hoses, master cylinder, rear wheel
cylinders, turned drums and rotors
about 5 years ago with new pads and shoes.
Shoes and drums most likely still
fine, probably near time for front pads. 
Shocks: KYB rears. Fronts I forget.
Bought a few years ago
from Bus depot when they had them I think ther were TD,
TIB, or T something.
Suposed to be the cats meow and hard to find. New
Steering dampner. 
Exhaust: Stock heat exhangers and elbows with aftermarket
muffler, I think this one
http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=071251053C.
Im not crazy about
it but it works. Better solution would be to convert to
72-74 heat exchangers
and go with stock 72-74 muffler but thats just my
opinion. 
Other: Has westy
spare battery and charging relay, buper
hitch, Bosch Halogen headlights. 
We
drive the bus 2-3 times a month otherwise
it sits in my garage. It runs very
well and I would not be nervous taking it on
a road trip. We do 3-4 family
camping trips out to WV every summer. I had
planned to try to sell in earnest
this spring. I have to get the title
corrected. Currently it is titled as a
'72 and has a '72 vin plate because the
guy I bought it from swapped the vin
plate for a '72 so he could get historic
tags in MD back when a '78 would not
qualify. When I bought it he couldnt find
the '78 title. I have the correct
vin plate and im in the process of getting the
correct title but that will
probably take 6 weeks or so. Once I have the
correct title I will pull the
windshield and reinstall the correct vin plate.
Then probably begin to try and
sell.

Ted,

Consider selling your
Champagne for a VERY large profit (if it is nice) and look for a '74-'75 Westy
with a full rear bench seat. That will give you the extra seating you are
looking for (5 passenger vs. 4 passenger). '74-'75 have the full upstairs bed
and the '75 models are fuel injected. 

Another option is a '72-'73 model. You
would have type 4 motor (carbureted) with a 5 seat arrangement. Two in back,
one jump-seat and two in front. The sacrifice is you only have the roof cot
and a much smaller standing space and no fuel injection. 

Unfortunately,
unlike the early models, the cabinets on a late model Campmobile ('76-'79) are
not in modular units. They are all designed to bolt together as one large
solid unit.

If you are set with modifying your Champagne, pulling the
cabinets will expose several holes in the floor and one in the side of the
bus.There are holes for the sink drain, water tank drain, and propane feed
line. There will also be a hole in the side of the bus for the sink drain
vent. 

You will have up to 3 accessory wires exposed. If you are removing the
center cabinet only, there will be a red wire running from the water pump to
the fuse panel. If removing the refrigerator, there will be two more. One from
the city power plug to the outlet on the bench seat panel and one from the 2nd
battery to the refrigerator. 

Also there are no trim panels on the wall of
the bus and you will have exposed insulation. The rear panel on the driver's
seat will be exposed metal and the carpet will end where the cabinet began.
Underneath the carpet is a wood panel that will need to be removed to access
the bench seat hold down plates as well as seatbelt anchors. All Campmobiles
start out as a passenger Kombi, so everything is there for seat anchors and
seatbelts. 

Instead of trying to shoehorn in an extra bench or jump-seat, you
would be better off pulling the entire Westy interior and getting a rear and
center bench seat and all the trim from a regular transporter. But then, why
not just get a transporter? I'm sure there are MANY folks who would trade you
straight across for your Champagne. Heck I would be tempted to find a nice
transporter, buy it and then trade you! :) 

I hope that gives you an idea of
what is under there and answers your questions,

Jon Stiles
