I just got this info from cr*tchfield.

"If the noise was constant for all sources then it's normally coming over
the power or ground connection. If it's just for the AM/FM then it's
normally coming through the antenna connection. Here's an adapter you can
use for antenna noise:"

 

So maybe I need one of these -

rch=antenna_noise&skipvs=T> &skipvs=T

 

or this

I wonder if the fact that my antenna is original, and my car was originally
only had an AM radio has anything to do with my issues? I would think not,
as I get decent reception when I am parked. Other possible causes of the
problem-I have put that foil bubble wrap on the inside  of my bus.

HI Kevin,
            More often than not the interference is coming in to the radio
through the power wires.  A line filter from Radio Shack often cures that
issue.  Easy to install. jon
