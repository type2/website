Scott -

You do NOT lose spark power with a resistor plug, that's been an urban
myth for as long as I can remember and if so, it's so negligible, most
don't know it unless it's a racing engine on the strip.  I don't have
the empirical data at my finger tips, but my in my own personal
experience I have not had any degradation in power or mileage running
resistor spark plugs for the past two decades - my "seat of the pants"
impression in Bugs, Buses and Vanagons has assured me of this as well.
 All of my vehicles in my signature run resistor spark plugs with no
problems whatsoever. Many vehicles, domestic or import have run the
suppressed ignition wires and resistor plugs combination from the
factory for at least the past 3 decades if not more.

YMMV tho :)
