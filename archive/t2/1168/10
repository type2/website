Wow - I remember reading Charlies ramblings when I first got my bus and 
joined the list. That was 1996 (I have a plaque from the show stuck up in 
the roof) which seems a loooong time ago.

It makes me realise that for both of my VW's, I am the longest owner by far. 
Maybe it's me, but once I own one I don't see the appeal of buying a 
replacement. You only have to fix all the DPO's "issues" all over again !
