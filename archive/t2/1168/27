People don't post much, but they can.  http://type2.com/type2charter.html
is accessable from type2.com, hit "type2" in the menu on the left, then the
"charter" link on that page.  Similar for the vb list.

The only restrictions are unsolicited commercial vendor posts and "my stuff
is on ebay" or "check this thing out on ebay!" posts.

Perfectly acceptable.   Generally it's a good idea to keep the actual sale 
discussion offlist - but discussion -about- the sale, ie: "how many miles" 
or "oh, yeah, you can find those headlight lenses for $10 over here" are
fine.
