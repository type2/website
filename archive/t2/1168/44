Stan,

Are you looking for camping interior parts, or general bus parts
(dashboard, seat belts, guages, ...).

There are many sources for parts, including Bus Depot and Cip1.

If you are looking for an interior, you can look for a used one on
thesamba.com, or a place like WWW.RVTEC.CO.UK (I couldn't dig up their US
site address) that is making new ones in Florida.

These sites are by no means a comprehensive list.  I'm sure others will add
their favorites.
