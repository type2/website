Subject: [T2] 15 years ago

Just wow!  I remember the envy I felt reading Charlie's posts leading  
up to and during his trip.  I also remember some of the various  
'characters' that were on this list 15 years ago.  This list could  
stand a few more of them (or anyone else ) - no offense to the  
regulars who post now.  Things certainly have changed.  I unsubscribed  
from this list some years ago, not having enough time to read all the  
posts.  Last year I needed ball joint advice, re-subscribed and was  
was amazed at how many fewer posts there are in compared to "the old  
days".  Its not all bad though - not nearly as many "how do I get my  
heat to work better?" posts to wade through in the winter months.
