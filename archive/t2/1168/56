Subject: Friday: Nader's blunder

	I know little more than this about the demise of the Corvair. 
(I know more about Nader's sister, a Professor of Anthropology at 
Berkeley.)  But what little I know of the Corvair itself is largely 
favourable, and leads me to the tentative inference that GM was 
unjustly obstructed by R Nader from a promising line of development.
	The power-to-weight ratio of that motor must have been one of 
the very best from Detroit up until then (and for quite some time 
afterwards, I'd guess).  Surely the handling problems were tractable 
-  if Porsche can subdue the oversteer of their far more powerful 
rear-engined cars, could it be beyond the wit of Detroit to develop 
satisfactory handling in their rear-engined vehicles?
	And the 'flat' conformation of the engine was a big help in 
making a van with max unobstructed load space  ...  The Yanks even 
had the sense to make the fan lower than mine 8-)

	Have any rtd GM staff said what influence VW's success had on 
GM's urge to make an aircooled flat-6?
