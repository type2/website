Subject: Re: [T2] Third Seat in westy Floor?

Two thoughts came to mind, both are stolen from later model campers.
 First, mount a rear facing jump seat behind the front passenger seat.

The second is a small middle seat, like on the Eurovans:

For a little extra background on the situation, my friend (the potential
buyer) has 3 kids and wasn't looking for a camper per se, but Ted's bus is
nice and local so we are all brain storming some ideas.

I mentioned the 74-75 set up to my friend which I'm keen on (I have this
setup in my 1968 tin top).

I agree with the earlier posts that you don't really want to pull all of
the cabinets unless the plan was to swap it for a 74-75 interior.
