Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pump outlet reseating?

Gerald,

On SU carbs (notorious for this problem) on the Triumph, I have had
excellent luck knurling the inlet tubes, then sealing with a fuel safe gasket
sealer on installation.  The sealer might not have even been necessary, but I
didn't want to be back.  I did a light knurl in the lathe with medium knurls.
If you got a buddy with same, should take only as long as it takes to put the
knurler tool on the toolpost, which if a quick change is about 5 seconds,
chuck the tube (20 seconds) and run the knurl, another 30-60 seconds.  2
minutes maybe, 5 minutes with BSing.  Probably not even worth a bottle of beer
but it helps

You might try (and I've done this when lathe poor) hand knurling
rolling the tube on a flat steel (vice) with a flat coarse file an all the
pressure I could exert, but this only really works for soft (copper) tubing,
though you can get just a bit of pattern in mild steel tube.

John

Either I'm not using the right search terms or no one has ever
documented a
good way to get a press-in fuel pump outlet to seat
properly and stay seated.
Newer style Chaiwanese mechanical pump. Have already re-pressed it
after
smearing with fuel safe gasket glue/sealer (high tack stuff).
Lasted about a
month. Smelled fuel when I got back from a short run
yesterday and had a
steady drip. Clamped the inlet line closed. Grabbed
the outlet and it easily
came out in my hand.
