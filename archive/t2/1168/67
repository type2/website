I have to agree with you Scott. Dual throat carbs trump single throat.
Center mount carbs are just fine as long as the driver understands their
inherent limitations.

Fuel injection is great as well as long as it is kept stock or as long as
you don't mind some exhaustive tuning on a custom system.

I have dual 36mm Dellortos on my Type 1 powered '68 Double Cab and
absolutely love them. Power, economy and reliability.

I have the factory Fuel Injection on my Type 4 powered '78 Campmobile and
absolutely love it. Power, economy and reliability.

Greg's FI system absolutely screams, and he has the right attitude to own
it. :)
