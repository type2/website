Subject: BC late may

> Heading to B.C. in late May 2012 ... love to rent a bus/vanagon for 6 days
or so .. OR ... I currently have a 60, 78, and 82 - all licensed and insured
and running strong .... be nice to find someone on the west coast who wanted
to borrow an 82 vanagon in eastern ontario in exchnage for lending a bus or
vanagon in B.C. for 6 days in May ... OTOH ... I've been considering getting
my 78 or 82 to the coast and leaving it there for a year or so ... then just
fly out and use it ... hmmmm ....
