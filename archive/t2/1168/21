Subject: RE: [T2] List protocol on parts needed, parts for sale?

I need a headlight trim ring and a parking light lens for a 72.  I also need
parking light gaskets, but I want to get those new, may get the lenses new
as well, depending on pricing.

I have a complete self contained AC unit that looks like a dealer installed
option I will never use that I would like to sell.

Thanks

Joe
