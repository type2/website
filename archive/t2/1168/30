Subject: Used OEM optional overhead AC unit for sale

Here is a photo of the unit I found on Google, (the only one I could find,
actually):

I can provide photos of the actual unit if anyone is interested.  

It came with my bus, but not installed, I am told it was an OEM dealer
installed option and was pretty rare, but other than that I don't know much
about it.  

Please contact me offlist if there is interest.   I'll never use it and I'd
rather have funds for the bus and crank down the windows if I get warm.  

TIA!
