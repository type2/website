Subject: Re: [T2] dual carb option

The reason why I think dual throat dual carbs are better than single
throat carbs is due to the fact that two manifold paths must combine
into one in an upside down 'Y'. When one intake valve closes, this
causes a shock wave which travels back and interferes with the intake
for the other intake valve on the other cylinder served by that carb.
I believe a crossover tube between the two single throat carbs helps,
but doesn't completely counteract this issue.

By 'Better', I am trying to convey some sense of overall efficiency
and effectiveness at carburation.
