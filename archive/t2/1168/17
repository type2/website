Subject: Resistor Spark plugs & wires & Radio Static

Sorry to get in late on the discussion of plugs.I don't really know what
type of plug I am using-I generally just get the Bosch type specified and
sold by our friendly vendors. Are all plugs resistor plugs these days? Ie is
that the current standard issue from my FLAPS and online VW vendors? If I
check my plugs-is there some  designation on them to indicate that they are
"resistor" type plugs?

 

I ask because my radio in my '65 gets tons of static when I'm driving it,
but is crystal clear when the engine is off. So I think I'm getting static
from something. If it is as easy as changing my plugs I'll that.
