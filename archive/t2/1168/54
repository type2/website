Sure they both do Kevin.  I recall test data propaganda by Pioneer back in the
day probably when their "Supertuner III" came out comparing its frequency
discrimination to their original Supertuner and some competitors, and how much
better it was, blah, blah, blah, and I think that for FM only as even by the
late 80's no-one cared about AM radio anymore.  And undoubtedly antenna
quality will play in as well (and in AM isn't a lot of it tuning mast length,
some EE or hamster out their will comment.)  I know dad, who worked as
engineer for 1 AM station and 2 FM stations when I was growing up was always
babbling about "mast length" for some reason, and I don't think he was
compensating for anything...  We would be hurtling along backroads of WV to
drive to transmitters in 2 feet of snow in the '73 or '76 with the usual 10
square inches of visible unfrosted open windshield and I recall the like
seemingly 10 feet of extended mast would be whacking on
 lowhanging trees.  Somehow I was always on those trips, usually sitting on
the floor in the back playing with some toys with a 1/2 ton of electrical test
equipment stacked around me, ahh for better safer times.
 
I'd also bet that
in todays world the quality, particularly of the AM tuner section in a modern
radio is done to an extreme minimum price, with little care for use as they
don't expect you to be listening to broadcast radio, just have it there for
the hell of it.

So does the quality of the radio affect the ability to
pick up stations, or is
it the quality of the antenna or both?
