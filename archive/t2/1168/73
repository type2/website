Subject: Handbrake adjustment problem - solved!

After a frustrating couple of attempts to adjust my handbrake according to
Bentley I identified and fixed the problem using the approach described by
Colin 'Amskeptic' on The Samba:

I posted this as I thought others may be scratching their heads over the same
problem.

What happens is that when the linings are worn (but in my case still well
within tolerance) the linkage in the drum pulled by the handbrake cable hits
the bearing housing preventing any further pressure being applied to the
shoes. Grinding a small bit off this linkage allows it to travel further and
the handbrake to be adjusted correctly.
