Subject: Re: [T2] More Spark Plug Tightening Info

Josh, you really never noticed that before....
 
Pretty much all plug
manufacturers do spec usually somewhere between 1/4 (more commonly in my
experience) - 2/3 turn past contact for metal gasket, 1/16 turn past contact
for tapered seat in their instructions.  Some go so far as to mention you can
use the 1/16 past contact when re-installing a crushed metal gasket plug. 
I've known pros who have done it according to something like that for years. 
Again I still feel it is mostly aggresious overtightening that causes issue,
and this would not constitute same.  But like anything done in such a manner
establishing "clean contact" to start your turn is open to a bit of debate,
probably one that the anti-antiseize croud will bemoan.  The 1/16 turn for
tapered seat gives one an insight into how fast torque and clamping pressure
build.
 
I do find the French made NGK plugs pretty curious...

I had never noticed this before.
It looks to say once the plug
is fully seated
(by hand I assume), tighten another 1/2 to 2/3 turns if the
plug has a crush
washer.
If the plug is designed without a washer, then only
tighten another
1/16 turn.

I know VW has a torque spec for plugs, but after
reading a lot of
articles and discussions here (e.g. anti-seize discussion) it
seems that these
recommendations from the NGK packaging should be fine.
