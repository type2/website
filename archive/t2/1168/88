Subject: Vanagon seats compared - question

Hey folks!

A while back (years ago) I bought a pair of early Vanagon seats for our 
'78.

I'm 5'11" and the seats put me looking out of the very top of the 
windshield.

Are late Vanagon seats lower? What years would late Vanagons be? 85+ or 
86+ or???

Am looking to recover these seats and can modify them if necessary to 
sit lower but would rather not...

Looking for an affordable slip in fix.

Did some junkyard hunting a few months ago for CR-V parts and it looks 
like all the Fiero and MR-2s are gone around here. I would have figured 
that those seats would have fit lower too.

We have the stock seats but they are going to need new springs in 
addition to new pads and covers.

Any suggestions?
