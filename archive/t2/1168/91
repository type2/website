Subject: RE: [T2] what would you do?

Thanks for the FREE advice guys.

I spent the day working on the fuel line, new fuel pump solved the idling
problem, so I replaced all the lines while I was at it, and added a new fuel
filter.

When I put a new pressure regulator on, my problems returned!  Turns out, the
NEW fuel press reg was defective, so put the old one back on.

So now she runs , but runs really rough :(   hesitates, and all but stalls,
but at least I can get her up to 50 mph.  So I am thinking of putting in a new
distributor.  And am gravitating towards a brand new one with petronix
ignition.  GOOD  or BAD choice?  Any thoughts?

Thanks again!
Jim
