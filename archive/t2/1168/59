Subject: Re: [T2] More Spark Plug Tightening Info

This all seems crazy to me.  I've never used a torque wrench, I've
always used anti-sieze and I've never had an issue.  Maybe I've just
been lucky but I've been following this thread simply out of curiosity
of how detailed some people get and I wonder if we are all way over
thinking it.  I for one have NEVER been accused of over thinking
anything.  Just my .02.
