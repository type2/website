Kevin -

The original and replacement spark plug wires from Bosch are generally
well suppressed with 1Kohm spark plug connectors and are usually
sufficient to eliminate the "staccato" effect of static on your radio.
 How old are your wires?  Might be time to replace them.  You can also
install an inline noise suppressor on your positive wire to the radio
to further help suppress noise - pick one up at any stereo or
electronics supply shop.  Resistor plugs do go a long way in further
suppression of noise.  Other sources of RF noise is the DC generator
as well.  If upgraded to an Alternator, these are usually suppressed
very well to prevent noise.

If using Bosch plugs, look at the metal portion below the hex.  If it
starts with "WR", then it's a resistor plug.  If it starts with just a
"W" followed by the number, then it's a non resistor plug.  Since
Bosch discontinued non resistor plugs in the past 2 or 3 years I
imagine your FLAPS or online vendors have just the resistor
version....unless they have old inventory of course

If using NGK, "BR" is a resistor plug, "B" followed by the number is a
non-resistor plug.  AFAIK, NGK still provides non-resistor plug (for
now).
