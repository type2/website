As quick as I can, here is the road I have been on trying to get some Bus
glass.

Vandals break 2 side windows, one in sliding door and the direct opposite
on the left center. Both are the same common 3/4 pane for use with vent
window.

Buy a pair from the Samba list. He sends one correct pane and one 3/4 REAR
side glass.

Buy another from another Samba guy. He ships UPS. I try to watch for
deliver van but miss it. Get a note on box. Sign that. Next day I watch
more but miss the delivery. Within 45 minutes of delivery notice on line,
I go down and the sig note is gone and there is no parcel. Who would just
grab a big box on spec that it might be pawned for cash?? Did UPS break it
and use the sig card as an out and just trashed the parcel, not leave it.
All speculation, but end result, another painful pane paid for and not
received.

So, I need one 3/4 center side pane still, if anyone has got one, with
shipping to 99201. I have a rear 3/4 side pane for anyone who wants it for
$25 shipped USA lower 48.

Thanks,
