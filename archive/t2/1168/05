I used them to title an abandoned '82 Westy about seven or eight years ago. 
Pain free. Sent them the paperwork they asked for, a check and in about six 
weeks I had a bill of safe from Maine. Took it and the Westy to the DMV, 
paid my fees and had a shiny new Oregon title.

Easy peasy.

was thinking I could go through a title service like these guys:
http://www.its-titles.com/  to get the correct title. Have any of you used a
service like this and if so how does it work? Or is there a better/easier 
way.
