Subject: Title Help needed

So it looks like Im going to be selling my '78 Champagne Westy and I need to
get a title issue fixed. When I bought the bus from a friend he had put a vin
plate from a '72 on it so it would qualify for historic tags in MD because
when he had it '78 would not. When he sold me the bus he gave me the correct
vin plate but didnt have the correct title. It has been titled as a 72 for the
nearly 10 years I have owned it and Im not sure how many years before.
 
 I
was thinking I could go through a title service like these guys:   
http://www.its-titles.com/  to get the correct title. Have any of you used a
service like this and if so how does it work? Or is there a better/easier way.
 
Thanks, 
 
Ted
