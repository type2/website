I think it has more to do with the quality of radio and antenna.
Different radios pull signals better than others and different
antennas have different gains.  The Chinese knockoff radio in my 2009
GTI loses signal when I drive through the Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel
which goes under the Chesapeake Bay.  The Pioneer radio in my 1995
F150 never misses a beat going through the same tunnel.  My guess is
its the radio but an argument could be made that the GTI has the
little sharkfin roof antenna and the F150 has the older style hood
mounted antenna.
