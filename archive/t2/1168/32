Subject: RE: [T2] Resistor Spark plugs & wires & Radio Static

Thanks for the info.

The wires to my radio are new, I installed one of those retrosound radios,
that sort of look old, but are new, and allow you to connect any sort of
extra (like SD card, USB flash drive, or anything with a 3.m MM headphone
type jack). It also comes with a remote-which should be handy when camping. 

The first one I got had all sorts of problems, but they were very nice about
exchanging for a new one, and it works well-except I'm still having static
on the radio while driving. I have a generator on my engine-and have thought
about upgrading to alternator.

They suggested a few things to try to figure out where the static was coming
from, but I have just been too busy to get to it. Maybe this weekend. On of
them was an inline suppressor-like you suggested. This radio has two wire
connections to it-one is supposed to be for 'memory' and always hot, and the
other is for when the bus is running. I hooked them both up to the
battery-as I sometimes like to listen to the radio when parked. 

I'll check my plugs next tune up-as I don't remember what is in there.
Sounds like if the plug has an R on it, then it is a Resistor type plug. My
plugs are probably more than a few years old-as my bus was off the road for
a while, and I know I had a stock of plugs-from buying a LOT of extras by
mistake.
