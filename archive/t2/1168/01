Subject: RE: [T2] AW code NGK spark plug question

Thanks, this is what I was after.  I will be driving the bus summers in SW
Ohio and I live in the country so I will be driving mostly 55 max on back
roads.  Driving old school VW diesels have taught me that when they gear
something for 55, it is happiest and lives longest around that speed so I
stay within that range.  

BR6ES it is.  I always used Bosch Supers but as previously noted, quality
seems to have taken a crap when they were outsourced.

To add to John Kolak's information:

I have used NGK BR5ES and the Bosch equivalent W8CC/WR8CC in both carbed and
FI enngines, both working just fine.  However, if you do alot of prolonged
driving at speed, I recommend the BR6ES or the W7CC/WR7CC plugs.  BTDT.
