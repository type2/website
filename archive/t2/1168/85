>>What I mean is if I pull up
the carpet should I expect to find the plates or whatever that the bench seat
would bolt up to <<
 
Yes, if you remove the floor in your camper, you should
find the attachment points for the other bench seat welded in the floor. You
will just need to get those little bolts\nuts that fit into the brackets and
are used for this purpose.
 
PEACE!

shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and
headed on toward the
police officer's station..."
