I guess I don't understand what is going on then. 

When I sit in my car, in the driveway,  I can pick up the radio signals no
problem. Comes in clear.

But when driving around-I seem to lose the signal. I guess I'll try to pull
over where I am losing the signal, and see if I can get the station in that
location with the bus not moving.

I think it will be dry tomorrow, so I'll try to take a test run then.

Antenna noise is just another name for poor signal.
Get closer to the broadcast antenna.
