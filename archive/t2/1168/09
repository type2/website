Subject: Re: [T2] AW code NGK spark plug question

I use the NGK BP6ES or BP6ET in my 74 AW code bus. I run good plug
wires so RF interference is not an issue. Why use a resistor plug and
throw away good spark power? I'm going the opposite direction, with a
Mallory Hyfire CDI, I swapped in a resistorless rotor in the
distributor, aiming for maximum spark at the plugs.
