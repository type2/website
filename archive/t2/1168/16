Thanks Jim,

I should have looked it up before I typed.
Sure enough, A little googling confirms you were right that resistor
plugs cause no performance degradation, and that for some CDI systems
are necessary to avoid problems.
My Mallory Hyfire CDI wants non-resistor plugs, so it looks like I'm ok.
