Subject: More Spark Plug Tightening Info

I recently ordered some NGK spark plugs for another vehicle.

I was looking
them over as I was curious about the markings and to see where they were made
(France).

I also looked at the box and noticed the following pictrogram which
appears to give instruction for their installation:

I had never noticed this before.
It looks to say once the plug
is fully seated (by hand I assume), tighten another 1/2 to 2/3 turns if the
plug has a crush washer.
If the plug is designed without a washer, then only
tighten another 1/16 turn.

I know VW has a torque spec for plugs, but after
reading a lot of articles and discussions here (e.g. anti-seize discussion) it
seems that these recommendations from the NGK packaging should be fine.

Any
thoughts on this or other rules of thumb?
