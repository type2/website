 It sounds as if you have decided not to take it back to the mechanic and
to deal with any issues yourself.  I would start with the basics.  Validate
the valve lash is set correctly (since the mechanic futzed with that).
 Then validate your timing is set correctly.  Another thing which can
really help on initial troubleshooting is compression testing.  Checking
the engine compression and spark up front can help to reduce the systems
you have to troubleshoot after the first steps.
