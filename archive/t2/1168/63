Subject: dual carb option

A friend on my VW web site has a type 2 with the type 4 engine and he bought
the setup below for his bus and loves it.  The guy that rebuilt his engine
for the bus was so impressed he bought a set for his squareback.

I have read, and been told, that the single Weber setup can lead to problems
with running lean because of the long intake runners.  Lean usually = hot
and on an aircooled hot does not = good.  Dual carbs would seem to be a
better solution to avoid the lean condition and this seems reasonably
priced.  I'm somewhat used to synchronizing twin carbs from my days with
early Volvos and SU carbs, I probably still have the kit somewhere.  

Has anyone used this setup or have any comments on it?   

TIA

Joe
