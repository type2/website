Subject: List protocol on parts needed, parts for sale?

Hey all -

Is there much posting on here with regard to used type 2 parts or does
everyone use The Samba etc?  

I need a few things for the 72  and have a few things that came with my bus
that I don't need and would like to sell.  

On the bricklist for example, members post up what is needed or for sale and
just request contact offlist.  I'm just wondering how it works here.  

TIA

Joe
