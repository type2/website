Yep,

Chuck is right. The antenna size will have something to do with 
reception also. For FM, try setting your telescoping antenna to about 
30". This will maximize the reception over that band of frequencies. 
Turns out to be about a 1/4 wave at the center of the FM band. For AM, 
the long wire (about 982 ft for full wave) required is a little 
impractical for mobile applications.
