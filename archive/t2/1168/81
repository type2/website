I am not sure where you live but most courts would say you owe something for
the services.
That is even though it sounds like you didn't get anything that you paid for.

I have a 71 and had similar issues with my breaks.
No shop in the USA can disconnect your vacuum and call that a repair.
If you were to have an accident as a result I would hate to be that mechanic.

I had my break servo rebuilt and with a new master cylinder as well as the
shifter adjusted and few other small items and paid about $650.

All you have to do to disconnect the vacuum is plug it with vise grips or a
rubber plug or simply put a valve in the line and close it.
Any of those options should be about 15 minutes of work.

As for the other items I can say why they were done unless you requested it.

The biggest time consumer I hear you mention is pulling the gas tank.

However I can't begin to think of why you got a paint job you didn't ask for.

I think I would give serious thought to going back for service.

I have had my own bad experience where I gave more than one shot to a local
shop only to pay less to actually get the repairs done elsewhere.

Not sure why someone who doesn't know what they are doing always cost more.

My guess is that since they have no clue it takes them longer.
