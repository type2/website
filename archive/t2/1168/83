Subject: Third Seat in westy Floor? 

I have a '78 Westy and was wondering if I removed the sink and stove cabinet
would it be possible to install another bench seat like is in some hard top
non westy's? Im thinking of a stock VW bench seat. What I mean is if I pull up
the carpet should I expect to find the plates or whatever that the bench seat
would bolt up to or would I likely need to weld some in or otherwise figure a
way to bolt down the seat? 
 
Thanks,
