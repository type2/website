Hi John,

 

The second skin damplifier stuff I am applying is actually the silver stuff.
That is all I have applied so far-just two layers over the engine and rear
wheel wells, and one layer everywhere else.

 

I think the new version of this stuff is black. I think the silver should be
better at blocking IR, thereby keeping the bus warmer in winter, and cooler
in summer.

 

Was writ:

"How does Second Skin differ from the silver stuff?"
