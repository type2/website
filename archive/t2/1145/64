My son has a 2009 Caddy Life Camper here in Australia.  This is his  
second one. He is a
window cleaner and does high mileage (about 80,000 kms in 2 + years)  
and he loves it.

Great sleeping arrangement with the back seat forming the bed,  
hanging bags that act
as curtains but hold al the clothes plus heaps of room inside and the  
added tent that
clips around the lift up rear hatch.  Even came with table and 2  
chairs that all fit in their
own places under the rear seat.

His is fitted with the 1.9 turbo diesel (77kw/250 nm torque) and  
manual gearbox.  Gets
around 800 kms per tank.

If I ever have to relinquish our 76 camper I could be tempted as a  
semi-replacement.
But as the Kombi will probably be with us for a long time (fingers  
crossed) I don't need to
consider that yet.
