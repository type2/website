The process is that revving the engine up to a high RPM creates a lot
of suction that is supposed to pull air through the carb throat. When
you choke off the air flow by hand, it creates a high vacuum that has
to pull something in from somewhere, so it sucks fuel through the
jets, which hopefully pulls any stuck dirt with it. If the dirt is too
large, the method is unsuccessful and the carb has to be disassembled
for cleaning.

 is not actually backfire, if that term strictly denotes an explosion in the
 exhaust, but what could be better called BLOWBACK in the carb.

Well, a healthy engine won't blowback. Blowback happens when you have
a stuck intake valve that allows the combustion chamber explosion to
leak into the intake manifold. Exhaust explosions are called wrap
down, at least when they are small and continuous as a symptom of
exhaust system leaks.
