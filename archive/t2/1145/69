Subject: auxiliary blower fan and placement

Hi everyone,

A while back I picked up a used blower similar to this one sold by JC
Whitney<http://www.jcwhitney.com/12-volt-heater-blower-kit-vw/p2002905.jcwx?TID=8014524FT2&zmam=15972153&zmas=21&zmac=165&zmap=12905G>

I cleaned it up and tested it, lo and behold it works. I crawled under the
bus to try and determine where to mount the thing but I can't find anywhere
except in place of the accordion tubes.  I found instructions online for
another blower system,
http://www.vaglinks.com/Docs/VW/BeetleI/Mechotronix.com_Aircooled_VW_InstaHeat_Install.pdf
and
that is where they install. I however, have one blower, not two. If I mount
it in place of one accordion tube will I affect the characteristics of the
engine in any way?

My bus is a '71 with the stockish 1600dp engine.

I would think mounting it in a central location would be best but I cannot
find anywhere under the bus to place it without cutting the main heater
channel tube.

Any hints or advice would be appreciated.

Thank you.
