 Drive these newer things and you will miss the camaraderie, the
 eGroups,  the waves from others, and the envious looks and sighs from
 those who  stop by to say you how they wish they had one. They always
 seem to materialize just as you think of selling and it changes your
 mind so fall in love with it again,  you plod on, and fix that
 something that always needs doing and makes you a westy owner!

Well spoken O of JnOK!

Normally loyalty is something you reserve for human beings rather than
machines, but what the VW engineers did for us in the air-cooled VWs
in general, and in the buses in particular was something that
engineers don't give the public anymore - simplicity, ruggedness,
durability, and something that was intended to be worked on at home
without too much trouble. Plus the no-hype design that appealed to
people to reject fadiness.
