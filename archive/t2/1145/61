Subject: [off topic] a classic automobile

No, I haven't won the lottery, but on the off chance
it is still Friday somewhere, has anyone any info on
this?  http://www.southernmotorcompany.com/profile/

I sort of figure they went broke pre-production, but
perhaps some one of you is in South Carolina or in
the know.  I'm dreaming of this vehicle, I gotta admit.
