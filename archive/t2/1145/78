Hi Kevin,

I recently did most of my camper with the Second Skin Damplifier Pro - just
kept buying irregular discounted sheets until I had enough. I did the front
and cargo floor after doing some rust repair and POR15. Noticeable
difference, altho I might add another layer in the front:

I think that in addition to the sound deadening, it will also stave off
rust, as the little leaks I have simply collect on top of the foil. I also
made sure the edges of each piece overlapped some, and mashed then together
to (hopefully) create a seal such that water will not leak under.

I used the foil bubble wrap on top of the Second Skin in the sliding door
and along the driverside wall, behind the rear seat and on the wheel wells,
and plan to add it to the rear deck after I add more Second Skin. I hope
this will isolate the heat somewhat from the engine, but still allow me to
hear it enough to mentally monitor while cruising.

On the cargo floor, I put one layer of Damplifier, and then a layer of foam
sound reducing matting (from another vendor), then the subfloor and vinyl
flooring: http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/782456.jpg

I plan to get some Damplifier on the nose - instead of the oh-so-effective
styrofoam vaguely glued there by VW - and then the foil bubble "insulation".

Instead of spraying inside, I got their Spectrum product to spray on the
underside of the bus, but have yet to do so.

Over all it's been a great improvement - I imagine it will be amazingly
quiet once I spray the underside.  Cheers, Mike
