If everyone had this thought, no one would have bought the VW busses when new.
Or when they switched from split windows to bays.  Then where would we be?
Bus-less!

Someone has to keep the closest thing to simple, flexible, utilitarian
transportation alive!  But the new Bully isn't any of that.  The Westy's you
can buy abroad, although expensive (I wonder how much more expensive they are
than say a 1983 Westy adjusted for inflation), pale in comparison to a new
"motor home" for cost and complexity.
