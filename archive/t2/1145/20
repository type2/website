Actually, if it's that lean, it's probably running cooler because it's 
probably leaner than stoich (14.7:1 AFR), which mean it's not damaging 
the engine.  In other words, it's just going to be extremely 
underpowered (probably running around 18-19:1 AFR).

Remember, the hottest air/fuel ratio (AFR) is 14.7:1.  If you keep 
leaning out your mixture, the head temps will drop significantly, even 
more so than if you richen the same amount from stoich.

So, the conventional wisdom that you will damage your engine if you lean 
it out only holds true if you're leaning it *towards* 14.7:1.  Once you 
get beyond 14.7:1, your head temps begin to drop - our engines just 
don't like to run there without very tight control of the AFR.  I've 
been running 16-17:1 for the past year or so.
