  Kevin,

A few years ago I began converting a baywindow delivery van to a 
camper.  I spent alot of time researching the various insulation 
materials.  I wanted heat as well as sound insulation.  For this reason 
I rejected pink fiberglass insulation which seemed to be popular in many 
70's van conversion books.  Then I considered a combination of rigid 
foam board and "great stuff" expanding foam.   Then I came to the 
conclusion that foil-backed bubble insulation (aka NASA insulation) is 
the way to go.

However.......I've seen several websites where guys just glue the stuff 
to the underside of the roof and then stick a panel under it.  This is 
next to useless in terms of radiant heat insulation--the chief benefit 
of this type of insulation.  I corresponded with a rep from Reflectix 
corporation and for RV use he highly recommended a 3/4" spacer  (you can 
use furring strips) between two layers of insulation or between one 
layer of insulation and the ceiling or walls.  The additional benefit to 
having furring strips attached to the van is that you get an air pocket 
that will let moisture evaporate.

In areas such as under the dash you have a fair bit of space so you 
could probably get away with a double layer.  Just remember to keep the 
space between the foil at least 3/4"

PS  As you probably know there are some good ideas here:

But please don't use header wrap on your heat exchangers.  Those puppies 
are prone to rust as it is and header wrap will simply speed up the 
corrosion rate.
