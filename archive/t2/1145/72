Subject: back to sound proofing...

Hey Guys,

Thought you might like to know, I got enough space in my garage to pull my
bus in. I started putting more sound proofing in today, and will be chipping
away at it for a little longer before putting the panels back in. Actually
before I start re-building the panels. When I get to remaking the panels
them I will try to draw up templates, so that anyone can use them to make
their own.

I have put one layer of SecondSkin Damplifier all over the interior of my
bus. Today I just put a 2nd layer over the engine compartment and rear wheel
wells. I posted some pics on The Samba -

The third pic has the area where I doubled the second skin stuff.

I plan on putting luxury liner pro on the walls, ceiling, rear door and side
cargo doors. 

I still have way more of this second skin stuff left. I'm not sure where
else I will double it up, maybe the whole floor area, as I don't plan on
putting any luxury liner on this area, like I do on the walls and ceiling. I
may put some on under the front floor mat, or at least on the pedal cluster
cover pan. I have not put any there yet, as I was not sure if I wanted to.
Anyone put sound proofing under their front floor mat? What do you think are
the pro's & con's of this?

I'm not looking forward to installing the luxury liner, as that needs to be
spray mounted, and I guess you are supposed to tape over the edges. I've got
to figure a good way to mask off so I don't get the sticky stuff where I
don't want it. I also don't want to inhale that stuff. Anyone have tips on
putting this stuff on the ceiling and walls, so I doesn't just fall down. I
was wondering if I have to tape all the edges anyway, why do I need to
spraymount it down? And if I spraymount it, do I need to get spray adhesive
over the whole surface, or just enough to hold it until I tape it. I guess
the original foam I took out was glued in...and I didn't have any rust
issues. They did not tape the edges of the original foam, they just glued it
in. 

I was also thinking of putting some of that silver bubble foil wrap on the
ceiling and walls to help insulate the bus, I have some left over from a
job, so the material won't cost me anything.
 
Ideas and suggestion on how to continue appreciated...

Thanks,
