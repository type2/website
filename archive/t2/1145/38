I too have a cherished can of the old stuff. The original could be metered 
out in dribs and drabs where the new faulty product only gushes out in a 
torrent making a mess of whatever you are trying to clean or lubricate. I 
tend to use my old can on my bus hinges.

I do appreciate the  possiblities of the cans used as roman candles.
