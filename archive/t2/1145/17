GREAT story.

A friend once told me a story about his '63 Corvair turbo Syder. He was 
displaying it at an East TN car show. Guy walked up and was reminiscing 
about old Corvairs, said he had one like that back in the 1960s and sold 
when they had kids and needed something bigger. Story went on for a 
while and he mentioned a few details that my friend noticed matched. 
Turns out my friend had original paperwork on the car and it was 
literally the same car! Talk about a grown man crying like a baby... A 
couple of years later the fellow bought the car back...
