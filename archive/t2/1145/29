The 2011 Volkswagen California....not available anywhere near 
California!  And the website I saw said 42,000 pounds sterling.  (I have 
no idea how to get that funny-looking, cursive-L pound symbol.)  I'm not 
sure of the current exchange rate but that's probably closer to $70,000 
than $60,000.  Maybe even a little more.  It was 2:1 when I was in 
London last but it has come down.  At $42,000 it would be out of my 
price range.  And I'd say that for $42,000, I could make the Bopmobile 
brand-new for all practical purposes.  Definitely a show-winner.  Right 
now she wouldn't even take best of show in a demolition derby.   Ciao...KR
