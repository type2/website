Adrian,

I have a BN4 but my guess is they are similar.  My other guess is that when 
the engine is running you are getting a higher voltage to the unit making it 
easier for the glow plug heat up.  Or possibly the fuel pump is not 
activated with a lower voltage. You might try putting a voltage meter at the 
unit with the engine running and the engine off to see if there is a 
significant difference.  Is so, try connecting a thicker wire from the 
battery to the unit.  Or your battery could be weak which does not show when 
the alternator is running.  Nominally, there should be not difference in 
operation with the engine on or off.

It is also possible to adjust the fail safe mechanism that shuts the 
circuitry down when things get too hot without ignition so that you could 
run say two minutes instead of one, which might be enough additional time 
for it to kick in.

But my guess is it is the difference in voltage when the engine is running 
and when it is not running is the reason for your problem.

Cheers,

JohnR



   Mine workks great when engine is on, but
in engine-off mode heater shuts itself off about a minute after
startup.
