	As far as I could make out, the gist of the method is 
suddenness.  I suspect 'easing' would prevent its working well.
	Also, I believe the reason it works (sometimes, I'm sure; not 
always) is not actually backfire, if that term strictly denotes an 
explosion in the exhaust, but what could be better called BLOWBACK in 
the carb.
	Anyhow, it transformed my 1600dp from a stumbling shambles to 
a good runner.
