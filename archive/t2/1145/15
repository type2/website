The loyalty is there, but at our age (66 for me) the old guard is 
getting tired of complaining joints from lying under the camper. 
Reliability is an issue when you are far from home and the best place 
that will work on it it is 100 miles away and I am arguing with Good Sam 
that the nearest shop can't work on it. Am seriously considering getting 
a Ford 150 extended van (good reliability record) that gets 19mpg on the 
highway and can be fixed anywhere- and putting in my own stuff including 
beds scrounged from a Westy. Youtube abounds with owner built van 
conversions.
There is a lot of storage space under the rear bed/bench on front engine 
vans.

  Drive these newer things and you will miss the camaraderie
