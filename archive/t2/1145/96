Subject: Carburation woes with 1600 DP

Hi Folks,

I'm running a '70 bus with a newish Mexi 1600 DP engine with a
PICT30/31 carb.  On my first long trip of the season (from BC to San
Jose), the bus started running oddly.  After the engine has been
running for long while and I come to a stop, the engine dies.  I can
then start it easily, but it won't idle.  I need to goose it a little
to keep the engine running.  After the engine has cooled, it starts
and idles fine.

I've done a few preliminary tests.  I put a vacuum gauge on the intake
manifold, and the vacuum at idle is in the 15-20 range and bouncy.
Thinking there might be a vacuum leak, I squirted starting fluid at
various places around the intake manifold but didn't see any effect.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Jerry
