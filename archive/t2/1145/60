Subject: trouble getting fuel line onto carb input tube

Hi all,



`68 bus w/ dual carbs. I'm trying to replace the fuel lines while engine
is in the bus.  I have the proper 5mm German braided line.



All has gone well except for pushing the new fuel line onto the carb
fuel input tube.



I can get the new fuel lines about half way onto the tube, but no
further.  This is a couple of mms past the bump on the input tube, but
nowhere near covering the entire tube.  I assume it is best to push new
fuel line to cover entire input tube?



Getting arms/hands behind the fan shroud at an angle to give any real
push is difficult at best with the tubes pointing towards the center of
engine.



What tricks/recommendations do others have to achieve this task?



Is there a lubricant that can be used that evaporates so as not to give
the fuel line any added chance of popping off at a later date?



I will be using clamps once on line is on correctly.



Thanks in advance,

Greg
