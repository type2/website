Good Grief

where is the loyalty? where the hardiness?  someone wants SHOWERS?   
Drive these newer things and you will miss the camaraderie, the  
eGroups,  the waves from others, and the envious looks and sighs from  
those who  stop by to say you how they wish they had one. They always  
seem to materialize just as you think of selling and it changes your  
mind so fall in love with it again,  you plod on, and fix that  
something that always needs doing and makes you a westy owner!

Here's waving at you
