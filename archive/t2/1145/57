Subject: Re: [T2] Thermostat on a 1600 engine

Oh drat! It's a dud! Well, there goes that $4.95. But I got to be  
excited for a little while.

It really bugs me to spend eighty bucks to buy the wrong part (for a  
2.0 liter).

But as I emailed, there are two baywindows in the Ecology Mesa yard in  
Chula Vista. One is an early bay, don't know which year. The second is  
a green '77. The '77 is an automatic with AC, and has all its AC  
parts. The engine is still in both. Well, dropped in the early one.

I'd love to have a '68-71 bay. So simple!
