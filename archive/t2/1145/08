Subject: idles, but won't drive

1776 with stock cam and dual Kadrons and a balance tube connecting 
them.  I've adjusted the accelerator pump squirt volume and, at least 
to some extent, balanced the carbs.

Upon startup, there is popping in both carbs for a minute or so.

After warm up, the engine idles well at 850 rpm and will rev in 
neutral to high rpms with only a mild hesitation.

When I leave the garage and try to drive away, there is severe 
popping in the carbs and no power at all. I have to feather the 
accelerator to high rpms to limp back to the garage.

Can anyone help me diagnose this?

Jack
