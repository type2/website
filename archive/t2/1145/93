Haha nice timing!

Jim Arnott just received the full collection of episodes I sent him and is in 
the process of hosting these on server in the US.
I imagine, if you ask nicely, he may forward you the disc I sent him if you're 
low on bandwidth.

Hi all

Ive searched the archives for this & didn't find anything, so forgive me
if some of you have seen this before.
Over here in the UK there has recently been a series of 10 episodes
about one man touring England in his bay window cooking in various
locations.

Ive watched the series & theres minimal info on his camper apart from
the first episode, but it's a good series all the same.

Heres a link to a site that is hosting the series for you to download if
your outside the UK.
