  Any BA6 experts on the list?  Mine works great when engine is on, but 
in engine-off mode heater shuts itself off about a minute after 
startup.  The shut off seems to occur in the temp regulating switch as 
all fuses and safety switches remain intact.  All of the manuals seem to 
only diagnose engine-running operation.
