My "other vehicle" is a Mazda5.  It's probably a similar size to the new
Bully, and has sliding doors and 3 rows of seats for a total capacity of 6.

It is based on a car platform (Mazda3), has an efficient engine (we get 30 mpg
on the highway), it is inexpensive (fully loaded under $22k but you can get
one for ~$18k), and can be loaded up for camping trips.  It needs to be about
4" longer for me to sleep in it, but I have attached my "drive away" tent (the
Just Campers tent sold by Bus Depot) to the side of it.

If you could pull out the middle seats and stand up in it, it would be the
successor to the bus.  Maybe when it gets relegated to third car status, I'll
turn it into a camper.
