Subject: Re: [T2] auxiliary blower fan and placement

I pulled one of these blowers off of a parts Beetle I once had. It was 
mounted under the backseat.

It's been years since I took it apart. Can't remember if it boosted 
airflow to the front or dumped heat out into the rear floorboard. The 
donor fan I have is steel inside and out.
