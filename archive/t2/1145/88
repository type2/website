 How do we know that popping occurs leaner than stoich?

You have no business running lean of stoichiometry if you don't have
AFR equipment and know exactly what you are doing. The GAMI aviation
article that this practice is based on is very adamant that stock
induction produces variations in AFR between cylinders that can be
fatal to the cylinders that vary from the correct mix. For this reason
OEM engineers to this day use rich cooling instead of lean cooling.
Lean cooling is okay for aviation use where manufacturing tolerances
are tighter, but for automotive use, it costs too much to get the
precision necessary for lean cooling. GAMI is actually in the business
of selling injectors tuned precisely enough so you can safely do this.
Then you have to know what you are doing to know what load conditions
need rich tuning and which conditions can use lean tuning and how to
safely transition from rich to lean and back. The GAMI article
describes the history in pre-WWII aviation where the aircraft would
run rich cooling until at altitude and ready for cruise, and then
would lean out to lean cooling using very precise instrumentation to
allow that.
