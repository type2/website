Subject: Meeting and cruise this Saturday

Hi all,
This Saturday, March 12, we will be having our regular monthly meeting
at Red Robin in Rancho Cucamonga at 10:30.  Following the meeting we
will cruise together down to Toms Farms in Corona.  It should be a
great day for driving, weather should be 74 and sunny!  Come on out
and drive your VW.
Rob Garretson b.
