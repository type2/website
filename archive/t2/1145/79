FWIW, I installed a bunch (a bit over 50sqfeet) of "fat mat" sound deadener in
my kombi.
It is blackon the side towards the bus, and silver on the side that your see
when it is installed.

The kombi was basicially an empty tin box in back.
  It's sort of an echo chamber designed to increase noises.
I added a floor mat and a 1970ish westy folding bed, which did quiet it
somewhat.
The fat mat definately made a difference in terms of the bus being less tinny
when you tap on it.
It may have made a slight difference in sound when driving.  I'm not sure.
It did not make it worse.

I did not put any on the floor.   Then again, there is surface rust on the
floor, that bus is not garaged, it rains 50 inches a year here, and it needs a
new rear hatch seal.   often is damp above the engine, and water flows forward
down under the floor mat.

I don't think it made any temp insulation difference
It was raining on us sleeping in the bus on the SST last month.  condensation
on the roof just dripped down and the upper sleeping bag was all damp on top.
It was kinda annoying!
It was freezing out at the time.  Didn't have the raining in the bus issue on
labour day weekend in September. or other times we've camped in it.   I think
SST was the coldest camping in that bus.
Camped in much colder weather in othe buses, without the condensation problem.
the other buses were paneled in the back, with ceiling.

Hopefully I'll have the kombi interior completely paneled before BYOB/ Kelley
Park.

I agree about the noise adding to being tired.
