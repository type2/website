I've seen attempts around here in TN to tempt consumers with a pump 
bottle of WD-40, much like household cleaners such as glass cleaner.

I'll be hording a few cans of the propane filled versions if I see that 
the stuff at the hardware store contains CO2. I like to use other brands 
for lubricating and stuff like Kroil for breaking loose rusty fasteners.

Your stories make me want to move my paint and cleaners out to the shed 
and outside of our house-attached garage. I'd hate to loose it all to 
freezing temps. I'm assuming that freezing temps would be bad for paints 
in the winter.
