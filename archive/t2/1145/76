I've played around with the BN4 as well and I'll second what John said about 
power.
If the designs are similar then 12V or under may not be enough.  I spent hours 
trying to get my BN4 to run on the bench from a car battery.
Never got combustion and continuous running on the bench until I used a running 
engine which gave about 14V.

With the engine off, does combustion actually occur and then cut out after a 
minute or so?  Or is it just the fan and no combustion before cutting out?

Also, The Samba has a BA6 repair manual on file here:
