Weber progressive jet sizes on my 2 l engine, as promised:

 

Primary Main Jet              1.35mm

Secondary Main Jet            1.40mm

Primary Air Correction Jet    1.70mm

Secondary Air Correction Jet  1.80mm

Primary Emulsion Tube         ?

Secondary Emulsion Tube       ?

Primary Idling Jet            .60mm

Secondary Idling Jet          .50mm

Pump Jet                      .55mm (IIRC)

 

I didn't get the emulsion tube sizes b/c I didn't know of their
existence when I pulled the carb apart.
