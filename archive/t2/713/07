I have an expensive thin-wall deep socket for those nuts. It can be
difficult to get any other sort of tool on the nut.

That number is the part number for the gear, not the camshaft. I don't think
any of the solid cams have the cast rings around the middle bearing journal
of the cam. You can also tell by the shape of the lobe.  If the cam is OG VW
it may have some numbers cast into it, they are difficult to see, but they
are there.

Yes save the gears. You will need a press to remove them.

Why are you putting the crank in the garbage bin anyhow? If it is a 2l crank
and not broken or destroyed on the journals, you should save it. 1.7/1.8
cranks are less valuable, but still worth something as a core. The VW cranks
are superbly made and seldom fail unless run without oil. They can be
reground. Unless it is broken, keep it.
