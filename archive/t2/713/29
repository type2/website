Subject: What do you always pick up at your VW shop?

While I was picking up my usual supplies at my local VW shop, I thought that
such a list might help some VW newbies.  Here's what I pick up everytime I
go to buy parts, or pickup supplies. I know if I pick them up on my parts
runs then they'll be in my shop whenever I need them.

- two valve cover gaskets
- oil filter
- a few dashboard bulbs
- whatever new patch/decal suits my fancy
- bag of shop rags

What do the rest of you pick up as staples to keep your bus healthy?
