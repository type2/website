Subject: trans leak at shift rod

Hi all,

Is the bus trying to tell us something?  Just as Rachel and I were 
carrying out the last piece of the new camping interior, I noticed a 
puddle under the bus.  Trans oil seems to suddenly be leaking from 
where the shift rod enters the transmission (091 manual on a 1978 bus).

Page 4 of Bentley's Transmission and Rear Axle shows an oil seal right 
at the front of the transmission, but it doesn't seem to reference this 
area again.  Well, it does warn that the engine and tranny have to come 
out to remove the rear shift rod (!?!).

Has anyone had a leak here and successfully repaired it?  Is there 
truly no way to do the work without removing the engine?  We can't do 
this ourselves in the parking lot, especially with our watchful 
landlords.  I'd be nervous to have a shop do the work after the 
countless hours spent getting every engine seal, exhaust piece and wire 
in place and perfect.  Ideas?

thanks,
joe and rachel broach
