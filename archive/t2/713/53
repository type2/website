Checker cab company in the old days used to never change the oil, only
changing the filters. Modern wisdom is that even if the oil stock is
long lasting (such as early synthetic claims of 50,000 miles) it is
contaminated by combustion by-products, and additives break down, and
as such it still needs to be changed at normal interval. That having
been said, I doubt serious damage was done by the oversight. If
anything, normal wear was slightly accelerated from the degraded oil
quality.

 10 years ago I was living with a guy who had gone at least 20k miles on his
 Ford Bronco without changing the oil. The dealer had done the 300 mile oil
 change when he bought it and he had never changed the oil since. He checked
 it and topped it up, but never changed it. It was only about a year old, he
 put a lot of miles on it.
