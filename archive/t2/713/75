I ordered one for my 73 from BD and it was square. Hearing everybody
talking about how they should be round I went and looked at the one
that's in mine right now. Square. And completely deteriorated so it's
been in there a loooong time... Long enough to possibly be stock.

Could the round ones be year specific?
