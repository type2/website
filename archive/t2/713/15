Well, when I changed the oil on the bus, it was dark, but it flowed out 
fine.  There wasn't any gumming or anything, and the oil filter drained 
easily too.  When I checked the oil, after 600 miles, it still looked 
pretty clear, too.

So, I'm assuming if you leave oil in there too long it gets all gummed up?

that's pretty funny... the putting it in the wiper fluid bottle ;) (not 
the blowing up part, of course)
