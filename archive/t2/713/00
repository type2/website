Hello Miles  The early subs did good later ones have problems   2.5 liter and 
some 2.2l Using your reasoning doesnt explain Toyotas head and crank problems 
either does it. Earlier Toyotas were really good cars , did away with the 
best motor they had the 22RE cause GM wanted 6 clys. . What has been happening is 
that GM(generic motors) has been buying into these companies and ruining 
them.  Yes the Mexi motor is a very good choice thu they have had some cams 
breaking and the compresion is low, but that is preobably a good thing  later and 
have fun  Mark Dearing
