Okay I'm working on my Berryman's Chem-Dip diploma this morning... <grin!>

"Dip-type cleaner is highly caustic, so be careful in how you handle this material. Read the label for soak times and proper clean up. Most carburetor part dips can dissolve small rubber parts, so you must completely dismantle the entire carburetor and remove all rubber pieces before using the dip. Take the carburetor completelyapart so the chemical can reach all parts and passages. In many cases, it may be necessary to soak the carburetor two, three or more times.

Be sure to follow the label's time schedule for keeping the carburetor in the solvent because it can destroy the metal parts if you leave them in the dip for too long. If the dip needs additional time to remove deposits completely, remove and clean the parts and then repeat the process rather than exceed the recommended time limits in a single dip. I have seen some cases where aluminum parts were pitted so badly from excessive dip times that they required replacement."

"The right way to rebuild any carburetor is to completely disassemble it and soak all the metal parts in a can of carburetor dip solvent overnight."

Nothing from Berryman's website (manufacturer of the chem-dip I use). 

From Gunk:

"USE DIRECTIONS: Works best at room temperature. 1) Place parts to be cleaned into parts basket. 2)
Lower basket into solution. Parts must be completely submerged. 3) Allow parts to soak for 20 minutes. 4)
Brush heavy soil deposits, if necessary. 5) Rinse parts in water. Use care to avoid splashing on any painted
or non-metallic surfaces. 6) Dry parts thoroughly before re-assembly. 7) Replace cover until ready to reuse
solution. Note: See Precautions and Disposal below."

A little humor - Berryman vs Gunk...

"Chem-Dip is also corrosive to aluminum, magnesium, titanium and their alloys. Carbutetors left too long in the solution will be blackened and permanently discolored."

For all the entries saying beware the Chem-Dip's strength I found about 12 that said they left their carb in for a weekend while they went to the beach for a holiday with no problems. 

Surely not scientific, but that's what I found...
