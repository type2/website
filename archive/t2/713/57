Have no fear. The first trip in my resurrected 72 (after sitting 8
years in a friend's yard) after slapping a $250 turnkey junkyard motor
in it was to take it up HWY 36 to the coast, and from there all the
way down HWY 1 to LA. Blew a brand new Autozone fuel pump climbing 36W
and burst a tire cord. All uneventful from there!

      Besides everyone I know telling me it's crazy to buy a 33 year
old car and then take it for a 600 mile road trip, I think getting
this bus ready has been the coolest thing I've done in a while. At
least I know you guys will back me up. It's like my old man said
"Anyone can rent a Dodge Neon and drive to hell and back, it takes a
real man to baby an air-cooled down hwy 128 in Mendocino County."
