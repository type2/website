Subject: What color is my Single Cab?

I just bought a really original '68 Single Cab!!  It's the same color green as
my first car, a '68 Beetle I had when I was 15 years old!!

A really Crayola Green...the paint code sticker is gone, but what color green
was available in a 68 Single Cab & and 68 Beetle?

Thanks for the help,

Tom
