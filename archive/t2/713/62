Subject: Re: [T2] Split the case, camshaft gear offset

Karl and Pierre.

Engine:

The engine was rebuilt by VW of Canada.

The engine case number is  GE 020417

The VW sticker that covered the engine case number says [English & French] 
"EXCHANGE  May be used for engine code GD   Part Number 039 100 031BX"

These was and still is a flex plate WELDED to the end of the crank shaft. [I 
would love to get to the two shims I can see.]

All the lifters were solid lifters.

Cam shaft:

The gear has these numbers:  "021.109.111C,  VW insignia, Audi 4 ring 
insignia, the number '8'". And 180 degrees from this info on the gear it 
says   "Germany  WW0"

On the cam shaft itself, it says: "021 109 101J" in one place, between two 
lobes.  Then it has  " 9a & VW insignia", and then, I believe "7a", in a 
GREEN painted area between two other lobes.

The cam shaft has two raised rings [perhaps they could be considered 
'cast'], one on either side of the central bearing.

There are 56 teeth in the cam shaft gear.

Thanks for the info.  Who would have guess that VW would have a cam shaft 
just for the automatic trans engines??

So, can I use this cam shaft with hydraulic lifters - standard trans??  
SURELY VW did not make special cams for BOTH solid lifter - auto trans and 
hydraulic lifter - auto trans engines???
