Hi Hisham,

Don't throw away the L-Jet system yet, there is plenty of help 
available....

www.ratwell.com has a lot of FI advice, including the VW technician's 
workshop manual.

When working with FI system, always start by adjusting the valves and 
verifying timing, vaccuum and fuel pressure. Then you can begin to work 
through the symptom charts in the manual here:

Last spring I swapped my bus from dual carbs to L-jetronic FI... It 
took some time to learn how the system worked but the end result has 
been much better performance and cold running than what I had when 
working with carbs.

Happy trails,
