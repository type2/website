That was pretty much my decision path.  Although it would be fun to win
the "Stoplight Grand Prix", the amount of time and blue words that I would
have to expend on a engine swap would be excessive.  I'm also not sure
that I could get a 2.5l Subaru engine into the engine bay of my '71
without hacking things up.

Still, it's fun to dream...
