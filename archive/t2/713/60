I have the same problem and have chosen to ignore it for the moment
(aren't ACVWs supposed to leak oil?). I will be interested to hear how
you go.

 

Richard Attwell covers doing a makeover on your 091 on his site
(www.ratwell.com <http://www.ratwell.com/> ). The seal you are referring
to is 001 301 227D. You will probably soon discover that only the 001
301 227 seal is available, which is for the earlier 002 transmission. I
suspect that they are interchangeable but haven't put it to the test.

 

Cheers,
