Hi Barry,

Do those come with the clips too? If so then I will take two pair. In 
summer 2000 I put rear brakes on the westfakia and the arms were 
included, riveted in place. Last fall I replaced the rear shoes and the 
replacements had no pins. The dealer price was $35CDN per pin, but 
since the pins were not available elsewhere there simply wasn't much 
choice in the matter.

Hopefully the list vendors will take notice of this and participate in 
your group buy.


Happy trails,
