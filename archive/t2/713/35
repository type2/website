"Pick up" from a VW shop??? Are you kidding? <grin!> 

The nearest one is in Chattanooga or Nashville (1.5 hours either direction) and they just order from the same catalogs I do!!! 

Once upon a time I was station in Norfolk and had a couple VW shops to buy parts off the shelf from... Oh the good old days! 

I try to keep 1 set of all my consumables on hand without a trip to the store or waiting a week for a mail order to arrive. Enough supplies for an old change (oil and filter), fan belt, fuses, bulbs, maybe wheel bearings and grease for 1 rear wheel and 1 front wheel, new brake fluid, tuneup parts (cap, rotor, plugs, points, condensor), and then there is my "used" parts stash. 

From this I can replace a starter, distributor, thermostat, carbs, injectors, injector brain, fuel pump, axle(s), hubcap, maybe a spare light front or rear, etc. As I use these items I try to reorder what I need. I gather used parts whenever I can - spare wiper motor, spare used engine for donor parts, spare screws, bolts, etc. Got spare wheels, 3 spare engines, etc. etc. Had I barn, I'd probably have whole hulks for donor parts. Not in my present neighborhood! <grin!>

As soon as I get rid of it all, I'll need it. My wife shakes her head but I did this once before. Got rid of my spare parts (the big stuff) and sure enough I was scrounging for engine tin, hardware, a good block, etc. 

I keep Type IV stuff for my Beetle (and to put my Corvair powered Westy back to VW stock if need be) and Corvair stuff for the Westy.
