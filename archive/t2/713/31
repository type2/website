Thanks for all the great suggestions from everybody. 
     Besides everyone I know telling me it's crazy to buy a 33 year old car and then take it for a 600 mile road trip, I think getting this bus ready has been the coolest thing I've done in a while. At least I know you guys will back me up. It's like my old man said "Anyone can rent a Dodge Neon and drive to hell and back, it takes a real man to baby an air-cooled down hwy 128 in Mendocino County."
     I've updated my toolkit to include two replacement cooling belts, spare plugs, points, a torque wrench, fuses, a rosary, Louie Lamour novels, and valium. I'm going to try and find a fire extinguisher before I leave, which I plan on doing on Monday. I'll keep everyone updated and send off at least one more e-mail before I take the plunge. Once again thanks for all the great help and suggestions.
