Subject: [T2] electrolytic rust removal

While you're reinventing the wheel there .................
I use a $12.99 Campbell Hausfeld / Harbor Freight sandblast gun and a 40
pound bag of playsand and if I keep recovering the play sand I can blast
half a bus in about 1/2 a day all for less than $20.00.
If the playsand is too aggressive then commercial blast media can be had for
reasonable expense.
