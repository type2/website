Subject: trans leak at shift rod

I did this once.  Get a new shaft seal, remove the shift coupler, worry out
the old seal, lubricate and drive in the new one, reinstall the shift
coupler.  It took me about an hour from start to finish.

The "drive in" part was the hardest.  I just used sockets and washers to get
an even push.
