Subject: [T2]Weber Carb issue

i have just bought a brand new weber carb defv 32/36 and its been running fine i guess... weather plays a toll on these carbs so until the temps raise up i really wont be able to get the full out of it...
 
i have changed out my manifold and also put the new manifold with it and in doing so i noticed a strong smell of gasoline coming from the manifold when i pulled it apart.... strong fumes of gas.... also when i picked the manifold that had been on it off one small drip of gas came out...
 
this doesnt sound right to me? i have changed this couple times now with this new carb and each time i pull the manifold it smells really bad of gas... this last time the bus sat for about four days no driving and then yesterday pulled manifold again and yep drop of gas again and really bad strong fumes...
 
anyone else...?
any other carb just like this i have put on i have never smelt such a strong smell of gas coming for the manifold.... it wasnt till i took the manifold loose that i smelt it couldnt help but smell it...
 
peace 
Chris


Peace and Love
Chris
