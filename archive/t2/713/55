You should definately check out the megasquirt EFI controller.  It's an 
awesome system as it's an full-on replacement for the Bosch ECU and it 
is fully configurable and open-source.  It's ten gazillion times more 
configurable than the L-jet and there is a huge user base of people that 
you can refer to for help in setting it up.  Before you spend another 
dime, I'd defintely take a look at the MS.

megasquirt FAQ - tons of info here
http://www.megasquirt.info

and the forums

Right now running the msns-extra code which is an enhancement on the 
stock MS code.  It's got spark control, too.  I think I'll be looking at 
that soon ;) HOT stuff!
