Subject: Please note - RE:  [T2] KONI Shock **NEW** Group Buy! - HURRY!

I'm excited to see that the orders are already coming in!  This makes me
hopeful that we will have a new group buy.

But please stop using the listmember discount code on these. As I noted, no
futher discounts apply to this group buy price. This just makes extra work
for me, as I have to individually email each person who uses it, to confirm
that they still want the shocks without getting an additional 5% discount.
It may also cause you to risk losing your place in line.  

Thanks,
