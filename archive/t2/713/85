Subject: '73 Campmobile - First start of the season !

Hi folks,

Good news....... once again our '73 campmobile started up after 5-6 months 
of storage.  As usual it took a while to get the gas flowing into it 
smoothly, but all in all it was an easy start-up.

Also once I took a test drive the brakes and suspension were a little 
creaky.  Everything "juiced" up better after a good 10-15 minute drive, now 
it sounds good as always.

See you on the road.........
