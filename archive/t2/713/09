Objet : RE: [T2] Split the case, camshaft gear offset


I do not agree on the letter "C" or other referring to offset -1, -2, etc.
This offset number is stamped near the teeth of the gear on the shaft side.
Am I right beeing is dissagreement ?

By the way, I am rebuilding a 2 liter with an offset of -5 (I did not know
offset number could be that higH).  Ordering a reground camshaft or a new
one, I do not know what offset I am going to get and the one I will get will
probably be different   from the one I have.

Shall I removed the rivet to salvage the original gear (-5), remove the gear
from the "new" camshaft, drill and tap to install original gear ?

Your advices will be welcome.
