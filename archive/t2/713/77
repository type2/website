Subject: Re: [T2] Re: New here, and having L jet trouble

Thank you Ronald & Greg for your insights and support, truely appreciate it.
The motor is an EC,  L injected type 4, so it shouldn't matter really what
vehicle its connected to. So no 412 knowledge required here. I have been a
believer in FI since having my 70 Djet squareback, the only non carbed vw I
ever had and the only one that start and drives with zero hassle, under any
ambient condition! That impressed the heck out of me. I just need to get
aquainted with the Ljet and its quircks. Thank you bothe agin for your help
and will carry out your suggestions and report back.
God bless
Hisham
