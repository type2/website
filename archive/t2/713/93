Subject: Re: [T2] electrolytic rust removal

i use white vinegar (5%) to clean really rusty garage sale type tools.
i get a good deal on them because they are rusty take them home and throw
them in a plastic pail with vinegar.  it will clean them up but depending
it might take a couple of days.  you will get a sort of black slimey
substance on the metal which i clean off with a stainless wire brush.
since i am a bit impatient and like to see the progress with time i brush
them a couple of times during the process but its probably not needed.  i
also pick at the big pits to speed the rust removal process without
loosing as much base metal.  you can use the old vinegar to clean weeds
and any other plant for that matter.  if you treat a area depending on
rain it will stay dead for at least a month.
