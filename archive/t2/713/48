Subject: Re: [T2] Split the case, camshaft gear offset

From VW, here are the current cam AND gear available:

Part number:              offset:                      for model:
021 109 015 M           -3                               66
021 109 017 M           -2                               66
021 109 017 L            -2
This one is for engine:
CD 000001      -->   CD 011000                   62
AW 000001     -->   AW 037000                  68
ED 000001      -->    ED 025000                   70
GD 000001     -->    GD 055800                   70

021 109 021 M          +/- 0                             66
021 109 021 L           +/- 0
This one is for the engines listed above.

022 109 021 A        ALL! no offset given        70
GE 000001 -->

Barrys 021 109 111C does not appear any where. If it is just for the cam gear, then is must be
a casting number on the gear, since VW does not offer the gear separate.

And..... if you look in the 68-79 Bentley, section 5, page 59:
Bottom right paragraph starts out  The camshafts for the engines with maual trans uses a different cam than
those used with a auto trans. The AUTO trans camshafts HAVE 2 narrow bands CAST into the shaft on each side of
the middle bearing.

I do not agree on the letter "C" or other referring to offset -1, -2, etc.
This offset number is stamped near the teeth of the gear on the shaft side.

> Question 2:  The cam has [IIRC] this part number, 021 109 111C   Is this a

 solid lifter or hydraulic lifter cam??

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

021 is solid.
022 is hydraulic.

But the end letter C does not appear in the list of available camshafts.
The end letter denotes whether the gear is -1, -2 , -3 etc.
