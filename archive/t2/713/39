What's a VW shop... ?-(
The closest VW dealership (Formerly "Aircooled Automotive",
now "Essex Sportscars" ), sells VW's, Audis and Porsches...
But don't go to the parts counter for AC parts...They can
only "order" them and you can use your Social Security
check to pay for them "if" they ever come in... ;-(

They do however have a perfect VW Beetle on the show-
room floor and, yes, the sign says, "Don't Touch"... ;-(
