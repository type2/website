Subject: Cheap Motorcycle Jack

Got a 51.70$ (with tax) Big Red motorcycle jack at Pep Boys. Comes
with a 10$ mail-in rebate. I do not know if they offer that deal
nationwide but it looked like a fine deal to me. Of course at that
price, it is made in the five letter country...

Because of a poorely located center stud it will not lift my
motorcycle without modification, however it seems that it will be a
good fit to help pulling the T1 engine.
