Subject: Re: [T2] Can you spare a flywheel lock (SF, CA)?

A word of advice on that flywheel lock out there:

It is designed for the typeI engine, reversable for
either the 6V flywheel or the 12V flywheel.

It is not designed for the typeIV engine. It will work
but not 100% efficiently.

 Don't apologize.  I do not consider your E-mail
 spam. 
 You see, I want to hear what frustrates other T2
 owners world-wide.  During one of my future
 "Internet Ordering Cycles," I will probably invest in
a fly-wheel lock, in preparation for the day I will
 need
 one handy.  (At least I aspire to rebuild the
 replacement 2.0 motor that is languishing in the
 barn.
  Some year.  :D)
