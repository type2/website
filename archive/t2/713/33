Sounds like your assesment is correct. The needle seat is probably toast (likely from someone screwing in the needle too tight) and the icing is likely caused by the plugged heat riser. I unplugged one recently using aq broken piece of clutch cable, screw end inserted in my drill and then the cable shoved intot hte heat rise, Better than Roto-rooter for unclogging a stuffed pipe.
As for the carbs, I've never heard of them being model specific, just year...
