Actually, it is the CAM shafts that will bend if the gear wheel is not 
removed and the cam is allowed to sit on the teeth of the gear [so the 
actual cam shaft is at an angle; one end of the cam shaft in the middle of 
the gear and the other end of the cam shaft on the surface]

But no problem.  Once it is put in the block and the block is torqued, the 
cam shaft will straighten right out, generally even before you have to set 
your valves the first [i. e., the LAST!!] time!!
