Subject: Re: [T2] Carb Ice-ing

I'm thinking the overnight in carb cleaner is the key fact. It was explained to me that carb dip was a 30 minute only solvent b/c carbs come with an enamel sealing the carb metal and this is stripped off by excessive soaking. 

Take THAT with a grain of salt. However from about 5 different sources I have been told not to soak a carb in carb dip any longer than necessary.
