It's too bad cuz i was just up there two days ago.  Anyways, when I 
didn't have the lock, I just stuck a bolt through the crank-case hole 
and put a pair of pliers around it.  Probably any kind of tool stuck 
into the gears that will get jammed into the bolt keeping the flywheel 
from turning should work.  It's not nearly as neat as the lock, but it 
is possible.  Creativity here is key ;)
