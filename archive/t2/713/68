Subject: RE: [T2] what happens if you don't change your oil in 10,000  

This is true.  In those days it was far more common to overhaul the engine
after 18,000 - 20,000 miles.

  They didn't even filter oil in those days, let alone change it.

  I can't imagine how short the life of my type IV motor would be without
regular oil and filter changes.

  I have a vivid memory of changing the oil on my mother's bus in the mid
80's.  She is notorious for never maintaining her vehicles.  Oil came out of
there looking like mollassus and ground up sea shells.

Weren't Ford model T's originally not provided with any way to change
the oil.   "Lubed for life" if I remember.
