Subject: Re: [T2] What color is my Single Cab?

Both of my 68 brochures only list 4 colors (blue, white, red and beige). I 
am not an expert on the original colors from 68 but I am thinking maybe your 
new truck was repainted. There was a dark green available in 71 if not 
earlier.

Here are the brochures if you are interested:
