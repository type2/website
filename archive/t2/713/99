Stan I sure hope you're using a proper mask for this, as playsand is silica
and you can kill your lungs pretty quick this way. Silicosis is a killer, as
many a worker has found out the hard way. Take care of yourself.

Regards,

Courtney

While you're reinventing the wheel there .................

I use a $12.99 Campbell Hausfeld / Harbor Freight sandblast gun and a 40

pound bag of playsand and if I keep recovering the play sand I can blast

half a bus in about 1/2 a day all for less than $20.00.

If the playsand is too aggressive then commercial blast media can be had for

reasonable expense.
