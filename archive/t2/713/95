Subject: Are KONI shocks really that great?

     I'm considering getting in on this latest group buy.  I missed the last 
one.  I read Ratwells stuff online about the shocks, which is why I'm 
*almost* convinced (I trust his opinion).  I'm still having trouble getting 
over the price, though.  I know... good parts cost money.  The thing is, I 
can buy GABRIEL_GUARDIAN shocks from my FLAPS for $14 a pop.  That's what I 
have on my 74 now, and they do the job (I have nothing else to compare to).  
I get that the KONI shocks are better, but are they really $70 a piece 
better (almost $300 total)?  Money is hard to come by, I'm cheap, and that 
$300 could buy allot of other bus stuff.
     I searched the archives but I couldn't find feedback from the last 
group buy.  Are there people out there from the last group buy that can give 
me some feedback?  I'm just looking for a few more people who put these on 
their bus to tell me that they are totally worth the price.
