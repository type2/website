Subject: Can you spare a flywheel lock (SF, CA)?

Hello listers,

I'm having a heck of a time finding a flywheel lock (aka 'flywheel
holder' I think) for sale in the San Francisco area. The closest I can
find is about 30 minutes away and they're asking 20-30 dollars for
it... my efforts to jam the flywheel with screwdrivers etc have come
to naught.

Does anybody in the city or nearby have a flywheel lock I can borrow
for today or tomorrow? If you can help me out, name your beer and I'll
bring you six of them :) Or do you know of a place nearby that sells
them?

Again, this is in the SF, CA area - my apologies to the rest of you
for the spam.

Cheers!
Mike.
