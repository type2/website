Subject: RE: [T2] electrolytic rust removal

Different strokes for different folks.
Different tools for different jobs.

     I don't use the electrolytic rust method for everything I come across 
that needs rust removed.  I'm willing to bet that you don't use your sand 
blaster for everything you have to take rust off of either.  It's one of 
many methods that I can draw from to do the job.  It's also about as cheap 
as sand blasting.  Your materials are some rebar, washing soda, a plastic 
tub, and a battery charger that you should probably have around anyway.  
Just like I have many tools in my tool box, some of which might do similar 
or the same tasks, this is just another method at my disposal to remove 
rust.  That's kind of important on these old busses.  If you preffer to 
simply ignore this other method entirely because you own a sandblaster, feel 
free :-D  While you are sandblasting all of your engine tin, with your 
resperator on and all that junk, I'll be in the backyard with my feet up 
watching the rust bubble off of mine while I have a beer!
