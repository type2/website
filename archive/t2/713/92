Subject: RE: [T2] electrolytic rust removal

"My next tub I am going to build will be bigger."
-Me too, I'm looking for an old used fiberglass tub with a drain :-)

"I am thinking about using some plate/sheet steel as the electrodes on all 4 
sides. "
-Good idea, with the greater surface area it would probably work better.  It 
seems like kind of a "line of sight" process.  I use rebar because it's very 
cheap.  The electrode is eaten up in the process, so after a while it will 
need to be replaced.

"I can't believe how easy it is. Remembering all the time spent with wire 
brushes, sand paper, files, sandblasting, etc. I wish I had known how to do 
this before. "
"Water and a plastic scrub brush. It's a beautiful thing."

-Yeah, I couldn't believe it when it started to bubble and actually DO 
something right before my eyes!  I'm kind of a science geek, so this pretty 
much had me jumping up and down and giggling like a school girl :-D Truly 
the "smarter not harder" way, IMHO.
