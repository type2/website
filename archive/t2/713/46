Subject: Engine Alternative for 71 Bus (Re:

Craig and list-

  I saw your note while reading the list from a few days ago and read some of
the replies, here is my "life experience":
  I tried to find an engine for my 72 Bus a while ago and could find
many buses with blown engines for sale or in junk yards.  Engines that still
worked were nowhere to be found.  I bought a rebuild that lasted 17k miles
before the head failed and I had another engine blow up in my other 72 Bus.
   I decided to try a Corvair engine. I have now put about 3K miles on the
Bus
with this engine and I think it is a very good alternative to the type IV
(and
bug engine).  The engine is about the same size, air cooled, about the same
weight (maybe less), and has a lot more power (110hp).  It also has hydraulic
lifters and is a very strong engine.  In my opinion it is a better engine
than
any of the VW air cooled engines.  Gas mileage may not be too bad since the
engine doesn't have to work very hard to move the bus along, (although I've
never checked).
   I got a kit from Clark's Corvairs and an engine and transmission from a
man
in Gettysburg PA who has a junk yard that is all corvairs.  When done you end
up with a Corvair 6 cylinder engine and transmission connected to the VW
axles.
   Let me know if you want more details.
