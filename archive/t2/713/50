Subject: New here, and having L jet trouble

Hello and peace to all, I am being force- introduced to L jetronic by
aquireing a vw 412 with an EC motor. The motor itself is in excellent
running shape (37k original . Here is the problemmiles). Its the management
system that is giving me trouble, mainely due to my unfamiliarity with it.
Here is the problem; the motor had a miss in it, took it to my trusted
mechanic, a tune up later it was good as new. 3 days later it suddenly
dropped adle speed and would not respond to gas pedal untill fllored. Limped
home. Now when I start it, it runs great & strong for 30-60 secs then
abruptly dies, again and again. Have so far replaced to no effect:  a) AFM,
b) volt regulator, c) fuel pump replay, d) Head Temp Sensor. I have run out
of clues in my own very limited experience with L jet and have become
completely stumped. Any and all tips or advice to get this motor running
again will be forever appreciated.
TIA
Hisham
