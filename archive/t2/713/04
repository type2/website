Subject: Re: [T2] Carb Ice-ing

I'm thinking the overnight in carb cleaner is the key fact. It was explained 
to me that carb dip was a 30 minute only solvent b/c carbs come with an enamel 
sealing the carb metal and this is stripped off by excessive soaking. 

Take THAT with a grain of salt. However from about 5 different sources I have 
been told not to soak a carb in carb dip any longer than necessary.

Hey Chris  I would like to see some proof of this  ??     The only enamel I 
have seen on carbs was where some dumbas painted the damn thing  The key to 
cleaning carbs is to wash it off after soaking with hot water and using air 
nozzle to blow out the ports really good.   What is the time limit that determines 
longer than necessary ???    inquiring minds want to know  Later and have fun
