hello Chris  about as scientific as we need   LOL     I think they are just 
covering their asses telling you that you shouldnt leave too long, and it 
wouldnt surprize me that some dumbass would just put the whole carb in without 
dissassembling it., I've  seen people do stupider things .  I have found that 
water will do more harm than the carb dip.  I have had some carbs so gummed up 
that I had to soak them for a week.  There is also the Coca-cola dip  LOL    
later and have fun  Mark Dearing
