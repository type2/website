Subject: Re: New here, and having L jet trouble

Hello Hisham,
While I'm not familiar with the 412, the typical reason why a no idle 
develops in an L jet engine is a vacuum leak in any one of the several air 
hoses connected to the intake air distribution manifold. The fact that the 
engine ran well for several days, then suddenly developed this problem 
suggests something began to leak air thus by-passing the AFM and resulting 
in a false reading by that unit. Result: too lean a mixture and die out. The 
first 30-60 seconds of operation may reflect the temporary inrichment by the 
cold start valve, but after it shuts off the mixture is too lean to sustain 
your idle. So check each and every hose and clamp that is in anyway 
connected to the air distribution manifold, including the one bewteen the 
AFM and the throttle, the power brake booster, the idle air valve, etc. Only 
after eliminating such a leak would you want to consider the fuel supply as 
the problem. You might try spritzing vey small bursts of starter fluid at 
the hose clamps when the engine is running to see if it senses any temporary 
inrichment at the point of a leak.
