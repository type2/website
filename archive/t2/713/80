Subject: Steering box Question

Did anyone reply to Miles about the difference between the 71 steering
box and the 73-79 steering box? I've been off digest for a while and was
curious about the difference and also if there was any way to adapt the
newer version to the older steering setup. Even if it can't be done, it
would be informative to know why not.
Thanks for the time.
