John:

Way back in the 70's my first car was a '65 stock 40 hp beetle.  I used 
to get the same thing, icing on the outside of the intake manifold 
right under the carb flange where the manifold curved.  This would 
occur particularly in humid weather even during the hot/humid summer 
months with the engine hot.  It never really seemed to affect the way 
it ran.  It was really a good running simple car.

I doubt that this is indicates that your carb is bad.  It is simply an 
artifact of the evaporation of gas into air (which is what you want) 
which produces a drop in temperature.  My heat risers were working 
properly at the time because I had unclogged them per Muir.

Is your car running poorly?
