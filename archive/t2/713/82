Subject: RE: [T2] electrolytic rust removal

     I have started to use electrolytic rust removal quite allot.  It takes 
time, but it's pretty much all time spent with the part setting in a bucket, 
and not time sanding and wire brushing.  I'll take that any day :-)  The 
following are some things I've found out about this process.  They may be 
obvious to everybody else, but they weren't to me:

1) Degrease the part carefully, any oil or grease will be a problem (no 
contact with the solution).
2) Arm and Hammer Washing soda is the same exact thing as most pool PH 
uppers (sodium carbonate), and it they just as well (I couldn't find washing 
soda).
3) The bigger the battery charger (higher the amps), the faster the process 
works.
3) This does not fix any pitting in the metal caused by the rust.
4) Scrub the part as soon as it comes out of the bucket and put something on 
it to prevent it from rusting again  right away (coat of WD-40, paint, 
whatever).  Parts treated like this will rust very, very quickly if not 
treated immediately.
5) You can do rust spots on the body using a sponge.  Just soak a sponge 
with the solution, lay aluminum foil attached to the battery charger over 
the back of the sponge, and place it on the rust spot.  The body has to be 
attached to the other wire from the battery charger, of course.  I 
disconnect the battery before I do this.  You might have to re-soak the 
sponge every now and then.

     Instead of jumper cables, I bought some solid bare copper wire at the 
hardware store in a guage that's easy to bend (I forget what guage it is).  
I use rebar for my electrodes and just wrap a loop of the copper wire around 
the top of each bar around the  bucket to connect them all together 
electrically.  I guess it doesn't matter what you use, as long as it carries 
the current.
