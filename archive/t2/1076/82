Subject: Brake woes

Hi Folks,

I'm struggling with a brake issue.  This is a a '70 bus with stock brakes.  It
pulls drastically to the left, and the braking power is not all there.  I've
replaced the cylinders, shoes, flex lines.  My question is: can a failing
master cylinder cause such symptoms?  How does one know when a master cylinder
is bad?  And who is selling quality master cylinders these days?  Any other
thoughts welcomed.

Thanks,
Jerry
