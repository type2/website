Subject: Dog house and dog carb!

I went out to work on my '63 camper yesterday.  I pulled of the tube 
 from the air cleaner and found my carb full of dry dog food.  There 
were no holes in any hoses.  I took off the oil bath air cleaner.  It 
was full of dog food too!

What the 
heck!____________________________________________________________________
