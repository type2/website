Subject: Re: [T2] Hitch question!!! HELP ME!!!

Apologies for the hijack, but how do you (or how does Don) repair the captive nuts?  One of mine has broken free and I was thinking I might have to slice open the frame, weld the nut on and weld it back together.  I was hoping there was a less destructive way.

Thanks,

-David
