Subject: Litchfield show CT Sunday this weekend

Hi y'all.

Just a word to refresh your mind about an interesting show which will be held
this weekend in CT at the Harwinton Fairground. 21st edition. Called the
"Litchfield Show" even if not held exactly there for many years now.

Lost of parts, lots of vehicules and lots of fun.

I planned to be there even if it is a little far to me.  Never know, I may win
one of the long distance award.

So you people with vans and westies, come down the night before for on site
camping then you may start your show ealy the day after.

See you there and look for my french accent.
