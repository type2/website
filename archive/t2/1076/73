	To make things even more confusing, let me mention that in 
the classic motorcycle racing scene beer-can aluminium has a strong 
following for gaskets between iron barrels and aluminium or iron 
heads.  It is of course thinner than those fancy prone-to-leak copper 
gaskets, which means it lowers the CR less (tho' I think all such 
effects are minor).  On the other hand, it crushes less, so the metal 
faces have to be just that much more accurately lapped.
	 This material is easy to cut to shape, and the price is 
right  8-) .  If the ones you can acquire turn out to be aluminum 
rather than aluminium, that will probably do :-| .
