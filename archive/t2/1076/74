Subject: RE: [VB] Push Rod length help

Push rod length is determined after you put the motor together.  You might
'get away' with whatever you put in, but a little work can ensure you get as
much lift as possible without sacrificing wear.

Allright Y'all,
I am putting this 1600 SP engine back together and I have 2 different
lengths of push rods.  So, for a 1600 SP, how long should the RIGHT pushrods
be??

PEACE!
