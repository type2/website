	I disclaim that imposing title, but offer these comments:-

1.  purge those final figures after the decimal place  -  they are a 
textbook example of spurious precision, at best a nuisance, and 
meaningless.  These plurry digital instruments abound with bullshit 
:-D

2.  the close similarity of those 4 'Equis' readings is very 
reassuring, along with the high values (well above 100).  If my motor 
read that good, I'd be happy.  You have nothing to worry about from 
these readings.

3.  The less even readings yesterday are no reason to  panic  - 
they're still all > 100   -  but you may as well read again after, 
say, a hunred or so more miles.


	At the risk of repetitiveness:

4.  comp readings must be on warmed-up engine, so that oil is sealing 
piston rings as well as possible

5.     "          "         "       "   with throttle wide open, so 
that a full charge of gas has been taken in on each intake stroke.
