It's the mouse pee you have to worry about- I've had 3 places rot out
because of this: 1. The front door cavity at the bottom; 2. The cavity
of the body brace running across just under the engine door; look just
above the engine seal there and you will see two holes they can use for
access. 3, Inside the rear hatch door; they can chew through the
fiberboard cover.   Inside of the foot kick panels they will nest in the
fiberglass there.  Mine were getting in from below through rust out
below the kick panels, just behind the bumper tube.
