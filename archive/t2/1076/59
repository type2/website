Luke,

Thanks for taking the time to post your photos. See links below.

I was at both OCTO and The Classic. Truly mind boggling from both the sheer 
number of vehicles (around 300 splitties at OCTO and maybe 1500+ vehicles at 
Classic) to the wide range of vehicle conditions, customizations and pure 
art. There are even some new and innovative products for our aging vehicles. 
For one, a trick distributorless ignition system bases on F*#d products.
