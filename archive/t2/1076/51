Subject: '74 Westy orange upholstery cloth??

I have been trying..in vain.. to find a supplier for the orange material in my
Westy, and have followed threads on this site, but..none!  Have been hunting
'boneyards' for potential donors,..nothing..and now my question, which has
prolly been rehashed as much as what tyres, and what oil,..but  with cheap
labor 'offshore', is it just there is not enough market here to develop
product, as to need for same,..or costs would be hugely prohibitive once
product was developed? I love the "audacity" that the orange plaid presents to
sight, and how it completes the van!  Cheers
