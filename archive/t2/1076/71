I ordered a "Felpro" brand engine gasket kit from my FLAPS and there were NO copper gaskets, but there were paper gaskets that looked like they were meant for this application. So.... are the paper gaskets between the tops of the cylinders and the head an acceptable substitue for the copper "crush" type???

the paper gaskets are for between the cyl and the case, "officially"
VW says to eliminate the copper crush gaskets.  personally I've had
trouble when I've eliminated them and now always use em when i put
heads back on. they are readily avaliable from most of the VW
suppliers.

YMMV
