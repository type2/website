Subject: Hitch mock-up

So I decided to go ahead and mount this hitch just to see exactly how
"beefy" it may be. Turns out that if it is properly mounted to the bumper as
well as the mustache bar (which my bumper needs to be banged out a little
and to have it's own mounts refreshed) it looks as if it is pretty solid.

Tongue weight rating is 100lbs, which seems to be the standard, and from the
looks of it, more than that will just bend the hitch down if not properly
mounted to the bumper.

Here are some pics I took of my mock-up. I intend on straightening out the
bumper and getting all the mounting holes for the bumper fixed and refreshed
before the final mount. From the sounds of it, there are a few of us that
have some busted nuts that need to be fixed before our bumpers can be solid
to the frame again.

Let me know what you think...
