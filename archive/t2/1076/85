Subject: Hitch question!!! HELP ME!!!

I purchased a trailer hitch on JC Whitney to pull a small trailer. The one
they pictured on the site was similar to the style that most cars have. When
I got my hitch, the one I received was the style that attaches to the engine
mount bar as well as the bumper... as style that Jon Stiles has pointed out
is not only the incorrect type as originally designed by VW, but also that
this smaller style may not be as "solid" as an actual Jamie River's style
hitch.

Here is a picture of it.

Is anyone using this one? Is it worth worrying about? Am I seriously in
trouble using this one?
