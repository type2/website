Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 Head Gasket??

When I rebuilt my 1600 dp roadside last summer I didn't use any gasket
between the heads and cylinders. Just used some valve grinding
compound and "lapped" the cylinders to the heads.  The round paper
gasket gets used between the case and the cylinders with a light
application of permatex 3h aviation gasket sealant on the paper
gasket. Tom Wilson's book "How To Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air Cooled
Engine" was pretty valuable in helping out with these little details.

good luck

ordered a "Felpro" brand engine gasket kit from my FLAPS and there were NO
copper gaskets, but there were paper gaskets that looked like they were meant
for this application. So.... are the paper gaskets between the tops of the
cylinders and the head an acceptable substitue for the copper "crush" type???
