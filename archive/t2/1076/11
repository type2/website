Subject: Saw a 'wierder ???? VW Van"

Hello from the Great white North!  Comming  up the East Island Pass, ...also
known as the Malahat, ..saw a "van", that looked like a VW westy, that was
'sliced' down the middle, and had a great 'hightop' and was yellow and
white,..and had a forsale  sign in the window!  Anyone on the list, know what
that was?
