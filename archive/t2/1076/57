" I found the aftermath of a pretty rockin mouse party upon pulling my
headliner "

I'm restoring my '72 Westy, and got the same surprise when I removed the
headliner above the cab compartment. I found a TON of droppings, and the
critter had used the insulation up there to build himself quite a nice
little rodent bachelor pad. 

The one additional item I found up there was the original occupant as well
(long since deceased.)

After giving him a proper rodent burial and removing what seemed to be 10
pounds of "previously processed food" - all is good to go... that is, after
I find the perfect replacement for the perfectly good insulation he turned
into a home
