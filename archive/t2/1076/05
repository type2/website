the first time I had the lines apart and the engine out I put in ball
valve shut off valves into the lines.  now anytime I need to do
anything in the fuel system I just turn the valve 90degrees and done.

no more fuel in face syndrome.  two valves and clamps cost less than
the tool.

also works great when parking for a period of time as extra security
from theft, reach under, turn one valve engine doesn't run.  just
remember to turn it back on when you get home, thought it was broken
after long flight until light bulb went off.
