Subject: 1600 Head Gasket??

I am putting together a 1600 SP and the old engine which the heads came off of had a copper crush gasket between the top cylinders and the head.  I ordered a "Felpro" brand engine gasket kit from my FLAPS and there were NO copper gaskets, but there were paper gaskets that looked like they were meant for this application. So.... are the paper gaskets between the tops of the cylinders and the head an acceptable substitue for the copper "crush" type???

PEACE!
