Subject: Insulation inside of tin around exhaust header

Hey all,
I removed the exhaust from my 1979 California bus yesterday.  It is
the CA exhaust with the big catalytic converter on the left side.  I
ran into some significant trouble when trying to remove the exhaust
header from the head on the left side; it seemed like the studs
weren't exactly parallel with each other.  In order to get that header
off I had to give it some tapping with a hammer in order to "walk" it
off of the studs.  But in order to tap it I had to remove the tin
shielding from around the header (it had a molded tin shield wrapped
abound the bottom section).  When I removed that shielding (after
carefully folding open the seams, of course) I found that the
shielding was packed with some sort of insulation.  Some of the
insulation broke up a bit but the majority of it remained intact; I'd
say that 85% of the insulation is still there.

I didn't know that I'd find insulation in there and have a few
questions:
1)  What is this stuff?
2)  Why do I only have tin around the header on the left side?  (Did
some PO remove the tin from the right header or was it never there to
begin with?)
3)  Is it okay to put the tin back on with the insulation in the shape
it's in?
4)  If I do have to replace the insulation, what do I replace it
with?  I was thinking that ceramic blanket would probably be the ticket.

Thanks a million!  I can't wait to get my bus back on the road.
