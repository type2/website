Subject: Re: Axle shaft - symmetrical?

There's a variety of options for moving the CVs around - but not on an
automatic!

This is my favourite explanation:
http://www.van-cafe.com/home/van/page_16_9/cv_joint_maintenence.html

"3) Rotate the CVs at about 25,000 miles (more frequently if you like).
NOTE: This is not possible on automatic transmissions, as the axles are
different lengths! (You can accomplish this by moving the CVs to
different axle locations, but this takes more effort.) See the section
on removal and replacement below. CVs take wear on one face of the ball
hubs only (except when you drive in reverse), so they can be made to run
in the opposite direction to extend their life. There are two ways you
can accomplish this. Assume you're looking at the back of the van, and
the CVs are labeled with letters, like this:
A------B Transmission C------D
You can move the axles so that the letters now read:
C------D Transmission A------B (option 1) OR
D------C Transmission B------A (option 2)
These two configurations will result in the forces being applied to the
CVs being reversed. Note, however, that the following configuration will
NOT reverse the forces applied to the CV joint rotation:
B------A Transmission D------C
In other words, if you move the axles to the other side of the van, the
forces being applied to the CVs will be reversed. If you keep them on
the same side of the van, they won't.. "
