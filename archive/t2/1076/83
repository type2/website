My guess would be a blockage in the line or excessive air in the right 
line.  I'm not sure about the 70 model, but usually there is a front and 
rear circuit, not left and right.  So if the master cylinder was bad, I 
would think you'd get poor braking power all over or the front/rear 
braking power would be funky.. not so much left/right.  I would trace 
the lines coming off of your master cylinder and see if they split and 
go to each side.  If that's the case, I'd take them apart, blow through 
them with compressed air and make sure it's all clean and clear of any 
obstructions/dirt/etc.

Have you flushed and correctly bled all of your brake lines?  Are you 
sure they're all running clean?  The fluid should not be dark - that 
means it has absorbed water.  You should get in the habit of flushing 
your brake lines every few years..
