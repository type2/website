Subject: Cylinder compression test

Is it possible to do a compression test by turning by hand?

I'm rebuilding a FI engine. I jugs installed the jugs, pistons, and heads.
The lifters, push rods, and tubes are next.

Thanks for the help. Also are 14" tires stock for the bus; or is 15 " tires
OK . My brother is giving me 5-15" tires, and I want to make sure I can use
them.

If the engine starts, you're half way home
