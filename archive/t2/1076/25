Subject: compression testing

Hey,
Yesterday I used a "snap on" Compression tester on my 1978 CDN.

1-140
2-110
3-120
4-140
Jumped for peak

Is there any "Zen" to these numbers? They were plugs out.

On April 24, 2003, with plugs in I read with a "Equis" tester.

1-122.5
2-120.0
3-122.5
4-122.5

Jumped in 3 steps.

I seek the knowledge of the "aircooled compression oracle."
