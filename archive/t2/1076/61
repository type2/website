Subject: Carbs question

Hello all,

I'm in the process of rebuilding my carbs (dual solexes, 32-34 PDSIT
from a stock 2.0 liter type4) including new throttle plate bushings and
of course a complete gasket set. Now I want to adjust them properly. I
checked throttle and starter plate gap as described in the manual. Now
I'm stuck with measuring the accelerator pump injection volume: I
temporarily hooked the carbs up to a marine tank that has a small pump
on it and flooded the carb until I could not get more fuel in (float
valve working), but did not hook up the cutoff valves to 12V. Somehow,
there is no fuel injected when actuating the accelerator pump. Is this
due to the cutoff valves being closed? As I understand it when looking
at the diagrams, injection should be occurring with cutoff valves
closed, shouldn't it?
Any help is greatly appreciated!
Cheers,
Timo
