Compression tests are a good general diagnostic, but won't tell you 
compression ratio or anything.  From the look of it, #2 and #3 might 
have leaky rings or valves, so you're next best bet would be to do a 
leakdown test and/or check/adjust the valves (you do have to adjust 
hydraulics as well).  Did you run the engine for a minute or so 
beforehand to allow the cylinders to be oiled?  That will make a 
difference in the compression readings.  Do not run it too long as you 
don't want to really heat up the heads and pull out the plugs because 
that can lead to damaged spark plug holes when you back the plugs out.  
You can also pour some oil in the chamber, but I don't like doing that...

If you do it with the other plugs in, it will just slow the engine down 
and probably give you lower numbers.  I did a compression test not too 
long ago and on each consecutive plug I tested (even with the other 
plugs removed), the engine got slower and slower as the battery died.  
The compression readings also got lower and lower until the last was 
90psi.  This was on a brand new rebuild.  I haven't tested them again, 
but the engine is running smooth as butter so I'm guessing that the 
cylinder is really producing more than 90psi ;)

Run the engine for a little bit to get some oil and gas on the cylinders 
and then test each plug with all the other plugs removed, and let the 
engine turn over at least 3 times or until the needle stops moving.  
Also make sure your battery is fully charged.

Lastly, I think the bentley has a spec of about 135psi if you were curious
