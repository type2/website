You'd think it might work like that, but actually, if you flip an axle 
shaft in place, and the torque will be applied in the same way to the 
CV joints.

If you want to equalize wear, you have to flip the individual CV 
joints, or move the whole shaft to the other side of the vehicle (and 
it has to have equal length shafts in order to do that).
