Subject: re: [T2] starting problems and burnt wires

Thanks for all your replies, they fixed the problem.  I went up this past
weekend and changed the battery terminal connectors, and cleaned up all the
connections on the starter and grounds.  The van turned over fast and strong.
I pulled the alternator out and the Brown D- wire was burnt.  I'll get this
fixed this week.  I'm guessing the problem was my engine to chassis ground was
not making a good connection and the starter used the small alternator wire to
ground it self.

Thanks again.
