Subject: Poptop/luggage paint colors?

Hi,

 

I'm (mostly) restoring my '72 Westy, and going to repaint it the original
Pastel White, but in looking at pictures of other "pastels," it looks as
though the poptop and luggage rack are painted a cooler (brighter) white
than the body.

 

Did the original Westy's come with Pastel White up top or was it, as it
looks to me, a brighter white color?

 

Thanks

Thom
