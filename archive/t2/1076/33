Ok, I was a little off. 70mph on a level road was 3600 rpm. I still dont
think that is very high as long as head temps are reasonable.

I checked vacuum and did a compression test today.

Vacuum was 15" at idle.

Compression test results:

1 - 130
2 - 140
3 - 135
4 - 130

I forgot to prop the throttle open, so I dont know how this
would affect the results.

I'll see how it drives tomorrow.
