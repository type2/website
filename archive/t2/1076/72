Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 Head Gasket??

As people are mentioning, possibilities are endless here.  The paper gasket
with Permatex or no gasket with some (nice thin uniform bead) of silicone is
what is usually used on the bottom, the paqper has essentially no thickness
(less than 0.010 certainly) so will make no real CR change, the silicone has
no thickness at all when squeezed out.  For the top a little lapping in the
fit, or using an ANNEALED (don't assume that it is, just because someone is
selling it for the purpose) copper gasket has good results.  They come in many
thicknesses and stock and non stock diameters for big bore sets, and can
mostly be used to help set a desired CR after cc'ing your heads and measuring
the deck heights, or you can steel shim under the jugs if you are lapping the
decks instead, same difference.  Some heads with a set quench area (and
thereby distance) should specifically NOT have this distance increased though
(with a copper head gasket or under cylinder
 shim) as they are more likely to detonate with a lower absolute compression
ratio because of the degraded performance of flame front propagation.  They
(the copper gaskets) are also available for the T4 FWIW for late bay folks,
though are a bit harder to find.  I like them in that application particularly
compared to the also officially deleted by VW steel shim gaskets.  But as many
have said, YMMV.  Annealed copper are generally pretty good at sealing
compression gases, in water cooled apps, not so good at sealing the water
jackets and passages, where they are sort of common for thick ones for
lowering CR for super/turbocharging.  You do NOT want to ever reuse any of
them, even if you re-anneal, unless in a real, real pinch (so to speak), there
is little crush left to them, so get it right and torque it down once.
