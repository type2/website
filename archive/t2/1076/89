Subject: Re: [T2] Hitch question!!! HELP ME!!!

Jamie, today was the day my hitch was installed on my 77 bus.. Even though
the bus is in great shape, two bolts had to be cut off and two retapped.  My
expert mechanic cut though the side of the frame and dropped in the two
bolts that were closest to the bumper as these nuts could not be saved.  It
took two hours including  figuring what to do. So if someone says the bolts
are rusted and receiving nuts gone, tell them to drill out the holes and
drill a hole into the side of the frame large enough to be able to fit a
bolt and washer into it to drop through the hole to attach the new nut .  I
hope this makes some sense.  The hitch fits  perfect.  Thanks.Rick Haynes

another method was to weld a nut to a flat bar,, drill out the flat bar ,,
tap it to the same thread as the nut.. then make a slot in the frame to
accept the flat bar with the nut held over top the old factory nut... and
put the new,, longer,,, bolt in..

something like that..

to slice open the frame, weld the nut on and weld it back together.  I was
hoping there was a less destructive way.
