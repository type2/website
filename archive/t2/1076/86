I thought Jon was going to help you repair the captive nuts for the 
bumper attachments so you could go with the other style of hitch.  What 
happened to that plan?  I don't have anything useful to add about the 
hitch, but Jon offered to help me with the same repair.  I plan on 
getting a hitch to tow a small trailer.
