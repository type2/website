Alan,

This is the tool the dealer (VW, MB, etc) used:

It very gently squeezes the hose closed and has a captive design for one handed operation. It works like a charm.

The ones in the photo are made by Stahlwille (12975) but I've seen at least one other brand:

Quoting Karl from the archives, they can be purchased at the MB dealer for the best price although I'm not sure of the part number to ask for.

The ball-valve mod is a something I had on my bus at one time when my gas tank was rusty and required frequent fuel filter changes and works great. I only prefer the clamps to them for the reason that I need to perform fuel line repairs on friend's buses that lack a shutoff.
