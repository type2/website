Subject: only 28 deg advance on dial distrib. 78

I recently put pertronics in the distr.-The '78 dual advance distr. only 
gets 28 deg total when I know it should be over 40- I sucked on a hose 
attached to the air canister and the plate (Pertronics) only moved a 
little bit- is this a vac problem or a stuck dizzy plate?  Since the 
plate pushes against the wiring before it exits out the old condensor 
hole, can this be impeding it?
