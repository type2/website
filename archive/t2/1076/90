Subject: Tranny rebuild kit

OK, so I decided to rebuild the transmission out of my 68 Double Cab.  I was
wondering if I should have my head examined or is this not that big a deal?  I
have my shop, allot of tools, pneumatics, hydraulics and a press.

 I have rebuilt engines in the past, but never tackled a trans overhaul. For
those who have done this, please let me know if I should attempt it or not
worth the trouble and just get a rebuilt.  I have read Ratwells info on the
transmission, and although it's tight in there, it doesn't look to
complicated.  I would also like to know if someone makes a rebuild kit or do I
have to buy the bearings, syncros and all the other bits separately.
