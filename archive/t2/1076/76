Subject: BusDepot: Pertronics for centrifugal vs vac advance difference?

Bus Depot lists a Pertronics 1847A and a 1847V points replacement
kit, one being for Centrifugal distributors and the other for vac 
advance units.  The distributor for 72-79 busses is a combo unit- AND 
under application both Pertronics is listed for 72-79 busses- so what is 
the difference?
