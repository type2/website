Subject: Engine miss

I have a '79 Federal 2.0L. I had been running high head temps whenever I
ran 65mph or over. Head temps would start climbing over 425F and keep
climbing if I let it. Once I slow down to stop and go traffic speeds, my
temps quickly drop to 380F or so. I had done everything to track down the
problem. Check for vacuum leaks, etc.  Injectors cleaned, new fuel lines,
SVDA, Crane X700, Timing (-at-) 7.5 BTDC. I'm pretty sure my AFM had been
messed with by my mechanic for tuning purposes. I decided to replace the
AFM, new dist cap/rotor, clean throttle body, new air filter. Wow, what a
difference. The new AFM (set to factory specs) really made a difference. I
can now run 70mph with head temps about 415-420F on a 93F day. Took a 60
mile drive and back, no problem.  The next day, on my way home, my engine
started to miss, mainly under load. Idles fine.  I found #3 spark plug
(where my CHT sender is) was loose. Tightened it, still misses under load.
I remembered I had removed my EGR linkage, since it had been crimped off
many many years ago. I hooked it back up, since that was something that I
had recently changed. No more miss. Thought my problem was fixed. 2 days
later, it's back. I dont know what else to check. My spark plugs (NGK
B6ES) look ok, nice tan color. The miss only occurs after the engine is
hot and under load. I can barely hear a miss at idle. I dont know what
else to look for. Could a failing head temp sensor cause this? Any other
ideas?
