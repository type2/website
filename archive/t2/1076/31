Subject: front door pull retaining clips

hey everyone,

trying to track down the metal clips that have screw holes in them so
i can mount my door pulls to the front doors on my 77 bus.  i have one
but can't find the other three.  i've checked a couple of websites but
can't find them.  anyone know if these are still available?  if so,
where?


thanks,

jeremiah
