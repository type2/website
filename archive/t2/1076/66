Subject: Re: [VB] Push Rod length help

Is that as opposed to the Left push rods? My recollection is that all the 
push rods are the same length. Actual length may vary slightly depending 
upon which rockers you are using.

Allright Y'all,
I am putting this 1600 SP engine back together and I have 2 different 
lengths of push rods.  So, for a 1600 SP, how long should the RIGHT pushrods 
be??

PEACE!
