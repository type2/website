Assume these are or were orginal 13mm across the flats (ATF). Next 
smallest wrench is 1/2", try that and if you got use a 6 side box 
wrench. Still too big, next size down is 12mm. Still won't work?? 
Then I get out the long chisel and hammer and break them off, or at 
least break through one side. Then they will come off with a vise 
grip or maybe just your fingers.

Note when using the chisel/hammer tech. If you angle the chisel just 
right you can sometimes start the nut loosening. Give it a few strait 
on blows to create a notch, then angle the blows to knock it counterclockwise.

As mentioned by others, before starting do soak with a good 
penetrating fluid. PB Blaster is a very good one, as is Kroil. WD 40 
is mediocre at everything it claims to do. Along with the fluid, 
another tech that just flat works for this and also stubborn taper 
joints and close fittings is tapping with a small hammer. Just light 
taps with a light hammer. I use a very small ball peen, like maybe a 
3 oz item. Very light tap/tap/tap/tap like 200 times per minute for 2 
or 3 minutes. Helps to break the bond and also the little vibrations 
will aid the fluid in penetrating.
