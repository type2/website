Some parts of Europe might be a better source than UK since the vehicle tax structure meant that more 1600cc single carb beetle engines were installed in 72-79 baywindows than the CJ Type 4 engine.

Wouldn't it be easier to just cut the slot and two holes for the the bolts than cut up two buses?

Just tap the hole to the left of the intake?

This I don't understand. Why forgo the vacuum control of the pressure regulator and then adjust the idle mixture? Why not adjust the wiper inside the AFM and then check the exhaust as you rev the engine?

I think they are just importing the same Brosol "Kadrons" we get.

If the Type 4 cam was virtually universal and the 1800cc engine ran both carbs and FI from the factory, it seems adapting the parts like Greg did would have good results.
