Subject: Re: [T2] center seat clamps

Wow... that's a coincidence. I just called the VW dealer here in Oakland 
today requesting the same part (I got the part number off one of the 
brackets that I do have, and by the way, they are slightly different 
from the two that hold the rear seat). I got excited when he found the 
part # in the computer, but guess what? They've been obsoleted. I wonder 
what they use in the Brazilian buses?

I can get the part # for you if you want it. I do know off the top of my 
head that the bolts are a M10 x 1.5 thread, and if you build up a floor 
similar to a Westy (plywood, tempered hardboard and linoleum) they need 
to be 60mm in length. I think the stock ones are 40mm. I found a source 
for the bolts (they are full carriage head, but can be ground down on 
the sides) here :http://tinyurl.com/jt2oa


Let me know if you wind up finding more than you need somewhere, and 
I'll do the same, Jeremiah.
