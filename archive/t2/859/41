The ball joints in the VW boxes are often Nakata Mexico (look for the big N).

BugHaus was selling US made VW boxed ball joints a few months ago. Their website says otherwise but give them a call to see if they can still get the US made ones:

Lemforder was another OEM. I've seen a lot for sale advertized as German but they have all been from Brazil. Wolfsburg West is one example.

I'd check with Bus Depot as they can often bring in the rare German made parts:
