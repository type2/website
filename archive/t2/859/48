Subject: Re: [T2]1700 change to FI?

Hi Doktor, and welcome back to the list.

I did some considerable research before I converted my carb'd bus to  
L-jet two years ago and would like to add my $0.02 CDN to this  
discussion.`

Why wouldn't the 1.8L L-jet work for a 1700??? The difference in  
displacement is only 5.5%. L-jetronic FI is controlled by the Air- 
Flow meter, so the ECU doles out fuel to the engine based on the  
amount of air being drawn into it. 5.5% less air (displacement) will  
correspond to 5.5% less fuel. There may be some minor adjustments in  
the mixture curve but I expect that 5.5% should be within the margin  
for error. I have swapped successfully components back and forth  
between a 1.8L and 2L L-Jet FI configuration on my 2L engine without  
noticeable effects showing on the cylinder head temps. It might make  
a difference up near the redline but the ECU puts the redline at 5500  
RPM where sane drivers fear to tread.

Rather than mix and match parts and second-guess the designers, why  
not go with a complete 1.7L D-jet Fi setup from a 411, 412 or 914?  
They used a lot of common parts with L-Jet but had smaller injectors.  
Failing that, go with a new aftermarket system like Megasquirt that  
has already been tested in a 1.7L configuration. You don't have to  
reinvent the wheel.

When I converted all I had to do was put a T in the line from my  
original tank. I have checked the fuel pressure with the T in place  
and with a direct line running back to the tank filler hose and there  
is no difference.

There are lots of ways to skin this proverbial cat. I haven't heard  
too many success stories with the CB performance dual solex setup, so  
I thought I would contribute my own experiences.

Happy trails,
