Subject: Proper gauge for ignition wire

Hi list,



My ignition wire, the one that runs from the bottom of fuse 10 on the
fuse block to the coil shorted out. What is the proper color and gauge
of this wire? Any tips for easily replacing it? This is a '71 bus. The
Bentley (wiring diagram D) shows it as one wire so I imagine replacement
will be easier. I will be putting the inline fuse back on this wire when
I replace it.



Thanks,



Max
