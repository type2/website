Subject: Re: [T2]1700 change to FI?

One thing i do know about this is that the 1.7 D jet from a 412 or 914 had 
heads that had a tube in the top for one of the FI components...worked off 
manifold pressure or something like that.  I forget exactly what those tubes 
were for, but they were important.

I think you could tweak the FI from an 1800 and make it work just fine on a 
1700.
