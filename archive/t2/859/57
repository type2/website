Subject: Adapting foldable tire rim to reg. tire?

I took a never used foldable tire out of a 74 parter camper years ago 
figuring it could be a spare rim (tire was totally cracked up).  As 
daughter has a bent rim, I took it today to be dismounted and revalved 
so I could bring it to her at Everybus.  It's a nice looking stock size 
rilver rim with a special valve.  They refused to remove the valve-seems 
to be part of the rim or may be oversized in its hole?  It looks like a 
double tube, one being the valve and the one next to it looking hollow. 
  Any experts out there on any problem with using this rim for a stock 
tire?  What was the extra "tube" next to the valve for?  I thought these 
came with an air pump that fits the valve?
