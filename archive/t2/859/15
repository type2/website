Subject: Friday Question: East Coast Fuel Prices

Hi Volks,

Our Annual Everybus outing gets started in two weeks and this year  
it's a doozie...

Toronto, ON - Erie, PA  on "Good Thursday"
Erie PA - Clemmons NC  on Good Friday.
Clemmons NC - Outer Banks on Easter Monday
OBX - EveryBus on Thursday
EveryBus - Toronto on Sunday.

2100 miles, approximately. That'll take something like 100 - 120  
gallons of fuel.
If there are list members along the route listed above who can tell  
me what gas is selling for, I'd like to hear about it. P-mail would  
be fine. Up here in Toronto we are paying a buck a liter this week,  
which works out to $3.25US/U.S. Gallon.

If there's anyone coming to Everybus from the OBX on Thursday I would  
be thrilled to Carabus, since you probably know the route better than  
I do.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
Toronto, Ontario, Canada
