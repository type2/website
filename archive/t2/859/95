Subject: Van starts best WITH a vacum leak

My van has been starting really well recently. *Really* well. Turn the key 
and instant starting. Fantastic.

I put it down to replacing the voltage reg and the appalling mush that was 
the carbon brushes.

However I discovered a couple of days ago that the air filter elbow was 
loose. The lack of tickover had been put down to a cold engine so I hadn't 
suspected a vacuum leak like this. I tighted up the elbow and tickover is 
much improved.

But now the van is back to taking 5 seconds or so to start. I turn the key, 
the engine turns over a few times and then starts a bit sluggishly.

The only bits of the engine that haven't been replaced in the last few years 
are the dizzy and alternator. Apart from the starting, running is very good 
so I'm guessing that the timing is off - but only at start-up. I and my 
mechanic have re-timed the engine (and the old one as well) several times 
over the years and I'm happy this is right.

So there must be an issue with the vacuum circuit. My thought is to replace 
the can (diaphragm ?) on the side of the dizzy as this is an easy job and 
it's at least 10 years old. I'm loath to replace the dizzy as its otherwise 
OK.

Any suggestions ? These things are supposed to run worse with a vacuum leak 
not start better !

Thanks
