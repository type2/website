They did indeed fold in on themselves to take up less room.  However, it
was one of the dumber ideas, since it resulted in a nearly irreplacable
tire that was probably dangerous to use within a decade.  Some US cars
also had them, but with a can of freon for inflation instead of an
electric pump.

Modern "donuts" a somewhat better idea, but still not for those of us who
take long trips.  Heck, with the odd tire size I carry two spares on
trips!

I wonder why the idea of under-floor storage was never explored for buses?
the center heat duct would have to be relocated, but then there would be
plenty of space for a spare under there.
