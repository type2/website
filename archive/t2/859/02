Subject: Type 2 1600 DP long block or head replacement steps [LONG]

My wife accuses me of being locked into a linear thinking mode and she's
right.  Multi-tasking is beyond my abilities and by way of example, I resisted
moving to Windows from DOS for years because I couldn't believe one ever
needed to have two applications open at the same time.  Anyway, I've developed
a set of step-by-step instructions for yanking the engine out of a 1971 Bus
and either doing a long block swap or installing new heads.  The steps were
liberally stolen from Muir and Benchley and modified to my own needs and
experiences.  I just put on new heads last weekend and made a few corrections
to my precious list (I'd be lost without it) and thought that it might be of
use to newbies who can sometimes get confused by the myriad of engine and
vehicle types in Muir and the austere German style of Benchley.

It's far from perfect (I find errors on it all the time) and really is
tailored to the specific idiosyncrasies of my latest 71 T2.  This one has an
exterior oil cooler and filter which makes things a little different from the
Busses owned by other folks (for example, I don't have one of those little
hard-to-find front fan housing cover plates and I have to deal with oil hoses)
but more or less it should work as a starting point for those with the same
year and model.  It's pretty terse in that the stuff you just naturally know
how to do after years of dealing with these vehicles is absent and a first
timer ought to use it only as a supplement to Muir and Benchley, not as a
replacement.

I hope this is useful to somebody.  I figured I owed the type2.com community
something back for all the help I've received from you folks since the very
first days the site was up and running.
