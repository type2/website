Hello Gail;    Well it seems you have come to the right  place.  We work on 
everything rolls, floats or flys  :)    there is a locking lever inside on the 
side of the headlite housing that you  unlock and slide down .  As you slide 
it down you have to be pulling the  housing out the front at the same time.  
The housings tend to stick if they  have never been out before and you have to 
be careful as there is a lot of  plastic in there . going back is as they say 
the reverse of the remove.   There are line up postss that you need to get 
right on putting it back in   later and have fun  Mark Dearing    Salem Import
