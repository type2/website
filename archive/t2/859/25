Subject: MICRONTA wires (on digital Tach/Clock)

Hello.  I bought a 'NOS' MICRONTA 63-837A digital Tach/Clock, sold by Radio
Shack.  I have the unit, but I have no idea where the wires go ! ! !
Right, no installation instructions.  (But would I read them if I had
them?!?!?)

There are five colored wires:  Red, Yellow, Green, White and Black.  If you
recall my Pertronics question (thanks for your emails, guys), I would tend
to do the Black to ground, and the Red to power.  However, the Black wire is
fused with 0.3A in-line fuse.

So I am going to assume that the Black is my constant power-on, and I guess
I could find the ground colored wire by going to the negative post on the
battery.  Do you have any guess how to determine the other three wires??

And why do I need three wires; I thought just a (1) power-on for the Clock,
(2) Tach wire to the coil, and (3) ground..  The wire all appear to be the
same gauge, like small radio speaker wires.  The unit was made in Hong Kong,
so even if the wires were marked, I don't read or speak Chinese,  Heck, I
have enough of a problem with English..
