Timothy asked:


 I have never seen a foldable spare.  Do they make suca
a thing for 4 lug vws?  What is it?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

It is a collapsible tire permanently mounted on a rim. They came in VW buses, only the 74/75 deluxe Westfalia
because of the space saving and the Westy had no other place to store it inside. You can see pics of it here:

It also came in the Mercedes SLK and some years of the Porsch 924.

The MB SLK uses the same 5 x 112 bolt pattern. The 924 is 5 x 130.

I have never seen any other one offered in any other car.

Even though the VW one is now 30+ years old, you can buy a brand-new MB one that will fit the VW bus, made by
Vredestein, but it is NOT cheap!
Part # 203 400 54 00 and it has a suggested list price of $200 [and that was in 2001!].
