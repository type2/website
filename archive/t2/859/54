The OE pads (Pagid, Jurid, etc) are fair priced and work well but they produce a lot of brake dust. Not a big deal if you wash your wheels regularly (which you should do because the front wheels like to corrode more than the rears).

I believe the cause of the dust is because those pads are made in Europe to TUV regs. requiring the manufactures to include a certain percentage of graphite during manufacture. I'm not 100% sure but I believe this is too limit the amount of heat transfer from the pad to the caliper where the brake fluid could boil.

PBR is a popular alternative I see sold everywhere.
