Whetstone Caravan Directions Friday March 31st depart 9am. (if you can't
join the caravan there is a simple set of directions directly to Michael's
place near the bottom of this page.)

When you meet up at Fry's (Baseline West of I-10) swap cell numbers if you
don't have a CB. Get out your map and compare them to these directions. 

Head south on I-10 just about 11 miles and exit at Riggs Road. 

Turn left onto Riggs and take it about 4 miles to Arizona Ave (more folks
will join here.) 

Turn right and head South for one mile then keep left when the road splits.
You should now be on Hwy 87 heading towards Coolidge/Florence. Stay on 87
for 36 miles as the road veers due West and take it all the way to the
junction of Hwy 79 (or stop at the state penitentiary to visit uncle Earl.)

Turn right and head South on Hwy 79 all the way down to Oracle Junction (43
miles and be sure to tip your hat at Tom Mix's tomb.)

The caravan now splits up with those taking the paved route turning right
onto Hwy 77 and heading into Tucson. (Soon to be dusty people see below
where it says "Dusty Route."

Paved route through Tucson: 

77 becomes Oracle road. Take 77/Oracle down to River rd and turn left.  

Proceed about eight miles until you reach Sabino Canyon Rd.  (This avoids
almost all the city stop lights).  

 Go Right on Sabino Canyon about 2 miles.  

 Go left (east) on Tanque Verde to Houghton 

Turn right and head South to Sahuarita rd (turn left.) onto hwy 83. (did you
"salute" the American Legion as you passed?)

Right on hwy 83 to hwy 82, 

left on hwy 82 to hwy 90 

turn left, take hwy 90 to camino de tundra, 

right on camino de tundra. Dude you're here! 

Jon Stanton 602-684-8013 (paved route) 
David Lehan 602-738-2196 (dusty route) 
Michael Holzman 520-249-6917 (our host) 

Dusty route through Redington Pass: turn left on 77 at Oracle Junction,
follow to Hwy 76 and head South 40+ miles until you're passing under I-10,
turn right and follow this road to Hwy 80, turn left and head South out of
Benson. There will be a signed road that says Post Rd., that's not the one
you want. The one you want is a touch farther south. It has no sign but as
you access it from 80, you will go up a slight rise and cross a cattle
guard. The road will take you west 4 miles to Hwy. 90 and from there you can
head south to Camino de Tundra. If you 

If you're in a hurry route; take I-10 almost to Benson, head south on Hwy 90
to Camino de Tundra and look for the pine trees at Michael's place.

If you have a little extra firewood please bring it along. Drive safe and
see y'all there tomorrow night.
