First, thanks to everyone that p/emailed on this.  The only missing
component is the wiring harness, and it is from a federal emissions (so
the 2nd one in the above list) bus.  I still haven't decided if I'm
going to take the plunge into FI.  I suspect if I asked the list if I
should keep on with the Weber 32/36 or go FI, the overwhelming majority
would say FI.  So, lets assume that's already happened. Be forewarned,
you'll probably get lots of "where does this go" and "why doesn't this
do that" questions as I climb the learning curve so many of you have
already traveled.  Now to convince my wife that this is a good way to
spend our money and my spare time :)
