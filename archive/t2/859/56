well the 411/412 had FI from the get go.  now as an engineer we always
build in certain tolerances and the VW bus was basically a "truck" and
having lived in the fatherland I saw how some of those trucks were abused
and used and not maintained.. so I suspect there is some wiggle room.

each and every part is a "one of a kind"   now in WWII the German army
used the Lugar pistol. a beautiful work of art. precision and accurate.
unfortunately they also had to be cleaned and maintained.  Now the US used
the 45 cal pistol. a 100 could be made in in the time and for the price of
one lugar...  it could be fished out of a mudpuddle and fired, couldn't
hit the broad side of a barn door, but it kept on working and working and
literally overwhelmed the lugar, now this is one example of many at the
time.

  the Mercedes was the Lugar. the VW was the .45 and they were very robust
and forgiving (to a point)  I used for many years a 1.7l 411 engine as a
spare for my bus so I could keep going while working on the engine.
however I never had the Djet FI system that it needed, so I just swapped
in my 2liter L jet and if there was any difference in performance it
wasn't detectable via the seat of the pants guage.. (and since it was a
temp engine I didn't much care as long as it ran until I fixed my 2liter)

now what does all this long winded discourse mean....  I'm not sure it is
Fri.. but the VW bus engine is a robust and durable and very forgiving
piece of machinery..  Now I don't advocate not fixing ones' bus less than
as good as possible, but for many reasons some people are unable to do the
best, so as good as possible is often the only choice other than the
junkyard...
