Despite having to go through the US site, they still shipped from
Burnaby, which meant no duty, no brokerage fees and orders arriving
within a couple of days of being ordered, even with cheap shipping.

They stopped publishing a CDN dollar catalog a few years ago when the
CDN dollar was fluctuating so much compared to the US dollar.  I also
seem to remember ordering stuff from them before they had a website.
I can't remember if they had a US outlet at the time - the name
California Import Parts made even more sense then.
