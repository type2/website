Hey VW cats,
  
  I noticed an ad for an estate sale with camping equipment for  sale.  Started at 8, I got there at 9.  Had a beautiful,  green tent that could be used as an awning or walk through.   Perfect height for the bus, easy to set up, etc.  Only thing, some  guy beat me to it.  $20!  Damn it, musicians always sleep too  late.  But I did get a nice, big water fire extinguisher that I  can fill myself.  And a great, down-filled Army sleeping  bag.  The estinguisher is too big for the bus but will be nice to  have in the garage.  I've blown out my little powder extinguisher  twice in the last year.  I'm also looking for a small CO2  extinguisher for grease fires.  They're pricey.  I'm amazed  that most people don't even have any type of extinguisher in the  house.  Fire insurance won't stop a fire.
  
  I'm just about set for a trip to Everybus.  Gotta buy some metal  tape and seal some holes in the engine compartment, install tie rod,  get new Hancooks mounted and balanced, then the front end  alignment.  Going to see today about getting the oil sender  installed in the sump.  Can't do that myself.  Any advice on  the best place to drill?  Might even try to figure out how to  install a second battery.  I know I'll need the relay.  Will  my 55 amp alternator charge both of them?  Thanks.  See yall  thar...KR
