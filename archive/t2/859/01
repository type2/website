Subject: Help with impossible nuts!

Hey there folks
  I've been a proud owner of a 73 camper, named Bliss, for a few weeks now.
I've been lurking in the background, and reading the archives, but I've
gotten to a point where I'm absolutely stuck and none of the
suggestions/solutions I've found seem to work..
I have a 1800cc engine (I believe, the engine code says AP, which was sold
in 73-74 from what I've read.  Please correct me if I'm wrong) that came
already out of the bus.  It had the entire exhaust attached, and I've
managed to remove the muffler and right heat exchanger.  However, I have 2
nuts on the left heat exchanger, that are just driving me crazy.  Its the 2
nuts that on the inside of the exhaust bends.  I have a nut/bolt extractor
that worked great on the other nuts, but the clearance between the nuts and
valve cover doesnt allow a socket/ratchet/vicegrips/ANYTHING to slip over
the bolt-extractor.
These nuts are so rusty/rounded off that a regular socket just spins around
the nut.  I hope thats not too confusing.
I'd rather not use a torch on these guys since I've never really used one
before..so does anyone have any extra ideas?
I suppose I could drill them out, but I'm afraid of slipping and damaging
something.
Any suggestions would be much appreciated as this is somewhat holding me up
from going further.
Thanks much!
--Nick
