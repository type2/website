Soak the nuts with penetrating fluid and give it a shot of freeze spray. That will help to break the bond of rust between the nut and the stud. If you don't have any invert your average can of air (duster in a can) and the spray will come out cold.

Then use an impact driver on the nut:

If the nuts have gone soft with rust you often have to grind them off but in that part of the head there isn't enough clearance. You might be able to file the nuts from 13mm to 12mm or 12mm to 11mm in order to get the socket to bite into the harder metal beneath the rusty surface metal.

If the face of the nuts are still strong then you can heat up the nuts with a hand torch and apply a stick of wax that will wick itself into the threads.

A Bernzomatic tip and a bottle of MAPP gas are easily found at the hardware store.
