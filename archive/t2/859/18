Subject: Re: [T2] FI wiring harness source?

Paul asked:

 I'm thinking about getting FI to replace the PO installed Weber on my
 bus.  There's a nearly complete setup on theSamba, but there's no
 wiring harness.  As a FI noob, my understanding is limited.  I have
 seen that most of the system needs to be from the same vintage to work
 right.  That being said, where would I find a harness?  In looking at
 all the involved components, I imagine getting the right one is the
 trick.  I tried the usual suspects.  Any ideas?

Before you buy a harness, you need to put together the correct group of parts.
There are at least 4 different FI harness's.......  
75/early 76 [6 pin AFM and electric-vacuum egr valve]
mid 76-78 and Fed 79 without the microswitch on the throttle housing
mid 76-78 with the microswitch on the throttle housing
79 Calif
