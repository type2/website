I hear that can be a problem when the jacks get older.  Trying showing
them the Crafstman or Snap-On tool catalogs; maybe that will help them
stay up longer.

I called a couple of times and it was busy.  So, to make sure she knows
about it, I sent a registered letter.  I also recorded a voice message
on the computer, used double-rot13 encryption on it (so nobody can edit
the message), and sent it via an RFC-1149 wireles link to your house.

Let us know how you make out.
