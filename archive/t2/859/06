Subject: FI wiring harness source?

I'm thinking about getting FI to replace the PO installed Weber on my
bus.  There's a nearly complete setup on theSamba, but there's no
wiring harness.  As a FI noob, my understanding is limited.  I have
seen that most of the system needs to be from the same vintage to work
right.  That being said, where would I find a harness?  In looking at
all the involved components, I imagine getting the right one is the
trick.  I tried the usual suspects.  Any ideas?
TIA,

have to resolve if I go FI
