Subject: Re: [T2] Will a '72 tranny go into a late '74 Bus?

From: steelersbus

 I was reading on Ratwell's site about a tranny swap. I
 have a late '74 Bus. 215mm flywheel. The site says that I
 can install a '72 tranny into my late '74 Bus, but I would
 need to replace the flywheel with the 210mm.

 Is the flywheel the only thing that would need to match
 the '72 tranny? Or will I need to replace other parts as
 well? Also, if I do install this, when replacing the
 flywheel, does it need any adjustment? Or is it just
 tightened on?

The 210 and 215 flywheels are the same diameter.

Leave the 215 on your '74 engine!

The only time a flywheel problem comes up is when you use a 76-79 091 transaxle, then you have to use the 228
flywheel. [unless you swap the belhousing to the early one]
