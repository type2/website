Wow - they mention all those body mods are in necessity rather than for
looks. they definitely put some low "ground effects" on that bus (5") - not
quite sure if it constitutes as ground effects, more like body mod...but I
wish i had that engine! A 2.7 911 Turbo RSR engine!!! DAAAAAMN!!!

that site doesn't go into detail about the suspension mods - "...The
suspension was also lowered 3 inches and good gas shocks installed..." maybe
its just me, but it seems like they have the rest of the bus worked out with
engine, trans, body mods but are lacking on suspension....

I ordered myself a set of the konis ($ouchy$) and as far as Ive read -
BusZilla will handle like a dream....as anything over 95 gets really
scary....granted i have bigger tires, no lowering and a big riviera top to
help push me around in my lane, but maybe i will be one step ahead than this
bus, at least on suspension :)
