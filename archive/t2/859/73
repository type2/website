I talked to Pam at great length.  She refuses to believe anything I 
say.  She's convinced that you're out with your busexual buddies and 
she's pissed because you didn't clean out the barn (or garage or 
something  - I couldn't understand).  What did you say/do to piss her 
off like that?  I hope you get your bus (are you under Babcia or Urge?) 
fixed in time for EveryBus.
