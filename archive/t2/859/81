Subject: Re: [T2] Break In Schedule on a Rebuild?

I just looked up Muir.  He only says

 "...don't lug or hot rod- just nice, easy balance,,,"

Is it that simple?

I'll let you know how it turns
out. I was told just to keep it under 55 and to not let
the RPMs stay at one speed for a long distance.

Any one out there that has done this before?(A long
distance drive after a rebuild)
