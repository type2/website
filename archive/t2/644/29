Subject: 71 Westy Luggage Rack Bottom Bushings ?

Howdy

I remember long ago seeing information on NAPA bushings '650-1110' and 
'650-1113' and have searched the archives and found the information.

So I went to NAPAs online web store and tried the numbers with no luck.

Does anybody have any other suggestions?
Mine are pretty dried out and need replacing.

Thanks
Kevin
