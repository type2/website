Subject: Re: [T2] URGENT: drying the air-oil filter

It's not going to hurt anything to move your bus the 30 feet or so without 
and air filter.

Move it, let her get out and then finish drying the air cleaner.

Tank, if it is not too wet, it won't hurt to drive it like that...it will 
dry out quickly with all the air that will be passing thru it.

Probably make the engine run better for a few minutes too...<grin>.

Let it idle for a few minutes after you hook it back up, so it doesn't try 
and suck *all* of the moisture out at once...


Cheers, dave
