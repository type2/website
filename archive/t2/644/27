True.

BTW, I took some voltage readings (at the battery) last night with the
Optima installed.

Engine on, lights off: 14.36V
Engine on, lights on: 14.10V

Somewhat improved from my old battery and it would appear the internal
resistance of this AGM battery is so low at 0.0030 ohms the system voltage
has been boosted dramatically even with the lights on.

I'm using the 70A alternator and matching voltage regulator and the voltages
seem to be in the middle of the Optima charging specs:
