Dear Will:

I dodged that bullet last summer with fast action and a big box of
Baking Soda when a fuel hose let loose after a repair in the driveway. 
Yeah I'd say it's crispy critters for all of the wiring or FI
units near as I can tell without being there.  Whether its a house fire
(had one of those too) or a car fire I would err on the side of
replacing everything in there not metal.  That means hoses belts wires
electrical stuiff -- even if it looks good.

Other bus owners, our Busses have a lot of OLD gas lines in them.  Check
every inch and check often!

Will, I am sorry for your loss and wish you good luck with the repairs.

BEN
