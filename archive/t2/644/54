 My 75 has a preheater on top of the cross over pipe with a flex hose 
 connected to the air cleaner. This is all stock fuel injected stuff on the 
75. I don't know what you have for an ait cleaner on that weber carb but if 
 you could adapt the snorkle (?) off the stock air cleaner to whatever you 
 are using you would be half way there. The snorkle on my air cleaner has a 
 thermostat that lets in preheated air only below a certain temp. The stock 
 preheater is nothing more than a sheet metal tube or pipe aprox. 1 1/2" dia. 
 maybe 2 feet long and about 3 inches of each end bent in the same direction 
 at about a 45 deg angle.

 Now think about cutting the bottom third of the pipe off length wise, with a 
 band saw or hack saw. the whole afair is placed on top of the cross over 
 pipe and either tack welded or held on with hose clamps. A flex hose is 
 connected to one end of the preheater on the passenger side then passes 
 through the tin into the engine compartment to connect with the snorkle. If 
 your engine still has the original tin on it the hole for the flex hose 
 should be there already.
 
 I hope I explained this well enough to make sense. If not, let me know and 
 I'll try to take some pics on saturday.

That would be 'I' in this pic:

You also will need the 75-early 76 tin to match. 'G' and 'I' will have corresponding holes in them:

[these say 72-79 but that is not correct......]
