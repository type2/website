Subject: Re: Color question

My 80 V-gon is a color of orange that I9ve never seen on another bus or
wedge (it is original).  It is quite different from brilliant orange9 as I
found out.  The paint name is Ruesch orange9, not sure about spelling, but
ruesch is just german for orange (looked it up).  Anyhow, I noticed none of
the paint chip web sites have this color listed, and that kinda stinks
because I was looking for touch-up. My point is, if anyone is involved with
these paint code sites (ie T2 site), there9s one you missed. If anyone knows
where to get some I9d love to know!  Anyway its a cool color very early
809s, I dig it.  Later, Nik
