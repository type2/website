Subject: RE: [T2] Starting problem - Update

Eric says..
but still wont turn over all the way. On to checking the starter I
guess..

And I quip that I've been there and done that...put in two new starters
before I took the friendly and free advice of many a wiser man than I
and bought a new battery cable.  And with my trusty but neglected wire
brush cleaned up applicable areas and installed said new negative
battery cable.  Oh well, I got a new starter out of it. And I am sure
someone rebuilt what was perfectly good.

Living, learning and wondering,
Mike
