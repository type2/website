The factory's favorite or my favorite? 

Mine would be White top, Tornado Red below... Wait! Tha's what I've got. Lucky me... <grin!> 

My second favorite would be a white top and a blue bottom. Specific shades of blue of course. 

Mine originally was brown as part of the Cow Poop Edition... Not bad, but not good either. Not a fan of brown cars. A feature I can easily overlook of course....
