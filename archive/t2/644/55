Subject: Re: [T2] Adding Warm air to a Weber Progressive

I bought a Sprint air cleaner from Pierce Manifolds (can't remember
URL) last Fall/Winter that was a direct replacement for the standard
chrome cleaner. The "new" air cleaner has a snorkel on it that I routed
the pre-heat to. The pre-heat source on my '72 is on the RH side, but
the snorkel will only fit pointing to the right-rear. So, I got longer
air hose from the local FLAPS (GI Joes) and ran the hose along the
runners from the LH side to the RH side.
I found that drivability below 50F is possible now. When it drops below
40F its not good. Since this is only mediocre, I haven't invested
additional efforts into getting the warm:cold flap movement controlled.
I set it prior to starting the motor according to the weather: over
80F, no warm air. Below 50F no cold air. It aint pretty. Honestly, I
couldn't imagine trying to operate a Weber on a pancake motor in your
climate. Maybe get an airhose that's 3x as long and wrap it around the
runners? I guess that would extend the warmup time quite a bit. Buy a
pair of electric socks and wrap them around the runners? Engine fire
warning... I don't know. Good luck, and if you find a solution that
extends drivability down into the 30's let me know. Winter time's
a-comin', windows are filled with frost...
