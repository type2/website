Subject: Cutting brake/hand brake

I spoke with someone today who described a modification that a friend 
did to her bus.  She showed him how to use it one snowy day, and it 
came in handy for him.

The way he described it, there was a door cut in the floorboard.  
Whenever you got stuck in the mud or snow, you would reach down, open 
the door, and slowly pull up on the emergency brake cable until the 
wheel that was spinning slowed down, and the other wheel started to 
turn.  Obviously, you had to know which wheel was spinning, but 
presumably one could get one's self out of many a jam this way.  
Apparently this guy was able to.

I wish I had been able to do something like this when I was stuck in 
the mud on a hill and started sliding sideways, fearing that the damn 
thing would roll.

Anyone heard of this?  Anyone done it?  Would something like this work 
just using the hand brake itself?
