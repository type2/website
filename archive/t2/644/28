Hey, I was wondering about this part of your message too. I've taken
our new 73 Westie on some trial runs and found it rather gutless. At
first I was wondering if this was because it has a 1700 whereas our
faster feeling 72 bus has a 2 liter.

But seeing you are experiencing power from a 1700, I wonder how much
more power we would experience by changing carbs. I figure part of the
sluggishness is the weight of the camper gear in the westy compared to
our empty bus.
