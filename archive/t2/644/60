Subject: Re: [T2] Adding Warm air to a Weber Progressive

Hi Tony,

That sounds like a good idea. Mine is balky at first, and doesn't
start running good until I get to work. Then just absorbing engine
compartment heat does the trick so that by lunch time it runs good.
When I first put it together, I had trouble with the choke linkage
being stiff, but now it seems to have loosened up and is running much
better when cold. We'll see how it does when it starts getting real
cold if I get it together by then.

 linkage pulling the throttle open...The heat from the case seems to
 be enough to prevent the carb from icing...I've got a cheesy chrome
 air cleaner but the crankcase breather tube feeds into it adding a
 bit more warmth...
