The page 11 scan you referenced below is for the initial new owner oil
change. I had trouble with mac.com letting me get to your other pages,
and I don't see this manual on your homepage, so in an old fashioned
kind of way (;-) I grabbed a 75 manual sitting here by my desk and
found on page D-2 that VW is calling for routine oil changes at 5K. My
7500 number, does however jive nicely with the 8K number you
referenced in the study.
