Subject: Tenth Annual Mid-Atlantic Holiday Bus Fest !  December 4, 2004

10 years of inviting all you fine folks to our home! 

In celebration of the first decade of this event, we
will have special doorprizes and, of course, the world
famous splittie cookies. All you need to do is bring
yourself, your band of merry travellers, and your
bus(or a photograph thereof).

This is a family event in beautiful downtown Takoma
Park MD, inside the Washington DC beltway. Kids, dogs,
significant others are welcome and they will find
there is much more to do than just talk VWs. If your
other is significantly bored, there is a wonderful
selection of shops just a block from the house, happy
to sell holiday wares.

Photos of many of the past events are at Tom
Carrington's site, http://volksweb.relitech.com .

Long distance travellers are welcome to camp in the
driveway, but spaces are limited so reserve yours now!


NB: We are always happy to help bus owners get
together to find that elusive part they need, but hti
sis not a commercail event. If you want to bring
something down that might be of interest to others,
fine, however this event is in the middle of a
residential neighborhood: keep it subtle and don't
plan to set up any tables on the sidewalk! 

Hope to see you in a month,

Michele Moriarty and Tom Forhan
