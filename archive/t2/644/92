Subject: Installing a BN2 heater in a Westy

I've pondered this for some time, and I think I have it figured out.

A BN2 (made to go in the trunk of a VW sedan) can be installed in the 
back closet of an early bay Westy.

The charcoal canister in the engine compartment would have to be 
relocated, but the exhaust from the heater can be routed  down through 
the engine compartment (and around the battery) to the outside.

The fuel supply line can tee at the gas tank outlet (and the fuel pump 
located outside) and then brought into the cabin right by the fender.

The fuel return line can be routed to go into the fuel filler neck 
where it goes through the back closet.

  The warm air duct can be routed into the front closet, down along the 
fender, and then out underneath the closet door.  The switch can be 
located next to the warm air register.

Is this do-able?  My stock heater works fine, but during the winter 
months is woefully inadequate for anything other than the cab.

What is the part number(s) for the glow plug(s) that will fit and where 
can I get one?
