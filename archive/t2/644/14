I'd be pulling in Indiana/Ohio/Michigan area...pretty similar terrain.

This could be tricky...I'm largely limited to shopping via internet for a 
vintage 1970s Airstream

Yep

True, but it's either tow with the Bus or my wife's Newer Chrysler Van 
(Makes me shiver) and I'm definately pulled to the thought that it would be 
fun to pull a '70s RV with a '70 Bus.

Has anyone out there experience with towing a small RV with a Bay Window 
Bus?
