About two years ago Napa changed the partnumbers on their air filters.  It
may be possible that the old part number that you have could have been
renamed to a different part number if they renamed more than just their
filters.  Give them a call at a local shop, they might still have some
conversion info on your part number available there.  Worth a shot.
