Calif has nothing to do with it!

Having the harness and sensor tells me you have a 76 built before the end of 12/75 
[up to chassis # 2x62077583]

After 077584, VW put the intake air temp sensor in the AFM. [7 pins] 

That is why your AFM has 6 pins and is part number 0 280 200 012.

You do not want to disconnect the throttle valve switch under the throttle housing. 
It controls your full throttle contact and electric EGR valve.
