Subject: light switch short

 my light switch started smokin the other day, I got it disconnected fairly quick but the switch wouldn't pull any more so I bought a new switch. The new switch has the terminals laid out differently than the old one. Both switches have a post at either end and both switches have four other posts which could be observed as two groups of two. I did my best and made a guess as to where to connect them then re-attached my battery cables. My parking lights come on but not my headlights. I tried moving the connections around a bit to see if I could get the headlights but I can't seem to. At one point I reversed the end wires and got a bit of smoke so I disconnected quicklike and put those back correct. My fuses all look fine. At the end of all this I tried to start it up to see if running or not makes any differance and it won't crank at all, not even the tiniest, but my parking lights say there's still juice. What's up???? Any clues.
