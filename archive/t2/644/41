Subject: Synthetic Oil: done to death?

This has been done to death, I am sure. Please point me to the 
Collective Wisdom.

The question is, do we like or not like synthetic motor oil in our 
aircooled upright engines? Gets pretty hot in SoCal pushing a 
Transporter down the Interstate and my oil sump temps are pushing 230F 
-- where dino oil is ready to exhibit thermal breakdown. Synth oil is 
reputed to stand off higher temps -- yes/no?

Oh -- for some odd reason, I can post NEW threads to the type2 list, but 
my REPLIES to existing threads are not getting posted.
