Subject: URGENT: drying the air-oil filter

My timing is for crap. I cleaned out my filter the other day agao and set it
in the sun to dry ... and last night it rained. The problem is that my
housemate, who has had her <expletive deleted> truck in my garage for the
last year and a half has *finally* heeded the call to fix it and remove it
from the property. Her plan is to drive it to Sacramento today. And my
camper is currently in the driveway, with an unattached, damp air-oil
filter -- blocking her in the garage.

I have the filter hooked up to a hair dryer as I speak (which, btw, smells
real nasty). How long is this going to take? What are the risks of not
drying it thoroughly and hooking it up long enough to move it from my
driveway to the curb across the street? I need to get my butt to work
shortly, so I am a bit panicked.

Many Thanks!
