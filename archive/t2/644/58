Subject: Re: [T2] Adding Warm air to a Weber Progressive

Walter at bus boys suggested an electric manifold warmer. He says they
use these in Canada. I don't know if he sells one or can order one. I
may be checking back with him now that winter is coming, but my bus
with the weber is down now anyway.
