Yellow is on the no-no list with my wife... Non-favorite... Tough isn't it??? However, it works in our bathroom...

I personally really like the dark mustard yellows I see on cars from time to time. I had an acquaintance in VA that had a nice yellow Beetle. Is Yosemite yellow a butter yellow or an orange-y yellow?
