Subject: need oval port 2L head in Portland Oregon/Washington area

Hey everybody. The trip to the shop for Ezmerelda has
been wierd. Turnds out my bus is a 2L not a 1.8 (the
fan housing number doesnt match the engine number.) so
the 1.8 head that I have wont fit (duh) I had four 2L
heads, but three of them turned out to be shot. so
Ineed one rebuildable 2L head (although Ill buy a
matched set id anyone has them.) Particularly if they
are in my area. It needs to have oval exhaust ports.

Anyone who can ehelp me out drop me an email.
