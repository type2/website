That's where they belong. Suck those fumes down their little throats :-)

         During the install of the carbs, namely the taking all the 34pdsit
 gear out, I started wondering about my oil breather hose and my
 charcoal box hose ...
 
         In keeping with the original setup I tapped a hole in the filter on
 each carb and threaded in a metal tube to which I connected each of
 these hoses so they are venting/breathing into the air filter of the
 carbs. This seems to make sense to me, but its been on my mind for a
 few days now and I figured I would ask those of you who have gone down
 this road before, what did you do with these hoses ?
 
 thoughts ?
