Subject: distributor vacuum can fyi

Folks,

I thought I needed a new vacum can on my stock 78 bus distributor.

I went back thru the archives and found that someone had ordered
one from Autozone....so I tried it.

I had to wait 10days to get it, but it is a match.  The only difference 
was that it had 4 mounting holes rather than just two.

It cost a whole $15.36...could have gotten it faster, but didn't want to 
pay the "special order" shipping charges.

"Wells" part number RV1001...made by Bosch in Germany....the arm sticking 
out of it was stamped the same as the original except probably a manf 
date.

The important part was the 110? or 101 stamped close to the can which 
believe indicates the stroke.


Just a confirmation ofthe original post...whoever it was, Thanks!!!

Cheers, dave
