OK that was a bit vaugue. You also need to disable the ignition
(spark). I'm really not sure what the best way to is, but you can
remove the power to the coil/ remove the rotor button/ remove the
primary coil wire and ground. any of these ways should provide a way
to keep the spark from igniting any gases.
