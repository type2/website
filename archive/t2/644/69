Subject: Re: [T2] Pulling a Vintage RV with a Bus

<A Type 4 engined bus *can* pull a trailer with a bus on it, and
still reach the German legal top speed for trailers (50 mph).  BTDT.
I wouldn't recommend that weight and size of trailer for regular 
use, though.  But anything that doesn't much exceed a metric tonne
should be fine.>

I have pulled Beetles and trailers with loads (small) of stone. I have also pulled a trailer with a 600 lbs motorcycle prob putting the load to nearly 1K lbs. 

It can be done but consider what the untaxed bus is like on the interstate and then subtract from that performance the penalty of the trailer. Your home area may different from mine, and your expectations may be different from mine and thus the reason I recommended borrowing a small utility trailer and loading it something approaching the camper trailer weight and then some more to represent a trip's toys. 

Try it. 

My bus is dandy on local speeds pulling 1500 lbs. It does pretty good on 55 mph highways because the traffic isn't running much faster than 60. However on the interstate it struggled at 65 mph (being nearly it's top speed) and the traffic was running 75-80 mph. Add to that a trailer and then a hill, and for me it was white knuckle time. 

It's up to you if you think it's white knuckle time... 

I would consider it on the side roads and rural highways but not the interstate without some creative reflectors on the rear of the trailer, good lighting, maybe a slow vehicle sign, and electric brakes. 

This is exactly why i wanted Corvair power. Power to keep up, and run 70 mph. I usually think the speed limit is almost the safest slow speed I can run on the highway... <grin!>
