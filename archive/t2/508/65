Subject: More info on Subaru bus on eBay

I just received another email where the seller says that the bus drives
great.  She also stated "and the volkswagen shop said it was an option it is
alot like the subaru brat motor they said"  I'm sure that this VW shop loves
the type of owners that don't know anything about their cars.
