I don't think that they are that rare, they're just expensive :D

I've got the dimensions here (thanks again Karl):

I took some pics of my camping stool, but never posted them. You just gave me a
reason to. Click on Camping Stool:

Ron Wolff makes a nice reproduction that gowesty sells.

I searched for awhile looking for a stool for my 79 Deluxe Westy. I eventually
found one after months of surfing the online vw classifeds and emailing
everyone that was parting out a westy. I lucked out and bought mine for $50 and
it had the correct mexico beige plaid (no yellow trash can).

I've seen 'em from time to time at the vw shows (one guy had 3 of 'em forsale),
so I really don't think that they're that rare. I would say that they are
highly desirable tho'.
