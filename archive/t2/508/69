I'm with you on that one, I have a good example of a mismatched aftermarket
cam with stock VW lifters in my glove box, within 100 miles of brake-in one
of the lifters was eaten up and missing over 6mm off the bottom of the
lifter due to difference in metals! 
If using Stock, stick with stock, if you decide to use aftermarket, get both
cam and lifters from the same vender.
