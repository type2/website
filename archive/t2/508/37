Dave,

In my experience, the good ball joints now available have a plastic socket,
which doesn't need lubrication the way all steel ball joints do. What I mean
is if you look inside the joint itself, the ball part of the joint rides in
a socket which is made of very hard plastic, like delrin or similar. These
joints are also pre-lubed and sealed so they should last a long while, say
60k miles. These are the joints made in Italy or the lemforder ones from
Germany.

The Taiwanese ball joints seem to have steel riding on steel. These are also
prelubed and sealed, but they would not last as long, imo. I think it would
be possible to put a zerk in either type, by drilling a hole in the center
of the joint, opposite the stem that sticks out, but I am not sure how
effective it would be in increasing the life of the part.
