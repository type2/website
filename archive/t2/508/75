Subject: Advice Please

To the list I need some help here.  I'm thinking about pick up a Syncro. It has had a 3.4 Trans Am engine put in it.  The kit came from Kennedy Engineering Products.  Trans has been beefed up as well & Porsche cv joints. It's is 87 certified by the state of Cal. 
Any advice would be helpful.

Thank you,
