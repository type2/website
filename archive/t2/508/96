Subject: Polarity reversal on 68 Bus.. (oops)

Hi all, Im a newby with VW's.
Here is my problem.  I have read through a number of posts with people 
describing an issue where the red and black battery cables are sometimes 
reversed. Not necessarily indicating a positive ground, but indicating that 
the original cables were frail and not colored.
Here we go..
I picked up the bus at a friend's house, and put a new battery in it.  It 
was at night, and I was impatient and didnt notice that the red cable went 
to (chassis) ground and black to positive. I naturally hooked it up the way 
that looked obvious and ended up with battery pos term to ground, and 
battery neg term  to hot.
THe weird thing is, I didnt notice any problems until today when I went to 
hook up a stereo.
Pop... bam.. boom.. fuses blow on the stereo.
Everything else still works.. it runs fine, all the lights work. it starts.
This one has me perplexed.  Currently I obviously get negative voltage at 
thefuse block. So I am wondering, is it safe to simply 'reverse' the battery 
cables back to where they should be after running it for afew days in 
reverse polarity?  Does anyone know why this would even  run when hooked up 
backwards let alone not explode into a ball of sinder?  Last time I did 
something this boneheaded I nearly blew my jeep up. :)
thanks.
jason
