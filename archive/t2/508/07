Subject: Re: [T2] Any experience or thoughts with the CB filter?  

The filter in that ad looks very much like a Honda motorcycle filter, the
one the 750 and Goldwings use. I've changed lots of them, I'm sure lots of
you have too. That would be nice if it was the same filter. If anyone could
find out, I might want one if I can get cheap Honda filters locally. $10US,
too much.

I wonder if that housing hanging down there would be vulnerable to getting
bashed off when thumping around campsites and off road?
