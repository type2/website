Subject: greaseless ball joints?

After the posts on various forms of lubrication, can someone 
explain to me why ball joints no longer seem to need grease?

In other words, ball joints with no place to put a zerk fitting
or a rubber cover to pull of and squirt grease in.

Do they now last forever?...yeah, right...

Mandatory bus content...time to think about making the front end on my bus
more "new" than it is.

Cheers, dave
