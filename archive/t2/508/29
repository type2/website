Subject: Tell me what you think of this bus....

> Hey, I'm thinking of buying this bus on ebay.

Well in my experience it's a lot of work to get vehicles registered with
sketchy paperwork.  But, if you live nearby, have some free time and place to
store it, then it could be a good project.

I imagine most people will stay away from this bus just because of the title
issue.  But don't fret, I'm sure with some legwork you can one day get it on
the road.

I suggest keeping an eye on the price, and jump on it if it's within your
budget.  Just keep in mind you can get good, running licensed buses for $2000
or less, providing you do a bit of shopping around.

Also there is no pop-top and that usually keeps the price a lot lower.

Good luck,
Shawn.
