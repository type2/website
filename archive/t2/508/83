Subject: Vanco Tires

Hello, I contacted Continental about these tires and got the 'official' 
response below.  The person who gave this response called me and said 
that he will be posting to this list soon with additional information, 
and will answer questions, about sizes and pressures for the different 
years and van/camper/syncro issues.

    The Vanco 8 is a direct replacement for its predecessor, the Contrans.

    In Europe, these types of tires are used on light utility vehicles. 
  However, most of the tires coming into the US are arriving on 
chassiss, that are converted into Recreational Vehicles, which is why 
this tire shows up on Contis web site in the Motorhome area.

   Reinforced refers to the size / load index combination.  Vanco 8s 
are 8 Ply Rating, which has a higher load capacity than Reinforced, 
and can be used in place of Reinforced tires in a given size.
