YES.  Grease of some variety.  Most of these shipped with some version of
white lithium grease on the cables and gear, but you're better off using a
more modern grease.  Feel free to use your favorite moly grease..it will
be just fine (and won't gum up as bad as the lithium over years)

Be generous, grease every moving part (lifter mechanisms included!).
Wipe off your excess though, obviously.
