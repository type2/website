Subject: RE: [T2] Re: type of engine is this?

Just got another email from the seller of this bus and he says "talked to
the local vw repair shop and they said it is a 21cc liquid cooled engine
that was a option upgrade for that van so it would have more power".  Must
have been some kind of option back in 1978.  He lives in Oklahoma, so maybe
they had some different options out there.  I guess that someone who doesn't
know what they have would be the worst kind of dreaded PO.
