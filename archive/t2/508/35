Jammy,

Call the local glass guys...They can get you one *and* install it with one 
of their seals....that way, if they break it, it's not your fault...and 
since they use their seal, it's supposed to be "watertight".

The ones that I called here in Arkansas were reasonable.

Don't call the big franchise places, but the true "local" guys.
On the other hand...might as well check the big places too!

Cheers, dave
