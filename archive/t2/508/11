Neat idea Jay! The only thing I might add would be some blue locktite on the
threads to keep them from working loose under vibration - in case it works
loose in spite of the rubber washers. Just some extra insurance.

| In an effort to make my '72 a little bit safer I went to the plumbing
| section at my local hardware store and came up with this setup:

nice
| smooth pass-thru for the fuel line and is most likely a bit more on the
| heavy duty side than lamp hardware.  Total cost was about $5.00.  Not a
bad
| price for one less thing to worry about...
