Subject: Heat Extractor - Eliminators

Hey guys,

    I have a 1973 Volkswagen Type-2 Transporter with an 1800cc motor and hydraulic lifters. I am planning on replacing my exhaust system (currently a dual exhaust pace setter) with a factory looking exhaust system (probably from Bus Depot). 

I live in South Florida (just 20 minutes north of Miami) and will probably never take this Bus up north on vacation. With that said, I will never REALLY need a heater in the Bus. It will never get cold enough. 

Does anyone know of a GOOD set of eliminators that I can install on my Bus's engine that I can use to eliminate the heat extractors? It seems to me almost pointless to have them on my Bus. I am missing everything that has to do with heating, except the extractors (that's the way I got it), so I'd rather just replace them with good exhaust pieces.


Thanks!!
