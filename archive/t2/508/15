Subject: Re: [T2] sliding metal sunroofs to fit 1968-1972 VW    

The cable is essentially a really long coiled wire. It gets pulled or pushed
through the cog gears of the handle at the front of the bus. This system, in
my opinion, is under a lot of load.

I lightly grease my cables once a year and it helps my roof to open and
close smoothly without putting undo strain on the cables.

In my case it helps and I have a fully functioning sunroof that I am able to
enjoy.

The cables in my van have been there since 1995 and they function like new,
and I am always looking for spares too.

FWIW, some cables don't have the felt intertwined (my two spares don't) and
makes me think that they would require some sort of lubricant to function
properly.
