      Please read

  Volkswagen Syncro 1987   
  Syncro  3.4 liter Trans Am engine(1995), Conversion certified by California.  


 The transaxle was rebuilt by a Syncro specialist and he said that it has been reinforced to be strong enough for the engine. The kit used to mount the engine is by Kennedy Engineering Products. The power going to the rear wheels comes via Porsche cv joints.

Thank you,
