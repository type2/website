The French company 'Serial-Kombi' sells the mechanisms
new. I don't know if it is repro or N.O.S. Anyway: it
isn't cheap!

They have an internetsite in French (the 'English'
link doesn't seem to work):

  http://www.serial-kombi.com/
  --> Bay Window 1968-1979
  --> Toits, ciels de toit, galerie

these items are the cables left and right, each one is
EUR 175,-!!:

  --> Cable gauche de toit coulissant 1968-79
  --> Cable droit de toit coulissant 1968-79


yours,

Vincent
