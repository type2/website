Subject: tranny whine

hi all - last week i got around to replacing the shift rod coupler.
shifting improved, but now i have a new issue. ain't that the way it is? on
the test drive i found i have a whine sound that happens in 4th gear at 50
mph. the sound is like a jet plane taking off, or really loud snow tires.
when i back off the accelerator the sound instantaneously disappears, but
reappears at 50mph. clutch is on, tranny has 120K miles on it - 75 FI 1800.
anybody have advice on what that sound might be? 'fraid to drive it now. -
steve
