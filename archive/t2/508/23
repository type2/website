Subject: top ten reasons bay windows rule

The top ten reasons Bay Windows rule:

#10 Sliding is for doors, not windows...
#9 Bay pilots don't have to look twice out the windshield...
# 8 Bay pilots love the IRS...
#7 Most Bay pilots can take small children on Big Wheels...
#6 You can put Mercedes rims on a later Bay Window and impress Bus-groupies
that you have a rare Euro-only Benzwagen...
#5 Bay pilots only need thermal underwear to stay warm inside; not a snow
suit...
#4 Many Bay Windows have headrests to cope with that neck wrenching "0-60 in
less than 4 minutes" acceleration...
#3 P(op-top) Envy - I mean the whole d*mn roof pops up on a Bay Westy...
#2 Factory air scoops on Bay Window air intakes...
#1 (hold your breath) Bay pilots have a REAL place to put their gloves...
