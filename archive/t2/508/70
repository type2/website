On second look, I might see a cap on the radiator. From the photo, its
hard to tell if there are cooling fans or not.

One interesting thing is the lip at the front bumper. That's definitely
not stock either.

One has to wonder... If they took the time to fabricate what appears to
be a well done lip, they may have taken the time to do a quality engine
transplant.

Anybody know what the HP is on the Subaru 2.2?
