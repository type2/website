Subject: RE: [T2] Any experience or thoughts with the CB filter?  

I'd be really curious to have someone do a test to see if there is any
loss in oil pressure. As a general rule one does not want to put any
device that can restrict flow at the inlet to a pump.

I did a little surfing and found a gear driven oil pump:
http://www.suntec.fr/images/document/docgenerale/PDFanglais/A2Lgb.pdf

It states that the maximum suction height is 0.45 bar ( 6.5 psi) This is
the maximum vacuum that can be allowed at the pump inlet to prevent air
separation ( cavitation ) in the oil. If we make the assumption that 6.5
psi is the max suction that our oil pumps should be subjected to, then
the maxi oil filter's relief valve must open below this amount. The
question is what is the bypass valve setting and how much oil goes
through the filter and how much oil gets bypassed? How much flow can one
get through the filter at 1 psi...2psi...3psi ? How much of that oil
gets bypassed?

On traditional filters where the filter is on the pressure side of the
pump, I've heard of bypass valve settings ranging from 5 to 30 psi.
Somebody please correct me if I'm wrong.

I'm not saying that this filter is a bad thing. I think that as long as
it didn't restrict oil flow, that it is at least better than a simple
strainer.
And it's a simple bolt on application.

Personally I think its better to have the filter on the pressure side of
the pump, but that typically involves drilling and tapping the block. (
although I did hear some talk of a bolt on oil pump with filtration, is
this true?)
