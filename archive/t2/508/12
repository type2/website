I got a new set of cables for my sunroof from
wolfsburg, and feel lucky to get em. they only had ONE
right one left and several lefts......I have a
questions about those......they are felt like cables
wrapped in a think wire for the crank to move the
slide.......should you use any type of lubricant for
these or it that what the felt stuff is for?
