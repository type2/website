The lugnut info is in the web site library at either

www.vanagon.com

or

www.type2.com

The tech articles or library is where you need to go.

That will explain the lugnut requirements.

If you call (I gave up after mentioning VW and Transporter/Westfalia) tell 
them you need a 15"x6" steel wheel for a Mercedes with an offset closest to 
whatever the factory VW offset is (find this out first I THINK it is 35 mm 
but I would verify this first!).

Never mention VW or Transporter...

They only offer I think a 15"x6.5" wheel, or maybe a 15"x7" wheel for a 
Mercedes.

Tell them you are doing a Mercedes project and resurrecting an old one and 
using custom wheel sizes or something.

Late sixties Mercedes model with a fire breathing engine or something...
