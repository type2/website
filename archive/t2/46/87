Seems to me like Hoover covered this at some point, but then again he 
covered so much that I could be mistaken. I don't have the CD handy at 
the moment, but search of the archives brought up these, most of which 
deal with prevention or thinking about a halon type system:

I expect the CD would contain the remainder of the useful information. If 
anybody has it and can run a search, feel free to pass on the results...
