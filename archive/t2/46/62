Subject: RE:  emergency near Modesto, CA

Thanks to all who replied to my message!!!  Collin decided to go to the
Volkswagen dealer in Modesto.  I think this is the best decision in his
case.  He is on the way to the east coast and in case something goes wrong
with the repair the Volkswagen warranty is good at any dealer in the
country.

Cheers,
Peter
