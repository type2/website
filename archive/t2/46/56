My own observations indicate that they are.  From years of driving the
freeways in LA, it seems that aircooled VWs are very "overrepresented" in
engine fires than other cars.

Of course, aircooled VWs have been around a lot longer than other cars,
which leads to aged fuel lines and creative backyard engineering.  For
example, somewhere along the line the PO's mechanic seemed to think that
it was OK to run the fuel line between the firewall tin and the firewall
rather than through the correct hole.  Sheesh!

The other strike against VWs is the fact that the fuel system is gravity
feed if a fuel line is opened.  VWs have the tank outlet in the bottom of
the tank, and the tank is carried high in the vehicle.  Most other cars
carry the gas low and suck the gas out of the top of the tank.  Puncture a
fuel line in this sort of vehicle and air will be sucked into the system
until the engine dies of fuel starvation.  Our VWs suffer from the simpler
1930s-era fuel system design, so they demand greater maintainance
efforts.

I'm also not pleased with the durability of German rubber.  It just does
not seem to last as long as American hose.
