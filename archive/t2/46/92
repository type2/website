Glad you didn't go against me too hard.
I had an engine fire, every little damage, caused by neglect.
I smelled fuel and did nothing about it.
I put the fire out with a standard extinguisher and I swear it did more
damage than the fire, yellow stinky powder all over the place.
If your engine compartment is sealed good a small Co2 bottle would be
sufficient to remove all of the oxygen but the compartment needs to stay
sealed for several minutes so you avoid re-flash after your fire is out.
