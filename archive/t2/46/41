Isaiah certainly has a turn of phrase. It actually is far cheaper the $400
if you hit an online marine supply. I remember seeing these systems for
under $100 before they outlawed Halon. I found this marine supply at
random.

manual "halotron" halon replacement 5lb extinguisher $129

automatic extinguisher system $189 for 75cu ft, discharges at 175 degrees,
indicator light showing operation, manual discharge option

this is almost the same but uses a less toxic extinguishing agent and only
covers 50 cu ft for $199

Maybe there's an opportunity to do a group buy for bussers in regions. This
is shipped as "Hazardous material" so I would expect pretty substantial
shipping fees and delays, given the current situation. It certainly would
be cool to arrange one for the Northeast for distribution at VW shows next
summer.
