With all this thread going on relative to FIRE, I am wondering if my 
question, as follows, actually made it to the post for the list to read, so 
I ask again.............

For reference:
Bus: 1970 Westy
Item: Original fuel Pump
Detail of Item: Bentley Book Section 3 on Fuel System, Page 9, Drawing 
Figure 4-3, Item 4 - "Cover Seal"
also, A picture of my bus engine (-at-)

showing the fuel pump and  the bolt on top that you loosen to gain filter 
access.

Does anybody out there know a source for this cover seal gasket ??

Thanks,
Bob Perring
