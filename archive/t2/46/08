Let's see a hose popping off it's connection, yes clamp the fuel lines but it
can still happen and Electrical fires happen too.  There may be the chance
that you can catch the fire early enough to put it out yourself.  Which is all
I want to do.  If you have to call the fire dept, odds are the fire has been
burning for a while and by that time I agree the engine lid would be too hot
to open.  But when it first starts, you may have a chance and a chance is
better than nothing.

For me an unlocked engine compartment door when driving.
