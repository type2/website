Subject: ignition worries continue

replacement ignition switch got me going for a few days. at least now i get
a click, and the idiot lights dim. tests for the solenoid and starter are
positive. guess i'm ready for the the addition of a relay, except i am also
getting a little, faint smoke rising from the ignition wires at the
steering wheel AND the red wire to the solenoid is very warm. anybody have
any advice? push starting the 68,  - steve
