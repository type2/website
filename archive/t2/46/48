The EGR valve leaks internally, you have to to remove the valve and block 
the exhaust flow either entering it from the tube that runs to the exhaust 
manifolds or block the gasses that leave the EGR valve.

I removed mine and made a nice block off plate.

The same could be done to a CA vehicle and you could not visually see the 
difference (bet the testing equipment would).

I could not find a source for the valve and did not try to repair it.
