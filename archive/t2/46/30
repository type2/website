I am assuming your friend has a 75 and up bus? [cause the 71 in your sig never
had a catalytic converter on it]
Originally, the 'fillpipe restricter' was molded into the filler neck. That
style is no longer available......then again neither is leaded fuel in the US at
gas stations. If he has a metal insert, someone may have had to install it to
pass the visual part of a smog check. Most are not removable without destroying
the rubber neck, they tried to make them tamper-proof.
