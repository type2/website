Hello Kurt

If I'm not mistaken this is another One year only part for our 72 busses, I
believe 71 had a different setup and 73 went to a new model.

I believe you can use a 71 you just have to wire it a bit different, not
sure how though since I've not done it.

I still want to make a list of all the one year only parts for a 72, also
all of the last year changes and first year changes, I believe it has to be
more than any other model, of course this is probably a Friday subject!

Good luck!

Meredith
