Subject: 74 Camper FS:

Hello list,

    I have a 1974 Camper for sale, I thought I would let list members have
first shot at it before I list it on E-bay. Fresh engine, runs great, almost
new tires, drive anywhere.
    I will be glad to send pictures and further information off list on
request. Bus is located in Southwest Louisiana.      volksfix(-at-)bellsouth.net
