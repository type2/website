There is no guarantee that such a system will work when fire time comes
along.  IMHO, the money would be better spent in getting the fuel system
and wiring in top shape, as it is much better not to have a fire at all
than it is to put one out.

One difficulty posed by the VW design is that the engine bay is actually
split into separate upper and lower compartments by the engine tin.  The
separation isn't complete, but it is enough to make it very tough for any
fire surpression system to do its job.

A typical VW fire is caused by the metal line that passes through the
front tin being sawed in half by the tin after the rubber grommet fails.
this produces a leak that spills fuel on both sides of the firewall.  The
fire starts when the fuel hits the exhaust pipe forward of the firewall,
but immediately goes through the firewall into the engine bay.  the leak
will feed the fire on both sides, as the tank is above the leak.

An extinguishing system in the engine bay will put that part of the fire
out, but it will continue on the forward side of the firewall.  When the
retardant dissipates, the fire will re-ignite in the engine bay.  A good
automatic system for a VW would have to be plumbed to flood both areas
with retardant, adding weight and complexity.
