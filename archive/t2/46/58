Subject: Engine dies when I  try to shift into reverse...Please help me

Hey guys,
  I just recently had the engine rebuilt (1800 carburated) in my westy a few 
weeks back. I have just finished putting the engine in and I have come 
across a problem. When ever I try to put it in reverse the engine cuts out. 
It does not jerk forward when it cuts out either, the engine just cuts out. 
The wierd thing is that all the forward gears work fine but it will not let 
me put it in reverse. I realize that you must push the stick down as you put 
it into reverse. I do this but still the engine dies on me. If I pull the 
stick down the engine cuts out but if push the stick back up quick the 
engine will kick back on. I hope that it is something that I am not doing 
right. But I dont have any clue what it could be, I am driving it to 
Vancouver in a month or so, so I need to get it roadworthy. If anyone knows 
why this is happening please let me know...Thanks,
                   Travis
