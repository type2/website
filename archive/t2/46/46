I took a look at the Kidde FyreWatch extinguisher
listed bellow.  They look fantastic for our
application, only one thing concerns me.  These auto
units go off at 175 degrees.  Anyone know how hot our
engine compartments get (without there being a fire in
them)?  Hate to be headed west out of Denver in August
and have the thing go off.
