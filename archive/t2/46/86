NOT!

not always, my wifes' 1974 412 wagen caught fire due to a malfunctioning
cold start valve in 1977, only 3 years old and less than 40,000miles on
it!  I had maintained it to spec.  fortunately I was driving it at the
time not her, and the always present fire ext took care of it before it
became a major problem.....BUT it is NOT ALWAYS neglect.

besides, I was a boy scout,  Be Prepared....!
