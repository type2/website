You should also touch bases prior to all that to see if they even have it on 
their system as happened with mine since they purge inactive records after a 
period of time.  I had to get a form from the DMV and have a police officer 
come by, verify the information on the vehicle and sign the form.  This 
enabled the DMV to put the vehicle back on their system.  Course... then you 
have the insurance paperwork etc..
