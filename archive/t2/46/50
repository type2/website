Subject: Bus in the news

There was (unfortunately) a bus on the news here in San Diego last 
night.  Looked like a very early bay, but the newscaster referred to 
it as a microbus.  It was parked in an underground parking garage at 
an apartment house, and had an engine fire.  Apparently did some 
damage to the apartment building, too.  Bummer.  They said the owner 
had the bus for 30 years!  Time to check our fuel lines?
