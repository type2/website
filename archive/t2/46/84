I would stipulate that to a certain extent this is Darwinian in nature. 
The folks who neglected their vehicles lost them to fire; the remaining 
ones, as they become a rarer breed, are continuing to be purchased by 
enthusiasts with a higher level of knowledge and bigger 
investment-emotionally if not economically. People who will fix fuel 
lines, or deal with reputable mechanics and shops who will do so.

Always sound advice. My extinguisher has yet to be used on my bus, but it 
helped save a Chevy SUV some years back...  ;-)
