Could be your non-retractable seatbelt hanging out the door and flapping in the 
wind.  Hey, don't laugh.  That one has scared the crap out of me more than once 
on a dark, lonely stretch of road...

On a more constructive note, definitely check your lug nuts!!  How do your 
brakes feel?  Sometimes old brake pads separate and the loose bit of pad could 
be banging around.
