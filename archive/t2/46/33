Isaiah:
I think it's the engineering!
I think air-cooled and fuel injection was the magic combination. Over the years, I've caught a few cars on fire, fixed a whole lot more of other peoples's fires.
I think early 914 Porsches and 411 Volkswagens were probably the kings of burning up.
The really bad part of an early (pre-Vanagon) bus is that once on fire ALL the gas runs out of the tank and adds considerably to the fire.
The 80 Vanagon westy that I'm now driving was a fire victim. It's driver was backing out of his driveway on an early morning commute when it coughed and died. He eventually realized it was on fire about the same time the garbage truck driver got there with the fire extinguisher. A quick shot into the door behind the license plate and the fire was out.
When I fixed it, I put on some new hoses, distributor, FI wire harness. NOTHING ELSE, not even the AFM or air cleaner!
The cause? It musta been a fuel hose leak, that was 10 years ago.
In addition, I've owned a burnt 75 bus, burnt 76 bus and a burnt 74 Porsche 911.
The 75 had a brand new factory engine, got all the paperwork, but had all the original fuel line clamps except 3 worm gear clamps. Burnt to a crisp, but I found the clamps! I told the previous owner he should SUE the dealer for ineptness. That baby was TOAST. Totally parted it out.
