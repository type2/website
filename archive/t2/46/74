Subject: Slight Back Fire/Another Dizzy Question

I rebuilt a Bosch 205A for my 72 bus out of two I had, new points gaped at
.016, cap and rotor, used a condenser that was on one because I could not
find one to match up locally, I have a 32/36 DFAV and installed the advance
vacume "front of can" to a vacume port on the rear "facing me" of the carb,
for the retard side I teed off the carb manifold that supply's the Vacume
Brake Assist, installed and static timed it and went to fire it up, Ye Ha it
started right up, then I timed it to 7.5 BTDC and 32 Advance ATDC, however
when I slowly give it gas I get a slight hesitation and some slight back
fire, but once it revs up it seams to run fine as I check my advance timing,
I'm sorta afraid to take it on the road while it is doing this for a test
drive, can any see something I missed or can offer suggestions on what to
try.

If you made it this far thank you and I look forward the wisdom of the list
yet again!

Thanks

Meredith
