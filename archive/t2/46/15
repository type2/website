Subject: Bus windshield seal is loose, normal?

Hi All,

I got a new seal put on my windshield after the rust and paint R&R (Thanks =
Grant!!). Its been a few months and I notice that the seal is not holding the =
windshield in so tightly any more. On the inside of the bus, I can peel back =
the rubber with a finger or two. It doesn't feel tight like the last =
aftermarket seal I had on there. It is still holding the glass in, and I sealed =
the outside with 3M windshield gunk when I put it in so I don't think it is =
going to leak when the rain starts. The seal is a WCM bought locally here in =
Los Angeles.

Is this a problem? Anyone else have this happen to them?

Thanks!
