I was curious as to how expensive it would be to put a simple manual Halon
system into my bus, what with all this fire talk making me very very
nervous. I remember this guy I worked with who had a porsche repli-car
with a type 4 engine who had a fire suppression system in it so I emailed
him and he pointed me to http://www.ioportracing.com/fire.htm

It seems they range around 400 bucks minus installation. All and all, it
doesn't seem too expensive to throw one in (especially considering I just
shelled out 600 bucks to get a new front axle beam installed).
