Dave,
1. you don't need insurance - that is only required when RENEWING your
vehicle.  I just transfered ownership of my daughter's 71 SB and was
required to register first, then get insurance.  I thought about it
afterwards and it made sense.  First get the ownership taken care of,
then insure it.  Once you own it, they can make you insure it before
renewing.

2. you have to take the bus to the CHP before the DMV and have them fill
out a vehicle verification.
I wasn't sure if there was anything else, so I went over to
http://www.dmv.ca.gov
which then led me to
http://www.dmv.ca.gov/vehinfo/vehicles.htm

There is tons of great info there about general registration questions.
From there we were off to
http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/brochures/howto/htvr14.htm
That is a complete brochure on how to register vehicles that have been
out of the system for 4+ years.

Their summary
You Always Need...
     Verification of Vehicle
      Proof of ownership

You Sometimes Need...
     Application for Registration (REG 343/31)
      Odometer Disclosure Statement (REG 236)
      Statement of Facts (REG 256)
      Motor Vehicle Bond
      Weight Certificate
      Smog Certificate
      To surrender license plates

Hope that helps a bit
