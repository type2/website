Subject: brand new air flow meter!!

hey all,

matty here again. last nite i discovered that i still
have a brand new air flow meter hangin around, from
when i bought my 76. u see, my bus needed a new one
but feul injection corporation sent the wrong one. i
got the right one, but i still have the other one
kickin around. its a part no. 410012 and fits buses
from 8/74 up to 12/75. (the one i needed was a
410018). i could just return it, but id rather hook a
fellow bus driver up. so whaddya say, any one want it?
 later on- matty
