Subject: re: [T2] Head Temp Sender

I had the same problem. After messing with the temp sender, I couldn't get is =
back in the hole. If the sender is not in there securely, the bus is liable to =
"stutter" when running.

First, the sender is supposed to screw into the head directly, but the aluminum =
is easily stripped especially if you don't use a torque wrench to make sure you =
don't go too tight. Ask me how I know...

If there is a spring stuffed into the hole, perhaps it is a helicoil which is =
used to "fix" a stripped hole. This is an accepted and recommended way of =
fixing the problem. If you can, you'd be advised to screw the spring into the =
aluminum head then the sender into the spring. Others on the list will probably =
have some good ideas on how to do this. I didn't do it this way, I did a kludge =
hack which I will briefly describe next. I'd consider this an alternative if =
you are lazy like me ;-) or are unable to follow the recommended solution. This =
involves a coat hanger so it is not for the purists, but you brought up JB Weld =
so I'm probably safe in your company..

My hole was stripped pretty good and the sender would fall out or vibrate out =
after no time. I attached a coat hanger to one of the intake manifold bolts and =
bended it in such a way as that it keeps the sender pushed securely in. I was =
concerned that I wouldn't be getting as good of a heat transfer from the head =
to the sensor so I coated the sensor hole and bottom of sensor with heat sink =
solution from Radio Shack. Next I was concerned that having the heat sink =
solution in there might interfere with the grounding of the sensor. For the =
sensor to work it has to get the heat from the head as well as a good ground. I =
ran an extra wire around the sensor and grounded it to a spot on the firewall. =
Not clean, but it works. Alternatively, I have heard that the sensor does not =
produce a linear response to heat, i.e. when the engine is cold, you get the =
resistance (I'm sure this measurement is in Bentley), then when it heats up =
just a little, you effectively get a short. You could put in a switch that =
gives that wire the "cold" resistance and then manually flip it to provide a =
short as soon as the bus is warm a little. Just don't let the smog people know =
if you are in California.

OTOH it might be easier to fix it the "right" way. Oh and BTW, JB Weld won't =
hold it in there (or it didn't for me)

Best of Luck!
