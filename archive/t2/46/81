Subject: turn signal/dimmer switch

Does anyone out there have a turn signal/high beam
switch for a 1972 westie.  On my first voyage after
installing a new motor, I went to signal my left hand
turn and "snap", the turn signal arm broke off in my
hand.  I've been trying to locate one through Rocky
Mountain Motorworks, but they have been out for quite
a while and don't know when more will come in.

Thanks in advance, my arms are getting tired from all
the hand signals and I feel sketchy about getting rear
ended.
