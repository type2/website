Subject: Painting the dash

Hey folks-

  I just pulled my dash to do some painting/cleaning in my '77, and I noticed
that it's looking a little dingy and faded unevenly from the sun.  I have to
imagine this a pretty common problem when the vehicle is 30 years old.

  The material the dash is covered in is some sort of vinyl (it's a stock
dash
as I understand it).  I'm wondering if I can paint it or if I can clean it up
some how.  Does anyone have experience restoring their dash?  I definitely
want
to look at my dash and think it looks good, so any suggestions would be
welcome.

Cheers,
Paul
