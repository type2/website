Hi Alan,
I had the same problem on my wiper motor. Since I did not want to change
the connector and wanted to keep everything as stock as possible, I
tried to bond it with no success. There is quite some torque working on
the gear. Finally, I disassembled a Vanagon setup (the T2 version is
held together by some screws, the Vanagon one is riveted, so you have to
drill it up). The plastic gear is *almost* the same, the metal tracks
are at slightly different radii. Just bend the connector a bit so the
"pick-ups" are at the right location and put the unit back together. It
makes sense to test the unit prior to installation, since it is a PITA
to do it all over again.
Cheers,
Timo
