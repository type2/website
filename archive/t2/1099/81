Subject: New Genuine VW Sliding Windows are Back

These are the real deal, genuine VW sliding windows, for the sliding door
and the window opposite it. I had them several years ago for a short time
for $149 each, and sold out rather quickly. Unfortunately, when I went to
reorder VW/Brasil doubled the price on me, so I had to walk away. Frankly I
thought I'd never see them again, but I'm happy to announce that I was
finally able to get them again for the previous price.  These are the same
as the ones found on late model German Buses and are drop-in replacements on
all 68-79.
