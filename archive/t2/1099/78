Subject: Some thoughts on trickle charging .... Was Re: [T2] Putting a

My 1970 Westy has a Kyocera 65-watt solar panel discreetly located out of 
sight inside the luggage rack area at the rear of the bus.  It charges even 
on a cloudy day.  I also have a small 2-4-6 volt battery charger that can be 
used to charge the auxillary battery located under the jump seat when 
necessary.

The main and auxillary batteries are connected, in parallel, but can be 
isolated when for camping, for example.  Most battery chargers and solar 
regulators automatically shut off when full charge is reached, so there is 
little risk of over-charging.  The solar panel is most useful during the day 
when parked in town away from shore power, or at the beach or in a 
wilderness area, to power an electric refrigerator.  The battery charger 
comes in handy at night at a camp site with 120 power, to support an 
eberspacher heater as well as lights, TV, etc.

It's a pretty good system.  The solar panel was expensive but small battery 
charges are not and do not take up much room.

For several years I had the battery charger hard-wired so it was on whenever 
shore power was active.  Recently I stopped doing this, as it is easy enough 
just to hook up the alligator clips to the battery when needed.
