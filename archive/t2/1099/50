I read the whole thread on Samba and the bus IS rough - too rough for me 
- but it DOES look like it is salvageable with some patch panels and a 
good welder/body man.

Some of the van really does not look bad - especially considering the 
parking arrangments for the past 30+ years.

He'll have some amazing bragging rights once the van is fixed.

Have spent the whole evening looking at formerly sunken tanks, ships, 
cars, and so forth. It is amazing what lengths some folks will go to 
save machines from history. One page estimated there were 150+ U-boats 
lost off of the coasts of the UK during the "Battle of the Atlantic". 
Several have been recovered and made into museums.
