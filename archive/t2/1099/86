When traveling on trips more than 100 miles from home I typically
bring along the following, it might seem like a lot of stuff but it
all fits in a bag stashed under the rear seat:

Flashlight
Wheel chocks
a jack, t-bar
spare tire(s), belt, oil
jumper cables
12 volt jumper pack
hand winch and 30+ feet of tow straps (if I'm going anywhere near off-road)
tool box
spare cables: clutch (including wing nut and clevis pin), accelerator,
a few barrel nuts for quick roadside repair
fuel filter
coil
distributor (points pre-gapped, of course)
spare oil filter
spark plugs
valve cover gaskets
misc electrical: bulbs, fuses, multimeter, some wire, crimp
connectors, wire nuts and tape for temporary and mid-term fixes on the
way
Books: bentley, muir, wilson
AIRS list
A way to get on the type2 list


No matter how prepared you are you have to be prepared for the fact
that something might happen that you totally are not prepared for.

Despite having all the above on board (and more) I was still sidelined
in the middle of nowhere Nebraska a couple years back on a
cross-country run. A valve drops you're going to need a head, maybe a
piston or cylinder, a floor jack for pulling the engine, a ring
compressor, etc, etc, etc.

Be prepared with some extra cash in the bank to pay for unseen
contingencies like drop shipping heads to Valentine Nebraska. Be
prepared to use what's available (a large worm type clamp can be used
as a ring compressor in a pinch, etc.). Be patient and take it all in
as a learning experience.

These vehicles can teach a lot
