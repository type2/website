That is the way my Autopal ones are as well. Kinda like:

The light is below the lines.Above the lines it's dark, with a pretty
sharp cutoff.

This is the difference between Britain, Japan, and other
left-side-of-the-road markets and the rest of the world. Those markets
have the broad light on the LEFT, doing a terrific job of blinding
oncoming cars here in North America.

Again, I can't rave about the H4 format enough. Get on the Bus Depot
deal. If you don't like 'em you can put them on the list here (or that
auction site) and get your money back. Just like the Koni shock deal,
there will always be folks who missed out for whatever reason and will
jump on a chance after the fact.
