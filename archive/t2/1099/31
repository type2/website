Subject: Re: [T2] Painting the dash

For anyone looking for a good "chassis black" i.e. not too shiny and not 
too flat - look at tractor implement paint. I have used in on several 
parts including the floorpan of my Beetle. I sourced mine from Tractor 
Supply Co. locally. At the time the gallon of paint was less than $20. 
It's probably a basic enamel paint from memory.

As for the dash I used rattle can vinyl paint from an auto paint supply 
store. That is industrial grade stuff and a previous attempt with FLAPS 
vinyl paint did not go well (flaked off). I prepped with mineral spirits 
on a rag rubbed all over the dash followed by a very quick wipe of 
lacquer thinner to get the mineral spirits off. Don't dwell b/c the 
lacquer thinner could "melt" the vinyl. My dash job is about 5-6 years 
old now and looks fine. The vinyl paint was "SEM" brand.  I recently 
used their flexible bumper paint on the side trim of my VW cabrio and it 
also has held up very well.  Hope this helps someone.
