Well, to be precise, it's $25K for a kit to build it yourself. If you
want it assembled, I'm sure there is an additional fee. Plus it would
be harder for an assembled kit to pass DOT. They technically supply
two kits, upper body and lower frame so that they are technically
repair kits for your existing bus, but you can buy the two and put
them together. If you weld in your existing VIN, is the newly built
bus a repair of the VIN metal that had the bus around it rust away?!?!
