Only time I've been stranded was due to the distributor.  The screw hole 
where the points attached got stripped.  Apparently this wasn't the 
first time, and a larger screw was used.  Well that finally gave up and 
using a larger screw yet again caused the points to sit too far from the 
nub on the shaft.  The rotation wouldn't open the points anymore.  Since 
then I've carried a spare distributor.  If nothing else I'd have a cheap 
009 loaded with new condenser and gapped points ready to swap in.

In addition to the loaded dizzy I carry a spare voltage regulator, 
double relay, fuel pump, fuel filter, clutch and accelerator cables, 
clutch cable wing nut, clutch cable clevis pin, 2 or 3 CV bolts, some 
12g wire and assorted connectors, and a full set of tools when I'm on a 
road trip.
