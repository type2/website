 If you want bright lights first make sure you have sufficient voltage up
front. A voltage drop from 13.5V to 12V can cause the headlight output to drop
by 40%! Start by cleaning all the main terminals (battery, ground and the +ve
terminal on the solenoid) and coating them with anticorrosion coating. You can
also run an additional wire from the +ve terminal on the solenoid up front to
reduce the load on the stock wire, and clean up the grounding points for the
headlights.
