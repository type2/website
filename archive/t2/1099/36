Why didn't you get the German Flosser bulbs they had on sale? They were 
a good deal. For good quality bulbs, Osram/Sylvania, Hella, and Philips 
are most likely to be found locally.

I'd skip the marketing gimmick bulbs (anything with a blue coating, 
Nightbreakers, Cool Blue, Bluevision, Sylvania Silverstar, etc.), and 
just get plain old good quality H4s. A blue coating will _always_ 
reduce the light output (it's filtering out non-blue light).

If you want to spend more, get either long life ("LL") bulbs, or clear 
"+" bulbs, like the Narva RangePower+50.
