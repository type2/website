Hi Craig,
	How are you set for total ignition advance?  If you are at 28* BTC  
try moving it up to 32* BTC.  Try a different distributor?  Use 91  
octane fuel if not already.  There might be some issue with using the  
small carb with 88mm machine-ins and the torque cam?  Maybe put the  
smaller air correction jet back in?  I'd take the air cleaner off and  
drive around the block to get some idea as to if it is totally  
blocked up or something.  If so you'll know right away!
	I have  a friend who built a SP motor with 88 machine ins and a pic  
34 carb which never ran as well as almost any stock DP 1600 in good  
shape....  There are so many variables to chase around when you stray  
from stock.  Even trying to go "stock" can be a hit or miss chore.
