Subject: Headliner install step by step

Hey folks-

  Pricing out parts, getting ready to start putting things back together on
the
interior (exciting!).  I tore out my old headliner because it was stinky
(mildew) and probably just should be replaced.  I've seen pictures all over
the
samba of some really good looking headliners that aren't the stock fabric
ones
(ones made from birch and various other woods).

  After seeing all the pictures, I'm still not able to connect bare ceiling
and
the epicness of end goal.  Does anyone have detailed pictures of a non-stock
headliner installation?  At least having something to see so I can make my
own
plans would be helpful.

Cheers,
Paul
