Subject: Putting a battery charger/maintainer on my 77 Bay Westy

I have a little 1.5 amp schumacher automatic battery charger that I always
leave hooked up to my van when I park it. A solar plug in one isn't doing it,
as my radio seems to kill the battery over a weeks period. I was wondering if
I couldn't just hard wire the charger into the system so that when I plug in
to a campsite mains, it will also charge up my battery? Anyone see a problem
with doing this?
Thanks,
Courtney
