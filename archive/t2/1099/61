    A LED flashlight that fits in your mouth is invaluable- Home Depot 
has sets that include a small one. My roadside emergency was a blocked 
gas tank- carry a fuel hose clamp and a spare piece of tubing long 
enough to go from the hose-to-filter end to the side of the car and 
higher than the gas tank. Have a piece of metal tubing that is alread 
fastened to the tubing piece and can be inserted into the tube from the 
tank. I blew into this to free up the blockage and then let it drain 
into a cup by the car to verify it was running.  A spare fuel pump is 
handy.
    I also had the heavy wire from the solenoid main terminal to the 
fuse strip fray/wear thru on a heater box, so spare terminal lugs and 
heavy wire was needed.  At least have the means to do a splice if 
needed.  The $5 blue flame flex-tip charcoal lighters by Benzomatic are 
good for emergency soldering. Also carry 30 amp adaptors for house power 
from RV boxes at campgrounds in case the 15 amp does not work or is used.
