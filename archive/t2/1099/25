Subject: Westy Stool / Storage Unit / Trash Recepticle Now Available

I now have repro's of the original plaid-upholstered Westy stool & storage
units, for between the front seats of your '74-79 camper. These are very
nicely made by a local customer of ours. They look very authentic, right
down to the securing straps. The wood color is a very slightly different
shade, due to the unavailability of the original, but it's so close that
unless you put it right up against your cabinet you wouldn't notice it.
