After removing the dash obviously...
 
You will be able to acess through a very, very much too small hole behind
each, where you must compress two opposing spring out plastic feet that
straddle the hose nib.  The best thing I ever found for this exact job is a
pair of some sort of odd pliers that had 1/4" wide long thin jaws with a bit
of semicircle ground into each, that I could slip up the hole, compress the
things and push em out.  It never occured to me too this moment that a bit of
the right size pipe slipped over then might compress them and tap it out,
perhaps a bit of 1/4" NPT brass?  The tried and cursed method would be working
each side out with a flat screwdriver or with a set perhaps of needle nose
vice grips.  The pipe thing I bet would do nicely if one could guess the right
size bit of pipe.  I recently had to do the job on my wifes Toyota rear wiper,
exact same size hole and mounting things.  Some things never change,
unfortunately I hadn't seen my special pliers since I
 moved, and there I was cursing two screwdrivers...
 
If you destroy them, they aren't expensive, or they weren't last I looked, who
knows today.
