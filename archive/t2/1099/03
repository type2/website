List (and Ron):

Are these the same headlights that have "MOTORCYCLE" embossed in the  
lens?

They are, in fact, an excellent upgrade to the stock headlights.  The  
pattern is different in that the cut-off for the top of the beam is  
more pronounced (I guess making it more compatible with an HID  
upgrade), but also the beam becomes more broad (in an up-and-down  
direction) on the right-hand side, thereby illuminating the roadside  
much better than the stock headlights.
