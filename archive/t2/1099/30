> We covered our dash because if was badly painted by PO.  They
had used some flat white house paint (as was the outside of the  
bus!!!) &
it looked terrible.

I used a material that is used as a boot (trunk, I think it is to  
you) liner.  It is
very thin and flexible yet hard wearing.  It is soft enough to mould  
into all
the depressions in the dash face as well as fold around the radio  
opening
& glovebox opening.

We used spray on adhesive on the dash and on the back of the material.
After 4 years it still looks fine.  (Materials is black by the way)
