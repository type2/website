Subject: re:Putting a battery charger/maintainer on my 77 Bay

I had thought about putting something just like this on my '65 bus. The
trickle charger that I had could be used with either the spring clamps or
just with the little ring terminals.

 

There was a quick disconnect for either option. So I planned on putting the
ring terminals right onto the battery, then leaving the quick disconnect in
the engine compartment. Then whenever I parked it for a while I could just
plug the battery charger to the battery via the quick disconnect. 

 

one things that would need to be done

1.       The original ring terminals would need to be enlarged to fit over
the battery terminals.

 

I'm not sure why you are going through the fuse box? These chargers are
designed to be connected directly to the battery, right?

 

If you want to leave the battery charger in the bus all the time, just make
up a longer lead.
