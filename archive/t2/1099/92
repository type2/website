That was VW's original intention, going clear back to the original
Beetle. Prof Porsche said it was a "dethrottled engine" for longevity
and reliability. Since engines have gotten bigger, that has changed
somewhat. I've heard Ronnie at Bustoration builds strong 1800 bus
engines built on single ports for the very reason of torque - which is
what a bus driver needs in an up-sized engine, compared to what a
Beetle driver needs, or someone who likes to play with a big street
motor. Ronnie uses the small stock exhaust, too, for the same reason
of restricting the flow for torque.

 displacement?
