Subject: confession

I am sorry, but it is time to confess if I am going to solve my problem.

I put down my grease gun at one stage (don't remember when) and I now
have a dab of grease on the rear "Z" bed seat.

How do I deal with this one?

Thought I would ask for ideas here because so many ideas flow from this
forum.

I think I started to use standard chassis lube, it is grey. I guess I
can open and check the gun if it matters.

If anyone asks for me to look for something then, yes I will do it.

Thank you in advance.

Alan
