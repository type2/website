Subject: Windshield wiper jet removal

Hi Type2ers-

  Trying to get everything stripped down on the bus to get it ready for body
work, and I'm not exactly sure how the heck to get the windshield wiper jets
off the nose.  Where do they come off at?  I searched Atwell's site and
didn't
find anything.

  I'd like to get these off soon cause I have a single dent to pull from the
nose, and then fiberglass and primer!

Cheers,
Paul
