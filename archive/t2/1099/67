Subject: Putting a charger/maintainer on.

Courtney,

I wouldn't leave a charger attached to the battery. There is undoubtedly some
leakage current that will flow thru it when it is not plugged into the wall.
That leakage would drain the battery. Other than that, I see no problem.
Anyone else?

Chris
