If the dash is too far gone for good results with this, I've had good
results with Vinyl Paint from FLAPS. Catch 22 is that you will have a
hard time getting all the Turtle Wax (or other brand) treatment off if
you try that first. Might try a little treatment on a small area first
to see if you like the result before deciding which route to commit
to. Of course, another option is recovering with fresh padding and
covering material.
