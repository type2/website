Subject: Re: [T2] Essential spare parts list for 2000 mile trip ? 77 

Though I have never needed them, I have always carried a spare clutch cable 
and a spare throttle cable, two items that can break and are difficult 
(especially the clutch cable) to work around.

As mentioned, points, but maybe more important, a timing light.  Points can 
break (I had this happen in the mountains of Colorado in an old Volvo --  
snapped in two) but mostly they may just need filing and adjusting.

Cheers,

John R
