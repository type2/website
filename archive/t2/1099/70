Hey Craig!

Don't let your head temps reach 420 ever, and avoid over 400 except
for brief unavoidable spikes when you first see it - back off the gas
or shift down for a blast of cooling air. Read this for the
explanation and also about how to properly handle it if you have to
get off the road:

You corrected your rich running problem with the change of float
and/or needle. Now you have added additional leanness - changing your
air correction has leaned the carb out of what it was spec'ed for
according to your application. The consequence of running lean is high
head temps:

Always be sure your Air/Fuel ratio stays out of the "death zone". You
will see it in charts on the above article. I know for an experienced
"dubber", the nose is a sensitive A/F Ratio tuning tool, but for this
kind of work, you really need something like the LM-1 exhaust
analyzer.

Best of luck,

John
