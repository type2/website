Subject: Headlight Grounds

Perhaps the problem I am having with my very dull lights can start with
Grounds.

I see one for each headlight.

Is there one in the steering column?

Is there one coming from the harness connected to the battery via some
means? 

Or it is likely a 12 Volt source looking for a ground to turn it on?

I am banking the 12 Volt source.

If anyone has more information than this please let me know.
