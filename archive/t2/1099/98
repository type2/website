if your tricky,, you can wiggle them out from the outside....  standing in
front of the bus,.. tug out on the nozzle slightly to one side... as your do
that ,, slip a very narrow flat tool under the rubber.  I use the blunt side
of a long razor knife.

it is very hard to describe in words, but you can walk them out by prying on
one side, and pushing on the other.

and ,, if you take out the signal lights on a 74 - 79 style.. you can reach
in , pinch the tangs,, and pull them out.. all from outside.

hope that helps
