Subject: Wiring question to install a battery maintainer into my 77

I want to install this charger/maintainer right into my Westy wiring so that when plugged in to city power it also starts maintaining the battery. My question is; Where should I tap into the existing Westy 120volt system? I want it AFTER the fusebox, but before the 2 plug outlet so I can have two free outlets inside the van. Could I tap in to the back of the plug outlet? Does anyone know what the breaker rating is? I'm at work right now, and my van is at home. :-) I'm thinking they are 15 amps.
Thanks,
Courtney
