Check the voltage up the front with a multimeter with the engine idling.
I get close to 14V. This was after going through and cleaning the main
electrical connections - the battery terminals and the point where the
-ve battery lead connects to the body and the +ve lead connects to the
solenoid. I then coated these points with anti-corrosion coating. Prior
to these changes the voltage at the front was about 1V less. Doesn't
sound like much but a small drop in voltage causes a disproportionate
drop in headlight brightness.
