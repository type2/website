Subject: Crashed T2 Westy Sighting in movie Bad Boys 2

Hi Guys,

Don't recall if this was mentioned yet on the list, at least I don't
recall. 

Last night I was watching the movie "Bad Boys 2" while channel
surfing after the Jet/SanDiego game.  Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are in a
fast Ferrari chasing the bad guys who are driving a car-hauler semi through
the byways of Miami surroundings.  I just flipped on the right moment when the
car-hauler semi going around a turn ram-rods a nice looking late
70's Campmobile.  

This was supposed to be in Miami or was it a studio in LA?
It was a nice lime green 78-ish looking Westy.  The Semi clipped the van from
the back and crushed it over forward  -  sad sad use of good props.  Why
didn't they crush an Aztec or a Hummer?

Was this anyones innocent bystander
van or was it a donnated token?

Sad! More precious metal gone to the
crushers.  We should send a collective complaint letter to the movie studios
and producers to use these endangered species with more respect.
 Happy
Camping,
