Subject: Re: [T2] Spare parts for long distance travel

Hi Volks,

I'll add my own $.02 to this thread... If you're gonna carry spares, it 
often pays to install them BEFORE the trip and carry the used parts as 
spares instead.

Your own driveway is a much better place to discover that there's a bolt 
missing from a kit, you got the wrong part in a box with the right 
number on it, or the PO messed with something in an unusual fashion, and 
you will have the option to swap the original part back in until the 
situation can be resolved.

Happy Trails,
