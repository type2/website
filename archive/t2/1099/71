That statement kinda needs to be qualified: running *leaner than stoich* 
does not yield higher head temps; it yields cooler temps.  But like the 
gami article mentions, running anywhere near stoich is dangerous, 
especially if you aren't monitoring each cylinder individually.

I should hopefully be monitoring all cylinders' EGTs in the next few 
months when the new megasquirt expansion card is released.  That will 
allow me to monitor EGT on all cylinders and and also me to tweak fuel 
flow to each cylinder.
