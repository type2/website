Subject: Re: [T2] Putting a  battery charger/maintainer on my 77 Bay

FYI, I have a closeout on a genuine Westfalia battery charger / AC-DC
converter that Westfalia-Werke was installing in T4 and T5 campers in
Europe.  It costs $950 from VW, and while not worth $950, it's a pretty good
deal at the $179 closeout price.  A lot of Vanagon people have been buying
these to permanently mount in their campers as a converter and battery
charger. The molded connectors you need to go with it run about $2 plus
shipping at electronic stores. The terminals are marked, but no wiring
instructions are included, so you'd have to wing it.
