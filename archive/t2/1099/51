Subject: Essential spare parts list for 2000 mile trip ? 77 Westy

Tom, I DO have a 77 Baywindow Westy and would love to know what you would 
consider taking along to keep on the road regardless. :-) I have a double 
relay in my stash, but what else is the essential list of parts for an 
extended road trip of about 2000 miles? I will start searching for spares if 
you don't mind providing your opinion on this.
Many thanks,
Courtney

Always be yourself, because the people that matter don't mind,
and the ones who mind, don't matter.
