Always be yourself, because the people that matter don't mind,

I bought a used Century 120volt welder that came with the gas setup. It does 
have a fan inside, but the duty cycle is still pretty short; about 5 minutes 
in every 30. That works for me though, I'm slow and steady. :-) I paid 100 
dollars for it with the gas setup.

That's identical to my Century welder. It is a starter welder with only hi 
and low; but it does work quite well. So far I've been practicing on old 
angle iron etc to learn to put a decent bead down. I am using .030 flux core 
wire, and on thick stuff it works very well, just messy with slag. I'm going 
to buy a bottle of gas to switch to the thin gauge (auto panel) welding and 
see what I can do. It will be interesting with the hi low setting only. Of 
course the wire feed speed is entirely adjustable. I'm using the "frying 
bacon sound" method of calibrating. :-)
