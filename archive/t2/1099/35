Bus BRRR 2010!

We are one month away from the 6th Annual Bus BRRR! This fund raising
charity event is hosted by Buses By the Beach. (www.busesbythebeach.com
<http://www.busesbythebeach.com/> ) Bus BRRR is definitely for the true
camping enthusiast and a great use of a VW Bus!  Temperatures can and have
dipped below zero at night.  This doesn't stop the VW Bus diehards from
coming out.  This one night campout is held on the last Saturday in February
each year at Beautiful Pokagon State Park in Angola, Indiana.  Each site
includes an electric hook-up so you can keep warm with an electric heater.
It also comes in handy for warming up a Crockpot full of Chili for the
"Chilly Chili Dinner".  It is always nice to come back and warm up next to
the giant Bonfire after spending some time on the 35-40mph (faster than your
average bus) dual refrigerated toboggan runs.  Lots of great volks, music,
conversation and fun!   All while supporting The Phoenix Society for Burn
Survivors.  Again this year, we are instituting the "Kozy as a Baked Potato"
Award for the warmest looking bus!

Some helpful tips:

Be sure to bring warm clothing for day and night.  A 1200 watt heater
(ceramic is best!)of some sort for the cold nights.  Some of our attendees
have fashioned or purchased Mylar or something similar for insulating the
pop top canvas.  This definitely helps to keep the heat in.  We have camped
at every Bus BRR and have been warm in the bus with an electric heater down
to -5 below. Most attendees bring a Crockpot filled with delicious chili
(optional) or a dish to pass for the dinner, but don't feel obligated.  You
may consider bringing some snow pants or suit if you plan on using the
toboggan run.  The park is really beautiful under a light snowfall.  Alcohol
is permitted at the park at this time of year, but obnoxious drunks are
never welcome.  Due to the Emerald Ash Borer please leave the firewood at
home.  We'll have plenty to keep the fire roaring.  If you have any
questions about Bus BRRR! please email Pete O. at pnoceanwesty(-at-)gmail.com .
Pete would be willing to give you his cell number if you are traveling in
and need directions or assistance. Email him and he will be glad to help
you.

Wishing you many miles of smiles!
