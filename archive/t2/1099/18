Subject: Re: [T2] confession

LOL Alan take it from someone that plays this game all the time.  Dawn  
dish soap, gojo or oxy clean and a little of the other grease...elbow.

I am  sorry, but it is time to confess if I am going to solve my problem.

I  put down my grease gun at one stage (don't remember when) and I now
have a  dab of grease on the rear "Z" bed seat.

How do I deal with this  one?

Thought I would ask for ideas here because so many ideas flow from  this
forum.

I think I started to use standard chassis lube, it is  grey. I guess I
can open and check the gun if it matters.

If anyone  asks for me to look for something then, yes I will do it.

Thank you in  advance.

Alan
