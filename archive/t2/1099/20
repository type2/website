Subject: Re: [T2] Painting the dash

Paul
I did my dash ... and I thought I did a great job.. i bought special black
paint,,, as at the time gloss or flat was all you could find.. so I had some
no shine,, low luster, something like that,,

Flat black is a bugger to keep clean...  gloss black reflects too much
light..

the other thing... I prepped and painted it properly,,  and 2 days after it
was in direct sunlight,, it blistered like I should have used high heat
paint...     so I wasn't happy.  but I have been tooo lazy to take it out
and do it over.

here is a pic that shows the dash,, after i painted it, you can see the
paint flaked off...
