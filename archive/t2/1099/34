Subject: H4 bulb recommendations?

Looking for a recommendation for H4 bulbs (just received my Bosch H4
conversions).

Searched the web. Most of the threads deal with how close to HID (bright
white) they look to oncomming traffic, and not about how well they work for
the driver.

Not interested in HID or increasing output from 55/60W.

Osram Nightbreakers look interesting. Or, should I just stick with a good
quality bulb, like Hella?

I'm running PIAA H7's in my Audis, but it is not clear to me if the whighter
light really improves night driving for me.

Thanks.
