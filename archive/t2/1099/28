Ron,

This is great!  If I had a wish list of things the Bus Depot's network 
of suppliers and custom fabricators were to provide the 76-79 rear westy 
table and leg would be at the top.  I bet there's lots of money to be 
made there.  Any chance we'll see this and other hard to find westy 
pieces in the future?
