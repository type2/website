Subject: Weber ict carb sync problem fixed

I thought I would share the solution to a mystery that has been plaguing
me with my weber 34 icts in recent times. For the record they are on a
76 2l.

When I first fitted them they passed the basic sync test of opening and
reaching fully throttle at the same time. Then, after being taken on and
off a few times, I could no longer get them to pass this test. I had
noticed in passing that the arm on the throttle shaft on the left side
had acquired a slight "S" shape in profile but didn't think anything of
it.

Yesterday I took the carbs off again and flattened the "S" shaped arm
out. What do you know, they now work in harmony! I also discovered that
you shouldn't overtighten the nut holding the arm on as the shaft will
bind! :(
