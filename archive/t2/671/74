Subject: Re: [T2] AVP Head

Since AVP is generally well regarded I'd be interested in knowing exactly
what the problem turns out to be here.

However, a "good" head - rebuilt or not - really should work right out of
the box so I wouldn't be too happy with a solution that says, in effect,
l"et the parts wear into spec."  Components are supposed to be in spec when
installed; the engine probably *will* get better as it breaks in, but should
still work properly on first startup.  Besides, didn't AVP do a "hot run" of
the engine after assembly?  (I seem to remember this is part of their
process, though I may be wrong.)
