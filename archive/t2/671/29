Subject: Anyone in Portland OR?

I got offered a set of HE's for my bus, but they're setting in a
driveway in Portland, Oregon. The owner pmailed me that he had them
but he was out of town and can't send them to me himself.

Anybody willing to pick them up and stick them in a box and ship them
to me? Pleeeeezeeeee?

(Of course I'll pay for shipping and a beer for your time.)
