Subject: Bending fuel line

Due to the fuel leak I had last week, I replaced all flexible fuel lines
exept from the metal fuel line going through the firewall. This metal line I
had to order and it will arrive later this week.
I will have to curve this line for 90 degrees; do I need a special tool to
do this? I tried to bend the old line and it was quite easy to do. Any tips
on this one?
