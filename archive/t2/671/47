Jamey,

Everything so far sounds great!

Hi temp sealant should be fine, the only place I would worry about it is 
anyplace close the the HE's.

I also blocked off one of the Y tubes and sealed around the vac hose...you 
can then go up front and listen and feel how much air is being sucked thru 
which vents.  If it doesn't sound/ feel good, then search along the tubes 
looking/listening for leaks.

I actually had my shop vac outside the garage door with the hose coming 
inside(with an etension).

Let us know how it goes!

Cheers, dave

 In my check, I found that air delivery was at:
 1)fan housing (thank god)
 2)after heat exchanger
 3)after plastic accordion tubes
 4)finally, and weakly, at foot vents
