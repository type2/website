Subject: More CDI MPG data: SF -> LA

Hi folks...

Yesterday I drove my fairly well-loaded Westy from San Francisco to LA 
via US-101.  Here is some more data.  The trip was broken down into 3 
legs for a total of 458 miles, using 24.5 gallons of 87 gas.  Overall, 
that's 18.7 MPG, but that doesn't really tell the whole story.

The first leg (San Francisco to King City) was mostly flat and I kept 
the needle at 65 MPH the whole way, save one hill that I did at 45 MPH 
in 3rd gear.  On this 212 mile stretch, the gauge was still showing 
well above the "reserve".  It took 8.1 gallons to fill the tank, for an 
astounding 26 MPG.  I had the gas pedal pressed about 2/3 the way to 
maintain speed.

The next two legs weren't so ideal for fuel economy.  It is pretty 
hilly and windy between King City and Santa Barbara, especially through 
SLO county.  Still, while keeping the Bus at a steady 65 MPH 
(occasionally reaching 70 MPH to pass trucks), I managed 15 MPG through 
these stretches.  My foot was all the way into the pedal for most of 
this leg due to the hills and wind, which I think explains the 15 MPG.

Today I am driving from LA to Tucson, AZ via I-10.  This is going to be 
mostly flat, though there are a couple of hills to take.  I'll post 
more fuel economy data for this part of the trip.
