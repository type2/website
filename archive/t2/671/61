Subject: a dumb question about front vents

Hi,

I'm heading over the river and through the woods tomorrow.  My dash vents 
leak cold air in the bus.  Can I cover the grills on the front of the bus with 
cardboard like the water cooled guys do?  Does that air go anywhere else?

Does anyone know what the thickness of the upper bunk mattress of a mid 70s 
Adventurewagen top?

Jacques
