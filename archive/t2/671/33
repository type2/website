It had been about an hour since it had been overheated and run out of oil, so
it wasn't stone cold, but it also wasn't hot.  It wouldn't turn by the
ignition key, or by hand with a wrench on the generator nut, or by bringing in
the clutch in 2nd gear with two people pushing the bus down a slight hill.  I
can't say I have prior experience with seized engines, but I was pretty well
convinced that I'd met one.

Good to know.  I had no idea.
