Subject: Re: [T2] Getting rid of old gasoline?

Thanks, Dave and Will. I've looked up my local haz waste disposal site, 
and I'll be able to get rid of the gasoline free, once we stop having 
holidays on Saturdays (only day they are open).

I didn't think of this at first because where I used to live (in San 
Diego proper), you had to make an appointment and sign forms to dispose 
of any hazardous waste. Talk about a disincentive!
