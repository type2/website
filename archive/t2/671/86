Subject: Re: [T2] Snap-on tools

Conclusion to this part of the saga: I called snap-on. They are out of 
stock on the 3" standard I ordered, the four-inch, and the two-inch. I 
asked for a refund and found another supplier. Snap-on is sending some 
sort of a tag so that I can return the ratchet grease (oy!).

My suspicion that something's amok has grown, meanwhile. It's easy to 
get any tool except the one that assures that all the others are 
accurate. Hmm.
