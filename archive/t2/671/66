Each winter, I take the front grille off, wrap the
black plastic screen in plastic wrap (or Aluminum foil
one year), and re-install it.  The 6 screws holding
the painted grille to the bus just pop through the
plastic (or foil).  Zero cold-are intrusion into the
cab.  At least from the fresh air system.   :-o  A low
tech and very cheap solution.
