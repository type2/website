I've done brake lines by hand. Trust me. you WANT the tool. The
brake/fuel line bender is often found in the $2.98 bin at big FLAPS.
;-)

If you insist on doing it by hand, what I did was fill the line with
sand and pinch or otherwise seal the ends. Find an elementary school
(serious!) and use the heavy metal pipes in the playground equipment
as your template. Gently bend around the pipes to the shape you need.
This is for large diameter bends. If you need small diameter bends, a
screwdriver handle in a vice will work, but be careful the handle
doesn't slip.

The playground equipment has different diameter pipes to get the bend
you want, plus they're not likely to slip or crush while you're doing
this. Obviously, if you have something sturdy you can use instead, by
all means... But remember that I've always lived in apartments and so
have limited space for such things. So I have to get creative.

The sand helps prevent kinks by filling the space inside and spreading
out the force used to bend the line.

This worked, but I'll never do it again. It's so much more convenient
to just spend a couple of dollars on a tube bender... LoL!
