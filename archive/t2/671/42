Wow! You guys are great! 

I got several offers to help me out on this, and I really appreciate
it! One of the list members apparently lives right up the street from
where the HEs are. =D

Again, thank you everybody!!!


PS: One of the replies asked what an HE was.... Heat Exchanger. The
air cooled version of an exhaust manifold.
