Someone -- I think it's Tom Wilson -- claims that bus exhaust parts 
were "intended" to be repaired by welding. At least, until they rust 
away completely. All of the u-tubes I've ever inspected (dozens?) have 
been welded, but usually ham-handedly.

I think this should go on the list for any major '75-'78 rebuild 
(unless you go with Bus Depot's cross-over crossover): find a welder 
you trust to make a stack-of-dimes weld with good penetration for these 
parts, then make sure the flanges are straight and true.
