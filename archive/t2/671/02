my heat system was hosed also, went to check the duct from rear to front
and it crumbled to dust in my hands, the HE were shot etc etc etc...
finally decided it wasn't worth the effort to restore the stock heat.  but
still wanted heat, so designed a totally new heat system around a gas
heater.  use A/C blowers to recirculate the heat from under the dash, to a
heater mounted under the front where an A/C condenser used to be located
then back into the front part of the heat system.  since I recirculate the
air it stays warm and it doesn't have to come from the back of the bus.
keeps at least the front part nice and comfortable. since I don't even
have seats in the rear I have no idea if any heat is getting back there
but don't really care either.
