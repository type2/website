VW sometimes literally scraps perfectly good parts, by the trailerload, that
they consider to be "end-of-life."  I think if we knew of the massive
quantities of incredibly rare Bus stuff that VW simply threw away over the
years, we'd all cry. On very rare occasions the parts find their way into
the pipeline quite by accident, probably because they were overlooked or
mistakenly transferred when the time came to scrap them, and were stumbled
on later by someone who knew their value and sent them back into the pipline
in some "unofficial" manner.  I know a guy in Germany who used to get
Westfalia stuff that way. He was a friend of the one-time owner of
Westfalia, so he had connections. Every once in a while, someone would call
him to say they were about to scrap another trailerload of parts, and give
him a chance to take them before they were destroyed. Unfortunately, often
95% of it really was junk, i.e. half of a kit (where the other required
pieces had already been scrapped), or some obscure trim piece that simply
never wears out.  But every once in a while there was a gem or two mixed in.

So my guess is that the matching right side heat exchangers were scrapped
years ago. Of course, you never know for sure. They could turn up someday,
forgotten in storage in some obscure warehouse almost anywhere in the world
that Volkswagen does business. Even if so, they could very well simply be
scrapped then, if nobody present at the time appreciated their value. But
more likely they're already long gone. (Actually I did find about a dozen
N.O.S. right side ones several years ago, but they went fast.)
