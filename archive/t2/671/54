Subject: RE: [T2] Brake diagnostic

My experience on my first 71 that steered one direction while braking was 
that it was a front brake hose semi clogged up, that maybe what you are 
experiencing. When I replace the lines and bled it helped the problem but 
didn't solve it 100%, i suspect something was aminss with the rear as well.

For grins I would bleed first and see if that makes a diff. then take a look 
at those front hoses. Probably time to adjust rear as well.

Let us know what it turns out to be.
