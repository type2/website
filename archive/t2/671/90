Subject: Re: [T2] Getting rid of old gasoline?

Mark,

 

I've taken gas that is only a couple of years old (in my case, it was from a
gas can for my generator) and put it in one of my other modern vehicles with
an almost full tank of gas - it didn't seem to hurt anything.  One concern
would be to make sure that you filter the gas to make sure you don't add any
solid contaminates to your other vehicles gas tank.
