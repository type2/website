Subject: exhaust systems.

Two of my rust buckets came to me with mufflers bolted directly to the
75-78 heat exchangers, or what was left of them, anyway. The third
appears to be the stock non-catalytic converter exhaust system. I'm
going to try to make do with the stock 75-78 heat exchangers for the
present. I am considering tuning the air/fuel with a wide band guage.

I'm concerned about fuel economy and long term engine reliability 
primarily.

Am I better served to stay with the stock system (crossover, u
connector, etc.) or will an aftermarket muffler which bolts directly to
the exchangers be a better choice? 

If the latter, where should I install the bung for the wideband gauge 
and, are there brands/sources list members recommend for the 
aftermarket mufflers?

Thanks in advance for your experiences, annecdotes and recommendations,

jack
