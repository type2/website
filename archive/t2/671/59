Subject: Volks Authority

For people in the San Jose, CA area I just found out that Volks Authority is shutting down. They are actually moving to a new location in Mountain View but won't be open to the public as Ray is going to be working exclusively on the owner's (Mark) vintage VW collection.

These guys were super friendly and helpful to me on too many occasions to count.

They are shutting the doors Fri at 12 noon so stop by if you have a chance.
