Subject: 78 vw bus axel support

Hi,
I'm wondering if anyone out there has a front sub-frame support for my 78
VW bus.  It is the piece that supports the axles and suspension on the
buses.  It has rusted through and is now undrivable.  If anyone can help
me out please email me at nspadafo(-at-)oswego.edu.

Thanks!
Nate
