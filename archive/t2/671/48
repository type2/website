Subject: Bending fuel line

Try your local auto parts or ACE hardware they sell benders that are similar
to a screen door spring for bending tubing. Just slip the tubing in the
proper sized spring and slowly bend it to your required angle.
Sometimes you can clamp the tubing to a heavy pipe at the center point of
your bend and pull  the tubing to the proper bend from each end.
