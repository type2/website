Subject: Warmer westy winters.

Hi Volks,

This past weekend my friend Adam Narraway stopped by with his 68 westy 
so we could gang up for what has become our annual "Last Minute 
Shopping" expedition. While he was at the house he mentioned his bus 
was in need of a sunvisor, and since I have about 6 spares I gave him a 
matched set out of my stash.

While we were rooting around in the garage digging out the sunvisors, 
Adam spied out the headliner section from our 77 sunroof bus. He 
recognised the shape, and asked if that was being used. Since I wasn't 
planning on using it (the headliner section is torn and dirty, I told 
him it was his for the taking if he wanted it. He planned to use it to 
help seal the drafts from the pop-top on his 68, which now wears a 
gigantic sportsmobile roof instead of the original 68 pop-top.

It fits perfectly. Now all we need is a set of sunroof rails for it to 
slide in. Anybody got a set handy? This solution seals the 68 westy 
roof opening nicely, and will look stock once Adam refurbishes the 
headliner.

For those with a 68-72 westy, this might be the way to go if you need a 
better way to seal the drafts from the pop-top.


Happy trails,
