Subject: More Parking Brake Cable/Brake Backing Plate Questions...

Same vehicle as before, 1969 Westfalia.

I think I know what I need to do here, but I just want some reassurance.

I know that the cable passes through the port pictured below, but is it part of the cable itself? 
Is this port part of the backing plate?

If so, it looks like I'll need to drill/punch/pull out the remnants of the old cable before I can
go about cleaning up the backing plate and replacing the cable.

Does anyone have a good picture of a good backing plate and what the end of the parking brake
cable looks like (the end that passes through the backing plate and attaches to the brake lever)? 
All the parts from my bus are so rusted and corroded and I don't have a real good idea of what all
this should look like when it's in working order.
