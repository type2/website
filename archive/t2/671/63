Subject: RE: [T2] a dumb question about front vents

With the front vent totally closed not much air should be coming through at 
all or that has been my experience. They are controlled by the blue levers 
(the blue bits probably broke off decades ago if like my buses). Also you 
can control the interior vents and shut those as well.

On mine the warm air comes up by your feet in those vents and right under 
the window and that's controled with the lever behind the ebrake arm.
