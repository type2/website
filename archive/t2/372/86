Good report, Tom- just a few suggestions:
An existing endplay can be checked as installed for limit without
disassembly.
The preferred repair is to start with two shims, and calculate the third.
A full stack might be too much, and crush the thrust bearing with torque.
An accurate dial indicator can read the full dimension with no shims.
