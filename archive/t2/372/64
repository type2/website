Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Line Size, Please

Since I was thinking these lines were 8mm I ended up using 5/16" ID
high-pressure hose which is .0025" smaller than 8mm but .0345" larger than
the 7mm ID hose that I'm now thinking is correct.  Since the hose that was
there has been there 22 years maybe I'll get the correct hose when I replace
it in 20 years or so!
