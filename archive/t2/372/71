"Adriablau", or "Adriatic (Sea) blue". It's the same color that a lot of
pool liners are painted.
I saw a can of Adriablau VW paint for sale on eBay not too long ago. There
was a can of that, and a can of Sealing Wax Red. Adriablau is my personal
favorite color for VWs and I have two that color...matching!
