Subject: Re: inverter

I must have them mixed up. As Jasan said in his message that the stock 
component was a converter. I was looking at an inverter for a solar panel 
application. So I could run 120vAC appliances when not hooked up to shore 
power. That way the panels would still charge and I could have my 120vAC too. 
At least thats the way I see it, but I'm no electrician.
