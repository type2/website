This got me interested so I just checked to make shure this was the correct
manual. It is. It is made by Phillips,
model PC-151-MR-2. It is "designed to handle a maximum continuous 12 volt DC
demand (load) of 15 AMPS". As Karl stated it only runs the fridge and
charges the auxiliary battery when connected to shore power.
