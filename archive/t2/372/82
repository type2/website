From the Bus Depot:

Wheel Cylinder, front left ('64-70 Bus) $11.95  211 611 069C OR
Wheel Cylinder, Left Front, 64-70 Bus $39.95  211 611 069C
Wheel Cylinder, Right Front, 64-70 Bus $39.95  211 611 070C
Wheel Cylinder, Right Front, 64-70 Bus $11.95  211 611 070C OR

Gary in a con artist.  As a matter of fact, based on my own experience, I'd
say 87.32% of shops with the name "The Bugg Shop" are straight rip-off
