Subject: carb cleaner

So Im rebuilding my dellorto duals, using parts cleaner and its doing OK. I 
cant seem to be able to get the brownish antique look off though, and 
suggestions. Is there a better chemical cleaner to dip these in, I also tried 
carb cleaner from the local parts store. Thanks Dylan
