How long are you letting the parts soak in the
cleaner? I had a set that I let stay in the cleaner
over the weekend (almost 3 days). This removed the old
varnish. Make absolutely sure taht there are no ruber
or plastic pieces left in the parts to be cleaned. I
made that mistake once. :(

I used a Dremel tool with a wire brush to clean up the
outside of the carbs and to clean out the fuel
reservoir tanks inside the carbs. I was just careful
not to scratch up any sealing surgaces with it.

Good Luck and have a great day!
