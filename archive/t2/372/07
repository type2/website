Does anyone have a picture of the front of their 75-78 engine with all the 
tin and exhaust in place?  I'm trying to locate a piece of tin and having a 
difficult time finding it.  I've got a 79 camper with heat exchangers that 
are identical to a 74 except for the square ports.  My exhaust does not 
exit toward the front of the bus and do a 180 and then go back to the 
rear.  The tin pieces I keep getting (I've bought 2 so far, both incorrect) 
are for the left side of the engine and the bottom plate has a half moon 
opening and it screws to the mid plate (also with a half moon opening.)  I 
assume these 2 half moon openings combine to  form a circle through which 
the exhaust pipe passes toward the front of the bus before it turns around 
to go toward the back.  I don't need this type of tin and I can't seem to 
explain this adequately.  All I need is the tin piece that is just above 
the bottom plate.  (without a half moon opening.)  It's number 32 in the 
following pic:

   Oh, I also need number 10 (for left side).   Am I totally confused 
here?  tx, greg
