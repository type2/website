While were on this subject, does anyone know if the galley light above the
sink runs through the converter? Just wondering because on the motorhome I
used to own all of the lights would run off of shore power when connected.
It would be nice to have a couple more lights wired up to the converter and
not have to worry about draining the batteries. I wonder, would the stock
converter be able to handle the extra AMPS?
