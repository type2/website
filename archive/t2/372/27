NAPA and any glass shop can sell you urethane glass sealant in a caulking 
tube. $15 or so. Do not use silicone."


My .02-
I have used marine silicone ($5) with good results IE no leaking years
later. The question I have is why is it leaking? When you put the window
seal in was the metal all rotted? If using silicone, (and I am sure any
window sealant) make sure to clean the rubber and glass with alcohol to get
a good seal.
