Me too. Weird trend... I've been VERY careful not to get them mixed up. I 
plan to replace them both to make them standard.

That's after I repair all the hoses. I tried to start my bus last week and 
it backfired. Consequently it blew every hose off the intake side....

Funny to me and scared the dickens out of my 3 year old boy and the dog.
