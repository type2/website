Subject: Woodstock - VWs

Just thought I'd mention this,

	I have this really awesome video of the Jimmy Hendrix performance at
Woodstock. It's completely in stereo, crystal clear quality professional
video recording from the bottom of the stage (not from the crowd). I got it
on LaserDisc for like $5 dollars at a used CD store.

In any case, the first 10 minutes of the video was panning over the people
at the concert, the parking area, etc, and all the hippies (some nude). I
counted at LEAST... at LEAST 30 some odd Volkswagen Busses. In nearly every
scene, there was a VW Bus, whether it was the old school ones, or one of the
Bay Window busses like I've got.
