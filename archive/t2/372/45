I just bought my 78 Westy a few months ago and most of the original paper
work and manuals came with it. The manual that I have for the converter says
that it is made by Phillips (B-W manufacturers Inc). Now I am not sure if
this is the correct manual since I have not taken the wooden box off that
covers the converter to verify the model number. If you would like I could
scan the four page manual I have and send it to you.
