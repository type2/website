Hello,

That would be me. I ended up using a course barrel
wire brush on an angle grinder to remove the stubborn
bits of foam that I could not peal off. I remember it
being time consuming. Try to peal off as much vinyl as
you can first. It has been some time ago since I did
it. I most likely used paint stripper to remove the
remaining glue and paint. be prepared to weld and or
fill up the extra holes in the dash. Good Luck!

Regards,

David Kelly
