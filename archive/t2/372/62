Subject: re: New glove box

Chris,

Having replaced my glove compartment with the plastic unit from
BD last summer, I can tell you this:
It WILL fit, but only from beneath the dash, with the metal
retainer removed... you have to kinda-squeeze
the compartment to get it in there...

The REAL PITA is getting the strap back on.  A tough angle to
work, getting that screw in.  IIRC, it took me
some two hours of heavy sweating and cursing before I finally had
it right.
