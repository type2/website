Subject: Re: [T2] Name this color, please

I did not say it was Neptune..... I said it was Niagra Blue for 72.

Here is what I wrote:
"From the 68-71 parts manual:
Aug 68 to July 70, it was called Brillant Blue. L 50 H, Cloud White roof L 581
From Aug 70, it was called Niagra Blue.  53D  Pastell White roof, L 90 D

This site contradicts the 71 and 72 factory brochures I have:
http://www.wolfsburgwest.com/colors/7172bus.htm
Neptune Blue L 50K was up to July 68, although my 68 and 69 brochures show Neptune Blue. My 70 and 71
brochures shows Brillant Blue. My 72 brochure shows Niagra Blue."
 
> that is not neptune blue. neptune blue is darker.
 My old 69 was that color now if I could find the birth certificate...
