Subject: replacing Solex 30 PICT with 34 PICT

Hello all-

I am new to the list here.  I have a question that I haven't been able to
find a clear answer to.

I suspect that the Solex 30 PICT-3 carb on my single port 1600 needs to be
rebuilt.  I have a spare rebuilt 34 PICT-3 but I don't know if the two are
interchangable without any significant modifications.  Can anyone clear
this up for me?  Thanks in advance.
