Richard and Greg,

Yup, I may have the same problem on mine, i got some pieces yesterday, but 
haven't checked them out yet.

Richard, looks like you have the tin that Greg *doesn't want*.  First one 
on the left of your pic from the rear(front if it were still in the car).
Looks to me like it has the 1/2 moon in it.  And the bottom plate has the
1/2 moon to match.

Greg, I think you want 72-74(not 75) so you get it without the 1/2 moon 
stuff.

Karl could probably set us both right....

Cheers, dave
