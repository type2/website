Subject: carb cleaner

So Im rebuilding my dellorto duals, and have a parts cleaner bin with parts 
cleaner chemical which seems to be doing alright but I can't seem to get some 
of the brownish antique baked on stuff off, is there a chemical cleaner to 
buy that will bring these back to almost new metal look. I did try carb 
cleaner from the local parts store but that does about as much as the parts 
cleaner. thanks
