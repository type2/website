Subject: New glove box

OK,,bought the new glove box (plastic one) to replace
the broken-up original cardboard one....

my question is, how do you install the thing??/

ive taken the glove box door off but it doesnt want to
gently slide into place....and if you remove the metal
strap and silde it under the dash it doesnt seem to
fit either


any suggestions?

thanks in advance
