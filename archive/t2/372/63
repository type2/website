Subject: Rear bearing maintenance??

So who here regularly re-packs their rear wheel bearings?
How silly would it be to add a breather and drain plug and run a heavy gear
oil in there?
I was planning to install a grease nipple into the hub and two 'bleed'
points between the bearings and the seals so I could add some grease each
service, but adding the bleed points in the right spot is proving difficult.
Any better suggestions?
Thanks,
