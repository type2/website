Subject: RE: [T2] at my wits end

Greetings-

Perhaps unrelated -- perhaps not -- years ago I drove a Beetle Convertible
with a whopping 36 HP motor.  After about 1/2 hour or so at
close-to-highway speeds, I would lose power.  If I pulled off the road and
sat for about 1/2 hour, the car would start and I could continue another
1/2 hour.  While stopped, if I tried to start the car before it was
"ready", it would sound flooded and/or out-of-gas.

What was the problem?  Junk in the fuel line.  At "cruise" speed, it would
slowly work its way upward, eventually closing off the flow of gas.  Then,
at full stop, it would slowly settle out and I was going again.

I cleaned the fuel lines and all was well.

-David

Hello

I shall have to start from the beginning

I have a 1600cc twinport campervan, with a new Vege Engine that has covered
about 3000 miles.  I have set the valves , points and timing and everything
seems correct.

My initial problem was that after around an hours constant driving i would
lose power and then the van would jolt violently, it felt very much like
fuel
starvation and the fuel pump didn't seem very effective so I changed it.
Still the problem persisted.

On one journey i decided to swap the coil as I felt it was possible that it
was breaking down under pressure when it got hot, on doing so i noticed
there
was a wire from the coil that i had no idea where it went, the live wire and
the wire to the distributor were in place no problem.  The bus would then
start but did not idle.  I read in my VW's for idiots book that on some
carbs
that there was a wire from the carb cut off valve to the coil but this was
already connected to the automatic choke (that I have disabled).

So my first question and most important one is can some one please confirm
where the three wires from the coil should go (as I thought there should
only
be two) and where should the automatic choke be connected?.  This should at
least get me back on a level playing field to investigate the original
problem!!!

Secondly with the timing set correctly, the valves set up the points set
and a
carb that all the jets have been cleaned thoroughly with an air jet...why
am I
still losing all power on any journey of a decent size?

Your help would be gratefully appreciated!!
