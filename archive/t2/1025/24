Subject: Outside skin for dog leg - late baywindow

Has anyone actually installed just the outside skin on a late bay dog leg?
Here is the part in question. I'm wondering if there is a lip all the way
around to allow welding or panel adhesive to be used? My tired 54 yr. old eyes
can't see if there is one from this picture?
