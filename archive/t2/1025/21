Courtesy of Mike S, here is my one time 71 Gullwing, Zander.

This was how he looked after being well used by one of my kiddos in BC for
many years.  When Anton announced he was selling MY LOANED bus, I went and
brought it home.  Now after derusting and repainting, feels like my baby
again.   Am currently installing  zbed, cupboards, et al.   Do wish Winnipeg
had a group of DYIers.

The seats have  enclosed   speakers, so I can hear  whatever without
blasting the surrounding vehicles.  Really enjoy Serius when travelling in
US of A.

Ginny with thanks to Mike, Jamie and the other readers.
