Subject: Re: [T2] Convert Sliding Door to Hinged (project)

Wern't there some Argentinain or Brazillain bays that had hinged doors as 
stock ? I think they were Bay to the back of the front seats and Split for 
the rest of the van.

I can't find a picture online at the moment but I'm sure someone must have 
one.
