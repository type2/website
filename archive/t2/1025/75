Subject: External Oil Cooler install tips for 78 VW Bus

Hi All,

Some time ago I bought some parts from bus boys to add an external cooler to
the bus. I have the oil filter adapter, remote oil filter, oil thermostat, and
oil cooler.

I think it's finally time to do my install. While, I can reinvent the wheel, I
wanted to ask for any tips on installation, placement, etc. I was hoping to
find a nice how-to writeup on the web, but my searching didn't turn anything
up.

Any suggestions appreciated.

Thanks,
Mark

'78 "Blue Bus"
