a little bit of ingenuity goes a long way ;)

With a highly modified 6" C clamp(t-bar removed, one end ground away, 
and swivel removed), an allen socket, and a 3/16 socket, I was able to 
press out the hinge pins.  It was neat cuz I'd put some pressure on it, 
walk away, and POP, it came loose :)

Sweet.. now I'm going to pop off the other pair and get this door 
mounted.. yay!

Thanks for all the help!

Mike
