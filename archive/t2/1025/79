Subject: driving out hinge pins - passenger door compatibility

Hey Everyone,
I have a 78 w/ a jacked up passenger door.  I have another passenger 
door from a 76, but I noticed that the hinges are different.  One screws 
into something, and the other is meant to be screwed into.

So, I wanted to know if it's possible to drive the hinge pins out and 
swap the pertinent parts of the hinge over to the new door - has anyone 
done this before?  I tried banging on the hinge pin, but it didn't 
budge.  I thought about heat next...  Otherwise, do I have to go find a 
78 door for my bus?

Thanks!
Mike
