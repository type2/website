Subject: FW: [T2] at my wits end

Thanks for all you help guys...I'll answer a few of the questions Not
electronic ignition...i have a Solex PICT 34 carb, 009 distributor and blue
coil...... If I pull to the side of the road she ticks over fine and revs like
a dream, put once it is back under load again she will start to faulter, and
yes she really jolts and is totally undriveable Somebody did tell me that in
the tank there is what the refered to as a "sock filter" nthat when gets worn
can block the fuel supply from the tank, but there appears plenty of fuel in
the system so cant see thius being the case. Aslo I have one plastic filter
from the tank to the pump and another from the pump to the carb.  Is this
correct or could the filter between pump and carb be causing me a problem?
Thanks again chaps I appreciate all you input
