Subject: Re: [T2] driving out hinge pins - passenger door compatibility

Mike asked:

 I have a 78 w/ a jacked up passenger door.  I have another passenger door
from a 76, but I noticed that the hinges are different.  One screws into
something, and the other is meant to be screwed into.

So, I wanted to know if it's possible to drive the hinge pins out and
swap the pertinent parts of the hinge over to the new door - has anyone done
this before?  I tried banging on the hinge pin, but it didn't budge.  I
thought about heat next...  Otherwise, do I have to go find a 78 door for my
bus?

Your 76 hinges are the early style which were up to vin 2x6 2126 631.

Good luck getting the old pins out!

Bus Depot sells a kit for each door:

You will need both style hinge halves to do this. I assume you do.
