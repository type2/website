Subject: Plugging the Throttle Plate Hole in the 34PICT-3 Carb

From Nate's Air-Cooled Tech Pages:

Does anyone know if plugging the throttle plate hole as reccommended above  
when using the 34PICT-3 with an 009 distributor would be appropriate when  one 
is using the stock (SVDA type) distributor (my applications are a 71 bus and  
a 71 beetle.)?
 
My theory is that my engine's in these two vehicles both have some miles on  
them, and perhaps the idle speed vacuum isn't all it should be, thus,  
insufficient idle circuit fuel flow because of insufficient vacuum at the  
progression ports, as the above article states.
