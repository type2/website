Thank you all for your replys.

Courtney, the bra is for a 68 bus. Chris Dreike, that's the webpage I've 
refered in the original post. I was looking for a manufacturer like this 
one, where I could chose the colors if possible, instead of a plain black 
like the Colgan Custom ones. The bus is painted with a white color and 
Pacific blue L-398.
Bra's should only be mounted when on the road (driving) and they should be 
off when parked for a long period to prevent moisture, dust, etc to set 
between the front of the bus and the inner side of the bra. However, I would 
prefer one without major wrinkles, if possible.

I would like also to use this message to say thank you to Greg Potts and his 
westfakia for being a inspiration to make an upgrade to my 68 bus.
It was cuted and fitted with a wood made poptop in 1970 by my father, but 
I've decided to change it for a Westfalia fiberglass poptop in 2005 after 
seing Greg's pictures in 2004. Although I used a different method to do it, 
the pictures gave me the final push.

Best regards from Portugal,
Joao
