The extra wire from the positive side of the coil was possibly to power
an electric fuel pump at some time - that's a pretty common place to
pull power for one.  And if I remember correctly on my 73 there was a
wire from the coil to power the backup lights, but it's been years and I
may be mistaken on that one.

BTW, if you run an electric fuel pump from your coil and mistakenly
attach the power wire to the negative side your bus will start and run,
but anytime you use up the reserve gas in your float chamber the pulsing
pump can't supply enough and you stall.  Restarts just fine and runs,
but when you take off it stalls again.  Ask me how I know :)

Cheers.
