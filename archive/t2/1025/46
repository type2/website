Subject: Baywindow Bra

Hello to you all.

I'm looking for a good quality baywindow bra. I've found a picture at
thesamba's gallery from a split bus with one mounted. I've sended an email to
the split owner and he was kind enough to send me the manufacturers webpage.
However, they only make them to be used in splitsbuses....
Although this is "off-topic" here's the picture of the split bus:

I'm attaching this link because the bra looks excellent. There are seams
around the head light holes and blinker holes. The finishings are great and if
fits amazingly well without wrinkles.
Can anyone send me a webpage from a US manufacturer for baywindow bras with
this kind of quality?...

Thank you and best regards to you all.
From Portugal, Joao.
