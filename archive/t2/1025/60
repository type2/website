Matthew,

I expect you have a fuel delivery problem.
Try removing both filters and see how it runs. Maybe one of them is a little 
clogged up. You might have fuel, but flow could be low if its clogged and 
your description is pointing that way.

Access to the "filter sock" in the tank is from below. Helps if the tank is 
empty, or you can drain it into a bucket that you can pour back into the 
tank later.     Remember, safety first with gasoline.     The fitting on the 
bottom of the tank unscrews, righty tighty, lefty loosy. Pull out the 
fitting and the sock should come with it. You can try cleaning it or just 
install a new one. Available at various VW supply houses.

Let us know how it turns out.
Chris

 Thanks for all you help guys...I'll answer a few of the questions Not
 electronic ignition...i have a Solex PICT 34 carb, 009 distributor and blue
 coil...... If I pull to the side of the road she ticks over fine and revs 
like
 a dream, put once it is back under load again she will start to faulter, 
and
 yes she really jolts and is totally undriveable Somebody did tell me that 
in
 the tank there is what the refered to as a "sock filter" nthat when gets 
worn
 can block the fuel supply from the tank, but there appears plenty of fuel 
in
 the system so cant see thius being the case. Aslo I have one plastic filter
 from the tank to the pump and another from the pump to the carb.  Is this
 correct or could the filter between pump and carb be causing me a problem?
 Thanks again chaps I appreciate all you input
