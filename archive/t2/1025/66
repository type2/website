I have seen surprisingly few of these conversions over the last 25 years.
I've talked with a few owners and they didn't do anything special to put
them in.  They seem a little heavy without a rear mount, but no one spoke of
problems.

I have seen way more uprights in type 4 buses than the other way around.
