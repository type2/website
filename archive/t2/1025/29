Subject: ZDDP, the oil fart, and frustration

I live in Calgary, a city of  greater than a million people and centre 
of the Canadian oil industry.
Do you think I can find Brad Penn 20W-50, Swepco 306, or even a bottle 
of STP (red) oil treatment??
Noooooooo.
Anyone have a western canadian answer to the question of what oil to use 
now that API SM/CJ-4 formulations have left our flat tappet engines 
naked and unarmed?
For those who missed it read:
