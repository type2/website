Yes, sorry.. I didn't have a close look.  I went out to the garage to 
try and bang them out but yeah.. didn't budge at all.  I tried heating 
it up, too.  I think I'm going to have to figure some way to press it out.

I'm wondering how their system works.. regardless, I'll put an order 
through for them ;)

Any tips on getting those pins out?

Thanks!
