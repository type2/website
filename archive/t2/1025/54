me too,  any chance of somehow extending the slider runway further 
back? Also you can have small shelves on inside of a hinged door.   imo 
2 doors are better than one big one.

ah well, use a porta potti. Its a luxury  not to be without. Even in 
daytime you can sit on it and stare out the windows while others make 
their way to some disgusting restroom, or worse yet, the bushes!
Anything as an overnight p-pot.  OTOH how many campers have concern for 
others nowadays ;-(

>  latch that draws itself shut with a motor -
that would be nice, but sort of goes beyond the VW primitive spirit 
imo. (course we have the porta-potti. so my opinion doesnt count for 
much here!


>  so that the bottom half went down

with steps!  super fun idea. I loved those disappearing door' videos 
someone posted last week.

how about a dutch-door (you may know as a stable door) . Security, 
privacy, but still get air, and easy to put the shopping bags over.

but these, along with the gull-wing are really not practical when you 
think that the door must almost always be closed, from 2-legged and 4 
legged varmits.
