Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pumps

Anyone have their Bently handy? Does it contain the spec for the length of
the fuel pump push rod? I would check that it is within spec. Expansion of
the case would effectively move the pump away from the cam. If the rod is a
little short, it could work when cold but not when hot. Changing the pump
would not fix the problem.
