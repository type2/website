Subject: Type 1 engine into bay bus

Hi everyone, just seeing if anyone has successfully installed a type 1 engine
in a bay window bus. I have a 73 bus that I have a 1776 type 1 engine that I
would like to put in it. Any major problems other then tins? I can fab tins or
buy the fiberglass ones from England.  Any pics of the completed mod... Any
negatives .. Thanks in advance!!!
