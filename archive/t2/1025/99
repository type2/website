Subject: Coil hookup/trans /motor bolts?

On my 74 westy, with Petronix, does the red wire from dizzy go to "+" on coil
and black go to "--"?  Also those long bolts that connect trans to motor, that
have one side cut off, are they the ones that go on front side of trans
bellhousing top through engine case to pick up nut on rear side of engine
block?  And install starter onto the one existing stud, then install other one
later, or wait til motor is in to install both?  Also, my Fuel Flo electric
pump fell off of workbench and broke off the 'out' nipple, should I just be
able to epoxy a replacement in there?  Thanks.
