Subject: Re: [T2] front brake hoses

Jeremiah said:


they failed me because the front brake lines had
cracks in the plastic/rubber part of the hoses.  from what i can tell
these hoses on goethe's 77 body are steel that is then protected by an
outer layer of plastic sheathing.  is this the case?  if so, could
anyone in mo tell me whether cracks in the outer sheathing would be
reason enough to fail?

They are rubber hoses. Cracks mean they are OLD. Replace them.
