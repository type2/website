Subject: ok, here is where i am at now..

ok, have seen a few of you posting, yes, my tank did have a sock, it has a
hex nut, i assume that means my bus was probably always carb'd.. dunno why i
have that strange electrical socket thingy in the back attached to the top
of the engine bay but whatever lol.. anyways.. i cleaned the sock, hooked up
an electric pump, I am still having same issue. I am leaning towards a carb
problem now though, I know the needles are fine, but i dont know if the
floats are correctly done, when i rebuilt them last, i left them where they
were and they were fine... i can leave gas in the  carbs and take tops off
and floats are floating.. maybe they are getting too much gas through i
really dont know.. but the carbs i would be buying are off of a running bus
up in washington, so i assume they will be fine, but i am prepared with a
rebuild kit if necessary, at least they would be the proper carbs. One
strange oddity with the type 3 carbs i am running though.. noticed a screw
from the side missing that makes me thing that may have been start of it,
but i dont know how long its been missing off of both carbs, but if i take
the butterflys off, the venturi wants to come straight out the bottom, i
assume those screws were to make the venturis stay, i put some tin screws in
there to make they stay, but i dont know if thats creating some sort of
crazy vacuum wierdness at accelleration because i can see around the venturi
lookin into the carb, around one edge.. dont know if that coule be problem
or what, but before i buy those carbs from that guy up in washington if he
ever e-mails me back... a local engine guy here has a set of kadrons we are
going to throw on there on tuesday and see if they resolve the problem... if
so, then i know im clear to buy the carbs.. any and alll input is
appreciated. I really appreciate you guys helping me brainstorm
