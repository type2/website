Subject: Re: [T2] RE Gullwing 

Well, gee... I'm the original poster, but I don't
think gull wings are the way to go for me! There is
the advantage of there always being an "awning" when
the door is open, I guess! It won't work for me
because of all the additional clearance required.

I am considering a single-wide hinged door instead of
a slider, but only if I can do it so that it isn't a
major bastard. I'd like to have more fixed space
either at the fron or at the rear of the existing
doorway, but mostly I don't like awakening everybody
in adjoining campsites when I get up in the middle of
the night. The rummbling I think I can minimize, but
the slam it takes to close the door, even when being
gentle and pushing inward on the back part - well, I
haven't decided yet.

Maybe I can adapt a Cadillac trunk lid type latch that
draws itself shut with a motor - I'm just idea
shopping right now. The gull wing would be neat if it
split so that the bottom half went down and the top
half went up - but I guess that would be a clamshell.

If you have any ideas, drop me a note! - BaH
