Subject: Re: [T2] Carb or fuel pump?!?!?

You need a vacuum Gage it also is a fuel pressure
Gage....If manual pump pumps above 3-1/2 psi...I would
look at the carb float valve being stuck.(may need to
be cleaned and new kit installed)...Use the vacuum
gage to see how much vacuum and if needle is
steady....check the cheap stuff first....T
