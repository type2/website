Subject: Engine problems... Solved hopefully

Hey guys.. Jason here.. 72 Westy, 2.0 Solid lifters/cam.  ok some of  
you may remember i had this problem where it ran fine at idle, popped  
and farted through carb at any acceleration.. well i think i have the  
problem solved.. took the van to a local engine builder guy in my car  
club.. He was just as stumped as i was.. compression ok etc.. timing  
good.. carbs good.. all looking good. so, I pulled the valve cover off  
of the affected side.. and i found that the intake valve on the  
passenger side, cyl 2. The spring was all black, and covered with  
carbon and the other springs were nice and shiny and nice.. and i  
could turn the spring by hand.. which i assumed was totally not good..  
i pulled the head.. everything looked ok on the inside.. had him  
replace the spring and pressure test the head.. i am going to go over  
and finish putting all the electrical etc back together this  
afternoon.. hopefully thats all my problem was... cross your fingers  
for me ;)

Jason
