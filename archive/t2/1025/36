Subject: Carb or fuel pump?!?!?

Ok guys.. so.. Got my engine back together today with the new valve spring
in place.. runs a little better.. but im still having the same problem.. as
soon as you accelerate it revvs to a point.. then.. just stays there.. not
sure here.. im thinking maybe my old stock fuel pump is crappy??? not sure
though cause after shutting van off, i can loosen a hose to a carb... and
there is pressure there.. enough to spray a little out.. so im thinking its
either a fuel pump issue or a carb problem.. but on a note here that my help
in diagnosis.. I can.... pump the gas pedal.. and get more acceleration out
of it.. ie: im enriching the fuel output.. maybe my carbs are just shot??
let me know what you think.. I might be purchasing an entire stock system
from a guy on thesamba for 120 bucks manifolds, distribution pipe and all.
correct non emissions 72 carbs. anyways.. any and all help is appreciated.
