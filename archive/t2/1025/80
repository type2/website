I think once you have the Kadrons on there you will want to keep  them.  You 
can take the time to clean and rebuild yours and make sure all  the parts are 
there, but make sure you have good bushings and no leakage.  
I wouldn't think type 3 carbs would be jetted for your type 4? 
 
while your head deep in engine compartment start with valve adjust then  
compression test to full tune-up to rule out something as simple as a foul  plug.
 
Hope this helps
