I've always wanted to go the gullwing route.   You'd have to  
duplicate the way the rear door of the bus opens up, but have the  
hinges beefier, and add hydraulic lifters like in the hatchbacks.

I've seen one done this way in a photo, may have been on the Samba  
site.  It was a VW van being used for an espresso shop.  With the  
side door lifted, it doubled as a sun shade.

If you went the single hinged route on the side of the door, you'd  
have a large hunk of metal sticking out.  You's also want to look at  
how the hinges on the back window work.

You might want to hinge it suicide style so your forward passenger  
wouldn't have to deal with the door sticking out right behind them.   
Also with both the side door and front passenger door open, you'd  
have a lot larger open area.
