Subject: front brake hoses

took gothe to a mechanics shop to get the mo state safety inspection
done. goethe failed.  this shop works on my wife's crv and my diesel
work truck.  they do not specialize in acvw.

among other things they failed me because the front brake lines had
cracks in the plastic/rubber part of the hoses.  from what i can tell
these hoses on goethe's 77 body are steel that is then protected by an
outer layer of plastic sheathing.  is this the case?  if so, could
anyone in mo tell me whether cracks in the outer sheathing would be
reason enough to fail?  if you live outside of mo and for some reason
know mo's safety inspection laws i would love to hear from you as
well.


tia,
