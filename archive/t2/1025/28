Yes. it latched and locked properly.  Not good though for a canopy/tent.
Sticks out too far and touches canvas.  Still, wished I hadn't changed back to
a slider.  Bottom of this door was fairly rotted on bottom so a new door was
the answer anyway.   ( a non-rusted west coast door, not a new door, just new
to Zander)
