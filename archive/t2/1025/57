Jason asked:


ok guys.. had info on how to check tank sock, and i even hooked up an
electric fuel pump to the bus.. same problems.. runs great at idle..
have to pump carbs to go anywhere.. revvs to certain point then starts
popping etc. and wont revv any higher.. i have done valves, timing, points,
plugs, fuel delivery system.. all seems to be pointing to the carbs now?? i
know a guy on thesamba has an exact set for my bus i guess i will be
ordering... unless you guys have any other ideas??

What year is your bus?

The sock is on the outlet fitting.  #5 here:

But if you have a dual carb type 4 engine bus, the tanks do not have them.
Follow the gas line that comes out the bottom and goes to the fuel pump.
Look at the metal tube coming out of the tank. Is it welded to the tank?  Or
is there a hex fitting holding it to the tank?

Welded?  NO sock.

Hex fitting?  Sock.

Look at the pic in the link I sent. The tank in the top half has no sock.

If it is welded AND you are sure it is lack of flow:  you will need to
remove the tank.
