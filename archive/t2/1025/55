Subject: ok.. so i have tried everything..

ok guys.. had info on how to check tank sock, and i even hooked up an  
electric fuel pump to the bus.. same problems.. runs great at idle..  
have to pump carbs to go anywhere.. revvs to certain point then starts  
popping etc. and wont revv any higher.. i have done valves, timing,  
points, plugs, fuel delivery system.. all seems to be pointing to the  
carbs now?? i know a guy on thesamba has an exact set for my bus i  
guess i will be ordering... unless you guys have any other ideas??

Jason
