Hello John,
Don't know where your located. Looks like California from your
E-mail address. Anyway to answer your question, there is a web site with
info
on type 4 engines into type 2's go to
http://www.aircooledtech.com/
Scroll down and near the bottom is a section on that subject. The fellow who
operates this web site
recently retired from the Navy and lives here in western Washington state in
Oak Harbor on Whidbey Island.
He operates a VW repair shop dealing in aircooled VW's. He also has a 1965
westy with a type 4 engine
installed. I've seen it run. It really scoots!!! The guys name is Nate and
his shop (located in Anacortes, Washington)
is called ProVolks. You can E-mail him thru his web site. But if you want to
contact him directly his shop phone is
(360) 299-8860
Hope this helps.
Mike Turner
