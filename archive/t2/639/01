Wayne,

And others...this is the only way(to my knowledge) that it was ever set 
up.

Loosen the compressor so that it can slide toward the engine and away from 
the engine.

To get the belt on the pulley, you take the impeller out, slide the belt 
toward the compressor thru the space between the fan shroud and the 
engine.

Put the belt on the pulley(main shaft pulley) and then put the belt on the 
proper groove on the compressor....with the compressor slid closest to the 
engine.

Make sure belt is on both pulleys and then put the impeller back on and 
tighten it up.  Then force the compressor away from the engine(therefore 
tightening the belt and then retighten the bolts on the bottom of the 
compressor and the side so that it is locked in position.

That's all folks!

Cheers, dave
