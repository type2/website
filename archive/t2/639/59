The way I'm going to address this for myself is: Install an air/fuel 
meter and O2 sensor so I can quickly tune lean for the smog test, and 
then quickly go back to normal running adjustment.  I'm also installing 
a CDI ignition system.  I will have to get this all done before June 
2005 (my next smog is due in Aug 2005, and I want to make sure I have 
some time to do it a few times, if necessary, before my registration 
expires).

Never.  It's frozen at the '75 model year as of last month.  Ah-nold 
had a chance to do the right thing for a change, but totally blew it.
