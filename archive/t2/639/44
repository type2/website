Subject: Wheel Bearing Noise

Hi Folks,

Now that I'm driving my Bus with a nice quiet (for an ACVW) engine, I'm 
noticing a fair amount of wheel bearing noise, and was wondering if there 
was a way to fix it.

I replaced both rear bearings in the summer 2003, and replaced both fronts 
in the spring of 2003.  I followed all of the available procedures to the 
letter, including using brass drifts and being careful to avoid scratching 
the new bearings and races.  I have also replaced all 4 CV joints over the 
last 3 years.  I've probably put a total of 15,000 miles on all of the above 
parts, but the noise is still there.  I've been running Bridgestone Dueler 
tires on my Bus since I bought it, and they do not seem to be the source of 
the noise.

Any thoughts on what can cause excessive wheel noise on an otherwise 
mechanically sound Bus?

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.
