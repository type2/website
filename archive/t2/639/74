Subject: Re: [T2] CA smog: we're boned

In the past I have also had success with some practices and things found at 
FLAPS:

1) One of the higher priced fuel system cleanup products like Slick 50 fuel 
additive. (about $8). Add to a tank of gas and drive it off before 
refilling.

2) Some products in the fuel additive dept claim a guarantee you will pass 
emissions. Couldn't hurt to try.

3) Fill up with one of the better grade gasolines that advertises formulated 
for lower emissions, like Chevron. I use premium for smog testing due to 
better consistency in molecule sizes.

4) Change oil in case contaminated with HC's.
