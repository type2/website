Thought I'd pass on some general tips I've used over the years.

Cheap and easy:
Premium gas (John's correct about molecule size)
Oil change the day of test.
New plugs/points/etc. 
Use a bottle brush and scrub out your tailpipe. This prevents the
particle buildup from affecting readings. (I actually passed a
previously failed test after the mechanic did this!)

Not so cheap and easy:
Improve ignition. Going all the way to a CD ignition will make a huge
difference. Especially when you also open up the plug gap as the
ignition manual recommends.
Find a friendly shop with a smog machine that will let you play with
adjustments while hooked up.
Play with tire sizes. If your bus runs cleaner at higher rpm's on the
dyno, then put smaller tires on to change the RPM point they're
smogging you at. Again, this will require a friendly shop that lets
you play.
Add a new catalytic converter. 

These things have all been passed to me by smog mechanics over the years. 

Good luck!
