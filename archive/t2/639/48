Subject: 1.9l Vanagon P&C Blowout Sale

List,

We have some Vanagon 1.9l Piston and Cylinder Sets at a special blowout
price.

These are for 83-85 waterboxer engines. The sets are new, in shelf worn
packaging but the parts are perfect. They are COFAP, made in Brazil.

Price is 220.00 $CAD, which is close to $US 180.00. We have 10 sets and when
they are gone, they are gone. Anyone who buys three or more sets gets free
shipping within continental USA and Canada.

Since I am not a member of the Vanagon list, perhaps someone who is might be
able to forward this message there.
