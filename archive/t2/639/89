That's what it used to be, before last year when they switched to dyno 
testing (at which time they also tightened the standards).

The real screw is the removal of the 30 year rolling exemption.

Let me put a silver lining on this...

Maybe it will create enough demand for parts that there will actually 
be a viable aftermarket for things like stock exhaust components.  I 
think it's just plain silly that things like heat exchangers and 
mufflers are so difficult to find for some model years.

I think any Bus can be made to pass.  It might take a bit of work (and 
a bit of cash), but I'm sure it can be done.

Oh the irony -- we had three things transpire roughly within the same 
time period:

	- Transition to dyno testing, stricter emissions specs.
	- Elimination of the 30-year rolling exemption.
	- Removal of the requirement of n% (I forget what the exact figure 
was) of
	  all new cars sold in CA to be zero-emission by (I forget the exact 
year).

There's a lot of talk around CA about the Central Valley and Inland 
Empire being the worst for air quality... well, in the Valley, 
agriculture accounts for a large amount of the air quality issues... 
emissions from farm equipment are virtually unregulated, and that's 
ignoring things like chemical spraying, etc.  In other places, utterly 
stupid land-use practices require people to drive absurd distances 
between home and work (man, you never want to get stuck in rush-hour 
traffic in San Bernardino or Riverside, or, heck, on the Hollywood 
Freeway in LA, for that matter).

Unfortunately, politicians tend to focus on getting the most / 
expending the least political capital, so they pick on a small group of 
classic car owners in the name of cleaning up the environment rather 
than take on industrial farming interests or take a sane approach to 
land-use planning.
