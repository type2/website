Subject: Re: [T2] Stripping paint the easy way

To get the price of a cab its probably the best thing
to do is call the number and ask.  My friend told me
the charge about $1.50 per pound.  Good if youre only
dipping the body, little expensive if the frame is
done too.  Give them a call cause from what I heard
they are real helpful and do a lot of work for people
restoring cars and such.  

Considering the amount of time it takes to
strip/sand/grind rust this could be a viable
alternative.  The process takes about a week for most
parts and time may be dictated by the amount of volume
they have on hand.  On the other hand when its
finished nothings left except shiny metal while rust,
paint, grease, all gone.  Not sure about its affect on
lead filler but bondo and fiberglass stands no chance.
 They probably use water to neutralize the acid and he
said that they have a spray to inhibit rust that can
be washed off with water.

>>"Question: what does it cost to get a cab - such as
the one shown in the pics - dipped? 

Does it eat out all the fillers? All the leading
that the old cars had? 

Anything done to totally neutralize the acids? I
have heard of rust coming back because the acids
never quite got stopped. 

Anything done to keep the rust at bay short term? I
would worry about a 2 hour drive home and getting
caught in the rain... "
