That's a rational response. Owning a bus is somewhere on the "i" end of 
the rational/irrational spectrum.

But:

As long as (1) your plenum tubes are clean, (2) your EGR opens and 
closes smoothly and is in adjustment, (3) you have a cat installed, (4) 
you haven't accidentally enriched the mixture, and (5) the complete 
exhaust system is tight, including the EGR filter, you should have no 
trouble passing smog. My last test for Peregrine (a '76) show numbers 
WAY below the requirements. The exhaust was so clean, you could durned 
near breath it.

It helps to fill up with gas that's part ethanol, and to make sure the 
engine is fully warmed up before testing.
