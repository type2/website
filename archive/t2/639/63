Subject: Re: [T2] CA smog: we're boned

btw, in the next few months, I will be heading over to the station to
test my bus out on the dyno for kicks.  The reason is I'm curious if a
bus engine running at stoich (held there with the MS) will pass.  If so,
that should be some helpful information for all of you.

The reason I'd test at stoich is because that's the only thing the MS
can hold the mixture to unless I had a wb02 setup.  I'd be surprised if
it wasn't the ideal setup because practically every modern car runs at
stoich at the speeds tested on the dyno.
