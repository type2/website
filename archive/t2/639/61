What disturbs me is that BAR/DMV is sending our vehicles to test only stations which means there is a risk that the tester where you do your adjustment may not "configure" you to pass at the test only station. The only recourse seem to be to err on the lean side of %CO while watching the HC, NOx, etc levels and pray.
