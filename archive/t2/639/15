Stan,  
       This is a very interesting post.  Some years ago in Hemmings, a company 
was offering franchises for this kind of operation... I don't know if they were 
or were not successful; haven't seen anything on them since.  Prob'ly lots of 
enviro-issues to take into account?

For all those in the southeast this might be the place
to clean up the old V-dub parts for painting.  A guy I
know sent me his friends webpage (non-vw) for a
look-see
