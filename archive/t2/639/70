This is truly valuable information. When adjusting my cars, I always 
remembered 1.5% as a benchmark since that is what my Vanagons had to have to 
pass smog. If I got 0.9, I considered myself lucky, and thought as low as I 
could go and still have a positive number was good since theoretically 
anything over 0.0 was not lean and would not damage the engine.

 and overheat bigtime. The combustion chamber of an Otto engine is a MIXTURE 
of
 rich and lean spots, hot and cool spots, etc. It is NOT a mixture of 
perfectly
 mixed air and fuel. THIS is why you need to run richer than "stoic"
 (chemically correct ratio), since your "worst case" A/F mix must be richer
 than 14.7:1, and to accomplish this, you must be richer than that, since 
there
 are LEAN SPOTS in your combustion chamber on every cycle of the engine.
