Somewhat tangental to the current discussion...

I'm interested in fitting my exhaust with an O2 sensor specifically for 
setting the basic mixture.  I'll probably build my own air/fuel meter, 
and I want the O2 sensor installation to be temporary... i.e. I'd like 
to be able to thread a plug into the sensor bung.

I'd also like to see photos of O2 sensor installations, if people have 
them.  I'd prefer to take a sample from all 4 cylinders, and thus after 
the cross-over pipe.

I've gotten the distinct impression that O2 sensors are somewhat 
standardized -- pulling the sensor from a Volvo at the junk yard 
probably cuts the cost of the sensor at least in half.
