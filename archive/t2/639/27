You can thread in a bolt with the right thread size.

On a VW this is too far down the exhaust stream for accurate readings so you
have to take a sample close to one of the exhaust port before the heaterbox.

The narrow band ones are but for the effort you'll want to build and use a
wide-band meter and have to be compatible with the meters. The NTK L1H1
sensor skyrocketed in price which was unfortunate but recently the Bosch LSU
4 was made to work with the various meters and is a far more affordable O2
sensor.
