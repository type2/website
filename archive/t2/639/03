I haven't tried using a heated sensor.  I actually posted this question to
the lists and got fairly nonsensical replies.

I've driven the vehicle many miles at high speed before taking my reading.
Given where the sensor is in the exhaust stream it just doesn't seem
possible it's not getting hot enough.  I'll probably try borrowing a
different voltmeter, just to assure myself that it's not my voltmeter's
fault.
