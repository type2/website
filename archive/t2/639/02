Subject: RE: [T2] Alternator & Regulator '78

That's likely drop caused by the silver socket. I would measure what the
regulator is putting out directly if concerned at all.

....

Hey, I am happy to see 13.2 volts at my special dash board connection 
(silver socket) when I am driving my '78 USA federal non-air
conditioning 
type 2.

But people (Bentley) seem to think I should be getting 14 volts.

Could it be that my regualtor is regulating my voltage to just over 13 
volts, and if I get a different regulator I would see the 'desired' 14 
volts??
