Well, the trick is that you need to be going 15 and 25 at a certain rpm. 
  This would obviously vary depending on the gear you're in.  I don't 
remember the numbers, but they're on the smog report sheets.  If you can 
find a long hill that will simulate those conditions, go for it.  I did 
try it and I was still way off.
