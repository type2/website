FWIW I have an old mount that looks like a hinge. Well works like one anyhow. 

Two flat plates. One bolts to the fan shroud, the other to the compressor. 

Lay a steel tube across the top of each them and weld them (look at a door hinge). 

One half has two short tubes - one at each end, and the other plate has a short tube in between the two end tubes. 

Insert a bolt through the tube for a pivot. This all should fit snuggly. 

The plate the compressor sits on should have a hole in it below the compressor. Weld a nut over this hole. Use a bolt threaded through this nut/hole to force the mount to pivot outward. Use a locking nut to keep the adjustment. 

Should cost about $10 if you have some old bolts, a welding machine, and some 3/8" (maybe 1/4") thick steel.

What does it look like? Take a hinge off of your bedroom door. Hold it up in front of your face with the hinge pin at the top, hinge closed, pin pointing at you. Holding the right side (shroud side) still, the left side (compressor side) should open upward. Adjustment bolt would be in the middle at the bottom of the compressor side. You may have to clearance the holes for the hardware, and a shallow hole for where the adjustment bolt would be a good idea.

Hope this helps someone. Did anyone find that belt number?
