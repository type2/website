Back in the day when I last had to smog my '66 Ghia I looked at the
numbers and, seeing how much below the minimum they were, asked the smog
guy, "What's the newest car that would pass with these numbers?" He told
me that those numbers would pass a car made up to the early '80s. I
imagine the recent changes would change that some.

But in the interest of cleaning the air I've often wondered why California
puts such an emphasis on having all the original equipment. Why don't they
provide incentives for companies to design upgrades that would make the
older cars less poluting? For your newer Buses couldn't a new 'brain' and
maybe a few other parts make them pollute less and run more efficiently?
