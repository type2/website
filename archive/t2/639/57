Subject: Exhaust Smell After Turning Off My Bus

I have a 1978 Campmobile and I have not been able to locate my problem in the posting archive.

Here's my scenario - I drive home from work (about 5 miles), pull the car in the garage, shut of the bus, leave the garage door open for a few minutes to clear out any fumes I just produced pulling in, shut the garage door and go inside.  Now if I come out to the garage later in the evening there is a heavy exhaust smell - almost as if the bus has exhaust "stored up" that it's letting out while it's just sitting there.  I know this sounds crazy - I just can't figure out why it would be producing such a strong exhaust smell long after I've shut it off.

Thanks for any help,
Jon
