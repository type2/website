PS - Forgive me for the second post, but another pertinent item is this 
state's social environment. One of our local big VW hobbyists (large 
workshop, several projects going at a time) is relocating to Missouri 
strictly based on his research of favorable political, tax, insurance, and 
economic climates of various locales across the country. He said he will be 
saving big money on gasoline, insurance, utility bills, and taxes among 
other things by moving.
