Well, see, that's part of the conundrum here.  I've used the same fairly
inexpensive digital meter many, many times to monitor and set the air/fuel
mixture in my California model Vanagon and it's always worked just fine;
once the mixture was "right" I'd see rapid changes in the voltage output
with many jumps back and forth over the .5 value.  Unless the meter has
suddenly gone bad I don't understand why I'm not seeing the same sort of
activity with the O2 sensor I installed in the Federal vehicle.

Bad or poisoned O2 sensor?  Well, maybe, but I'd doubt if 3 different
sensors would all show up this way, with 2 of them new out of the box,
particularly since the last new one installed was *after* VW set the basic
air/fuel mixture.

O2 sensor not hot enough?  Well, could be, but the sensor is inches away
from the left-side heat exchanger's connection with the crossover pipe and
I've run the engine at freeway speeds for 20-30 minutes before testing.
Doesn't seem too likely.

Something else?  Inquiring minds want to know.

> Use an analog meter. My digital meter seems to have a lag in it, and
doesn't react as quickly as the sensor values change. The only vehicle I
have checked was a modern VW and the values changed rapidly. YMMV.
