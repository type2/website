I've said it before on this topic...

While this is an annoyance (well, aggravation with the tighter 
standards), I don't consider it a show-stopper or something to get too 
worked-up about.  It will be possible to pass, and while it may be a 
wee bit painful from the initial investment point-of-view, I certainly 
won't mind having a Bus that runs better, gets better gas mileage, and 
pollutes less.
