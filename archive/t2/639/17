When the o2 sensor is cycling back and forth over .5, that means you're 
mixture is around 14.7:1.  I don't know yet if this is the ideal for 
smog tests, but I will find out very soon because my megasquirt can hold 
the mixture there very nicely.  Whether or not it goes fast or slow 
doesn't make much of a difference.. heck, it could hang out at .5 
(wouldn't happen) or cycle from .1 to .9 and be about the same mixture. 
  Narrow Band o2 sensors don't like to hang around .5, btw.  They tend 
to either side of .5 do to their response curve.

You'll have to drive and hold a speed then take your reading.  The 
difficult part about all of this is you need to simulate the loads 
required at smog tests (if that's your goal) and then tune there.  It's 
somewhat difficult unless you have one person driving and the other 
person hanging over the engine tweaking on the AFM (if you have EFI). 
But regardless, you have to tune with a consistent load/speed or some 
kind of consistant condition otherwise yes, your readings will be all 
over the place.


>> O2 sensor not hot enough? 

Is this a heated sensor.  If it's cold, it will read rich until it heats 
up.. at least, I think that's what mine does - or maybe it's the other 
way around.. crap, I forgot.  I installed mine in the header pipe after 
3 & 4 and it starts reading in about 10 seconds.  I've had mine 
installed after the collector w/ a heated sensor and it took around 30 
seconds.  Also, sensors installed after the collector have delayed 
readings.  I noticed this after moving my sensor into the header.

  Well, could be, but the sensor is inches away

should be plenty hot.

o2 sensors get slow when they get old.  Again, this has nothing to do 
with what your mixture is.

maybe, maybe not.  There are lots of digital ones that don't read fast. 
  Just look at what it's averaging around - don't worry how fast it's going.
