Do you run the second cooler in line, after the stock cooler?  I have
considered a setup like that,  although I currently plan on keeping the
stock oil cooler in the upright fan shroud location, like a type 1 .....

I plan on pulling a small "camping" trailer ..... similar to Greg's
Westrailer.  I live in western PA, and every camping trip involves
traversing mountains, hills, ridges, in one form or another, to get
anywhere.  In the dead of summer, oil temps occasionally have gotten 220,
240, etc, with the DP 1600 and no trailer.  I guess we will see how the
upright conversion goes alone and with trailer, prior to any additional
cooling.....

Thanks for the info!

<<<<<<I have the Cali book and recommend after doing a BAS 911 conversion
instead (www.ahnendorp.com) to simply relocate the cooler under the car to
catch air when the car is moving. I relocated the stock cooler down there.
I also used a CB Performance thermostat to limit flow to a second
cooler+fan with electric thermostat (big flat stacked cooler) for idling
and city traffic. Cooler, fan and thermostat was spotted once at Pep Boys
too.

No pressure problems apparently, and never any heat problems. The fan would
cycle in traffic after a July highway run.

Engine is/was in a '65 Beelte. Both coolers are outside the engine
compartment.
