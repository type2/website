Subject: RE: A/C pulley and belt

I have a '79 that I modified to make it easier to adjust the belt tension.  
As installed, you used spacers under the compressor to adjust.  I welded a 
nut and drilled a third hole in the middle of the lower mount. and use a 
bolt to adjust the compressor up and down.  I retained the outer existing 
bolts to lock it in place.  for adjustment, then, you loosen the outer 
bolts, adjust with the middle bolt, then lock down with the outer bolts.  
Much easier.  On another note, does anyone have a source for the condenser 
fan motors?  I'm thinking about just replacing them with aftermarket 
radiator fans if I can't come up with the correct motors.
