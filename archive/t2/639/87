Subject: Re: [T2] CA smog: we're boned

Hi Folks,

I'm sorry to hear that you CA residents have to deal with so much smog 
trouble.  Here in W. NC, we don't even have emissions testing -- if they 
did, most of the vehicles used on farms, back roads, and tiny 
wide-place-in-the-road towns would be illegal.  Heck half of those wouldn't 
even pass safety inspection in a "real" test.

I had to deal with smogging back in Colorado, and it wasn't nearly as bad as 
CA -- tailpipe sniff at idle and 2500, visual check for proper equipment.  
If CA is a bellwether for the rest of the country, it worries me that many 
more Buses will be sent to the crusher simply because they can't pass 
emissions.  SAD!

That said, I can't be too annoyed at an effort to clean up the environment.  
However, I'm pretty sure that the CA smog thing is just another way that the 
car manufacturers are forcing us to buy into the "throwaway" economy.  Of 
course, if we all buy into the president's idea of "Clear Skies," we should 
remove all emissions controls and set our mixtures to super-rich... :-)

I wish you all luck in keeping your Buses on the road as the government 
keeps tightening its grip on our individual rights.

Best,
Jason Z Upper
