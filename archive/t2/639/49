No.

It would not light if your battery was getting low and your alternator
output was LOW to the point that it matched the voltage of the low battery.

If your alternator has NO output then it is lower than the battery (0 is
lower than 10 [or 8, or 6, or 1]).

But, the light shows the DIFFERENCE between the two. So, if your
alternator/regulator is going wierd and only puttng out 10 volts and your
battery has one bad cell and is putting out 10.2 or so you will just show a
very dim (0.2 volts) light.

At some point I'd like to install a -/0/+ voltmeter in that circuit that
would show the actual difference and which "direction" it was in. Probably
have to be a digital meter since it should normally hover very near "0".

[5 minutes of re-reading and thought pass]

What I wrote explains why what you wrote should not be true. But, there's
got to be something else going on in that circuit and I don't have it handy
to look at.

The way the quote from Type2 reads means the light would always be on in a
properly running setup. The Alternator/regulator should be putting out
around 14 volts. The battery should never get above 13.2 or so (sustained).
That would mean you'd always have almost a full volt at the light.

I'll have to dig in the diagram and see how it actually works. I think it
only indicates one direction (alternator lower than battery).
