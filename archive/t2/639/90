Dear friends:

I am at a crossroads here with this discussion.  My wife thinks "sell 
the bus - the quicker the better".  She is a Sub-molecular Biologist 
(and unabashed F*rd Fan/mechanic)  and the smartest person I know. 
Took me a month of !(-at-)(-at-)#ing around to get it through smog this year. 
(and 3 years to get it on the road at all!)

This is a tough morning for me as I love the bus.   However,  I need 
something that isn't laid up for a week or two at smog time and 
costing me hundreds a year.  I now need to drive my bus every day. 
Our family situation with a 19 year old starting to drive has put me 
in the position where my "project bus" is now a "daily driver" and he 
drives my other truck.  I am worried about my bus holding up in that 
role.  (40 miles daily with the Sacramento Causeway).  And this smog 
thing does, frankly freak me out.

I was smogged in March of this year.  Was I already tested for the 
higher standards?

Thanks for letting me vent and I'd appreciate all helpful suggestions 
on or off line.  I am a tinkerer, not a mechanic and I need some good 
advice here.  Money is tight and we kind of live from check to check.

Thanks,

BEN
