OK let me make sure I understand your technique.  You adjust the 
mixture to the point where it cycles back and forth over the .5 value 
the quickest?  Is that correct?

I was trying to adjust the AVERAGE reading to reach about .5, but I was 
not able to get consistent results (average reading), and my rate of 
switching back and forth seemed to slow down.   I will have to go back 
and try this again.  Like you, I was using a brand new o2 sensor.

I don't know what to think about your issue.  It seemed to me that 
after I tried adjusting, the rate of switching back and forth slowed 
down.  Maybe you are getting results similar to mine.    Maybe you 
could try leaning out your mixture to see if the switch rate increases. 
   I was actually trying to enrich my mixture slightly to see if it 
would bring down my CHT, but in doing so, I believe that I slowed my 
rate of switching (and it had no effect on my CHT).

I wonder if an analog voltmeter would make it easier to visualize the 
oscillation across 0.5.
