If you have a belt and it has no number then you can find the correct
replacement pretty easily.  Almost every FLAPS has a Gates belt length
finder hung somewhere in the store; it seems to be part of the original
kit for auto parts store settup.  Alas, only 3% of the stores have a human
who knows what to do with that finder.

If you want to (a) find the correct belt number and (b) amaze the parts
salesman you can go to the belt length finder (if you don't know what it
looks like see
http://www.gates.com/brochure.cfm?brochure=2269&location_id=2742.
It is a track with two semicircles mounted to it.  One of the semicircles
is fixed and has a slot cut in it with some numbers.  The track also has
numbers.  Mount your old belt on the fixed semicircle and read off the
number beside the slot where the top of the belt lies.  This is your belt
profile.  Then slip the movable semicircle down to get the length of the
belt, which will vary according to profile.  Look for that number on the
rack.

If that was not clear then let me know.  I did look for a tutorial on the
web but did not find one.

On a total side note I did find this page during my search:
http://www.gizmology.net/index.htm
It contained a very good basic description of casting small metal parts.
We still have a decent supply of used vehicles to pull parts from but as
time goes on learning to cast small parts is going to become part of the
basic skills needed to keep a bus on the road.


OOK!
