Subject: Re: [T2] CA smog: we're boned

Richard, up here in Canada guys often pass the smog tests by using alcohol
enriched gas, available at Mohawk Gas Stations. Because it is ethanol based
it seems to run much cleaner. I don't know if you have gasahol :-) down
there, but up here many people who can't pass with regular fuel use it to
take the test.

Just a thought.

Looks like they upped the limts in the ASM test (aka rolling road) for 75-78
buses to 1.08% and 0.88%. For 79 vehicles it's even stricter. I have no
chance of passing right now without retuning it and they are forcing me to
go to a test only center because of vehicle age. This is going to be a real
hassle this time.

 

What's really scarry is that the Gross Polluter (GP) standards with the new
test (2.58% and 2.38%) are ever lower than the previous Pass/Fail standards
for the old Two Speed Idle (TSI) cutpoints of 2.5% and 3.0%. I suspect the
majority of bus owners who passed with flying colors last time are now all
going to fail badly on the dyno.

 

It's official: we're boned.
