Finally something not on the West Coast!!! <grin!> 

There is another place in Nashville too. Different company, same services. 

Question: what does it cost to get a cab - such as the one shown in the pics - dipped? 

I'd love to dip our bus someday when I do the MAJOR R&R. That will have to wait for the day when I own a garage and don't have to save up my lunch money to buy parts... <grin!> I'd have to reseal all the body seams though... 

Does it eat out all the fillers? All the leading that the old cars had? 

Anything done to totally neutralize the acids? I have heard of rust coming back because the acids never quite got stopped. 

Anything done to keep the rust at bay short term? I would worry about a 2 hour drive home and getting caught in the rain... 

Sure looks pretty, all that clean grey steel. 

Shoot it with the yellow etching primer first?
