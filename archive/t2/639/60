YOu know, I tried this and I was so far off.  What you really need to do 
is go to a station and have them stick it on the dyno while you mess 
with the spring tension.  That's really the only way to do it because 
it's super difficult to simulate the loads/speeds that your bus is going 
to be tested at.  I found a shop that would do it for 50 bux here so 
it's not that bad....
