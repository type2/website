John,

I understand about doing what ya have to do...but!

Here in Arkansas, a judge with a $100,000 RV got popped
because he had done the same thing...

The *state* doe not like it when they loose tax money.

He paid a big fine, went to jail for a short time, and lost his "judge" 
job and his lawyer license.

On the otherhand, if you don't own the vehicle...this could be good, 
except if someone runs into you or you into them....then problems again.

I'd say it was "tea party" time for youse guys.

If I were you all I would  *really* would like to know how many 
pre 1980 cars were still on the road in the smogged counties that you live 
in...and by what year.

I bet the dmv or someone has that number.....how many cars/people did
they screw by keeping it to 1975 and earlier.

Sorry guys....

Good luck, dave
