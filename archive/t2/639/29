Clearly out of tune.

The possible problem here is that the calibration of the dealer's gas
analyzer isn't the same as the smog tech's and with such a lean limit you're
going to have trouble passing unless you get the engine set much leaner or
are able to get tested at the same shop that can adjust the AFR.

It's hard for a digital meter to read those voltage values unless it has
mix/max/avg memory.
