Subject: FS: 78 auto Transporter, very little rust, no engine, in VA,

I am still selling my 78 Transporter.  It has very little rust, and no
rust through.  No engine, but has a working auto tranny.  Interior is fair
with a few vinyl panels sagging.  It has a factory AC unit installed in it
with the evaporator underneath.  The gas tank is out of it, but included.

Some pics can be had here: http://www.lostwater.com/78_bus.htm

It will be sold for $500, with free delivery to Winchester VA, Richmond
VA, or Norfolk/Virginia Beach.

Email any questions.

Thanks,
