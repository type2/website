I have the meter that's sold on aircooled.net and it responds really 
quickly.  Other meters may be different... but regardless, it doesn't 
really matter if you're trying to tune an AFM.  The only thing you can 
tune is long and steady "states" because it's nearly impossible to try 
and tune accel enrich, cold start enrich, etc.  Doesn't really matter 
anyways because that's what's being checked when you go to smog (long, 
steady runs...)


The megasquirt "stabilizes" in a different way.  It looks at your rpm 
and calls those steps (or something like that).  So, let's say your 
engine turned 4 times, that's 4 steps.  You can tell the megasquirt to 
make an adjustment to your mixture based off of your o2 sensor every 20 
steps.  You then tell it how much to change it when it hits that' 20th 
step.  Plus, you can set the limit that o2 readings can affect the fuel 
mixture.

but otherwise your readings are coming in raw to the ms and you can see 
them flying by.

There's a program called MSTweak and that takes all your o2 crossing 
points (where the o2 passed through .5) and remembers the MAP and the 
RPM.  Then it builds a fuel map based off of that.  Pretty slick!
