  Hello,
  I have recently just purchased a 1979 Westy camper that has damaged hinges
  (The rear scissors style hingers I believe were on the Westy campers from
  1974-1979.) In other words, I can't close the poptop. I have looked all
over
  the net, and haven't found any leads. Does anyone have any idea were I
could
  find these hinges? Any help would be appreciated.
  Thanks!
  Brian
