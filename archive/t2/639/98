If I remember correctly, anything that affects the fuel system must be 
CALDOT certified or something like that.  Apparently this costs the 
companies $$$ so they don't get it certified and all the racer kids have 
to use these aftermarket parts illegally and then switch them out come 
smog time.  I don't think the state would necessarily mind old engines 
running cleaner, I think the state is more worried about newer cars 
being modified and falling out of smog compliance.
