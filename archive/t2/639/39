Chris,

For what it's worth, yes, I did find my original belt that was on the bus 
and the york compressor when I bought it.

Forgot the original number, but IIRC, it is a 10mm belt and it is 46.5" 
long.

NAPA can match it as belts can be sold by width and length.

The belt should have a mm length as well and I believe it was 1180mm

The belt number will generally indicate the size.

Cheers, dave
