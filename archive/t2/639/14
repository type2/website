If it has the tab on the back at the bottom to attach to the cradle its a
Bus engine. If it has the hokey, make do, oil pump adapter plate its a Bug
engine.

>     Hi everyone,
 I have a 1968 bus, transporter, kombi...the engine serial number by the
 generator reads H232781.
 Now, there are some people telling me that the number means that the engine is
 actually a type 1 engine, H series (1493cc, 44hp, 32 kW) whereas what the bus
 should really have is a B series (1584cc, 35kW, 47hp).
 My question is: by reading the engine serial number, can anyone tell me what
 series the engine is? I also have pictures I can send out just in case someone
 wanted to be sure. From what I have learnt by fixing the engine and ordering
 parts, I always tought it was a 1600cc...
     Having said this, if it turns out to be a H series, is it possible that
 1968 type 2s actually came out with the H series engine in the first months of
 production of the vehicle??? My bus was first registered in CA in april 1968
 and the production of H series engines on type 2s actually stopped on july of
 the same year (according to the busdepot engine code links, and actually later
 than that in the type2 library engine codes section).
 I hope someone can help me with this, it is a pretty crucial piece of
 information...
 thanks,
