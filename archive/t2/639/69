Subject: 72 throttle cable adjustment

I didn't get any replies but I did discover the answers:

There is a 2.5mm grub screw that holds the cable on. You have to be careful not to remove too much slack or idle will never settle down. The FI spring is much stiffer than the spring that returns the dual carb linkage to the closed position.

Right away is the answer. A sticky throttle cable at the linkage/cable connector was the cause. Once I greased it the throttle snapped closed and the carb circuitry and dash pots too care of the rest.
