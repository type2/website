Subject: Wheel Bearing Noise

Jason, have you jacked up each front wheel and rotated it, listening for 
bearing noise?  If you have a suspect, it sounds like you have the experience 
it takes to examine the bearings and bearing races.  On the back it is not as 
easy.  I don't want to suggest pulling your half shafts so you can rotate the 
rear wheels (lots of work) but for starters why not have someone ride with you 
and try to identify the source, front or rear, left or right.  If you don't 
know when your transmission lubricant was last changed, fresh lubricant would 
not be a bad idea.  Buy 5-6 ft of 1/2" or larger clear tubing and a funnel; 
braze a 17 mm nut on a bolt; buy a gallon of gear oil; then go for it.

Now that I'm driving my Bus with a nice quiet (for an ACVW) engine, I'm 
noticing a fair amount of wheel bearing noise, and was wondering if there 
was a way to fix it.

I replaced both rear bearings in the summer 2003, and replaced both fronts 
in the spring of 2003.  I followed all of the available procedures to the 
letter, including using brass drifts and being careful to avoid scratching 
the new bearings and races.  I have also replaced all 4 CV joints over the 
last 3 years.  I've probably put a total of 15,000 miles on all of the above 
parts, but the noise is still there.  I've been running Bridgestone Dueler 
tires on my Bus since I bought it, and they do not seem to be the source of 
the noise.
