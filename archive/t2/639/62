But with a gauge on the dash, you can see if you're rich/lean at 15mph 
and 25mph (those are the speeds they test with, right?)

Seems like you can: drive to warm up... set idle mixture, drive at 
15mph, tweak, drive at 25mph, tweak (erring on the lean side), test 
(and hopefully pass), tweak back to 13.5 for normal running.
