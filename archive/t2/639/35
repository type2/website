Subject: Re: [T2] Outer Race removal??

I have a 76 with disk brakes so I don't know if it's the same as 
yours... but anyways, I used a screwdriver and a hammer.  Took a bit of 
hammering, but it came out ok.  Then, to press it back in, I took the 
old race, ground the OD down and used it as a mandrel to press the new 
one in w/ my vice.  Worked great!
