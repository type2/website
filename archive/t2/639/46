The simple narrow band meters measure lean or rich around 14.7:1 and only at
certain temperatures (usually above 400F) so the sample needs to be taken as
close to the exhaust port as possible.

You don't want it to run lean unless you temporarily have to pass an ultra
strict smog test.

When we talk about lean running VW busses we are really talking about the
lean side of rich close to the stoichiometric ratio.

I'd like to quote JC of ACN:

Since zero %CO is approximately 14.7:1 an AFR meter should be reading rich
all the time according to John's tuning directions. All of this assumes the
accuracy of the measuring device. Here are some conversions from his
numbers:

14.5:1 = 0.2% CO
13.5:1 = 2.6%
13.0:1 = 4%
12.5:1 = 5.3%

All the %CO factory specs I've seen have been on the rich side of stoich
(14.7:1). Stoch or truly lean, I'm told will be a contributing factor to
premature heat failure of the heads. VW specs are:

2.0 - 4.0% (CB)
1.0 - 3.0% (CB, Aug 72 - Dec 72)
0.5 - 1.5% (CB/AW, Jan 72 - July 74)
0.2 - 2.0% (ED)
0.9 - 1.0% (GD)
0.5 - 1.5% (GE Federal)
0.2 - 1.2% (GE 79 CA)

So you can see his recommendations are within spec for light throttle. The
half-full throttle settings you choose have to coordinate with the smog test
limits imposed on you. For my bus the limits were 2.5 %CO at idle and 3% CO
at 2500rpm (the last test was anyway as I need to research my next test).

These limits still adhere to John's ideal settings (at least for 78).
