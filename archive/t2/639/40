Tom:

About a month ago, I purchased a air/fuel ratio meter from CB 
performance.  It was about $120.  Last night I finally got around to 
hooking it up and trying it out.  It came with a heated o2 sensor, but 
I hooked it to my existing stock non-heated sensor ('79 Ca emissions) 
which is pretty new.  I tried it out on the road, but didn't put too 
many miles on it, but it did seem to register rich and lean conditions 
when I expected to see them, i.e. rich when I stepped on the 
accelerator and lean when I let up.  However, it seemed to indicate 
that in general, I was running lean at steady states, like when 
cruising at around 60 mph.  Now, this is generally the opposite from 
the information that I was getting from my o2 sensor when I measured it 
with the voltmeter using essentially the same approach as you described 
in your last email, i.e.  I adjusted my AFM so that I would get 
readings generally above 0.5 volts, occasionally dipping below 0.5 
volts.  So now, I'm really wondering what to believe.  The lean 
readings from the AFM would support my high CHT readings, but they 
don't support my o2 sensor readings.

All the testing last night was done with the lambda control circuit 
disabled by jumpering across the throttle switch.  Tonight, I'll try it 
with the control circuit enabled.
