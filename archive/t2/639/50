Stopping at the smog station this morning to deal with my flat bike tire gave me a chance to talk with the smog tech. In this area all the tests are now done on the dyno and he told me they've changed all of the test limits as well. After I arrived at work I decided to search for the data because he couldn't tell me what the new limits were:

http://159.145.15.175/ftp/pdfdocs/asm_ph43.pdf

Looks like they upped the limts in the ASM test (aka rolling road) for 75-78 buses to 1.08% and 0.88%. For 79 vehicles it's even stricter. I have no chance of passing right now without retuning it and they are forcing me to go to a test only center because of vehicle age. This is going to be a real hassle this time.

What's really scarry is that the Gross Polluter (GP) standards with the new test (2.58% and 2.38%) are ever lower than the previous Pass/Fail standards for the old Two Speed Idle (TSI) cutpoints of 2.5% and 3.0%. I suspect the majority of bus owners who passed with flying colors last time are now all going to fail badly on the dyno.

It's official: we're boned.
