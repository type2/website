Larry,

I think that is the point...as others have mentioned....they don't want 
you to be able to get the old parts....or pass the test...they *want* your 
bus off the road....

This brings me to another point....how does Jay Leno get all of *his* 
Lamborgini's and other exotic cars to pass smog???...or are they all older 
than 1975?

This is my last post on this as I suspect we are about to overdo and kill 
this thread.

Cheers, dave
