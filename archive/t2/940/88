 I want to put a battery cutoff switch at my driver side seat pedestal base
(like a boat battery cutoff) to disconnect the battery ground .  This means
running an appropriate cable from the VW bus (RBC) battery negative ground to the front of the bus and from
the switch to a ground spot up there.

 Well, this wire will have to be about 11 ft long, so I  went to Home Depot to check what they had.  They had
a reasonable sized and flexible wire with multi strands.

 Before I went for the  full 11 ft, I got a foot and half cut off to play
with it at home.

Sounds like you want to extend your negative battery cable from the battery to the cutoff switch and then add
a short gound cable from the switch to the body?

And the cutoff switch has 2 posts on it like a battery?

Then here is the ideal set-up: a 11' 6" battery cable with a post on one end and a battery clamp on the other.
0000 gauge, almost a half inch in diameter.

It is from a BMW and is on that auction site......  270073092837
