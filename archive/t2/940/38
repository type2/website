I wonder how much air those would put out vs. the stock fan.  I hooked 
up the 3" turbo 3000 and it was nowhere near the amount of flow that the 
stock fan puts out.  So, back to the store they will go.  I think I 
might just run a duct from the inside of the bus to the stock blower and 
leave it at that.

Hmmmff.
