Yeah, it just sounds like way more work than it's worth.

My plans for the Guac have hardened. Unless a $45 gas heater falls
from the sky (Dan).

A pair of bilge blowers attached to the heat exchanger stovepipes
(risers, whateverthey'recalled) in the engine compartment. Hoses up
into the scoops with vents going into the cabin. So I have the air
from the cabin going through the bilge blowers and through the heat
exchangers.

I've priced everything and I should be able to do it for around $100.
The only concern is attaching to the right hand stovepipe. It's not
round, but oval. So I'll need either something flexible or to fab
something up with sheetmetal. I welcome suggestions here...
