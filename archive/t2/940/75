You know what, I think I'm going to go for this idea.  The heat coming 
from the back of the bus seems like it's way too hot and I'm pretty sure 
it'll met that fan.  Plus, this way it's also not putting a full suction 
on the system sucking a ton of exhaust in.

I figure this way it'll be recirculating some of the colder air from the 
back of the bus (helping to move air back) and I will also put a 
recirculation duct in the back of the bus to supply the stock blower fan.

I think because of all the bends in the ducting, the stock fan, or any 
other blower fan for that matter, just can't do much short of putting a 
jet engine in there.  The engine cooling fan is still the best as far as 
moving air to the front.
