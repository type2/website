Remove the small covers on the HEs.  They cover the small rectangular 
hole in the bottom right of the pic linked below.  You should be able to 
remove the right cover without removing the HE.  The left is harder to 
do with the HE on.  Be careful not to drop the flap down into the HE.  
Ask me how I know?
