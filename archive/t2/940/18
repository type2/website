Hi Mike,

My last four domestic cars (01 Malibu, 02 Focus, 03 Malibu and 05  
Malibu) have all had an option to recycle interior air or pull  
exterior air into the climate control system. I've also seen this  
same option in various 80's Dodge products. I use it more use in  
summer than in winter, as it's easier to chill the interior with 75  
degree air going into the AC than with 95 degree outside air.

Happy Trails,
