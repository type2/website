Subject: Re: [T2] Runs fine until it warms up

Michael-

I had this *exact* same problem with my '79 a few months ago. Temp sensor
didn't have any effect on the problem for me, either. After monkeying around
with all the same stuff you describe (cold start valve etc), I finally
traced the problem to a loose connection in the double relay harness. Does
it start to idle poorly just before it completely dies? You might try
fiddling with the harness at this point, pressing the connection firmly into
place, jiggling wires etc, and see if it makes any difference. In my case, I
haven't gotten around the replacing the part(s) yet; I just zip-tied the
harness up tight to the relay case. Anyway, HTH and keep us posted-

<<It will run just fine until it warms
up and then it starts popping (just a little) and running very rough. This
will go on for about 3 to 5 minutes until it shuts off completely. After
that happens I cant start it again until the engine cools sufficiently for
it to start again.>>
