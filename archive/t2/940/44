Subject: splitty in cooperators Cdn commercial...

Last night I saw a commercial for the Co-Operators insurance on Canadian TV.

They featured a nice blue splitty used as a mobile office.

The original story is here

Of course the splitty in the commercial was embellished somewhat to 
appeal to a TV audience...
