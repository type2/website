Subject: Re: [T2] bilge blower heater retrofit - was: Oil cooler as heat

Only a week ago I installed 2 of the 3" Atwood blowers in the engine
compartment. I mounted them to the ceiling on each side and extended the
heater hoses from the doghouse. I found some rubber plumbing adapters to
connect the 2" hose to the blowers.

I bought a variable speed switch from these guys ( http://www.zaneinc.com )
for about $30, they make nice click-off, DC switches.

Here are a few pics after the install ( http://voxlux.com/bus/ ), the extra
hose clutters up the compartment a bit but its easy to remove to work on the
engine.

Much better airflow, not as much as I thought but my exchangers have a few
holes. Once I get some new exchangers and seal up the system nice and tight
it should rock. Also, since the blowers are in the back they are very quiet,
even when cranked to full.

Total cost was about $100.

Happy Holidays!
