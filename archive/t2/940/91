Subject: RE:What gauge is the wire?

As others have already mentioned, you'll be able to get a heavy gauge wire,
of the appropriate length, made up for you, but be careful of what switch
you use.  It will have to be able to handle the full load of the electrical
system, including starting and charging, under the worst conditions.
