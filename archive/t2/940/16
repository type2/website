Hi Courtney,

Your suggestion is right on the money. VW designed the system to be  
flow the air into the cab under pressure. This way a leak in the  
system will release warm air outwards, rather than possibly pulling  
exhaust fumes into the heater ducts.

Note that if you are going to pressurize the input to the heater  
boxes, you will get better heat with a cold-air return duct to reduce  
pressure inside the vehicle. If the bus is 100% airtight (unlikely as  
that might be) the fans will have trouble trying to push air into it.

Happy Trails,
