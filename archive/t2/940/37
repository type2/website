Subject: Re: [T2] bilge blower heater retrofit - was: Oil cooler as heat

"Does anyone have access to a bus with a BN-4 in it?  I need to know exactly
where the fresh air intake for the heater is in that left rear interior
quarter panel (maybe measured from the window edge or corner).  If there's a
space for the plastic duct from the BN-4, there has to be space for a simple
vent in the interior quarter panel."

 

There's an embossed rectangle stamped in the interior just above rear deck
in the driver's side rear corner next to the rear hatch.  That gets cut out
and some kind of screen plate with a right angle down into the engine
compartment is fitted.  When I retrofitted my last BN4 into a '71 the only
problem I had was the four inch thick padding of the older style westy beds
covers the hole and restricts airflow.  I wedged an old oil bottle or
something similar to hold the pad about three inches away.

My son still owns that 71 Riviera, let me know if you need pix, maybe I can
email some next week, after the holiday.
