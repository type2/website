I'm concerned that putting the blowers between the doghouse and the
HEs will suck cooling air from the engine. The fan only blows so much,
and if you're sucking out more than it's designed for, you end up with
less cooling air at the heads and cylinders.

Have you noticed anything? I know you wouldn't be using them when it's
100 out, but it's still something that concerns me...

(In my 78, it's impossible to put them between the fan and the HEs, so
not an issue for me.)
