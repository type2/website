Subject: Re: [T2] zodi Hot Vent

I've got one of their hot water showers and it's the cats pajamas -
though I think the piezo start could be better for what I paid for it...
 And with limited water, you really need to recirc the water in a bucket
to the desired temp, then turn off the flame and shower at leisure with
on/off capability. You can't turn the water off with the flame goin', so
if you don't have unlimited water to fiddle with and get adjusted to the
right temp my method works best...

The unit gets HOT - so you'd need to keep it well away from anything
combustible.  Only good when you're stationary - you couldn't mount it
outside the bus and run it whilst underway...

Zodi sometimes moves their seconds thru that famous auction site...
worth a try...
