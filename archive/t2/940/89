Karl's post reminded me that my Mini also has a long battery cable -
the battery is at the back of the Mini (for weight disitribution!),
but the engine is at the front.  The positive battery cable goes the
length of the car, and is at least 10 feet long (probably more).

A new battery cable for a Mini is about $70.  When I had to replace
mine (because the insulation was cracking), I went to an auto-electric
shop and got them to make me up a cable with the appropriate
connectors on it instead of getting the aftermarket cable.  Worked
great, and I could get whatever ends and length I wanted.
