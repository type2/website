That looks almost exactly like the BA6 recirculate ductwork, except
there's also a flapper at the "Y" that keeps the air from the
recirculating blower from going back up to the engine.  When the
recirculating airflow is higher than the airflow from the engine, the
flapper is pushed to close against the branch from the engine.  When
the engine airflow is higher than the airflow from the recirculating
blower, the flap is pushed to close against the branch from the
recirculating blower.

In the BA6 case, the heater is under the middle of the bus, after the
recirculating "Y".  As well, there are no heater ducts underneath the
back seat, only the recirculating blower input duct.
