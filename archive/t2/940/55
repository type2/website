Hi Michael,

The low gas milage, black smoke and poor running when warm all point  
to an over-rich condition.

First off, check the fuel pressure, and make sure the fuel return  
line is not kinked. If the fuel pressure is above 35PSI at idle you  
have a bad regulator.

Secondly, bypass the cold start valve with a short section of tubing,  
as it might be stuck open.

Thirdly, verify the wiring between the head temp sensor and the ECU.


Happy Trails,
