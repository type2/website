Yeah.. that's exactly what I'm thinking of doing - I probably didn't 
make that clear cuz I mentioned the in-line fan stuff..

but yeah, I think it would be great to pull the air from the back of the 
car cabin and send it through the exchangers.  It just drives me nuts 
because I have this tiny oil leak and I keep smelling the burning oil 
every now and then.  If I can take outside air, or at least air near the 
engine, out of the equation, I think it will be a lot better.  Instead 
of going up the vents (which would be a bit difficult) I was thinking of 
cutting a hole in that area just behind the cabinets (in my 78 westy) 
and putting a vent right there.  That space is pretty useless right now.
