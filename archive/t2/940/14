I did this on a '71 with a Chevy Blazer three speed fan mounted in the spare
tire well and blowing thru' the heat exchangers...With an upright engine, I
capped the outlets on the doghouse and used the engine fan to just cool the
engine...Sucking air in from the interior and recyclin' it got the inside of 
the
Bus hot! Hot enough to actually melt ice on the windshield with the defrost-
ers... ;-)
Loud tho'... :-(
