19 strand is very common, but not differing conductor sizes.

Concentric stranding, where there is a central conductor and layers are 
built up, progresses 1, 7, 19, 37... (1 + 6 + 12 + 18) where each layer 
has 6 more conductors than the prior. All conductors are usually the 
same size (cross sectional area), although some wires are made from 
non-circular conductors, which creates a smaller diameter overall wire. 
That may be the difference you're measuring.
