Subject: Cooling Tin Piece Needed

Hi,

I've discovered that a piece of my 1600 cooling tin has mysteriously vanished.

"Rear Air Baffle Plate, Left" # 131 119 357

Bus Boys no longer has it available.

I'm also looking for the two front heat riser covers
211 119 577 and 211 119 578

Anyone got extra tinware sitting around they'd like to get rid of?

Thanks
