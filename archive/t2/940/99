Subject: windshield replacement

folks, i was helping a buddy today put a new
windshield in a 64 bug. The rubber we got (from Bus
Depot) doesn't want to go over the little teeth on the
inside of the wind frame. Huh? We don't have the
original or previous rubber to be able to check to
make sure the rubber is the same.  I can see that
these teeth would keep the windshield in place in case
or accicent. Do i rip those teeth out, which is what i
did on my 70 bug in the late 80s.

thanks
matthew
