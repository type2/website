Subject: 1600 Cooling Tin Diagram Needed

Hi,

I'm replacing the heads on my 1600 dp engine. I'd like to find out why
my #3 and #1 valves are stretching or sinking. I may be missing some
necessary cooling tin. Does anyone have a link to a diagram of the
complete cooling tin?

Thanks in advance
peace
