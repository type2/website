My 67 camper was stolen late last night from in front of my house.
I got up at 7:45 and went out to get the paper and the bus was gone.
Called the Fresno PD and reported it stolen. Merry Christmas to me!

At 8:30, I got a phone call from a friend that drives/owns about 30 Vanagons. He heard a 67 bus was stolen on
his police scanner and knew it had to be mine. He spotted it around the corner from my house!
They had cut and screwed up the ignition switch wiring and it quit running. So we towed it home. I just have
to fix the wiring and see why it died.

A police officer showed up 10 minutes ago [9:30 ish] to make a report on it......
They are fast acting here.
