Mike - I have to agree with you on this. Adding a
valve to recirc / not recirc may be considered, but I
did so with my current heater system and the only
times I have opened the outside air valve have been in
extreme heat in summer - using it as an additional
fresh air vent! I really only do re-circ - all the
time. Of course my bus has so many holes for air to
get in that it is in reality probably only about 50%
recirc! - BaH
