Subject: Heat in a bus

My 78 bus has little heat.  My booster fan(over the engine) does not work
but I do have a working assembly with relay to replace it with.  However, I
had read that if the lower flaps which prevent the booster from blowing air
from the heater boxes into the engine cooling fan are missing, engine
overheating is guaranteed.   Is there a relatively simple way to determine
if these flaps are intact?  My bus does have a blue metal rectangle about 2
by 3" and I worry it could be a missing heat flap.  I don't know where it
came from.  A couple of years ago I did replace the right heat exchanger but
did not take anything out.  I also plan to insulate the main heat
duct(surprisingly good looking after nearly 30 years for carboard) abd put
in a bilge blower.  I think this must go inline toward the front as it could
melt at the rear.  

Advice is welcomed and personal experiences are valuable

Thanks to the contributors to the list.  It is necessary to keep such an odd
old vehicle going.
