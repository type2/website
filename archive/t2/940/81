Subject: \What gauge is the wire??

OK, i am just waiting for the coffee to perk, and I have this bugging me:

I want to put a battery cutoff switch at my driver side seat pedestal base
(like a boat battery cutoff) to disconnect the battery ground .  This means
running an appropriate cable from the VW bus (RBC) battery negative ground
to the front of the bus and from the switch to a ground spot up there.

Well, this wire will have to be about 11 ft long, so I  went to Home Depot
to check what they had.  They had a reasonable sized and flexible wire with
multi strands.

Before I went for the  full 11 ft, I got a foot and half cut off to play
with it at home.

I remember that there was some posting that if you had wire of so much
thickness, and so many strands, you could compute the gauge [or would it be
correct to say AWG - American Wire Gauge] of the wire.

Well, I also had a piece of electric clothes dryer wire that was pretty
heavy.  The middle wire said '8'  [the two side wires said '6'], so I guess
that was the gauge of that wire.  It was also multi strand wire.

I counted the dryer wire '8' and it had 19 strands.  18 of the strands
measured around .74mm and one of the strands measured about .53mm.  OK, I
thought, made in China quality.

Then I checked the Home Depot wire.  It also had 19 strands, but about 2/3's
(13 strands) measured about 1.55mm, and the other 1/3 (six strands) measured
1.20mm

What gives??  is this common to have a mixture like that??  Is 19 strands
per cable a common basis??

BTW, I did find that the Home Depot wire was indicated as 2 gauge wire.  I
would like to know just what it was computed as.....
