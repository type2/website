Subject: Re: [T2] bilge blower heater retrofit 

When I did this, I added an Attwood 3" bilge blower
but I put it up front, below the passenger seat area.
The single 3" model was adequate in this manner. I was
concerned about the wattage. Once I installed it, I
was unhappy with the noise, but it certainly moved the
air!

The application you guys are discussing makes much
more sense. You even have room to wrap some noise
deadening insulation around them and to soft-mount
them. The 3" model required adapting to the slightly
smaller duct tubing. I think a DC motor pulse-type
speed controller will be most appropriate; maybe you
can find one with high enough capacity to drive both
blowers. Otherwise you can use the stock blower
control (bottomed-out heater switch) and add a relay
of higher capacity and larger gauge wire from a better
source (adequately fused) Be sure to keep in mind the
flaps that exist on the stock blower to prevent engine
cooling air from escaping backwards through the
blowers when the blowers are not actuated. Also be
sure that your "trap doors" between the fan housing
and the heat exchangers (T4) are in place and working
or you'll be sending most of your air into the engine
cooling air especially at low speeds. Aircraft Spruce
& Specialty has insulated flexible (heater air)
ducting in various sizes. (They also have heat
exchangers - I believe the jargon is "muffs")-BaH
