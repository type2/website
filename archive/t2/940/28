If you open the wing about 3" it creates a vacuum to suck the smoke
out while you're rolling. In traffic I have to open a window too.

I hate the smell of a smoked in vehicle. And yet I smoke in my bus
when I'm alone. That's the biggest reason I did vinyl upholstery. I
can easily wipe it clean so no smoke buildup.
