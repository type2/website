Subject: RE:T4 Oil Pressure Sending unit adapter wanted 

	The oil pressure sending unit may not have metric threads, since the
same units seem to go in American and imported cars.  It might be  a pipe
thread.  I am going to install a VCO oil pressure gauge this summer and am
hoping to make up a T using a short pieces of pipe and a T with internal
threads so I can use both the VDO and warning light senders.    Other wise,
I see the Bus Depot has a dual sender unit for about $28
