Subject: Who's up for a camping trip?

The third weekend in May there are a couple things happening down in the
Oxnard/Ventura area that might make interesting side trips on a camping
trip. There are at least 3 state parks nearby (on the ocean) to choose
from and that weekend - May 16-18 - there is the Strawberry Festival and
the Karmann Ghia Treffen, depending on your tastes. Can I have a show of
hands of any that would be interested in making the trip?
