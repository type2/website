Hi Seth,

As Andy points out hook your negative lead onto the chassis to measure votlage.  Unpainted bolts are good.  I haven't looked at the dash elecrics on my bus, but typically there will be a common point that all the negatives go to and that will attach on to the body somewhere.

Any diameter of wire will do for extending continuity tests (i.e. whatever is long enough and handy) and to avoid confusion is should be insulated.  A bare wire touching the chassis could give some odd results.  Strip back about an inch of the insulation on each end and measure it to make sure that it's a good bit of wire.  Wrap the wire around one end of the test cable and measure the continuity of the two bits of wire in series.  You may need to cover this in something to prevent the wires touching the vehicle body.  The additional wire shouldn't add much resistance.

Good luck with your fault finding, and if you find yourself confused by anything break it down into smaller chunks until it starts to make sense.  That mantra has worked for me for 15 years of electronic engineering and counting.... :)
