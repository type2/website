It's really not hard with two people - but two hydraulic jacks helps. The
amazing thing is that it is possible with just one person and one jack. On an
upright with the detachable rear panel it's a breeze. Just prop the engine up
inline with the transmission and roll the bus back!

I'm considering cutting the cross-bit under my engine compartment door the
next time have my engine out just for this purpose. The idea is: the easier
the engine comes out, the more likely you'll be to just pull it and go over it
nicely. There are alot of potential oil leaks and other "details" that are
easy to fix with the engine out but a PIA with the engine in.
