Subject: rear shocks

dear list members can anyone tell me if KYB GR2 gas shock absorbers #4095  
(or could be 343144) are these the correct shocks for the rear of a 71 westy? 
i ask because after taking the old ones off the new ones are considerably 
shorter .. 4 inches or so, and i would have to jack the rear mount up quite a 
bit to get the holes to line up .. can anyone help? thanks .. scott 71 westy
