Subject: Re: [T2] T4 Oil Pressure Sending unit adapter wanted

has warmed up.

Had one on my 72' never had that problem...

>I personally would be concerned about how engine vibration will affect a
vertical piece of pipe with a heavy weight on the end of it......

Pipe is only going to be maybe 2" long at the most and the sender hardly
weighs much. I use a similar set up on my 28' sailboat's inboard gas
engine. Oil pressure sender has an attachment to break the ground on my
fuel pump if pressure drops too low. Lots more vibration in the boat with
solid engine mounts too.

>  wouldn't a flexible pipe be better?

Sender needs to be grounded, flexible means metal strapping to get a ground

>I would hate to have the pipe loosen up or wear its threads and fail at
highway speed!!

Threads are tapered (pipe thread. No more likely to loosen up than the
stock sender.
