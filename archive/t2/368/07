I'm really sorry to hear this. It happened to me once, although not in the
same place, and I know your heart must have just stopped. I now treat the
electrical system with great respect and double check my work before
reconnecting the battery.

It's not really part of the FI loom: you can remove the loom and still leave
that plug connected to the double relay. If that's all that's fried I think
you got off lucky and can either run new wires or find a bundle and plug
from a donor bus.

From the archives:

CU 57 X         022 906 021 S

ECU,  CU 57 X
   Volkswagen
     1977     Type 2 1970cc (CJ,GD,GE) Manual Transmission

The harnesses vary according to the features. I think I have this right:

- 75-76 1/2 harness (throttle body switch, vacuum can EGR, 6 pin AFM)
- 76 1/2 harness (micro-switch, mechanical EGR, 7 pin AFM)
- 77-78 (+ 79 Fed) harness (mechanical EGR, 7 pin AFM)
- 79 CA harness (O2 sensor, resistor pack built into harness instead of
module on firewall, 7 in AFM).
