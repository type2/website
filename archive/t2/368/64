Something about the threads being wrong. Use at your own risk.

Also - check that hose regularly. Noticed my 5 year old, stored in the dark 
grease gun has a hose that is cracked all over badly and will be replaced 
soon.

Hate to have you (or anyone) use that hose and have it rot and burst 
causing a mess and a fried engine. Remember - check every five years! <grin>
