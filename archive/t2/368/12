Subject: Input Shaft

Ooops. It's 5:00 AM in CA, and I just woke up from a sound sleep and
realized I forgot to grease the tranny input shaft splines before putting
the engine/tranny back in last night. I don't think the clutch disk actually
travels back and forth on the shaft during operation...can I get away with
this? I'd hate to have to rally my crew to R&R the engine again....


Thanks,
