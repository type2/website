It really sounds like I could screw the sender into the case fine if it
were not for a clearance issue of the tin. In looking at the sender the
threads look tapered like NPT to me. I am going to try some pipe tomorrow
after work and see how it goes. I have NPT taps and dies and pipes so I
think an adapter. Plus I have never seen a sending unit of this type that
was not with tapered threads so I have to believe that the sender and the
case are NPT. If they are not tapered what keeps the stock unit from
working loose?
