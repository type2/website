Large heat-shring  hoses ARE available.  But could they be used to repair

Or the 2"-> .75" diameter for 2X48" for $87.25 tubing??

or the 1" -> .5"  diameter for 5x6" for $4.35!!

Heck, you don't even need much more than 4 x 2" pieces for the four ends of 
the two hoses in question.  Heat shrink those ends  and they are going to 
stay...
