Subject: Engine In!

The deed is done! My avp rebuild is finally in the bus.  It took four guys
(and one chick running the grill) to get it done.  It took a while to jockey
into place, and we R&Red the moustache bar twice. It was kind of a bitch
with four of us (well three actually going at it); I can't imagine doing a
T4 alone like some folks talk about.  Well, my hydrualic jack is kind of
half-assed.  Hopefully it will be running by Friday...
