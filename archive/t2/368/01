Hello Jason,

I had to "make" the molded vacuum hoses using
appropriate lengths of heater hose and plumbing elbows
from LOWE$. When I get my didigal camera out, I will
take pictures of them. I just used hose clamps and
large wire ties to make the connections stable. At
first, I tried to use long lengths of heater hose to
replace these molded vacuum lines but I had to make
them very large to keep the sharp curves from
colasping. I did not like this so I used the elbows to
compensate for the sharp curves. This makes them
sturdier, neater, and less likely to collapse from
vacuum. When I take the pictures of these hoses, I
will let you know what sizes of heater hose I used and
what type and size of elbows I used. So far, this
seems to work and they hold vacuum fine. Have a great
day!
