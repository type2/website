Subject: Re: [T2] Engine In!

Working in a garage with a nice smooth concrete floor and a proper jack, I
wouldn't hesitate to remove and replace a TypeIV engine by myself.  Heck,
even on my rough asphalt driveway, on a hill, I've removed and replaced
engines many times, usually with the assistance of only my wife.  It sounds
like you installed the engine without everything attached since there's no
way to remove and replace the moustache bar with the heat exchangers in
place.  Yes, that bar has a "front" and a "back"!
