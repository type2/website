I finally did get my new axle beam in, and mostly everythings ok, 
except that now my brakes are incredibly stiff - standing on them only 
moves them a couple inches.  I've checked every vac line, and all is 
well there.  Wondering where to check next.  Everything went back in 
smoothly, I've double checked all connections, now just wondering if 
there is something I might have missed.

Thanks for all the help this week to those who responded to all my 
posts.
