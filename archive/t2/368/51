Count the no. of threads in 20mm. If you had 13+ a hair what you have is 
20/13.3= 1.5 mm per thread. A simple scale is all you need to do this, as 
well as confirm the diameter.

For sure, you could get the proper die from Samstag Sales. I have an axle 
die rethreading set. It includes most but not all the large metric sizes. 
These are designed not to cut, but reform damaged threads. Should be 
available at least by special order at most FLAPS. For sure NAPA has them. 
Otherwise, tool jobbers serving industrial and commercial mechanics will 
have them either as sets or individuals.

Do a Google or Dogpile search for "Axle Reforming Dies, Metric".
