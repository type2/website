When I installed the pressure switch in my 2 liter I put that piece of
tin in a drill press with a circular saw. then simply cut a circle the
proper size in it. The sender then nicely will screw directly into the
case. No extra fittings to leak & leaves a nice stock look. The only
thing I haven't done is to find a good plug to fill in the area
between the tin & sender.
