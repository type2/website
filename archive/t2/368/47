Less than an ohm through the connection is ok. You will always have some 
ohms in your test wires by themselves. Connect your test leads and wires as 
a loop, record the ohms, then subtract those from your test for a true 
value for the circiut being tested. The 77 may have a "zero" feature. You 
hook up your test leads/wires, push zero, then check the circuit for direct 
readout with the test equipment ohms already subtracted.

That is verification of poor contact. Clean the tags bright with a wire 
brush. Use a pliers very carefully to squeeze the pushon terminal "wings". 
If they are very old they may crack and break, rather than bent. If they do 
brake then replacing them with quality terminals may well fix you. If they 
will bend just a bit, don't need much, push it back on. It should take a 
bit of force to push back on. If not, it's soft or cracked and needs 
replacement.
