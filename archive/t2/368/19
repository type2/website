Subject: RE: [T2] looking for 74 stove picture

hello all list

by the best luck i found a replacement for my top stainless steel!!!

I found that my stove is a brand name MARTIN, so i guess its not a true
westfalia.

I found that in a little camping shop in a small town, and for 40 $ CAd i
could have the replacement part!!

The guy had an identical used stove behind the counter in perfect shape he was
willing to sell 75 $ CAD! he says they still sell those stove for RV and the
price NEW is 119 $ CAD.

Now with more stove picture i could tell if westfalia put these "martin" kind
in there 74 cabinet or if mine was not stock and someone swapped them before
with the true westy one...

ive search all the web but cant find any place or picture about 74 westy
equipement... and all other westy also nothing about the westy equipement
could be found on the web!!

ill post picture as soone as i get some!

thx for your help
mike
