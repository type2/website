Subject: Bus wheels?

Hey guys,
	
	I've got the set of wheels that have the VW chrome (aluminum) hub
caps on them. I was just curious, are the wheels themselves supposed to be
black, or are they supposed to be the same color as the body of the car?
Right now they're black, and they look a little ghetto used Crown Vic police
car looking.

You can see what i mean at: http://community.webshots.com/user/todd82ta
