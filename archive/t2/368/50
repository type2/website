For sure, if you want the benefit of higher torque and horsepower from the 
2L, use the larger clutch that is designed to hold up to this higher 
stress. It's the only prudent course. Know as well that the later 2L 
trannies are also a bit more robust, and your 72 tranny has become out of 
spec. If you use all that extra power most the time with full throttle 
through the gears it just will not hold up as long as the stronger tranny. 
In fact, if that 72 tranny has a lot of wear the sudden increase in stress 
from this swap could mean tranny problems soon. The first time you put 10 
more hp on it than it has ever seen or ever was designed for it could go 
"CA-CHUNK". Certainly the wear curve will speed up. Let's face it, what 
good is seat of the pants horsepower if you can't use it without breaking 
something??? Not trying to scare you but all compromises allow higher risks 
of issues and costs unanticipated in the budget.
