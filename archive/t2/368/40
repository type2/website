; We have a 72 bus and are using the original 72 tranny, but are putting a
74
>> or 75 2000cc in it 

>Is it a later 2.0L or a 1.8L from 74/75?"


>Umm, a minor point here but the 2.0L started August 75 (I just found this
out as I was look up my engine which is a pre-Aug 75) so a 75 could be a
2000, at least to my understanding. It should be easy to tell by the two
letter start of the case 

 

i put a 2liter in my '72 bus.  I changed the bell housing  to the 091so I could yous the large 228 mm flywheel and clutch.  Also used the the starter from a '76 - '79 bus.  ( sr87X)
