Subject: Re: 14 inch versus 15 inch - perhaps another SoCal source??

	Hey there, Good List!

	All this recent chat 'n gabfest WRT to sources of non-stock-size
rims for buses reminded me of a dusty ol' biz card I had pinned up somewhere
on my dusty ol' pin board of fame...

	Back in the day when I was all about things Type 3, I had some
custom off-set 14 x 7 rims built for my '69 Squareback, to go along with
some 14 x 6 rims I had purchased in the mid-70s down in Orange County, CA.
The shop that built the 14 x 7s was called (drum roll, please...):

	Custom & Commercial Wheel (-at-) 14278 Valley Blvd., La Puente, CA  91746

	The phone number listed on the card is (818) 961-4435, and it dates
from the halcyon days when Los Angeles ONLY had 2 (count 'em 2) area codes.
Proceed at yer own risk.  I miss the old "2 area codes only" days - whadda
we have now, like eleventy-three area codes in Los Angeles county alone?
Long time Los Angeles area listees - 'member when you could just tell people
your telephone number w/ no area code?  'Member calling family living 5
miles away and not having to practically invoke international calling
rituals?  'Member when Baskin-Robbins REALLY did have 31 flavors?

	As I recall my conversations with the folks there - they were
capabable of using either customer supplied centers or their own, and mix
mastering them with rim diameters of the customer's choosing...  Prices were
reasonable enough (then) for me on my meager public servant's wages (want to
say like $25-30 a copy) - so this current talk of $100 a pop for rims made
my ears fibrillate...

	Finding tires to fit is your own responsibility - I have no support
or affiliation for tire national socialism or it's proponents, exponents,
advocates, heirs, assigns, or successors, etc...
