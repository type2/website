Ahhhh! Noooo! Take it from someone who daily job includes fighting corrosion
on metal surfaces: DO NOT steel wool it! This will leave behind mild steel
imbedded in your stainless, which will rust like crazy! Try bronze wool, or
a Scotchbrite-style pad very gently. Be warned, however that this will leave
behind very small scratches in the direction you rub, resulting in more of a
"satin" finish. There are many stainless polishes and cleaners (I prefer
"Brite!"), available to help remove stains while keeping a gloss finish.
Another product used often in the marine industry is called "FSR".
(Fibreglass Stain Remover) In addition to being an excellent cleaner for
fibreglass (take note pop-top owners), it also works well for removing
stains on stainless. One caveat about using FSR, though: It works so well,
be prepared to do the whole area that you are working on to avoid clean
spots. These products are available at marine supply stores, or any good
hardware store.

Cheers,
Matthew
