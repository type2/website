Subject: Re: [T2] Metric or NPT was VDO oil Pressuse adapter question

Hey there Volks,

Steve Dolan has the VDO oil pressure switch installed w/o an adaptor in one of
his buses. In fact here's some pics:

http://www.everybus.com/dworkin/steve/ and click on the 914 Oil pressure sender
installation pics.

IIRC, he trimmed the tin in place, and said it didn't take much to get it to
fit. You can probably find Steve's post that goes along with the pics in the
archiv... ahhh... here's a post from steve on the subject:

You can also search on - Oil pressure sender, 914 oil temp sender plate and
vacuum - which will return another thread on the subject.

I'm using the VDO adapter hose, but Steve's solution looks alot cleaner.
