Subject: Vacuum Hose NLA??

How about . . .   'make do'  ?  ?


Quoted from someone: "Yes, all but two. The NLA molded hose from the s-boot 
to the decel valve and
the NLA molded hose from the s-boot to the oil breather."


Problem:  The ends of the Vacuum hoes tend to get cracked with age (like me) 
and tend to leak (like me).

There is no know replacement (NOT like me) vacuum hoses.  What to do...


Well, cut back 1.5 inches from the cracked end of the hose (NO!! NO!! 
please, NOT ME !!) and filp the 1.5 inch piece around 180 degrees, so the 
fresh cut end attaches to the s-boot or the decel valve or the oil breather. 
   Then slip a sleeve in the cracked end on the 1.5 inch piece, and the 
remaining body of the hose.  Liberally apply 3-M adhesive to the sleeve and 
hose sections.  (It would be GREAT if there was some HEAT SHRINK TUBING that 
would be large enough to cover these vacuum hoses.  BTW, what ARE the OD of 
these two hoses..   And the OD of the decel valve tube and the oil breather 
tube..))

Where to get that 'sleeve'??  How about the 'Y' at the S-Boot!!  just 
hacksaw the two 'Y' pieces off, trim and finish the newly;y formed sleeves.  
You HAVE been saving those 'Y' pieces from your scavenger runs, right??  
Even if you don't save the S-Boot, which you should, because you never know 
when mine might break/crack and I would need one...   :-)  you are probably 
saving a LOT of misc pieces, like the 'Y's.

And you probably figured out by now that these old, cracked vacuum lines 
really might have a few inches of re-usable life tot hem.

Remember, these FI bay window VWs have been on the road for almost 25-30 
years, and we only need to keep them going for another 4-5 years when the 
new VW concept micro hits the streets...

PS.  If anyone tries this let me know if it works, OK ? ? ?
