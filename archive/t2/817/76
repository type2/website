Subject: Re: [T2] Stainless Steel Exhaust

A couple of people have flipped the heat exchangers around to make them face 
to the rear(manifold pipes only, no HE), then welded on stainless mufflers. 
Quck and dirty...

Did some searching but all the notes on stainless exhaust options are at
least a year old.

Are there options out there for going all stainless(sans heat
exchangers...while the idea of getting these fabbed in SS excites me, the
cost of such a project surely deflates me)
