<<Not sure why you are not understanding this. The parcel tray is
netting. You repair it by duplicating the pattern using fishing line
like you would crochet a lace doily.>>


Why do I have a hard time understanding this one?

I don't Karl--except the monofilament is awfully hard plastic to be Ron
Popeiling the net back together---

Nylon, maybe---

Why not just stop at a fabric store, or a fishing tackle shop---a ships
store would have the netting.

You must think your in Tahiti, or Hawaii---

If you have enough spare time to be crocheting a parcel tray net back
together---stop by--I have some work for you to do-- ~: )

This whole idea reflects back to the making of your own book shelf--who
has the time?

Not me----
