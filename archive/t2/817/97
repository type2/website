        Should be....... Winter rustproof -- Rotisserie

Count me in!  Looks like you did a super job on a 'challenging' project! If you 
have 50+ images, perhaps you could put the best of them on CD and make the CD 
available for a few bucks.

It's evident that you invested a considerable amount (dollars, time) in the 
rotisserie.  What happened to it when you finished your restoration?  I'm 
guessing from dot-ca that you are in Canada... right?

Here is a better picture of the rotisserie in my driveway.

Would you all like a webpage made of ALL the pics I have of this thing?
I think there are about 50+ pictures at various stages...  Collie
