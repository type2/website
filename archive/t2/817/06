Subject: Re: 1965 Beetle front wheel aligment problems

As I said all I was asking for it is a decent steering behavior untill I can 
find the remain parts that I need to repair the front end of my 65, since in 
this very rigth moment I have to use it like spare car (yes my wife car not 
only has a spare tire when the things going bad it also has a spare car, my 
beloved bug).
First at all I would like to thanks fo Bill, Tom, No Quarter and all the 
people that help me this time as well an apologie to the Type 2 list for the 
not bus context but I could no resist, you are a huge source of wisdom.
Yesteday when  I wrote the note I was tired and desesparte but today with 
the help of all of you and the manuals I made my self to fix the problem to 
the point that the car has a normal and I said normal not perfect behavior, 
so it can be used for a while until I fix the hole thing and then to a 
profesional alingment shop.
One more time thanks

Roberto
