We rolled a late Westy over on it's side by passing a tow rope around a 
door post and pulling hard (but gently) with my '84 Rabbit convertible. 
Not a method I'd recommend for a Westy you plan to keep in good 
condition... We were stripping it for the junkyard. We did roll my 
Beetles up on two wheels many times with friends. Easy to balance on 
flat ground. No, wouldn't crawl under it though... HOWEVER I like the 
idea of a rotisserie! Will do this someday if I do a major restoration 
to my bus. Am planning a small one for my Beetle project if I ever 
restart that project. Chris
