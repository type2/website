Subject: Re: [T2] Winter rustproof -- Rotisserie?

Does anyone on the list have experience with a 'Rotisserie' device?  IIRC this 
looks something like two large-scale engine assembly stands, facing each 
other.  You bolt the support arms to the chassis, maybe at the bumper bracket 
bolting points, and then rotate the vehicle around a horizontal (front-to-back) 
axis.  Rotisseries show up on eBay infrequently... used to be advertised in 
Hemmings... never saw one up close, though.  Again, does anyone on the list 
have experience with the 'Rotisserie' device?

Thanx and have a great Thursday.... Glenn

I find it much easier to roll it onto its side, just remember to remove
the rearview mirror before rolling it over...
