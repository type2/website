Hi Zach-
 This same thing happened on my '75...  What was happening is that the 
seals in the master cylinder were wearing out and brake fluid was slowly 
leaking into the power brake booster. It eventually got so bad that I 
couldn't move without the brakes engaging. As a temporary fix, I 
disconnected vacuum line going to the power brake booster and plugged 
it. I didn't have power brakes, meaning it took a little effort to 
stop.. but at least I was back in control of them.

Later, when I pulled the master cylinder and brake booster, the booster 
was filled about 1/4 full with brake fluid. I got a new master cylinder 
and a good used brake booster and they work great now.

The engine is connected to the booster by a long vacuum line that runs 
down the left side of the bus's frame. If you still have your stock fuel 
injection in your '75 it connects to a vacuum "T" that comes out of the 
left side of your air distributor (that round thing on the top of the 
engine that has the 4 manifold pipes coming out of it). You can 
disconnect it and plug the connection with a creative solution ( the 
handle of a turkey basting brush works nicely) . Be ready to get a good 
leg workout when stopping. Another thing to consider is that the long  
vacuum line that  runs  to the booster often develops leaks.  You might 
also want to check that the one way valve in this vacuum line is working 
properly. You should be able to blow through it one way and air will 
pass, but flip it around and blow through it and no air should pass.

Hope this helps,
