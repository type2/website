Actually none of them look quite like the original, although ours is
relatively close. AFAIK an exact duplicate is no longer available. When last
I ordered one from the "original" supplier, it turned out to be the very
same Taiwanese made repro that I can get cheaper elsewhere. Except for one
difference ... the "made in Taiwan" sticker had mysteriously disappeared.
