Now here comes the BIG question-----
 
How in the Sam Hill did you manage to repair that thar parcel tray with
fishing line?
 
Blue or clear monofilament, ?  
 
 Twine or rope??
 
 Ohh----You meant fish netting---
 
 I like to see this tray repaired with blue monofilament fishing line
myself---
 
 This is a lost art --making your own fish net Ya know---

I have an old set of them. Pumpkin orange netting!

Ever do crochet or tatting?  That is how you repair it. 

Not the Bus Depot plastic one, the Bus Boys copy:
