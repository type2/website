Tom,

You can use a sandwich plate adapter. It mounts between the oil filter
takeoff and the filter. It has a crude thermostat built in, I think they are
made by mocal but the package says empi. I have one at our shop I can have a
look at tomorrow for the part number, and yes, you can still use a good
filter, it will hang about 1" lower.
