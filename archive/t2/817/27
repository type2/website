Thanks Greg,
That's exactly what I was looking for.
I will print it on mat finish photo paper using a HP photo printer and will 
use a clock movement with a long reach spindle so it won't need to be dished.
Not sure what glue I will use yet.
Regarding clocks on ebay $40 is not in my budget for such a luxury item which 
is why I am attempting the DIY solution which should be practically $0 in 
cost since the movements are rather inexpensive.
Thanks for all the responces and ideas.
Rusty
