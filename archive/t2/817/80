(or at least will be when most of you read this)...

Check out what I found in my 1973 VW Bus tonight. I'm sanding and painting the
inside of the Bus. I removed the dash again and started to use the air hose to
get all the dirt and dust out, and I heard this rattling around in the front
compartment along with a bunch of pennies (some of them wheat pennies).

Please... I don't mean this to start a political conversation, so everyone
PLEASE be respectful. But... I thought it was kind of cool and figured some of
you would get a kick out of it!!!
