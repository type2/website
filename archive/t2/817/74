Subject: Stainless Steel Exhaust

Did some searching but all the notes on stainless exhaust options are at
least a year old.

Are there options out there for going all stainless(sans heat
exchangers...while the idea of getting these fabbed in SS excites me, the
cost of such a project surely deflates me)

My bus is a 75, the exhaust is....hmmm okay.  Its pretty much completely
rusty and is one of the many "upgrades" I plan to make to the bus.  Since
I plan on using the bus heavilly for long trips and being a soggy NW
resident, I am trying to go with the long term plan which is to replace
things with high quality reliable parts so I can replace it once and not
have to worry about it for a couple of years.

Does anyone know where I can find something like this?  Bob made several
posts about carrying SS stuff a few years ago but it would appear that
these are no longer available on BD.

Thanks again!


Oh and thanks for all the Glovebox info and the strap!  I installed it
last night and it fits.....*ahem* like a glove.
