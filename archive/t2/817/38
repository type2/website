Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Parcel trays

I was into it for awhile, then I bailed.  On the second day I was thinking,
"what else is there to be said about parcel trays?"

So I clicked a random "parcel trays" email on the screenful of them and read
about Chinese environmental practices, and I knew then, that the buslist was
taking the discussion on its natural, logical course.

I get all my political news from the list.

Anybody even see my slider door post?
