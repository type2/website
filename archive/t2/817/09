Subject: Two color scheme - interior color ?

Hello to you all...

I know this may be a stupid question, but when using a two color scheme in a
'68 bus (for instance, blue and white) what should be the color for painting
it inside, before mounting the interior panels? Should it also be a two color
scheme, or only white (if white is the upper color)?

Thanks in advance...
Best regards from Portugal...
(It's hard for me to get help in this small country....)
