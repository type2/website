Good price, Good find.

Now here comes the BIG question-----

How in the Sam Hill did you manage to repair that thar parcel tray with
fishing line?

Blue or clear monofilament, ?  

Twine or rope??

Ohh----You meant fish netting---

I like to see this tray repaired with blue monofilament fishing line
myself---

This is a lost art --making your own fish net Ya know---
