Subject: Re: [T2] Winter rustproof -- Rotisserie?

<< I've been a bit concerned about using a rotisserie while welding in
new panels (especially structural ones). How do you ensure that you
haven't introduced a twist into the body when it's suppored only by the
rotisserie, and it's tilted on its side?>>

You weld stiffeners in the area that your removing.
Do your work, then remove the stiffeners.
