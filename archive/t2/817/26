Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Parcel trays

I've used my parcel trays for 34 years- any holes that developed were 
repared with dental floss doubled into a large needle- you "purse 
string" around the hole for small ones and criss-cross over large ones.
Worked fine and holds a knot much better than monofilament.  BTW, cut 
shelf liners from naugahyde to fit inside and resist pencils falling 
through or something catching and ripping it when grabbed from the shelf.

Not sure why you are not understanding this. The parcel tray is
  netting. You repair it by duplicating the pattern using fishing line
  like you would crochet a lace doily.>>
