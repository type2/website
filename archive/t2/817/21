Subject: Re: [T2] Clock ideas for Bus

I've never seen an actual bus clock.  A couple of questions...

Are the hands exposed, or is there a clear lens covering them?

If there is a clear lens, is it an integral part of the clock, or a separate
item that fits into the cup on the dash before you install the clock?

Thanks.
