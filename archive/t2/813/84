Subject: Are replacement body panels larger than the old ones?

Someone mentioned that the new rocker panels etc, are made larger to fit
over the original ones. I am wondering if this is true? I want to get same
size replacements and cut the old ones out then weld in new ones. Ron, or
someone, could you please advise? Also Ron, what is shipping going to be for
a set of rocker panels and inside rocker panels for a 77 Westy going to cost
via US Mail to B.C. Canada?

Thanks,

Courtney
