Subject: Re: [T2] BN4 heater inside bus

<<under NO 
circumstances should you put one of those heaters INSIDE your bus. 

I'd have to agree. But weren't these mounted in the engine compartment?
Same place the fresh air for the heat comes from anyway? 
Regardless, I'd rather see you make a frame and mount it on the roof or
something... >>


Really?

Check out the Plat Cat

It exhausts outside the vehicle.
