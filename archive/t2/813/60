Please don't forget that Propane (LP gas) is heavier than air and gas
leaks will settle to the lowest point in a room or space. Like where
pilot lights live. NFiPA 54 (Int'l Fuel Gas Code) states that all open
combustion appliances must be located a minimum of 18" above the floor
in a garage. Gasoline vapors are also heavier than air. Even efficient
combustion has trace gases, that while not poisonous, can displace
enough oxygen to cause asphyxiation. OD sensors are like idiot lights.
If it's on, it could be too late.

Everyone talks poorly about attorneys. Until they need one. (No, I am NOT!
;-)

Bus content? It's not advisable to use open combustion fuel fired
equipment in an enclosed space, like a Westy.  No matter how leaky. No
matter if you're in Canada or the US. Get a big dog or a real fluffy
sleeping bag!
