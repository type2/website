Subject: RE: [T2] Are replacement body panels larger than the old ones?

Courtney,

That someone would have been me. They are not necessarily oversized, but
some are. Rule of thumb: if it is an OEM piece it is most likely not
oversized. If it is a cheap Dutch or Danish repro it most likely is. It does
not matter for rocker panels since you have quite a bit of room to maneuver
anyway. It does matter, however, for panels that go in between others - e.g.
doglegs.

Someone mentioned that the new rocker panels etc, are made larger to fit
over the original ones. I am wondering if this is true?
