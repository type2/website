Perhaps not.  The strobe flashers have their own time base and their
strobe rate is probably not critical.  A timing light gets its signal from
the ignition.  What we are debating here is whether there is a time delay
between the high voltage signal in the ignition and the flash of the
flasher.

Even if a cheaper timing light has a delay, it would probably be
consistant.  Compare it against a known standard and figure out the
correction factor!
