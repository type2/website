Subject: Re: [T2] Westfalia: Baywindow or Vanagon?

Baywindows or Vanagon is the wrong question, the question is where you 
want to go ?
I like route 66 so much for example, I imagine that  the 66 signs along 
the road is actually the speed limit, perfect for my vanagon !!!
California 101 is too much for my vanagon , can't hold the speed that 
much !!! ,  if you baywindow or Vanagon is super loaded , you can still 
take the coastal California highway 1 !! ;-))))
