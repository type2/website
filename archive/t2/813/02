Hi Don,

I hope it's just an electrical fluke and not a problem. The only time
I ever had my oil light come on at freeway speed was when I had
thermal breakdown of the oil at 280 degrees.

 One thing at a time. Interesting thing though... The light doesn't come on
 when coming off the freeway or idling or anything, but if I'm maintaining
 speed every so often it will come on for a few seconds, then go off. Really
 bizarre. RPMs don't seem to matter. I'm monitoring to see if I can find a
 pattern. Otherwise it works beautifully.
