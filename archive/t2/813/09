No way graphite is abrasive!  It is one of the softest minerals with a
score of 1-2 on the Mohs scale.  Some think that graphite is abrasive
because they think that pencil "lead" is graphite.  In reality the "lead"
is a mixture of clay and carbon.

For years I've used a spray can of graphite in a solvent carrier given to
me by a friendly locksmith.  Works a treat in all my locks.

The only caution is with things electrical.  Graphite is a conductor.
