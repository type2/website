Finally read something on this site that made me angry! Even allowing 
for Eisenstein and the wave function effect across the metal/metal 
boundary (if you don't know what these are, buy a very thick physics 
book), for the time it takes the electronics to react to affect the 
perceived timing by one degree (i.e. all the electrical delays in the 
timing light leading to a delay in the flash), you would have to be 
running your engine at 115 thousand rpm (above 6000 rpm or so the 
flashes would start to appear continuous anyway, so this is academic). 
The biggest delay in measuring timing (even with a cheap light) is the 
processing inside the brain, and the time it takes the light to travel 
from the gun to the pulley wheel and then to your eye.

Email me direct if you want the calculations, but I'm just off on 
holiday, so don't hold your breath.
