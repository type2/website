Apparently that's the ingredient they patented back in the 80's. I can't tell from the MSDS exactly how much is in a bottle and the contents smell overwhelmingly of solvents.

Lookin up the MSDS is interesting. The contentrate contains by volume:

Distillates, hydrotreated light	 64742-47-8	 < 50 %weight
Stoddard solvent	 8052-41-3	 < 35 %weight
Solvent naphtha, light aromatic	 64742-95-6	 5 - 10 %weight
Benzene, 1,2,4-trimethyl-	 95-63-6	 1 - 5 %weight
Xylene 1330-20-7	 0.1 - 0.5 %weight

The plus version has slightly different percentages. Now look at the bulk techron that is added to gasoline:

Solvent naphtha (petroleum), light aromatic	 64742-95-6	 44 %weight
1,2,4-trimethylbenzene	 95-63-6	 < 15 %weight
01154100-5007P	 Trade secret	 < 6 %weight
Xylene	 1330-20-7	 < 2 %weight

Finally some secret ingredient. Why is it missing from the bottle? :-(
