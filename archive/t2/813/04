Subject: BN4 heater inside bus

Never received issue 5892 wasn't sure if I posted correctly; sorry about the 
double dipping...
Hello,
I was wondering if anyone on the list has mounted a BN4 heater inside their 
bus, yes I mean inside.  I was planing on this do to time constraints.  It is 
getting cold & rainy and I have no garage.  I do all my work on the curb. I 
do 
however have a great basement.  I was planning on building a frame out of 
copper tubing and angle iron.  I was also going to then mount a small gas 
container (from an old lawn tractor) on the frame along with the wiring and 
switch 
etc..  All I would have to do was connect to the battery.  I saw a "portable 
unit" on the web which was used as a tent heater.  
Also I would just drill 2 holes right though the floor (use some 1 1/2 metal 
flex tubing to get the exhaust angle right).  I have two units (one works and 
one does not). I could then take my time with the rear install using my parts 
unit (for alignment of ducting etc.).  
Has anyone done this or seen it done.  I've already started my frame. If this 
doesn't pan out at least I'll have a nice bench test setup.  Any advice would 
be appreciated.
Thanks.
