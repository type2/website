Following is an extremely amusing excerpt from somebody else's email, that I
thought worth keeping.  I am one of those that babies my engine along at 
50-60 mph though, today's fuels have a big bearing on this...

The Engineers at VW thought otherwise. You didn't see people babying the
type2 when it was new, did you? NO massive Factory
Recalls, No warnings from the dealer or statements in the owners manual,
saying:

 "CONGRATULATIONS ON THE PURCHASE OF YOUR NEW VOLKSWAGEN TYPE 2. NEVER NEVER
NEVER DRIVE THIS VEHICLE OVER 50MPH, OR WHEN THE OUTSIDE TEMP RISES ABOVE 60
DEG. OR YOU WILL VOID THE WARRANTY, BURN A VALVE, DROP A SEAT, HOLE A
PISTON, BURST INTO FLAMES, AND DIE A FLAMING DEATH, ALL WHILST HUMMING THE
HORST WESSEL SONG THAT HAS BEEN SUBLIMINALLY IMPRINTED INTO YOUR
SUBCONSCIOUS BY OUR SUPERIOR SINGLE SPEAKER SAPPHIRE AM RADIO. HAVE A NICE
DAY.!!!"

Cruising speed numbers can vary for a number of reasons.  If I went by my
speedometer I would say that I cruise at 75MPH in my meximotored '71.  If
I apply a "testosterone factor" to that number I would brag about 85MPH
on the lists.  The GPS tells a different story: 62MPH.

The reality is that I cruise between 58 and 62MPH.  The bus feels
comfortable at that speed and that makes me feel good.
