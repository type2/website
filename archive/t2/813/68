> Terry,
Glad to hear that it works well for you.  Not sure what the climate  
is where you are, but in the southern part of Australia which is cold  
& wet during winter ( read 6-7 months of the year) & humid during the  
Summer, oil is one of the worst things to put in an automotive--no,  
actually any lock here.  Oil & cold equal stuck wafers = no entry.   
We dread getting locks in at work that someone has 'oiled'.  The  
amount of work to clean them out & make them reliable is often as  
much as non-genuine replacement.

Of course there was the woman who used kitchen cooking oil. . . .
