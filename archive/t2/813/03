<<If a guy has a bunch of time on his hands, and doesn't mind crusin' at
a
monotonous at 50-60 mph all day the Bay's are neat.
Nice looking vehicles's and cozy for sure.

50-60? I do 70 here in the mountains...>>

Keep the hammer down Don.

I did, and ate a couple of valve seats.
The Air cooled rides don't like extended WFO trips, and most certainly
don't enjoy the Pike's Peak Rally.

 
<<A real pain to work on,but doable.

Eh?  I'd rather work on my bus than my Volvo any day!>>

Good.
Glad you enjoy the Ruebic's Cube.

Biggest pain in the ass engine to work on ever--( What engine? You have
to be a tinsmith prior to even getting close to the engine)

12 cylinder Detroit Diesels are toy blocks in comparison, small block
Chevy's are like an erector set.
A Vanagon?
A blind man could do one in a day.

Nope--one suitcase engine and done.
Morto.
Finito.
 
<<The 80 to 83.5 Vanagon's gained some creature comforts, but it's
pretty
much the same snails pace on the road.
Same pain to work on the engine's.
78 Westys have nearly identical interiors.>>

Really?

I'm sorry I didn't know they opened up and squared things off in the
interior of 78-79 Westy.
Got rid of them horribly uncomfortable kitchen chair type seats and all.

I Must have been looking at a Citroen or something else with a Pop top.

<<<AC was available. And with the upgraded compressors available at Bus
Depot they don't suck much power.>>>

Really?

I must have some terrible running wasserleaker's, or your running the
bottle on your air cooled engine with the AC on.
Anytime I see a cop with radar pointed at me I just turn the AC on.
Faster than the brakes.
Huh--run the Bus up the mountains at 70 mph with the air on and no
melted valves or seats?
You must have done the titanium valve's and hardened seats awhile back
Don.
Put a load on that engine all day up a hill, it'll put them into nuclear
meltdown faster than Jackie Robinson.
Unless the Reverend Ainsley Faith Healed you and the motor.

<< Yes, "real" heat would be nice, but that can be achieved in a bay as
well.>>

Yea, with a propane heater heater running while your driving.
Not around here anyway.

I'm talking about actual winter temperatures.
0 on an below

Not just 40 degree's above zero.
Winter?

That's spring around here.-- ~; )

<< Can't compare FI systems though. I prefer the Jetronic series to the
Digijet series personally, but I doubt there's much difference
performance wise.>>

Digijet is a bit simpler to diagnose and keep running right.
A 1.9 automatic will fly past a 2.0 stick or auto, and stay in front for
a long time.
 
<<I could drop a Raby engine in a bay and get the power. As for
monster... Weren't you just saying they were easier to work on than a
bay?>>


Ask Mr. Raby to build you an Air cooled engine that will compete with a
Zeteg Vanagon Swap.

He'll have a hard time keeping up with 700 horses.

I'm using this just because you want a new engine--so do I.
 

<<We could debate this all day, but preferences will remain. Either way
we're talking about decades old vehicles that will require lots of
attention unless they've been meticulously cared for. A bucket Vanagon
and a bucket Bay will both be PITAs until lots of time and money have
been invested. Water or air.>>

I been doing that, and having fun at it too---
What I have found to be pretty much true in VW Land from owning and
operating on both engines, and vehicles is;
Air cooled requires allot more money and time than the water buffalo's.

Push them hard ---you pay.
No way around it.

Whereas, I have ran the snot outa my wasserleaker's and haven't had a
valve related failure --ever.
Had a couple of hoses blow, but that was my fault for not changing the
125,000 mile old hoses prior to flogging the snot outa the Van.

Preventative maintenance does pay off.

<<<(BTW: I'm just teasin' ya about the engine work differences. heh)>>


Too Late Don, I'm still sticking with the V-12 Detroit--: )

Adios,
