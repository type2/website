For those of you who went to Everybus this year, you remember that the
days were beautiful, but the nights were in the upper 30's and lower 40's.
 We would have been super uncomfortable had it not been for our buddy
heater.

We just cracked a window 1/2" and put the buddy on the floor between the
seats, heat rises, so my wife and I and baby Sofia stayed nice and warm. 
We did have problems with the water accumulation on the windows, but that
was really a minor nuisance really.

The Oxygen Depletion System (ODS) is what sold us on the buddy heater. 
Basically, you can't kill yourself if you follow the instructions and
provide a vent for outside air.  And if you don't, the ODS shuts it down.

The Portable Buddy uses an Oxygen Depletion System (ODS) which is a safety
device used to light the heater as well as shut it off if Oxygen levels
drop to
between 18% and 19%. The Buddy should operate without any problems up to
7000 FT
above sea level. At higher altitudes, the ODS may cut-off prematurely
resulting
