Few modern cars have setting like in the old days!  No carb needles, valve
settings, timing or dwell to deal with.  Modern "technicians" ("mechanic"
seems to have gone the way of the dinosaurs) just plug the thing into the
computer and replace the components the computer says to replace.
Diagnosing problems by sound, smell, and feel is becoming a lost art.
