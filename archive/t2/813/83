Subject: RE: [T2] Oil Screen Screw - 2L motor

Regarding what am I going to do... if it's broken and the piece is sloshing
around in the sump - I'll have to rebuild.  

Right now I want to get a better handle on the issue.  I'm thinking that
maybe the bolt was not tightened enough and/or the silicon gasket is not
sealing correctly and I don't have an issue with it being over torqued.  

If it was torqued too much - I guess what I don't want to do is make it
worse - it's only a slow leak.  But then again, if the case has a crack -
it's not going to get any better.  Like I said, I'd like to know if I have
something truly to worry about.

One other question - my oil drain plug is really hard to get out (it's one
of those allen wrench ones) and I'm not sure how hard I should try to get it
out... could I possibly do other damage to the case?

I meant to say oil pickup. The bolt is between the inner push rod tubes.

What are you going to do if you find out that it's broken? Tear down the
engine or keep driving?
