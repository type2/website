Subject: Aftermarket heater control boxes?

Has anyone used the aftermarket heater control boxes as sold by cip or others? What is the quality like? I've just discvoered that the "chimney" or mushroom on top of mine are rusted through. Does this affect their performance?? I still haven't quite determined what this is for.
