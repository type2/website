I can give a few reasons for this.

1. The number of lawyers was considerably less than it is now.  Hence, the
number of disclaimers was also less.
2. Warranty periods were shorter.  VW didn't care if your heads packed
it in in 50K miles when the warranty was only 12,500 miles.
3. Brand new engines had all the cooling tin and flaps in place  They
cooled better than the typical engine sold now.
4. The average driver had more common sense.  No car built then would take
being driven uphill on a long 6% grade at WOT on a 104 degree day.
5. Those same drivers would take the claims of "top speed is the cruising
speed" with a grain of salt.


I'm a 60MPH on the flat, 3/4 throttle uphill kind of guy.  On a 400 mile
trip this means that I get another half-hour or so to enjoy driving a bus!
