Subject: Re: [T2] BN4 heater inside bus

Hi Tony,

Our family had a 1971 westy back in 1980... After the first winter of  
driving it Dad installed a BN-2 heater at the passengers feet and  
ducted it into the riser pipe below the dash. It worked very well at  
defrosting the windshield and with a partition behind the driver's  
seat it kept the cab comfortable.

Happy trails,
