Okay so I don't have a picture but I am not sure what this strap you speak
of is supposed to look like?

when I look into the hole where my glovebox is....I see no strap(I am
assuming that this strap runs vertically from the bottom middle up around
the back and connects to the top)  If so the strap is not there.
