I've had mine switch off on me a few times, probably because I had it in a 
corner.  But even so, I would never use it overnight. A couple I knew of 
died in their tent using a conventional propane heater. Some other friends 
of mine swear by it and leave their buddy on high all night in their truck 
camper with only a small window cracked. Scary thing was that their CO 
detector went off during the night and it didn't even wake them up. Yikes!
