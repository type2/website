Subject: Sliding door and rear hatch panels

On an 1971 westy : are the chrome pins (rivets ?)  that hold the
sliding door and rear hatch panels reusable ? Do they pop out ? Is
there a source for them in case I break some while removing the panels
?

The goal is to sound-proof these inside and cut new plywood panels for
them. The original panels are rotten.

Thanks
