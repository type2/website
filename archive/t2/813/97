Are there any vanagon seats that will fit the '71 bay rails? If so, which
years should I look for?

Talking about reupholstering, I just recovered my z-bed with dark denim and
some quilted denim. So far it looks awesome! I am soo glad I don't have to
look at that torn vinyl anymore, and the dark blue denim looks awesome. It
was actually pretty easy, the hardest part was the folding the corners.

I will post some pics on my site when i get the chance.
