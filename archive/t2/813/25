Cruising speed numbers can vary for a number of reasons.  If I went by my
speedometer I would say that I cruise at 75MPH in my meximotored '71.  If
I apply a "testosterone factor" to that number I would brag about 85MPH
on the lists.  The GPS tells a different story: 62MPH.

The reality is that I cruise between 58 and 62MPH.  The bus feels
comfortable at that speed and that makes me feel good.
