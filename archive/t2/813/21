Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing motor mounts ( metal parts welded to frame )

Yeah that is what I was thinking.  The reason I was thinking of two 
bolts is because the mounts are angled towards the back of the bus some 
and if there was only one I could see it shifting.  With 2, one at the 
top left and one at the bottom right I could avoid the twist if the 
welds broke.  I patched the frame where I chewed it up taking out the 
old mount and don't think a couple bolts would compromise it more than 
my shoddy welding.  My hope is that I can keep it in until either I 
learn to weld better or have someone else do a proper job on them.
