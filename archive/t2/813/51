The Portable Buddy uses an Oxygen Depletion System (ODS) which is a safety
device used to light the heater as well as shut it off if Oxygen levels drop to
between 18% and 19%. The Buddy should operate without any problems up to 7000 FT
above sea level. At higher altitudes, the ODS may cut-off prematurely resulting
in what we call a nuisance shut-off. What happens is the molecular structure of
the air at higher altitudes may cause the air-flow in the pilot to increase and
blow the pilot flame off the thermocouple, causing the heater to automatically
shut-off. Also, if you have a change in weather and the barometric pressure
drops, this could also cause the heater to shut down prematurely.
