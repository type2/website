Subject: Starter sticking - 71 westy

71 Westy 1600 DP, single vac advance, single stock carb

I have had ongoing starting problems, think the first round was due to some 
hot start relay a PO installed that was shot. I replaced starter with a 
rebuilt guy and in transit the sylanoid got smashed and I replaced it with a 
new one, but sometimes the sylonaoid would not work and sometimes the 
starter would get stuck on the flywheel.

I just put in a brand new Bosch starter and the problem is it seems to 
randomly get stuck on the flywheel. The bushing that is in the housing is 
stuck, I could not get that sucker out so I left the old one in and Im 
assuming that bushing is the cause? Does that guy spin, what does it do? Is 
it just like a spacer? Any ideas how to get that guy out, I spent forever 
with various tools trying to get him out.  What else causes the starter to 
get stuck like this? Any ideas? Would love my bus to be a solid starting bus 
 runs great if you get the engine to life.

Thanks in advance.
