Subject: Re: [T2] Re: lock lubricant

John  we also use Tri-flow at work for most automotive locks.  This  
lube works great in normal day to day use if there is a good  dust  
cover and little chance of dust/grit/water entering the lock (most  
newer vehicles are OK in this regard).  In older vehicles where dust  
covers are damaged & not available for replacement or the lock  
barrels do not seal well & particularly in cold/wet environments, I  
still prefer something that is dry & does not 'hang on' to the dust/ 
grit like 'wet' lubricants.
I'm not knocking Tri-flow, it's a great product in normal usage.   
However, when the elements are being tough on a lock eg ice, rain,  
salt air, Graphite still wins hands down IMHO.
For those that think graphite is an abrasive, try working with it on  
your fingers regularly.  It is very sliippery and makes gripping  
small parts (read automotive lock wafers & springs) a real chore!!
