...never knew this, but that explains it.

I make xenon flashers for oceanographic recovery and warning applications,
If I take several exact units, same exact settings, etc, and power them up
at the exact same time with the one power supply, not one unit will flash at
the same rate as another unit due to the different tolerances in the
components in each unit. I'm sure this also applies to timing lights as
well.
