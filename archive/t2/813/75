Wow, 4 or 5 people being active at night in one bus; makes for the locals
thinking there is an earthquake judging by the way the bus is jumping around
 :-)

Hi Mark,

 

We camp with 4 or 5 people sleeping in the bus.... At EB2005 at night

the windows steamed up even with an electric heater in the bus.

 

IIRC it's typical for most people to exhale about a pint of water

overnight. More if they're active. ;-P
