Subject: Oil leak

I am trying to figue out where the oil leak on my 1976 van with a 2L is.  It
is dripping from the pressure control valve flange, below the oil filter
mounting flange where it meets the case.  I changed the oil cooler, and
torqued it to 60inlbs, and used new seals.  Up by the distributor, oil
pressure switch looks dry.  Are the oil filter flanges known to leak where
they meet the case? Also it looks like I will have to take the cooler off
again to getto the top nut on the flange, to check it sealing capabilities.

It drips a drop every 20 seconds, should I be worried?  Any advice would be
appreciated.

Eric
