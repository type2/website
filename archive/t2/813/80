Where is the bolt for the oil pump?  Are you suggesting that I try to turn
it to see if it's loose?

I guess I understand what can go wrong... I don't understand how to verify
if its gone bad already and what to do next if it did - besides a rebuild.

If the boss is cracked the bolt holding the oil pump may not tighten in the
threads.

Sometimes part of the boss cracks and falls off completely.
