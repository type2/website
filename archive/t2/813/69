Hello Eric    While you were in there doing the oil cooler seals did you do 
the fan seal and o ring?? You should have while you were there  .  You still 
can just by removing the fan and hub .   Also check or replace the oil filter   
Does your motor have the thermosta hooked up and is the wheel in place for the 
cable.  I have seen these left off and the case will leak from the pulley 
bolt not being there   later and have fun  Mark Dearing
