Subject: Replacing motor mounts ( metal parts welded to frame )

Long story short the PO put a late engine in the 69 Bus I bought and had 
to cut out the motor mount parts that are welded to the frame.  I have 
since acquired the parts and have them reinstalled and tack welded ( 
maybe more than tacked ).  I am not convinced I am able to get enough 
new welds since they were originally spot welded to the frame in 
numerous places.  Does anyone see a problem using 2 - 3 grade 8 bolts to 
reinforce the attachment through the frame member?  Would that hold the 
engine up in a failure of the welds which hopefully is unlikely?

Any advice is appreciated,
