I've never heard of or experienced this sort of delay.  It would be easy
to check for though.  After the timing is "all in" at, say 2500RPM, If you
were to rev the engine to 5000 you would see an variation of a couple of
degrees even though the distributor couldn't change its advance.

I don't think I'll be tossing my old Heathkit timing light, though.
