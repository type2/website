Subject: '70 sunroof Bus 4sale

Last month I started taking the train to work full time and now I need to
start thinning down the herd so I don't have to park cars on the street
that aren't getting driven. So this extra Bus is for sale.

'70 sunroof Bus, no rust California vehicle, some dents, one replacement
panel available for panel behind driver's door. Originally tan and white
but now in red oxide primer on the bottom. I rescued this Bus about 10
years ago from being parted out and started collecting parts for it.
Several years later I rebuilt the brakes and rented an engine from a buddy
for 2 six packs of Gordon Biersch Marzen a month (hence the Bus' name
Gordon). After a few years of that I got a fresh 1600 single port rebuild
to put in and the engine now has about 15k on it. Among the parts I've
collected for it are the sunroof cables and hardware, correct brown spare
tire cover, correct door panels, and correct brown floor mats. The seats
have been recovered in tan from TMI. The tires are nearly new as well. The
bad parts are - the afore mentioned panel damage, trashed headliner, bent
rear bumper, and the brakes shoes only have a few thousand miles left in
them. I am asking $2200 for this Bus that you can hop in and drive home
(its already been to Minnesota once) from Campbell, CA where I live.
Please contact me off list if interested for pictures and/or questions.
