Subject: Horn Button Problems

74 Westy.
This isn't the typical Horn Button Question.
My probem is that the horn button is not connecting the ground seeking
circuit.

I don't know if I'm missing a part or if something is wired wrong or fallen
off or.....
Searched the archives but this doesn't sound like the typical problem

Here it is:

The ground seeking terminal/wire going to the horn connects to the sterring
column TUBE.  The column TUBE is the black metal piece that sorrounds the
column SHAFT.

As far as I can tell (Ohmeter), the column TUBE is insulated from the column
SHAFT.
The horn button is connected to the column SHAFT. It is not connected to the
column TUBE.
Thus the horn button connects the column SHAFT to the infamous Brown Ground
seeking wire (on mine the ground wire is basically connected to ground, 20Ohms
or so).

So my horn circuit is not being closed.  The wire going to the horn is
connected via a screw and circular crimp connector  at the base of the TUBE.

Should the TUBE be connected to the SHAFT?  Am I missing a part?
OR should the horn wire be connected directly to the SHAFT and not the TUBE at
all?  Where is this connection?

Some help would be great.  Didn't see anyone with this problem.  Maybe a
wiring error by a previous owner?

Thanks!
