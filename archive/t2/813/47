Subject: Cruising Speed (was Baywindow or Vanagon?)

I've never worked on a Vanagon, but my Westy isn't THAT difficult.
I've owned vintage Volvo's and a couple of Austin Healey 3000's, a
couple of Ghia's,Type 3 and various econoboxes and  pick ups over the
years. The easiest was my first, an early Chevy Nova wagon.

My 78 has a speed limiter. The front storage bin of the poptop gets an
annoyingly loud vibration at about 70 mph or in a strong headwind.
When that happens it's time to slow down. No reason to go much faster
than 70. I've had it up to about 80, but who's in a big hurry?

I think the the front left fastener either needs tightening or
loosening. It's on the list of to-do's but  the vibration is an early
warning sign to slow down and pay attention.
