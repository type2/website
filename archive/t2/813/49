I got mine from the USA so no warnings were crossed
out.  You're right, it's a Canadian CSA thing and the
company would pay a heavy ransom to have it CSA
approved.

Did you get it at the sale price or $129?  

Let me know how you like it.  The pilot light had me
freaked at first then I started thinking about it as a
mini mini fireplace.
