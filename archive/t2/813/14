Subject: Re: [T2] lifter noise/bogging

What is "bogging"?  You mean the perceived power of the bus?  That can 
have a lot of reasons, based on all these experiences I've had: from a 
sticking distributor (not allowing advance), cracked points rubbing 
block, cracked hose sucking air, or electrical discontinuity in a 
critical ground or connector, say, from the temp. sender.
As for the lifter, it is draining when parked- maybe worn....check 
adjustment of at least one to 2 turns in of the rocker adjusting screw 
after it JUST makes contact with the valve end; this is best "felt" as 
you hand rotate the screw with a screwdriver.
