Subject: The Riviera Registry - Released!

Hello all! I have been working hard on my release of The Riviera Registry
site! Please do not be confused with the Pre-68 Riviera Registry at
www.therivieraregistry.net <http://www.therivieraregistry.net> ; which
offers pre-68 specific information.

I am offering a site where Riviera affiliated campers of any year can enter
the riviera registry, meet other riviera owners, discuss riviera technical
issues, sell parts and post trip reports on the Forum!

http://www.rivieraregistry.com/

Also, you can add yourself to the Riviera registry Frappr Map:
http://www.frappr.com/therivieraregistry

Please email me if you have any ideas or information you want to post on the
site, it will be updated weekly, and soon we will have a online form to
enter your riviera in the Registry (for now, you have to email me your
information and photos, please see the site for more information).

Happy bussing!
