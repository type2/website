Well, YES and NO. Yes, they are re-usable if you can
pop them out with out breaking them (sometimes
difficult to do), NO they are NOT re-usable if you
break them.  And Yes, they just pop out, although it
is sometimes difficult to do without breaking them. My
advice would be just to buy new ones, I'm pretty sure
most online parts places carry them, BusDepot, CIP1,
etc should have them in stock.
