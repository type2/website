<<Did you use the heater when you were sleeping? I haven't tried it yet
that way. It's a great little heater.>>

The Mr. Buddy Heater is a neat unit.

I've been using mine for 5 years , and with a window cracked open up
front sure has made my life much more comfortable in my Bus and Vanagon
during the winter months.

So the window's get a little steamy---
It's a bonus--

Nobody can see me snoozing inside- ~ : )

With the low oxygen shut off it's a safe unit to use while napping.

Happy Winter Camping
