Abraham,

Yes, they are difficult...you need a friend to help and you need 
everything to be ***very*** warm.  Summertime is actually best for this.

Push, pull, tug, squeeze down on the seat at the front and you will
eventually get there.  Maybe a hair drier on low to help the vinyl stretch 
a little.  Did some on my 78 and they weren'tall vinyl, but non stretching 
cloth....even harder than pure vinyl to get to stretch..

Oh, and some good hand strength helps.

I suppose you could take them to any local upholstery shop to get help if 
you had to.  My local upholstery place was very knowledgeable about TMI 
products.

Let's hope that they didn't send you the wrong thing!...something they 
have been know for in the past...your local upholstery shop will know.

Glad to have you back on the list!

Cheers, dave

 Whereas earlier years use wires and hog rings and hooks, the 77 seats use
 plastic strips that have to fit into little pockets around the base of the
 seat I had no trouble getting the longer strip into the grove (this accounts
 for the front and both sides), but I feel like the vinyl is about 1-3 inches
 too short to ever fit into the back part.
