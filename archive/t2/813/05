Subject: Re: [T2] BN4 heater inside bus

Dino,

I hope you got some additional responses besides mine, but under NO 
circumstances should you put one of those heaters INSIDE your bus.  It 
is just a bad idea in so many ways.  First, the idea of piping highly 
flammable liquid, under pressure, to the inside of my bus, gives me the 
willies.  Second,  piping a clear, odorless, deadly gas though the 
inside of my bus just plain scares me.  DON'T DO IT.  Do it by the book 
and be safe and happy.
