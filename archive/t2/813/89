some years ago I overtightened the oil drain bolt and it broke, managed to
find a longer bolt to grab some threads and pulled it carefully tight.
that's been well over 5 years ago and I haven't touched it since, do all
my oil changes thru the drain plug, and yes it was a real bear to get
loose the first time.  basically just put a good bit of pull then push
then pull on the socket handle til it finally came loose.  I suspect those
threads can take a lot more abuse.  sort of figure the oil filter will
grab anything worth talking about and as long as my oil presure stays up
(I have guages) I won't worry about it....
