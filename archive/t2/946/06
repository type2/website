Subject: WTB center intake plenum 2.1 wasserboxer

   esteemed list:
I am no longer subscribed to the vanagon-list so please forgive me for 
asking this here, if you are a member and are subscribed please post 
this if you have a spare moment.  A friend is replacing an '86 2.1 
engine that threw a rod through the top of the case, and shrapnel 
impressively punctured the intake center plenum.  Reading internet 
materials indicates that intake runners are slightly larger for the 2.1 
so likely the 1.9 plenum we found won't fit.  Does anyone have one 
available to sell/trade?  Also seeking an intact 2.1 core to redeem the 
$800 AVP core charge.

bus content:  drove my '70 to the pick-n-pull in Carson City, and a few 
other junkyards looking for the above-mentioned parts.  On my 1776 I 
have a bad miss on #4 from chronic manifold intake leaks and also fouled 
plugs from rich jetting at high altitude.  At the yards we found a 76 
picked clean and a '71 also.  an 82 air-cooled Westy with complete 
engine and interior (now kind of ravaged).  spent quite a bit of time 
comparing L-jet, Digijet, and Digifant FI systems. 

I have had the good fortune to have found a '73 Westy nearby on 
Craigslist for $600 that needs a little work.  I might find a good 2.0L 
core engine and 091 trans to refresh heads and optimize the setup (will 
run on dual weber ICTs).

Also a recent pick-n-pull find, I scored a stock timing scale, I will 
mail it FREE to the first person who needs it.  Provided I can dig it up 
again.  Things are kind of a mess around here!

TIA
