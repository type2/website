I'm not sure there's a size/weight that triggers the inspectors.  I
had a relatively small and light package opened up like this, but it
seemed to be for much more obvious reasons.  The package was from an
online retailer, the package had their logo on the box and as part of
the return address sticker, yet they had declared it as a "gift" with
a $20 value.  It was worth quite a bit more and it didn't take much
for customs to go to the retailer's website to find out how much more.
