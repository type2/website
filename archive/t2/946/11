I'll give that a look.

I went to Pep Boys since they have the largest "HELP" section  of all
the FLAPS around here. Nothing. I asked the counter monkey, showing
him my old one. He went looking at watercooled heater hose. The bends
are too wide. He just gave up. Dork. Wouldn't let me go look.

So I bought a pair of 1/2" caps and capped the nipple on the plenum
and the port on the S hose. Cold starting will be a pain, but
otherwise, at least the leak is gone for now.
