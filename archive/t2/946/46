Subject: Re: [T2] What to fix first?

I would get the next bigger metric size tap and run that through the 
stripped hole, then use that size screw. Even better would be to buy an 
electronic replacement ignition module and throw the points and condensor 
away. Go to
www.hot-spark.com
and buy a 39 dollar conversion. Put in what size screw will give you a snug 
fit using loctite, and it is set forever. No need to ever move the screw 
again after you've set the pickup gap. Bonus of easier starts, maybe better 
mileage, and less wear and tear.

Courtney
