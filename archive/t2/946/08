Subject: new generator brushes fail

Jack,
      Are you sure the new brushes are good?  Have you checked the continuity 
of each brush from carbon face to end of lead?  Is it possible that a new brush 
did not seat on the armature.... grasping at straws here.

I don't have the equipment to carry out the loaded-generator test, 
so, remembering a previous situation with another VW, I removed the 
brushes,  replaced them with new ones, and repeated the no-load test. 
Zero volts output.

I put the old brushes back in and restored the normal 12V, 36V outputs.

Any ideas on the time dependence or any suggestions for why the new 
brushes gave this result.........
