EMPI makes them out of Asia somewhere.

I just did this on my '70 Deluxe and ended up drilling out the crappy tabs
and using some stainless bolts. They don't fit right, but it was my only
choice since the originals were beyond help. I am on the lookout for some
quality replacement units.

I heard somewhere that Hella is making them again. Anybody got info on that?
