You have to pay duties on second-hand items coming into Canada.  I
don't know of a differentiation between new and used.  Taxes and
duties owed are based on the value of the item (amongst other things).

Heck, up here in Saskatchewan you have to pay taxes when purchasing a
used vehicle, even on a private sale.  At least if you want to license
it you do.  In that case as well, the taxes owed are determined by the
value of the vehicle or how much you paid for it, whichever is higher.
