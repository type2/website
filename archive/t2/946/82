Subject: T1 mexican thermostat

Folks, I've searched the archives and been off reading about the mexican 
thermostats off and on for about an hour now.

Does someone have a link to an article that explains how they fail in the 
closed position....seems like someone posted a link at one time, but I 
sure can't find it now.

Seems they had a picture showing a cut in half mexican tstat.

I can't believe that VW would design something to fail in a manner that 
took the entire engine with it....especially in sunny mexico.

Yes, I've seen the prices for oem on the samba and others, but $65 to $70 
bucks sure seems a lot...and the samba prices for the mexican version are 
just as bad.

I have one oem stashed for the T4 bus, but sure do need one for a T1 
engine

Reasonable Alternatives?

Cheers, dave
