Subject: RE: [T2] Front axle beam

	It's a major job, but doable, even by yourself. I replaced the beam on a
'77 a few years back, did it all by myself. Make sure you remove everything
that passes through the beam. As I recall, that's the heater tube, clutch
cable, brake pedal rod to the booster,e brake cables, etc. I forgot the
clutch cable, dropped the old beam to the floor, drivers side was still
hanging, that's when I found I had forgotten the clutch cable. It took me 5
weekends to do mine, mainly because I kept finding more stuff that I
figured I might as well change while I had it all apart-so I'd have to
order the parts and wait. I ended up replacing several seals and all the
front brake lines. Hardest part is getting the new beam lined up and bolted
in place-especially if you're doing it solo-get a helper for that step if
you can. Also, with the new beam loosely bolted in place, you'll find there
is some movement with the beam. Make SURE you have the beam pushed back all
the way toward the rear of the bus before tightening the bolts. Bentley
warns of leaving rearward slack on this step, I'm assuming because if there
was rearward  slack on the beam and you panic brake, the weight of the bus
is enough to cause the beam to shift rearward and shear the bolts, leaving
you skidding down the road with no front axle. Beams tend to rust from the
inside out, so rust prevention can be difficult. I had the idea at one time
to drill holes at both the top and bottom of the uprights, and pump POR 15
into the top, letting it drain out of the bottom hole-idea being it would
coat the inside and prevent further rusting. Never did it though. Good luck
with it,  Jeff
