It may be that the screw that is in there is an incorrect replacement giving you the feeling that the hole is stripped, like a standard screw size ran into a metric threaded hole, that would be good news, as for knowing the size I can't help.

On the flip side, if it is stripped you may be able to run an Imperial (standard/American) tap in there and go up to a slightly larger in diameter screw as a good strong repair.

If it is stripped I can't see a lock washer or locktite helping.

I am pretty sure that you do not want a lock washer on your points, seems to me that they would be really tough to set and in your case the pressure of the screw trying to collapse the washer would pull the screw right out of the hole finishing off whatever is left of the threads
