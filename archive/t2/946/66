And that is why I get the peace sign and the weed sign on an almost daily
basis when I drive my Bays. I don't have any stickers or graphics of any
kind. 

But, you got to love Americana!

I think this afternoon I'll drive my bus around getting high with my free
love partners then go to an all-you-can-eat buffet, after that go home and
watch must-see-TV and then maybe a midnight sit-in at the county dog
pound...
