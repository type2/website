Subject: Re: [T2] windshield wiper blades for a 72

Matthew asked:


 folks, why is it that the wiper blade on the 72 hangs
over the right side & doesn't touch the glass? do I
need to position the arm up a bit farther (when arm in
"home" position) or do I need an even shorter wiper
blade?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Because of the curve of the windshield.  As the blade goes goes up, the windshield gets flatter, so the blade
wipes it.

You cannot bend any blade to clear the curve and still work on the rest of the glass.

You do not want to shorten the arm or the blade, or you will not clear the top half.

Who looks out the bottom right corner?  :)
