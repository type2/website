That's what the hammer is for behind your front seat-get a nice deck 
hammer without too much claw bend- my daughter has one-
they are
1. A defensive weapon
2. hubcap remover
3. cold start idle raiser- place handle where your heel usually is,
lay hammer head on pedal and push!
4. camping aid for tent pegs
5. emergency hatchet

  So I bought a pair of 1/2" caps and capped the nipple on the plenum
  and the port on the S hose. Cold starting will be a pain, but
  otherwise, at least the leak is gone for now.
