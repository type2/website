Subject: Re: [T2] Front axle beam 

This all being said, there are pretty wide manufacturing variances in this very important to fit extremely well part.  The fit of the beam on the bus should almost be a press fit, and it needs shimmed as described in Bentley.  Furthermore a beam might be TOO NARROW and darn near impossible to get on if corrosion has set in on the frame (not uncommon.)  This is a real bear of a 1 man repair, I did my first alone when I was 16 or 17, I've done several others and would much rather do it with a friend.  Only real tips I have beyond those already mentioned are to have some shim stock of various thicknesses to cut shims from, and take the opportunity to replace all the ball joints, drag link and pivot pin, tie rods, brake lines, etc that you have to remove anyway as now is the time.  Good time to replace all your soft lines, calipers, master and wheel cylinders if they need it.  If Bus Depot still has the new beams from SA BTW the one we put on Dolan's '73 was a nice beam, sure
 nicer than cleaning up something used, but a good used complete southern beam is often a cheaper alternative, and who knows may be recently rebuilt.  In the future keep excess grease from lube jobs off of them BTW as it collects and holds dirt that holds moisture, doesn't protect as one might think.

  Timo asked:

Is it true, that even if the front axle beam is for a t2b it may not fit
my bus, because they come in different widths?

No, the 71 to 79 beam is all the same with the same part number.
