Subject: too hot heater fan

Problem solved...well, sort of.

Folks, I was reading the front page of the "food" section of the newspaper 
last week and they were doing an article on how convection ovens are 
really great for cooking faster.

Had a pic of the inside of the oven with...wait for it...a *fan* inside 
the oven, cause that's what it does.....move oven temperature air around 
without melting.

Bingo!  Might not be 5 billion cfm, but might help and certainly wouldn't 
melt from the temps our heaters put out.

Only one problem....finding one that runs on 12 volts.


Cheers, dave
