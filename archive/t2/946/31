Subject: Re: FW: [T2] Why is my 77 Westy running so cool???

I'm not sure mine is working.  I rather doubt it.  But I've found that the engine runs much better when the oil temp reads about 120F.  I call that the magic number.  So I always warm it up until it gets there or close to it before I drive.  Haven't noticed the sludge since I started doing that.  Newer cars with computers compensate for it but I still don't think it's good to start driving on a cold engine.  One of these days I'll get around to checking/changing it.  But Scott sounds like I better go ahead and order it now.  I'm thinking about it.   Cheers...KR

doing themselves a disservice. John Muir talks about how the most wear
happens on a cold engine. Of course, oil is thick and drained away,
clearances are largest. Driving away with a cold engine has to make a
difference on expected life of these motors. Since I installed mine warmup
time is a fraction of what it used to be, and so I believe will be the wear.
The CHT gauge shows normal operating temps regardless of outside
temperature, around 300F
The type 4 is expensive so put in a type one. They work.

The tin beneath the pushrods needs to be there. But wide open flaps allows
maximum cooling when the engine don't need it.
