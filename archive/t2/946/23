Subject: RE: Why is my 77 Westy running so cool?

Scott I used your instructions to install my old but working thermo off a DP 1600, and it was excellent, thanks for that. That's why I bought the parts to do it from you.On the other note, any clue as to why my engine would run so cool? Does the protective sheetmetal that protects the pushrod tubes keep THAT much heat in? Mine is off right now as I haven't replaced it since I did the thermo install.
Thanks,
Courtney
