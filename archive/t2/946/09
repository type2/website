Subject: Re: [T2] Tire Chains How-To

30 some years ago, while in grad school, I drove my SO  (we were 
"engaged" from Syracuse to Denville NJ for Christmas, in a storm using 
chains in a 67 bug- what was normally a 4 hr drive took as I recall all 
night doing 30mph or less down Rt 17 as they closed interstate 81! 
Couldn't believe the depth we were slogging through most of the way in 
3rd and even 2nd gear.  Bus relevance?  I foolishly traded in that bug 
for $1000 against a $4400 71 camper used one summer-little knowing how 
collectible the 67 would be!
