Subject: RE: [T2] What to fix first?

I am running one in a SVDA in my 1600 DP. It is better than my old compufire
and fits a heckavalot better. Flawless so far, and cheaper. Lots of power
and idles like a rock.

hot spark. thats a new one for me. its cheap and it has a 3 year warranty.

for that price im likely to buy a couple and see if they are any good.
