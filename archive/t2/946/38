No, the 71 to 79 beam is all the same with the same part number.

211 401 061 K = 68 to the end of 69.
211 401 061 M = 70 and up. For 71 and up with power brakes, you need to
also get 211 401 213 mounting. Then VW
subbed the beam to part number 211 401 061 N for 70 to the end of 79.
Comes with the servo bracket already
installed.

Now if you include the spindles, then you have a difference between
71-72 and 73-79. The calipers are
different.....
