Subject: Re: [T2] WTB center intake plenum 2.1 wasserboxer

Will asked:


 A friend is replacing an '86 2.1 engine that threw a rod through the top of the case, and shrapnel
impressively punctured the intake center plenum.  Reading internet materials indicates that intake runners are
slightly larger for the 2.1 so likely the 1.9 plenum we found won't fit.  Does anyone have one available to
sell/trade?  Also seeking an intact 2.1 core to redeem the $800 AVP core charge.

There is a complete 87 2.1 at one of the yards here in Fresno, Calif.

I can get you that plenum.  And anything else you may want off it tomorrow.
