Subject: read side marker light source?

folks, i need two side markers for a 72. the rear red
ones. Any source for these? w/o photos, i am weary of
buying stuff from the bus depot, esp with their
ambiguous descriptions.  i need the whole shooting
match- lens, body, rubber gasket part (and bulb).
thanks
matthew
