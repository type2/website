Subject: Re: [T2] Rear window seals - Brazilian vs. German vs. U.S. for

I'm figuring yer wanting the OE Style that uses the Chrome Trim.  In terms
of quality materials (EPDM), fit and the proper groove for the original or
repro metal trim being offered these days, Wolfsburg West (made in USA) is
perhaps the best choice overall.

The Brazilian variety's cross-section (also called the profile) is made to
only accept the less desirable Plastic Chrome Trim, less desirable because
the trim fades over time.  Brazilian production over the years has finally
gravitated to EPDM, but the splice seam is still garish in appearance.  But
it's usually the economical choice if yer gonna use the Plastic Chrome Trim.

West Coast Metric's (WCM) offering is made in USA with decent quality EPDM
compounds, but because of "filler material" is not as soft and supple as
Wolfsburg West's product.  Overall quality is very good however and uses the
Metal Chrome Trim.

Most OE German seals coming through the pipeline these days are of the
profile that requires the Plastic Chrome Trim.  They quit making the rubber
that takes the Metal Chrome Trim back in the early 80s.

Now my qualifications to make the above statement(s) - The Old Volks Home
was the first in 1976 to offer reproduction window seals in a high quality
EPDM compound made right here in Southern California.  In fact, I still have
the tooling if I were to choose to reactivate production.  Initially Old
Volks Home made seals for the Split Rear Window Beetle, then gravitated to
the popular "California Look" Window Seals, that is the later, wider profile
without a groove for the Chrome Trim.  Eventually tooling and production was
made to produce the OE Style seals with the Metal Chrome Trim Groove.  I had
a good run with it until around the mid 90s when every Tom, Dick & Harry
decided they could make window seals in USA, Brazil, Taiwan, Mexico and
whatever other 3rd world country.  Eventually the imitators were selling the
stuff for less than what it cost me to produce, so sales naturally eroded to
the point where it was no longer economical to produce a high quality
product that no one apparently desired - they opted for price (cheep) over
quality.  Even the USA made seals were being manufactured by the
imitators out of cheaper grades of EPDM to realize greater profit margins
and I wasn't about to compromise my compound formula quality to offer
cut-rate pricing.  No biggie - Old Volks Home was doing just fine, having
gravitated to other parts and accessories for Bugs and Buses, so the tooling
and production was quietly laid to rest.

That being said, Wolfsburg West is the only outfit since then to step up to
the plate to produce their window seals with virtually the same, soft EPDM
compound as mine and their tooling is perhaps the closest to mine in correct
lengths and profile for the Type 1 & Type 2.  The biggest difference between
Wolfsburg West and others (to include myself) is that the splice seam was
changed from vertical to angled to mimic the original seal appearance.  So
why should I re-start production when a viable, quality made product is
already available at very reasonable pricing?  That's a no-brainer ;-)
