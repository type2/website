I'll bite. Press your index finger and thumb together like you're
pinching the small end of some kind of imaginary cigarette. Now hold
these two fingers up to your mouth as to simulate smoking it.

I get flashed that every so often. Some kids even flashed me their stash once.

Bus content: In the recent past I dropped something in between the
z-bed and the bus' body in my '71 westy. This required me to remove
the entire rear seat/bed/cabinet to get into this awkward to reach
area. Underneath the wood cabinet I found a number of what must have
been 20-30 year old "roaches" , and I'm not talking about the insect
variety. Better for me to find them than a southern cop with a k-9
on-board..
