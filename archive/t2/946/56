Longer dwell is not necessarily a longer spark, although it may be more 
powerful. "Dwell" is a measure of the period the coil is powered - 
allowed to build a magnetic field. The setting can be critical for 
points, since too much/little can cause the points to "burn," or 
prevent a good spark. There are no points to burn in "electronic 
points," so the dwell time can be increased, which gives the coil time 
to store more energy, which is in turn released in a stronger spark. 
This is most apparent at higher RPM, where the actual charge time is 
smaller.
