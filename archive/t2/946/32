Subject: Re: [T2] windshield wiper blades for a 72

Believe it or not, that is exactly how the factory wipers are on a Bay
Window.  I saw this weird happenstance on a military co-worker's brand new
73 Bus in 1973 when he brought it on the post to park next to my (then)
brand new Karmann Ghia I had bought a couple of weeks before (Fort Ord, CA -
a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away).  Both he and I thought something
was wrong, but a quick check with a knowledgeable dealer parts guy at the
time at Wester VW in Seaside (yes, Virginia, there were those once a upon a
time <grin>) confirmed that's just the way it was supposed to be.  Bay
Windows use 16 inch blades and the passnger side blade has always had the
propensity to not touch the glass near the end of the blade towards the
outer portion of the vehicle, because of the glass' curve.  I suppose you
could reposition the arm/blade assembly upwards, but it might not look right
when compared to the driver's side.  The 14 inch passenger side on my Ghia
did the same thing, thanks to the curvature of the glass, but not as extreme
on the Bay Window.  Most 73-77 Super Beetle Sedans & Porsche 911/912/914's
I've seen have this problem as well to varying degrees.

YMMV
