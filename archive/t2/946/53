thanks Mark
          I will remember when  I have the engines out to also swap the fuel
tanks.

Mario, I am sure you know or can find out  . ..   if the charcoal filter and
associated hoses need to come with the '75.



As long as you are going to take the FI '75 gas tank (and fuel pump),
consider the fuel filler line to the gas cap.  And the gas cap ring.



Take the removable Firewall with the DR/Resistor pack and the Decel Valve
(sorry, may not be a correct name, but you know what I mean.  You will
probably get the charcoal canister as attached to the Firewall)



When you sat you are taking the engine compartment wiring, you probably are
including the FI brain harness, AND the driver side wiring that connects the
FI fuel pump from the starter solenoid.  (The starter Solenoid has two spade
connectors.  I use three, where the third is my hot wire to the battery.)



So I guess you are taking the '75 starter, along with the '75 tranny so
good.



And the Air Filter bracket... from the '75

First, remove the upper engine paneling from the '75.  There are six rivets
that you can drill out, and then bend the soft metal tabs at the absolute
upper rear.  [Keep an  eye out for the fuel vapor recirculation lines that
are back there, and take what is needed.] These two panels and the sound
proofing will come out.  Now you can adventurously CUT OUT the '75 engine
compartment upper deck, which will have the engine compartment access
panel...Cut it ALL the way to the front, just behind the rear seat.

This is major surgery, but very do-able with the '75 gas tank removed.  And
it can be matched up with the '72 solid panel and scribed and cut out the
'72 mirror image panel, so it will be do-able with the '72 gas tank removed
(before the '75 gas tank gets installed)

See you at EB 2008
