Anybody familiar with the Pertronix Igniter II line ?
Picked one up at a yard sale...Part no. 91281
I think it's for a small Ford V8...260 CI but not
sure...Anybody know? And if anybody can use
it, will trade for, well, anything that'll fit my bus
that is of equal or greater value as they say in
the ad biz ... ;-)
