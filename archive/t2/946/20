We have NOS thermostats in stock. These are type 1 thermostats, but they are
the late ones for FI Beetles, so the temp range is almost a perfect match
for the type 4 stat.

We only have a few of these left and may not be able to get any more once
they are sold. They are NOS Walhler in the blue and red box. There is a tech
article linked in the product listing on how to install this in a type 4
vehicle, very simple to do.
