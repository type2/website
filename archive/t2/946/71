Subject: Rear window seals - Brazilian vs. German vs. U.S. for my 70

Busdepot - Brazilian 6.95
Aircooled.net - U.S. (I think; doesn't say?) 19.95
CIP1.ca - German (ends in a G which usually means German with them) 19.95

You usually get what you pay for, although I once found a Brazilian door seal that fit better than a U.S. made one. Has anyone got any experience with a window seal when it comes to the differing seals and their qualities?
Thanks,
Courtney
