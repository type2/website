I agree that's a great page!  I like to be able to steer in the snow 
also... so I generally put chains on all four wheels.  Real chains on 
the rear, cables on the front.  The cables are so light and easy to 
handle, they hardly take any time at all to put on.

Yep, that made national news!  Here in Dallas we had a nice coating of 
sleet last Monday and since then it's just been raining.  :-(
