Subject: Re: [T2] Handbrake Adjustment Tool



Billy,

The handbrake adjustment is located under the bus, in the area of the
handbrake.  You need to jackup the bus, adjust the rear brakes and then
tighten up the screws for the handbrake while it is 6 clicks out.   You
hold the wire with a flat-head screwdriver so it won't twist, then tighten
the nut.   It's just that for some reason, it tightens a bit and won't let
me go too much further, but it could be something I did.  That's why I'm
looking for a better tool to grip it well...

Regards,
Shawn.
