Getting the nut off is the easy part, although the screwdriver trick sounds 
pretty good -- wish I'd thought of that when I was replacing the starter on 
my '75! I replaced mine by myself on the side of a busy interstate in the 
dead of winter with semi's whooshing past at 70mph (I'm saving that story 
for a Friday!)

Ouch! I thought that access hatch was standard for all late bays (US/Euro or 
otherwise). That would most definitely be a huge PIA.

I honestly couldn't tell you whether removing the wheel would be helpful. I 
never pulled the engine on my '75 w/T4, so I have no practical experience 
with that. However, I'm thinking that if you removed all the 
air-filter/heater-blower/pile-o-stuff that sits on top of the pancake, you 
may have an easier time pulling the motor out and getting it back in. If I 
remember correctly (it's been a while), most of that comes off in nearly one 
piece. With it all off (and possibly the rear bumper too), it might give you 
enough clearance to remove the engine without having to jack the bus up. But 
like I said, it's been a while and I'm sure I've killed those brain cells 
that remember any of it since.

All I can say is that I'm *really* pleased with the way my '70 is set up. 
The apron was easier to remove than any other part on my bus, and with it 
and the bumper off, the engine slid out with very little resistance.
