Hi Gregg,

Good call... I couldn't remember if the apron came off or not on late bays.

Also, another trick I learned that may work on a late bus (correct me if I'm 
wrong)...

The top motor/tranny mounts are a real PIA to get to. On my '70 I undo the 
rear mounts first so that the engine/tranny are supported by the floor jack. 
Then I lower them a bit so that I can get to the top motor/tranny mounts 
easier (no top access door on an early bay). The mount by the starter is the 
worst -- I remember from changing out the starter on my '75. You can get to 
the nut in the engine compartment from the top access panel, but it helps to 
put some duct tape on the head of the "D" bolt where it attaches to the 
starter assembly to keep it from spinning/falling out. This is especially 
helpful when putting it back together.

Later,

Sean
1970 Microbus ("Mimi")
