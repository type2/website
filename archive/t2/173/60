Subject: Re: [T2] 77 bus disc brake bleeding

Whoa- in my experience, a pump of the pedal pushes out about a cc from
the tubing.....I always assumed that with a slow pedal push (not a
tromp) the open bleeder causes no hydraulic pressure to induce pressure
against the springs of the wheel cylinder (rear brakes).  Thus the rear
shoes should not push out?
