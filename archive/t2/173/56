Subject: getting a "new/old" bus in the US

here is way that would work - but it would take a long time......

IF you know someone who lives in any European country, you could pay for the 
"new" bus and have it put in their name.

They would be allowed to ship the "new" bus over to the US  ( they can bring 
a camper/vehicle over to use on a vacation - requires special forms ect)

once the "new" bus is imported for their vacation here you start the 
PRETENDING..............the bus breaks down

PRETEND the bus breaks down and is left with "you" to fix/repair it.

THEN - you can file a "mechanics lean."  Stating the vehicle was left there 
by a vacationing european.  You can say they decided fixing it was not worth 
the trouble and they flew home.  the state will then issue the "mechanic" 
(you) a title, regaurdless of year......

I know it is confusing but it will work!
