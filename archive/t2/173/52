Subject: Re: [T2] Are these new or restored? - 2002 Type 2

These vans have actually been around for several years in brazil.  They 
do not meet import requirements for the US or Canada by a long ways.  
They would have to be sample crash tested here in the US and from emails 
from people familiar with the standards "no way" was the chances of ever 
even being tested.  The type 2 standard design would have to changed in 
to many places.  I went down and looked at a current eurovan to get an 
idea.  "No way" is probably correct.  as for doing as is done with "mex" 
beetles, using a registerable pan and "restoring" it, this i was told 
could be done if you could get the parts to here in the us.  "kits" 
(like the old puma) in certain forms might be able to be created.  not 
sure of the current rules on them.
