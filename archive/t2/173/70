The sender unit in the bus's tank is a float with a
variable resister. The variable resister is a element
that is contacted by a "sweeper arm". Over a period of
time the contact wears down the resistive element,
which will cause dead spots. Based on the sender units
I have looked at. The mechanics of the sweeper arm
tends to make the low end of the unit fail first. In
other words it will register when you have a full tank
and drop off suddenly
somewhere around the half tank spot. 

   Sometimes you can get a little extra life out of
the sender by carefully bending the sweeper arm so
that it contacts on a different area of the resistive
element. Also the
Arm can fatigue so that it is not getting the required
spring load on the resister. You can
play with bending it a bit more to get the firm
contact back. It is fairly brittle so take it easy.

  Another problem can be caused by a bus sitting for a
long period of time. The gas will form a varnish on
the contact surface. Rubbing alcohol or something
similar with a pencil
eraser can clean off the contacts effectively.
Symptoms would be an erratic gage function in most
cases.

Checking the unit is easy with a volt/ohm meter.
Disconnect the battery. Pull the sender.
With the meter on the sender's contact you can move
the float along the resistive element
And the meter's readout should move smoothly. I like
the analog meter (needle indicator) for this type of
check. Digital readout meters are easier to read and
more accurate but would be more difficult to watch and
see if the resister is varying it's value smoothly.
You should see a nice smooth change in resistance
value as you  move the float arm assembly. If you see
erratic value changes or if the value goes from some
resistance value to an infinite reading.. you have a
bad sender. Using the meter you can play with
relocating the arm contact point (you will be able to
see where it has been rubbing). If you can get it to a
spot where you have the smooth value change it is now
useable. Accuracy will be questionable but you will
have a readout indication. If you don't have the
adjustment on the back of your gas gauge you can play
with bending the wire that the float is attached to.

  All that being said. If it is bad I would just get a
new one from Ron or someone.

Access is a different story. I advocate cutting a
access hole and installing a marine style hatch cover
with a integral O ring seal. The hatch cover I used is
a screw in type. Machine screws are used to attach the
bulkhead to the deck. Because the deck metal is not
flat you have to use a gasket material of some
kind..i.e. RTV would work. From then on you have
fast/easy access to the gas tank compartment without
it looking like a hack job.

Disclaimer: This is what I did/would do to any bus.
These things are always futzing up.
You are free to agree or disagree. State your reasons
to the list for general consumption as you won't
change my opinion in a p-mail exchange. ;-) 
Been there done that.
