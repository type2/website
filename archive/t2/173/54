Subject: Splitting T4 cases.. a little progress

OK, 

I found the 20th fastener; the one under the oil cooler. Now I can get a 
start on splitting. At the flywheel end, I can get it open 0.5mm using a lead 
hammer; t the "tabs", maybe 0.2mm. However, at the crank nose, nothing. I 
can't even show a crack in the hardened grease at the parting line.

Any tricks for this bit?

Cheers/Don
