Just did this today- use a vice grip on the cable behind the equalizer,
where it is reinforced.  Too hard to try and hold a screwdriver while
turning a 13mm wrench on it.

 You hold the wire with a flat-head screwdriver so it won't twist, then
tighten the nut.   It's just that for some reason, it tightens a bit and
won't let me go too much further, but it could be something I did. 
That's why I'm looking for a better tool to grip it well...
