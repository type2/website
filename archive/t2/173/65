Subject: Re:fuel fil. change interval/pump life

Usually I changed the fuel filter every other plug change.  Have 236,000
mi on original fuel pump.  Once (3 years ago) it was restricted by silt
in the filter, (terrible power upon going up any grade) and removing it
and allowing the gas to flow into a bucket showed silt.  Since then I've
listened carefully to the pump, and once replaced the filter when I
heard "noise" (a sizzling sound) and noticed no more silt coming out the
line.  Now I change it about every 12K (yearly).
