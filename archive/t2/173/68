Bentley Official Service Manual for VW
Stationwagon/Bus 1968-1979, Chapter 8- Page 42

185SR14 Reinforced*

Correct replacement tire must bear word
"REINFORCED".  The maximum inflation pressure
listed on the tire should be 40 psi.  

No where in Bentley will you see Load Range C or
D.  No where.  The other spec is a 185R14C
commerical tire with a max inflation pressure of
55 psi for 72+ busses.  Bentley states "Correct
replacement tire must bear the letter "C"
immediately after the number 14 in the size
designation-- and not elsewhere.  The maximum
load inflation pressure listed on the tire should
be 55 psi."

Now, please now quote me where you see load range
C or D is the spec or that 40 psi isn't enough. 
(In fact, load range C tires in LT195/75/14 have
less max load than 185R14RF.)
