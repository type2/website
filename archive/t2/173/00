I have a 1776 motor that has a valve tick i can't get rid of...Valves =
are at .006, and it gets worse as the car warms up, and yes, it is a =
noisy valve train not a rod.

A fellow listee mentioned to me that maybe the rockers have to much side =
to side play and that is the prob.  They are stock rockers.   My =
question is how do i test for this on the car or how to do.  Never ran =
into this before.
