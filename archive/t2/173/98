Subject: Re:engine stand-using engine lifter??

A neighbor gave me one of those hydraulic engine lifters with the big
arm that lifts up as it is pumped- anyone make a base for this that
allows the engine to be slid onto it and then lifted?  Problem I see is
that attaching 4 chains to a base must have some neans to keep them
vertical and not angled towards the lift hook?
