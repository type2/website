Ahhh, you caught that.  So did I, but how does
one answer?  There does appear to be some
contradictory info.  My assumption is that the
"Campmobile 71 on" is a type and should have been
"Campmobile up to and including 71" only because
it would not make sense for the heavier, later
busses to require the heavier tire.  The
opposite, that later busses, "Campmobile 71 on",
have tires with a lower load rating than a
Stationwagon or panel van 72 and on doesn't make
sense.
