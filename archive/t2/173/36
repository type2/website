Subject: Re: [T2] Are these new or restored? - 2002 Type 2

A-ha, I was thinking I should have mentioned that in my original note :-)

You can get away with it for Beetles for one reason:  a 2002 Beetle will fit
on a 1963 Beetle pan.
You take an old Beetle chassis down to Mexico, buy a new Beetle, take the
new Beetle body off the 2002 chassis and put it on the 1963 chassis and
since the VIN follows the chassis you now have a brand new 1963 Beetle which
is exempt from all those import restrictions.

Can't do this with a Bus, it's a unibody design.  I suppose you could gut
the new Bus and install everything from the new Bus into the old Bus shell
but doing that you might as well just restore your old Bus to original
specs, at least if it's a late bay you get the Type 4 :-)

However, I have seen many brand new, old style Bugs that have been
imported from Mexico---South America, in the Sunday Chicago Tribune for
sale----

How are these vehicles made available?
