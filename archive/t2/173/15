Subject: timing and generator question

i have a 71 with a 1600 sp 34pict3 and 009. the case is H code. i was lookin 
at the boston engine site for some help with timing. is the info on that 
site correct? it is said to be for dual port, anything i should do diffrent? 
also i noticed while i have the engine out that the gen. pully does not line 
up with the crank pully? i read a thread sometime back about the tin and hub 
being diffrent. my tin is concaved about the same amount it is out of line. 
i have been thinking about putting a alt. in this bus. will one of the kits 
fix this problem. or what else will i need? what vendor should i get the alt 
kit from?
