Subject: RE: [T2] Are these new or restored? - 2002 Type 2

	I just got an email back from Jason at beetles-uk.com.  He states
that the Type 2's are 100%new, built in Brasil and then converted in the UK.
They are fuel injected 1600cc with catalytic converter.  After a quick
currency conversion, it appears that the price quoted for the Rio Camper is
approximately $19,250.00 before shipping from the UK, so they are not
exactly cheap to say the least.  I am not sure of availability of parts ('79
spec?). 
	Perhaps if a few listees got together and did a group purchase we
could get a better price from the dealer and do a consolidated shipment in a
40' container ( I think 6 Type 2's should fit in a normal shipping
container).  
	I also emailed justkampers.com about these Type2's, as the photos of
their Flat Pack Interiors match the interiors on the beetles-uk.com page
exactly.  I will post again about my findings after their reply.

<I'm confused. I thought they didn't make the bus anymore.>
