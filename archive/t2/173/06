Not on a 79.  Don't worry about supporting the
tranny, it's bolted to the frame.

I wouldn't attempt this alone if it's your first time.  I=20
believe the T4 motor is about 350 lbs.  My doctor has ordered
me not to lift one up again, and I had a helper.  Several
weeks of lower back pain taught me my lesson. Another set of eyes
and arms is very valuable for a first time removal.  You'll
definitely want some help reinstalling.  I've said this before,
wives make great assistants.

Great time to make sure that engine seal is in place and
in good shape.

Not THAT easy, a 2.0 liter FI engine is a little tight, don't
forget to remove the rear tin and coil.  Jack that sucker
up good 'n high (secured safely with jack stands of course.)
Just go slow and make sure you clear the tranny input
shaft (this is where another set of eyes helps.)

You don't have to remove the mustache bar (rear support)=20
from the engine, so just the 4 mounts to the tranny, then
2 bolts on either end of the mustache bar.

Basically, just follow the Bentley, but you can ignore
the part about supporting the tranny (so I've been told.)
