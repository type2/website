Subject: It Ticked...???


Ok, I got the engine in my bus and everything hooked up as I thought it should be.

(I had the engine out to replace the clutch)

I turned the key to on.
Lights worked, Lights on dash lit up.
Turned the key and it ticked.
Tried a couple times. Same thing.

I Checked the battery connections and starter connection. Then hooked it to another car for a jump. 

Still Just a tick.

Tried again and there was no tick.
No lights. no radio. nothing.

Checked fuses. Every thing looked good.
Wires crossed?
Well any thoghts please share.

Jason
