The max inflation pressure is too low.

Wrong.  Please look at your Bentley on page 8-42.
 This 185R14 Reinforced is exactly spec for a 71
or earlier bus.  (Well, exactly unless you want
to dig up new bias ply tires.)

See the tire page.  Link in sig.  

Lotsa misinformation out there, like it's gotta
be LRC or its 1435 lbs is a enough or 185R14RF
isn't up to spec, etc.
