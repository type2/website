Subject: coil question



  I was driving my bus and for no reason out of the blue, it started running 
horrible, then 2 mins later stalled and wouldn't start.  i was towed home.  
The problem is electrical, there is plenty of gas getting to the engine and 
the engine turns over fine.  I pulled the coil wire out of the top of the 
distributor and had someone turn it over while i looked at the spark.  It 
was orange and barely there, so i thought the coil went bad.  I changed the 
coil and same thing.  So i changed the voltage regulator and the same thing. 
  I just get one quick orange spark and then nothing out of the coil wire.  
Please help
