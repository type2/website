Thanks for the input.  If my diaphragm is toast, what are my options?  I =
have one more thing to check tonight.  You see, my problem started when =
I fitted my oil bath air filter back in the bus after doing much =
tweaking to get the engine running better. I had it all just perfect, =
put the AF back in, crank key and crappo! no run well.  Won't idle.  I =
can rev it up and it will run pretty good with some missing/popping.  =
But at low rev, it pops back through the carb.  It has been driving me =
crazy.  I just remembered that I did not check the vac line that runs =
from the left to right carbs.  I will check tonight.  Everything else =
(timing/points/valves) have been adjusted and re-checked.  Any ideas?

-Tom
