Subject: Help with shock id.

Hi Folks,

	Can you help me id these shocks? They are a year old Eday purchase.
Oops! shoulda' checked them out a long time ago to see if they fit. They
don't fit my 81 Vanagon.

	They are Boge, red in color with the name ORCA painted on them.
What does Orca mean in spanish? They were made in Mexico, along time ago I
suppose because the box is older than sin. If this is the original box
there is a part# 32153 stamped on it. That number is also on the shock
along with this PN 803 513 031. The last two numbers, 513 031 jive with
some VAG and B boys,depot, cip numbers, but not close enough or there is no
pictures that go back to the early busses, or T1, T2,3 or maybe it is for a
Saab or Packard.

	More:

	15 inches closed
	A strut style with two concave washers and two rubber bushings
	Double action, automatic three stage valve

					Thanks,

					Craig
