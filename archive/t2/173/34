Im looking for some support here.  How difficult would it be to remove an 
engine 1600dp from a 66 bus, strip the componets (carb, gen, exhaust) etc.  
Install the componets on a new longblock, and reinstall the engine in the 
bus?  Is this too ambitious for someone with only basic mechanical skills and 
knowledge.  What special tools would be required?  And could I do all this in 
a weekend?  Any help and or advice would be appreciated.

THANKS
Matt
