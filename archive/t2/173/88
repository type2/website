I have found that on a fuel injected bus it is not that difficult with
smaller sized hands (or a pair that can be borrowed) it is not that
difficult to 
.  remove the air cleaner intake runner
.  remove the bulkhead
.  reach in there and remove the old one, (careful don't drop the O ring
.  twist it around until it comes out in the corner where the tank is
lower
.  insert new one, wiggle and jiggle to get it in place
.  insert appropriate expletives
.  lock it down with a quarter turn (thereabouts)
.  replace the wires 
.  replace the bulkhead
.  replace the air intake.

less than an hour start to finish, and I haven't hacked up my rear deck
