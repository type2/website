Take the line off at the engine - put it in your mouth and suck.

Right before you pass out, cap off the line with your tongue and wait about 
1/2 an hour to see if the vacuum leaks off.

<grin>

A better way would be to use a Mity-Vac tool that can be purchased at 
Sears, Northern Tools, Harbor Freight I expect, etc.

You use it to pull a vacuum and then watch the gauge to see if it holds it 
and a reasonable amount of time...

I'm sure there are numbers to check but if it would hold vacuum for several 
minutes then I would feel good about it.
