Subject: Re: [T2] Are these tires  a potential death trap?

Hey Hey:

Im living proof of the worng tire load range issue; my
78 had four new Goodyear 185/70R14.  

If you keep em and dont get an "incident" (like me!)
they wear out on the edges anyway.  basically at high
speed (or high winds) they "fold over" in ways that are
just not right.

You'll end up replacing them in short order no matter
what.
