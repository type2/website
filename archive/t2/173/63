Subject: Re tire size- correcting taller tranny gearing?

In reference to using 205/70, this is the least tall tire- I get the
following measurements: STANDARD=0.82X185= 151.7mm sidewall height from
rim.  195/75 is 195X0.75 =146.25mm and 205/70 is 143.5mm.    Now I gotta
ask, if you stick a later tranny (77, 78) in a 75 bus, would the smaller
tires be of any value in giving more stock gearing?  Besides causing a
"lower gear factor", the wide footprint means more steering wheel
resistance at low speeds, abad consequence, yes?
