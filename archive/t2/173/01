Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch in my 79' Westy

Hate to tell you this, Jared, but the engine must drop. I just replaced the 
clutch in my '70 -- also happened to be the first time I pulled a VW engine. 
I'm assuming you've got an 1800 or 2000cc FI engine (based on the year), but 
it shouldn't be all that much different than pulling an earlier motor.

I performed the entire operation in the carport of my apartment complex. You 
don't need an engine stand -- just a floor jack and a 2x4. You'll also need 
a cement block or a couple of short 4x4s to hold up the tranny after the 
mounts to the engine are removed. As far as tools go, nothing needed other 
than a 17mm box wrench, 17mm socket w/6" extender. You'll also need a clutch 
alignment tool -- I bought a "metric" one from Pep Boys, but it didn't fit 
tight enough. Ended up with a plastic $1.50 Empi one from my local VW custom 
shop that worked like a dream. Other required supplies are a tube of 
molybdenum grease (use freely on the pilot bearing, throw-out bearing and 
input shaft).

And some advice from one engine-pulling-newbie to another...

1. Don't worry -- it's actually a very simple process.

2. Make sure you have a Bentley manual -- read through the process a few 
times to familiarize yourself with what's going to happen.

3. Label any wires, hoses, etc. that you disconnect. Any wires or hoses that 
do not attach to anything except the engine need not be removed unless they 
get in the way when you pull the motor -- Bentley says to disconnect damn 
near everything, but all I ended up having to disconnect was the fuel line 
and a few wires -- left plug wires and everything else intact. Do disconnect 
the battery ground strap though!

4. A helper is great but not necessary. I did the entire thing myself, but 
muscling a 250+lb motor around on a floor jack is a lot easier with two 
people.

5. If you really want to do it right (and have the extra $$), replace 
everything while you're at it -- pressure plate, clutch disk and throwout 
bearing.

6. Pulling it out is easy -- as long as you remove all the mounting nuts -- 
there should be four attaching the motor to the tranny, two or three 
attaching the rear support to the motor, and two that attach the support to 
the bus.

7. Putting it back in can be tricky, but still pretty easy. When you've got 
the motor and tranny lined up and almost completely together (about an inch 
or two gap), you'll need to kind of wiggle the motor as you push forward so 
that the input shaft mates up with the hub on the clutch disk. While you're 
doing that, put a big crescent wrench on the alternator nut (or turn the 
pulley by hand) until you're sure that the splines on the shaft have mated 
correctly with the teeth on the clutch disk hub. If you think you've got 
them together, test it by turning the alternator pulley with the bus in gear 
-- if the bus moves/rocks a little, you're golden. Just push it all together 
as tight as you can and start putting on and tightening all the mounting 
bolts (starting with the motor/tranny ones).

Anyways, I hope this helps. I was pretty nervous about doing this myself, 
but it went fairly smoothly and gave me a new sense of confidence about 
working on my bus.

If you run into any problems, this list is a gold mine of help. Also, feel 
free to p-mail me if you get stuck (this whole process is still *very* fresh 
in my mind). In any case, GOOD LUCK!!

Sean,

Mountains burnt my clutch out!! I'm dying having to share my wife's Jeep
with her again. Anyway, can I replace the clutch without dropping the
engine? I don't have a lot of tools, a garage, or an engine stand, so I'd
like to make this replacement as easy and painless as possible. Any and all
advice would be appreciated.

Thanks in Advance,
Jared
