  I am living proof that this can be done be a novice with limited mechanical ability and only a modest set of tools. The best thing to do is to keep a step-by-step journal of EVERYTHING you remove and to LABEL all bolts, nuts, and parts and put them in zip-lock bags layed out in the order in which they were removed. Then when you are ready for the re-install, just follow your notes backwards. It also wouldn't hurt to take a few photos of the engine before in case you need to look at it for reference when you go to put it back together. If you can get a helper who has done it before it helps greatly. I say go for it! After all, there is only one way you are going to learn it.
