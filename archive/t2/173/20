Subject: Re: [T2] Are these new or restored? - 2002 Type 2

Interesting concept, and I know that there are many opinions on this
import subject.

However, I have seen many brand new, old style Bugs that have been
imported from Mexico---South America, in the Sunday Chicago Tribune for
sale----

How are these vehicles made available?

There has to be a way around all the bureaucratic BS--somehow, other
than offering you first born to get them in here--

And at only 19g's and some change, it is a pretty good price---go check
out the figures on a Eurovan---

Later,

Terry

I just got an email back from Jason at beetles-uk.com. He states that
the Type 2's are 100%new, built in Brasil and then converted in the UK.
They are fuel injected 1600cc with catalytic converter. After a quick
currency conversion, it appears that the price quoted for the Rio Camper
is approximately $19,250.00 before shipping from the UK, so they are not
exactly cheap to say the least. I am not sure of availability of parts
('79 spec?). 
No, 2002 Brazilian spec. It's the 1600 dual port type 1 engine will all
kinds of parts on it that we've never seen in the US. I think they would
be hard to get. 
I think most of the parts would be unique. I thought it interesting that
it had the immobilizer, that's an anti-theft system that comes on
current water-cooled VWs. Means the instrument cluster is totally
different as well as ignition switch, means there is an ECU just for the
instruments, etc. But it is a moot point anyway because: 
Perhaps if a few listees got together and did a group purchase we could
get a better price from the dealer and do a consolidated shipment in a
40' container ( I think 6 Type 2's should fit in a normal shipping
container). 
No way no how can you bring these into the U.S. I'm sure if you could it
would be done and I'd have one :-) 
Apparently the UK has somewhat more lax vehicle requirements but in the
U.S. these vehicles would have to be DOT and EPA certified for 2002
safety and emissions requirements. Hmm no airbags, or side impact door
beams. I sure don't have the money to custom-engineer and certify such
systems. The engine is not EPA certified so good luck with that, I know
it costs the manufacturers lots of $$$ to do that. Guaranteed you
wouldn't meet 2002 emissions requirements with it.
