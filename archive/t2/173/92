The table could be wrong but it's (C)1976, not (C)1972 if that's any
comfort.

Another fact is that although camper has the highest unladen weight it's
gross vehicle weight is ~110 lbs less than the delivery van and station
wagon.

I have no idea if 110 pounds warranted a 1979 commercial tire instead of a
1979 reinforced tire because it sure seems like a slim margin but this is
the only data to support the difference in tires.

That leaves us falling back to your FAQ again: the 1540 load rating for the
reinforced would seem to be ok as far as Bentley is concerned (I can't find
this figure, what page?)

Apart from asking Continental, it would seem someone is going to have to try
these out and report back over time.  Perhaps more feedback will come from
people like this:
