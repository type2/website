Subject: Re: [T2] Handbrake Adjustment Tool

Shawn,
I know that it isn't right to answer a question with a
question, but I noticed last weekend that my hand
brake is not working so well.  I haven't had time to
look into it, but I was hoping that a simple
adjustment would solve my problem.  Where is the
adjustment you are asking about?  I will be curious to
see the responses you get to your post as it looks
like something I will be wanting to try.  Good luck!
