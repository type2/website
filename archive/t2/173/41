Matt,
Piece of cake, just make sure you have a good VW 
service manual around for reference (Bentley), and 
don't leave any sheetmetal off.  I took my completely 
assembled engine apart (took the crankshaft out) on 
Friday after work, stayed up 'til 9:00P, started again 
(-at-) 10:00A and re-assembled it by 3:00PM Saturday.  And 
I am not the most mechanical guy in the world, and I 
don't do it for a living.


Later,
