Re 32 psi 1155lb tires , 2 ply sidewall-
If tight for loot, you could use them on the front,where 27 psi is a
norm.  In the rear, if not a Westy you can use 32 psi, but I'd replace
them for 1500 lb rated tires (usually 36psi inflation or better).  I'm
surprised they have a 2-ply sidewall.  The list would be surprized how
many busses I've seen or parted with 1200 lb tires on them.
