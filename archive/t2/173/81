Nemo's excellent FAQ seems to be weak in one area: model.  He specifically
says that the 185R14RF tire is for 71 and earlier busses citing the Bentley.

Looking at the Bentley it specifically says:

7.00 x 14 8 PR
All models through July 1971

185SR14 Reinforced
Campmobile from August 1971
Delivery Van and Station Wagon from August 1971 - March 1972

185R14X
Delivery Van and Station Wagon from April 1972

The important fact I want to point out is that for a Campmobile from 1971
and onward the recommended tire in Bentley is the Reinforced variety.  It
makes sense that for delivery applications and carrying 8 people in a
passenger van that the 185R14C tire is more appropriate.

Next I went to my owners manual and it states on page 53, "You VW is
equipped with tubeless radial tires of either designation: 185R14C6PR or
185SR14Reinforced.

I've got a 78 Camper and I've been going mad trying to figure out which
tires are appropriate.

My final questions on the subject:

- does Dr. Tim think the reinforced Continental tire that just appeared is
the "perfect tire" for a late bay ( older than 1971) Camper?

- if the reinforced tire is appropriate does the 185R14C tire provide for
better handling when used on a Camper?
