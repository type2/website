Believe it or not, our helpful bureaucrats are
not very efficient.  Vehicles with tags from
other countries can enter the US.  Surely you've
seen Canadian or Mexican tagged vehicles. 
Usually they are allowed in when a foreign
citizen has some sort of acceptable purpose to
enter, ie business or vacation.  And, hard to
believe, they are not tracked that closely, so
some are "lost" and left in the US.  

Not every state is particularly vigilant about
VIN, etc.  I'm sure you have heard that SC is the
state to get a drivers license if you are an
aspiring terrorist.  It's also a good place to
get a stolen (or illegally imported) car tagged. 


Examples:  there was a German tagged MB Westfalia
Vito at Everybus.  I have heard of various
happenings whereby certain eurospec vans (later
vans w/ 1600's and no smog devices por examplo)
that found have found there way to our 'mericun
shores.  

I cannot even imagine how difficult the EPA and
DOT would be if you were caught at this...
