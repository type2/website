Subject: Shims for adjusting valve geometry?


Hello all,

Does anyone know of a source for rocker arm thrust washers(shims) and rocker
are stud shims? These are for a type IV engine. I'm trying to tweek in my
valve train geomtry - and it seems that shims are the only way to do this.

Also - how about swivel foot adjusters for a type IV setup?

Thanks for an help,

Ed
