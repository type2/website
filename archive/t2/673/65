Problem easily solved by relocating the alternator charging wire from the
post on the starter to a connector directly on the battery post. Should you
have need to use the cutoff while the engine is running the alternator
still has a proper discharge path and feedback loop as it "winds down" with
the motor.

I'm still not sure why VW ran the alternator charging wire the extra
distance to the starter rather than keeping it in the engine compartment
unless it was specifically to avoid having to use battery cables with an
extra wire/terminal or using the "clamping bolt" to connect the extra wire
from the alternator.
