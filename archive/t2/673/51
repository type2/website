Subject: Paste in Rebuilt Calipers

Anyone had experience with rebuilt calipers from Bus Depot? I just got a set
and they came with a package of what I assume is caliper paste.

Section 8 Page 20 of Bently says "..rub VW brake caliper paste into the inside
of the rubber dust seal. Then install it on the partially pressed-in piston as
shown.."

The rebuilt calipers look like the seal and piston are fully installed.

My question is, do I need to take the seal out and apply the paste that came
with the kit?

I don't want to install the calipers without the paste if it isn't already
there, but I also don't want to take it apart unnecessarily to check if it's
already in place.

I usually get into trouble disassembling things that don't need to be.

Bus Depot had no clue when I called to ask. They said, "they are like new
ones". I said, "If I had new ones would they come with the paste already
installed under the seal or would I need to remove the seal and do it myself
with the supplied package?". They said, "they are like new ones."
Sheeesshhh..

I was just wondering if anyone had had any experience with these and bothered
to remove the seal to check.  Seems like if they are fully assembled it would
already be in place, but then why was the package of paste provided if you are
not supposed to do anything with it?  Hmmmm

Thanks,

Mike
