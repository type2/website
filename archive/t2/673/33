Subject: Thread size?

Seems the cylinder head on the 1,2 side of my engine used to reside on the 3,4
side of someone elses engine. This is a 1980 2L engine. Just in front of the
intake manafold flange for cylinder #2 there is normaly a bolt to hold down
the cooling tin. in this situation there is a larger hole that looks the same
as the one by cylinder #3 intake manafold flange that the temp sensor threads
into.

Does anyone know the thread size of a temperature sensor II. I need to find a
bolt that is the same size as the temp sensor so I can fasten the cooling tin
to the head. Or does anyone have a dead temp sensor II taking up space in your
spare parts bin?

Thanks
Tom
