Subject: Spark plugs and cht sensor ?

Been reading up on installing my cht sensor before I put the tin over #3. Most
folks seem to recommend using NKG plugs so there is a little more clearance
for the sensor. I have always used Bosch plugs so I have no Idea about the
quality of NKG. Tried searching the archives for nkg and only got 10
responses. 6 of them were duplicates. Anyone out there use NKG plugs? Whats
your opinion? GOOD? BAD? INDIFFERENT?
Thanks
