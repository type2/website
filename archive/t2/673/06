Subject: My solenoid is possessed!

Hello all - 
 
I have an 81 Vanagon.  It wouldn't turn over, no matter what I did.  I finally took a screwdriver and jumped the terminals on the solenoid - the one from the battery to the one that takes the input from the ignition switch.  Engine turned over a few times.  I came forward, turned the key, and she started right up!
 
I thought maybe my starter bolts were loose, causing the starter to stick.  Nope.
 
I thought maybe the solenoid wasn't getting enough voltage from the starter switch.  Nope.
 
I thought maybe after a long drive, the solenoid was getting hot and sticking.  Nope.
 
I can't figure out the pattern.  It starts great ten or so times, in all kinds of conditions - after sitting overnight, after a long drive, after a short drive, etc, then it freezes and I have to "persuade" it with a screwdriver.  Once it turns over once, then it starts right up.
 
Any suggestions?  It's not a huge deal, since I know how to fix it temporarily, but I don't want to have to crawl under my car in my work clothes...
 
Thanks - 
 
Marc
