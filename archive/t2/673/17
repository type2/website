Subject: AFM O ring size?

I have a rebuilt AFM to install on my engine. Removed the original months ago
to clean the air cleaner. Pulled the parts out of their boxes today and found
no O ring present. Does anyone know the correct size O ring to seal the AFM to
the air cleaner? OOPs 1980 Vanagon 2L.
