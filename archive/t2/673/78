Subject: 71 Clutch disk question -Springs or no Springs

Hey Y'all,
I just bought a new clutch disc and pressure plate 
for my 71 Westy. I have a question about the disk. On
a stock 71, the disk should have NO springs, correct??
The only pictures I can find in catalogs are of the
later models which have springs integrated on the
middle of the clutch disk. I have the correct pressure
plate for the year with the "fingers" diaphram and no
metal ring in the center.
I know I can just look at the old disc once I drop the
engine BUT, I may need to use the bus as a primary
driver at a moments notice, so I want to do the clutch
R&R in one afternoon and not have to worry about
waiting for parts to be shipped.

Peace, John Baker
