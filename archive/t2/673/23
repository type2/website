Subject: Push Rod Seals

This list has been around so long I feel like I am always asking a repeat question.  Can someone tell me their experience with pushrod seals.  In the library article about replacing them it is identified as two kinds..... Volks, and others.  I don't expect them to last forever, but I don't want to have to change them in a year.  Which brand is the best?
