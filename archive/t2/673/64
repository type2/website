Subject: Fuel pressure

I have the problem with the 77 FI bus down to, to much fuel(flooding). it 
seems the fuel pump runs all the time, this doesn't seen right. Is there a chance 
that the double realy is bad even if everything else works fine or is there 
something else I should do. Its not my bus so I would like to fix it factory 
specs if I can, or should I put in a fuel regulator?

Thanks Mario
