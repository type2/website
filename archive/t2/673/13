Subject: RE: [T2] '76 FI died -

Thanks, Patrick,.

I have had this '76 for less than 500 miles.  When I got it, my friend and I 
checked most fuel things out.  We replaced the fuel pump, fuel filter, ALL 
the fuel lines, and the four fuel injectors/seals.  I bought a 100 psi water 
pressure gauge from Sears, and we hooked it up to the left fuel rail.

My partner could see that it went to 30 psi almost immediately when I 
started the engine.  It kept 20 psi when the engine was shut off.

I am noticing some high gas consumption, but I haven't had the AFM checked 
out yet.  Also,  the max single drive it did in the past 500 or so miles [8 
months] was just 65 miles one way, to get it home.

BTW, this '76 was sitting for 16 years, and this is just the trial runs, so 
I don't expect the gas situation to be normal.  I try to drive it each week, 
but less than 20 miles total per week

Recently I replaced the oil cooler seals.  To do this with the engine 
in-place, I pulled and cleaned the fan housing, along with tons of other 
stuff.  I replaced the alternator with a checked out alternator that puts 
out 14 volts on the bench.  Plus a new regulator.

The '76 has been running enough since [50 miles] to prove it doesn't leak 
any oil anymore, but I could have missed replacing a necessary wire.

I believe this is the 'early' '76, VIN 2262035022, and it is different from 
my '78  in the ECU wiring pins numbers and throttle, etc,

Now, the [final]  problem is that it will not even turn over, even with a 
fresh battery.  All this is just about one mile from home.
