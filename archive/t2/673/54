Hello Guys  This went around some time ago.  I personally use an assembly 
fluid made by Raybesto  part # baf-12 if and when rebuilding  brake or clutch  
clylinders. I would much rather buy these type of parts new but sometimes thats 
not a choice, such as the calibers for my 1965  356C porsche. I dont know why 
the stick up for paste is a problem but whatever.  I suspect that Jason is 
right that what is being called a paste is really the anti chatter stuff.Most of 
this stuff is either blue or red . I personally use the spray stuff  from 
permatex as you can get a better coating with it. It also works real well on head 
gaskets  as its temp range is something like 2500 degrees .   Later and have 
fun  Mark Dearing
