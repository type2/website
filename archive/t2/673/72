Subject: [T2] Overhead A/C

It is hardly the time to be talking about air conditioning up here in the 
northeast, but here goes :)

Just an FYI , as my guess is anyone running an overhead air conditioner (the 
VW t-shaped one) in their late baywindow bus probably has a bit of trouble 
finding parts for it. My local (Phila, PA) u-pull-it has a bay in it right 
now with the overhead air conditioner in it.  Everything *inside* and 
*under* the van is there.  Everything attached to the engine is already 
gone.  I have no connection to the yard, just thought I'd pass on some info 
in case anyone needed anything before it gets crushed.  P-Mail me for info, 
their prices are pretty cheap.  I'll probably be running up there this 
weekend to grab a few bits, so I might be able to pull/send something if 
need be.
