Subject: 71 bug convertible FS or trade in Ohio-PRICE CUT

Hey Y'all,
I am looking to get a decent single or double cab or
water cooled westy in trade for this nice bug vert. I
will also take money, at $3500 I am going in the red
on this sale, but I need the bread and the garage
space. Heres the link:
