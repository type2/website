I can second this because I blew up my homebuilt 1835 type1 engine this
way--an expensive mistake, it threw a rod through the case.  You may warn
her to kill the juice immediately upon hearing the rod knock, it would be a
little cheaper that way.

a good reason on engine disassembly to use the proper tool (or a dowel or
something soft) to remove the oil pressure relief pistons rather than
jamming a screwdriver into them, this was my downfall I think it got
deformed and that's why it got stuck.
