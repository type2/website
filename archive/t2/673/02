Hi Barry,

Sounds like a fuel delivery problem. My Dad's FI'd Vanagon westy did 
this last week on him, and the problem went away on its own as soon as 
the temps came up from -20C to -5C. We figure it was a blocked fuel 
filter, clogged with ice or frozen impurities.

Do you have a fuel pressure gauge? This will help determine if there is 
enough fuel getting through.

Suggestion: Swap in a fresh filter and see what that does for you. Let 
us know.

Happy Boxing Day,
