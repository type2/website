I don't know how I would have got my CHT ring terminal under the plug without completely deforming it unless I used the NGK B6ES plugs. These plugs let me install and remove the plugs without ring terminal wear and tear.

Some of the vendors on the list will tell you Bosch plug quality is going down and sell NGK. I've been able to get Bosch plugs in Made In Germany boxes and never had an issue but they see far more units than I do with my one bus.

The NGKs work great: quantitatively at least as good. I switched to a colder plug at the same time so I can't really make a direct comparison. I have them in my motorcycle, wife's Acura and the bus. Of the bike they are gapped very wide and always look like new. On the car they were run 65k miles and looked like crap...

The car was in bad need of a tune-up and a little pooped but we still got good mileage with those plugs.

Even VW was installing them in mexi-beetles.

I usually buy them locally for $1.99/ea. Some parts stores consider this plugs special order and want as much as $8/ea which is insane. You don't have to pay that much.

Parts Plus is the chain I get them from now that my local independent has shut down.
