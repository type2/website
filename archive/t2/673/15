Yah, I'll go ahead and do this today or tomorrow.  But, like I said, 
the starter is spinning when this happens ... I can hear it whirring!  
But the shaft is not popping forward to engage the flywheel.  Is this a 
symptom of insufficient juice?

No, that is still in the circuit.  I have a WR1 kit that the PO bought, 
sitting in my parts cabinet at home.
