Subject: Bosch Germany Plugs - Hint from Heloise

"I've been able to get Bosch plugs in Made In Germany boxes ..."

Hey, if you have actually LOOKED at the terminal tips on Bosch W8CC spark 
plugs made in Germany, you will see the copper core center of the terminal!!

[I like to think of the 'CC' as Core Copper, and the 'CP' as Core Platinum.  
I have a set of 'CO' plugs, and I guess it is time to see what the 'O' 
stands for!?!?!? Core Obsolete??  Core Oxonium??  Core Old-fashion??]


And if you look at the tip, the flat part of the terminal from a plug made 
in India, there will NOT be any Core Copper at all.  In fact, it will NOT 
even be FLAT, and smooth.

If you can get plugs from Germany, you should pay the extra Marks / Pesos / 
Gilders for them, and buy as many sets as your pockets can hold.  They will 
go up in value [quality = value] as the $.99 Bosch plugs continue to supply 
the market.

BTW, I am now [Monday]  off to Banks junk yard(s)  in Fredericksburg VA.  My 
cell is 571 235 4479.  I should be on line until 2-4 PM today.  My planned 
trip tomorrow is to the Banks in Conowingo MD [camping at the base of the 
Conowingo Dam tonight], and Jessup MD and Erdman Ave Baltimore MD (No, I 
don't like the 'new' Crazy Ray's.  They do not get as fresh a stock as the 
other two, because they are not crushing and replacing, just using their 
current inventory.)  Cell phone also.  If you need anything small...

PS.  The '76 is still not in service.  And I have to pick up a lawn mower 
from the repair shop for the final mulching of the leaves.
