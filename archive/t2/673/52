It's most likely anti-chatter grease (or whatever substance it might
be other than grease). The assembly lube is only used when completely
rebuilding a caliper. I used it when I redid my M-B a few years ago.
The substance that came with your calipers is to be spread on the back
side of the brake pads to supposedly help keep noise down.
