Subject: Starter trouble

This has been happening off-and-on for the last few months, but 
suddenly has gotten much worse (possibly because I'm in Tucson, AZ 
right now, which is colder at this time of year than San Francisco ever 
is).

The symptom is that, sometimes, usually when the engine is cold, 
turning the key will spin the starter, but the shaft is apparently not 
coming out to engage the flywheel.  Usually when this happens, it 
corrects itself after a couple of tries.  Yesterday (with my wife in 
the Bus, unfortunately), it took about a dozen tries before the starter 
would engage the flywheel.

This happens much less frequently in warm weather, or once the engine 
is warm (higher ambient temperature around the starter, I guess).

General opinion of my extended family here is that the cold weather has 
rendered the old lubricant in the starter sticky, preventing the shaft 
from coming forward.

Does this sound like a reasonable diagnosis?  Figure it's time to 
replace the starter?

I'm going to be here in Tucson for several more days, so does anyone 
know of a good VWFLAPS in the area where I can buy a decent reman 
starter?  I could mail order and replace it when I get home, I guess, 
but I have a lot of space to work on it while here, and it would 
probably make my wife happier if I fixed it before driving back to San 
Francisco.
