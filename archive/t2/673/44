Subject: Buggy for free

Hey fellow bus people, I have a dune buggy for free to the first person
able to pull it out of my yard here in sunny SoCal.  It is on a 56 frame w/
no tranny.  The body is in fine shape but needs paint and just about
everything but if you show up with a flat bed trailer I'll help you load
her up.  It is titled as a non-op so their are no back taxes due.  Anyway,
respond back off list so I can get this thing out of my yard.  I'm moving
to Texas soon and need to clean up my back yard so I can sell my house and
not look like white trash.  It is not a Manx but is made of very thick well
laid fiberglass so it is very strong.
