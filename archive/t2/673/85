Subject: What is this on my coil mounting bracket?

1970 standard VW beetle with 1200 D block engine



On my coil mounting bracket there appears to be a resistor of some kind, or
perhaps capacitor? It's about 2 inches long and 3/4 inch wide. It comes off
the 15 terminal with it's own black wire and just attaches between the coil
mounting bracket and the fanshroud via the 10mm bolt. What is this for?



Courtney
