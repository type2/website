Chris, please check you local law enforcement community.  It has been 
reported that if you are in the driver seat and the keys are in the 
ignition, even with the car parked with the engine off, you can be cited for 
DWI.

So, at least be sure the keys are not in the immediate area.

Also, on the battery cutoff, you can install a battery cutoff switch at the 
Negative Ground terminal of your battery.  You can twist the green knob and 
disconnect the ground.

This is a good type [Careful, some FLAPS sell them at $14 or more!!]

When the Green knob is twisted just one turn, the current is interrupted.

Also, with the battery disconnected like this, you can run any AMP meter 
across both sides of the disconnect [over the Green knob] and read the 
actual amperage.  Turn your parking lights on, and read the actual amps they 
are using.  Have you SO blow the horn!! You will go WILD, once you get the 
hang of it!!

Heloise Hints again!!  [Barry, actually, but you knew that, right??]
