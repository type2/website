I'd:
	- recheck the plugs for fouling

	- make sure that your choke is disengaging when warmed up
	
	- check for vacuum leaks (is the idle completely smooth?) 
		(spray the throttle shaft bushing in particular)
	
Could also be your pre-heater tubes are clogged, but I would think that 
would result more in the choke not disengaging (although I could be 
wrong).
