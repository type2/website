Mario,

Bad relay will not make the pump run constantly. It is probably the afm
doing this, I've seen it before where the switch contact inside the afm is
closed with the afm flapper in the resting position - switch should only be
closed with afm flapper open, i.e. engine running. It seems that people who
don't understand how the pump circuit works, like a previous owner for
instance, make a "modification" to the afm, which actually breaks the
failsafe system of the pump. If there is evidence of the top cover of the
afm having been removed, pull it off and look for this condition. First
verify correct (or incorrect) pump functioning on with Bentley fi chapter.

Pump running constantly won't cause rich running, by the way, it is supposed
to be always running when the engine is running.

You should have a pressure regulator already, look on ratwell.com there are
some very god diagrams on what components fit where.
