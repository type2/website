Subject: Re: [T2] upper bunk for a 73 westy?

The bed shown is for a Westy with to top cut away to fit the wider bed,
not ther sunroof style that had a cot.  However, I will email you a pic
of the foambed as I had on  a 71 bus bought in Germany- it had a hinge
in the front and flipped up with the roof when you were not using it. 
It was very handy and we still use it as a backboard to our bed. 
Somewhere in the archives should be my post re how this was sized.

 times over the years, but never tried it. I know that one of the list

 has done this, so I know it can be done. As I was surfing the samba
last month
 I ran across this ad.
