Subject: WooHoo!! Wipers Work Now!!

Ok, I still need a new switch, but..

My wipers work! 

When I had cleaned and lubed everything, I couldn't get the wiper
mounts apart. So I just squirted in as much grease as I could.

Well, on a lark yesterday I soaked them in PB Blaster. Then I blew
them out and sprayed white lithium grease inside. (I know, not the
best. I figured it was just screwing around anyway..)

It worked! I guess there was stuff in there binding up the shaft and
the PB cleaned it out! WooHoo!!!

Now to push in some moly grease or something and replace the switch...
