Subject: AIRS help needed - Oxford PA

Help!!

Tehre is a '71 in Oxford PA that is going to the junk yard if it cannot be 
found and saved.  The junk yard will not re-sell it if they do not get the 
title with the vehicle.

The junk yard said they would be picking up a '71 VA van in a couple of days 
(by this weekend!!) and/but if 'we' can find it and get to it first, I hope 
we can get it back on the road....

I know someone on the list in Washington DC area who recently asked about 
getting a '71 station wagon...


Someone give me some help on this.  Are you out there?!?!??


BTW, I got the '76 back home.  It had TWO massive vacuum leaks.  More on 
that if requested...
