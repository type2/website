Subject: 2.0l cooling

Working on the 82 westy looking for overheating problems. Saw the picture at
(http://www.californiavan.com/95altima/81westy.jpg ). Is there a seal/gasket
between the oil cooler and the warm air duct, left rear.  There was not a seal
in place when I had it apart a year ago, so I didn't even think about looking
for one (first 2.0l I opened).
