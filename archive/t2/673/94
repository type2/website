It is a capacitor installed by some dealers to reduce a clicking noise on 
the radio caused by voltage fluctuations generated by the points and help 
provide a little extra power at the coil for better spark.

I had a bad one on my 74 super beetle and it caused me no end of grief 
until I just tore it out one day after checking and replacing just about 
every other part in the ignition system. It got 100% better after that. 
Most radios nowadays have internal voltage regulation, but if you have a 
stock radio it may still click. Of course, if someone on this great list 
has a capacitor meter and a good one, you could replace it with a regular 
capacitor of the right rating. But me, I tossed it far away and never 
looked back.
