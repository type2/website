I can't afford any bus parts right now.  There's my bus content.

Watching the footage I've seen so far makes me care very little about a lot of
things in my life, especially bus parts.  I feel that right now is a time when
the rules of this list must bend for us to reflect amongst each other,
typically a caring, connected group of folks, about the value of human life,
and to consider this situation in a big, big way.

As a generally non-religious type, I pray for these people as I watch human
beings swept away by tides, wondering if their next moment off camera carries
life or death.  It's a far cry from the worst moments I'll likely ever come
across in my life.

Ron's absolutely correct.  We haven't seen the worst of this.
