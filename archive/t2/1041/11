Subject: poptop paint question

I'm going to be bringing my bus to the paint shop to have it painted.  I 
was talking to the guy at the shop about what to do about the pop-top. 
One suggestion that he had was using white truck bed liner paint because 
it's really durable.  I don't care about it being smooth or shiny.. I 
just want it to be strong.  Anyone think it would be a bad idea?  Would 
it make it too heavy?

I just have to check to make sure that the bed liner paint can flex 
because I know that top bends when I load stuff on top, especially in 
the luggage rack..

Thanks!
Mike
