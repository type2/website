Troy -

Just pulling back the steering lock and looking at the cylindrical portion
of the lock will not get you the code.  The Lock Cylinder where the key goes
in must be extracted from the steering lock and to look at the code on that
piece will get you results (usually).  Then yer local locksmith can code cut
it.  Write down the code on a piece of paper and put it in a safe place.

You didn't indicate if you have an early or late 74 (the steering
locks changed at Vin 2x4 2164 059/060), so the procedures are a bit
different.  Here are some links:
