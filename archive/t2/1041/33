Subject: Re: lifter woes

Likely your pushrod is NOT seated in the cup on top of that lifter, and 
subsequently bangs around making all hellish kinds of noise and not 
doing its job. When you are assembling them horizontally into an 
installed engine its easy for that to happen.  The telltale sign is 
indeed that the adjusting screw is turned way out compared to the 
others.  Just did this, 3 of 8 were this way on the first go around !

but now on the #4 intake/exhaust side the valve adjustment screws are way
out by comparison to the others.
