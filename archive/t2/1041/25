Subject: SEALS, Seals, seals... who to buy from!?

Ok.. so, I'm going to be repainting the bus and pulling off all of the 
old seals as they're totally shot.  Now I just need to figure out which 
ones to buy.

I'd like to get the best quality seals, but I'm not sure who to go with. 
  I bought some seals from OE Vee Dub a while back for my sliders and 
they seem like they're high quality.  I'm guessing that I want to stick 
with the German ones?

I'd like to redo all the weatherstripping, seals/window scrapers, poptop 
seals, etc.  If anyone has any recommendations, I'd appreciate it!

Thanks,
Mike
