 My dust cover had a big gob of silicone over the speedo end. I removed itand
removed the circlip and pulled the cable out the back a bit and tierapped it
in place. Now I don't have to listen to the aweful noise of itdestroying
itself. Just have to get a new one at some point will try aFLAPS when I get to
a bigger city. Currently in Advocate Harbour NS.

-----------------------------------------------------

When my daughters rpm counter froze and took out the top end of the lower
cable; I found that neither the upper or lower cable is available anymore.
Only the one-piece earlier is available so the rpm counter is out of the
system. The one-piece cable is part number 211 957 801 F.
