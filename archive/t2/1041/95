Subject: New owner; 1970 Camper

Cream colored vw camper '70.
My car broke down in Seaside on Thursday.  A really accommodating
mechanic got me back on the road in great time.  He had a handful of
vw in the lot and was selling someb& including a 70 camper!  I have
been wanting another van ever since I got rid of mine ten years ago,
and am excited to be an owner of the T2.  I left a deposit of B= price,
and continued with my camping trip in Big Sur (unfortunately I didn't
really look it over completely.  I was sold on a glance).  I'm going
down to see it this weekend.
The seller (Mechanic) is working on the electrical and some body rust.
I am due to pick it up in 2 weeks.
I'm going into this blind b based on pure love of the bus.  I have
owned beetles (80's convertible), and one bus (80's vanagon)prior-
both which took me across the country and back, but nothing this old.
I am planning on resorting it, but want to learn how to care for it
first.
What should I look for when I pick it up?  What questions need to be
asked? Crash course in the 70 bus/camper?
Thanks!
