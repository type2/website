A way to get your deposit back?  :)

First thing I would look at would be the fuel lines, braking system, 
tires, and the health of the type 1 engine.

- replace the fuel lines without question
- look at the brakes and adjust the shoes.  front and back
- get new tires that are properly load rated for the bus
- a compression test would be a good starting point to determine the 
health of the engine.
