    It's getting harder and harder to find a "radiator shop" these
    days...With plastic and aluminum radiators being the norm
    and cheap chinese (original) or replacements available, the
    business of repairing radiators is pretty much gone...
    My buddy, in his heyday, had ten guys workin' for him in
    his shop, now he just pulls 'em and sticks another one in...
