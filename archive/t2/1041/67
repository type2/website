Subject: RE: [T2] Speedo cable replacement

Thanks for the replies.  Love the type2 list.

My dust cover had a big gob of silicone over the speedo end. I removed it
and removed the circlip and pulled the cable out the back a bit and tie
rapped it in place.  Now I don't have to listen to the aweful noise of it
destroying itself.  Just have to get a new one at some point will try a
FLAPS when I get to a bigger city. Currently in Advocate Harbour NS.

Cheers,
James
