Subject: Re: Bosch W8AC Plug discontinued?

Jules said: According to the service people at my local Foreign FLAPS
(BAP/GEONAlbany, NY) the Bosch W8AC spark plug is no longer available.
Theyoffered Bosch Super Plus 7902 as a relplacement. Oh, I just noticedthat
the plugs are stamped WR8AC. 1) Is the W8AC going away?2) Is the Yttrium core
Super Plus an OK plug to run in my 1600 air cooled?

Do not use any plug with a R in the number. That is a resister plug. Your
standard ignition system has the resistance already built in to the rotor and
the plug ends.

W8AC is the same as 7502.  I have not heard anything about it being
discontinued. These places show them available:
