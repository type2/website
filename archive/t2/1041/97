Subject: Re: Bus curb weights?

Joel asked:
 I was reading on wikipedia and it said:"In 1968, the second generation of the
Type 2 was introduced. It was built in Germany until 1979, with production
shifting to Mexico in 1980. Brazilian VW plant produces the Kombi since the
50's until today. Models before 1971 are often called the T2a, while models
after 1972 are called the T2b.This second-generation Type 2 lost its
distinctive split front windshield, and was slightly larger and considerably
heavier than its predecessor." So, my question is: where it mentions that the
later version is heavier than its predecessor, does it mean the '68 to '71
bays that have the turn lights down low and the doghouse fans hroud, or does
it mean that the splitties ('67 and down) are lighter than the bays?  The
vintage bus list didn't have anything on "curb weight" or "net weight" to
compare it to the approx 2700 lbs that I found for the bays. Thanks,Joel in

It is answered in the first paragraph; ist and 3rd sentences:
In 1968, the second generation of the Type 2 was introduced.
and
This second-generation Type 2 lost its distinctive split front windshield, and
was slightly larger and considerably heavier than its predecessor.

What are you missing?

For a 67 Kombi, you are looking at about 2500 lbs.

For a 68 Kombi, you are looking at about 2800 lbs.

Same for a 71 Kombi:

Now I know my 77 deluxe Westy weighs 3820 lbs. on the scale without me in it.
VW said 3300 lbs...... so I am not sure what the deal is. Curb weight means
'ready to drive', VW lists it as 'unladen weight':

Ready to drive to me is a tank full of gas and my water tank and my propane
tank full. Not counting any additional items inside other than the camper
equipment like the front and rear tables and the front stool. All the items
listed here under 'deluxe Campmobile', pages 4 and 5:
