Subject: 1600DP won't idle

Hello all!

My new 1600DP in the '69 won't idle.  After a quick check that the shut-off
solenoid was functioning, I plugged in the vacuum gauge
 and sure enough I have 5" of vacuum (and no stuck-valve vibration in the
gauge needle).  I'm just getting back into type1 engines after a long stint
in type4s, so I'd like advice.

My best guess for the source of the leak is the intake manifold boots.  As
far as I can tell, I'm going to have to pull the engine to get to the intake
manifold boots.  The generator has to come off, and I can't see how that
will happen with the engine in the bus.  Correct?

I did a visual and that is the only idea I have for the leak.  I did give
the manifold end to head nuts a crank and they are all tight, all vacuum
ports are connected or capped and the silver disc in the rear of the carb is
in place.

What simple stupid thing have I missed that will save me from an engine
pull?

Steve
