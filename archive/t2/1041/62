Subject: Re: 1600DP won't idle

Steve said: My new 1600DP in the '69 won't idle. After a quick check that the
shut-offsolenoid was functioning, I plugged in the vacuum gaugeand sure enough
I have 5" of vacuum (and no stuck-valve vibration in thegauge needle). I'm
just getting back into type1 engines after a long stintin type4s, so I'd like
advice. My best guess for the source of the leak is the intake manifold boots.
Asfar as I can tell, I'm going to have to pull the engine to get to the
intakemanifold boots. The generator has to come off, and I can't see how
thatwill happen with the engine in the bus. Correct? I did a visual and that
is the only idea I have for the leak. I did givethe manifold end to head nuts
a crank and they are all tight, all vacuumports are connected or capped and
the silver disc in the rear of the carb isin place. What simple stupid thing
have I missed that will save me from an enginepull?
------------------------------

5" ?    Are you sure the timing isn't severely retarded?  I would advance the
timing first. See what the vacuum is at 7.5 before TDC.

You do not need to R&R the engine to remove a DP intake.  Just loosen the
clamps on the boots, remove the carb, remove the left side intake end, remove
the nut on the center support mount, then slide the center section out to the
left.
