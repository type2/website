Subject: Changed Oil for first time...

Hey guys,

      I have a rebuilt 1800cc in my 73 VW Bus. I had issues with the lifters
(which were re-used apparently) in my Bus. The rebuild was done by GEX several
years ago prior to me getting it. The Bus has about 3-4k miles on it since I
bought it, and the motor had just been installed prior to me getting it.

In any case, with the recommendation of you guys, I installed new lifters (the
Febe ones I think??? whichever are the best ones from Bus Depot). Anyway, I
changed the oil this weekend. It was a mix of various 40 weight oils and some
synthetic (yeah, I know, I shouldn't mix... sorry). But, I changed the oil to
15W-40 Shell Rotella-S. From what I understand, that's probably the best oil I
should be using in the VW Bus with our air cooled motors (right?).

Anyway, the oil that I drained from the engine was fairly clean, but there was
this black powder of sorts, that was suspended in the oil. It's kind of hard
to explain, but... my guess is that maybe they were little metal fragments, or
something??? It's like the oil was totally clear, and then here was this black
powdery stuff that was totally suspended in the oil. I figured some metal
shavings would be expected since I installed the new lifters... just wondering
if I should be concerned. I did use assembly lube (heavily) on the new lifters
and pushrods.


Thanks!

Todd
