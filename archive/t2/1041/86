I actually also had problems accessing the site early yesterday morning.

NSLOOKUPs were timing out and I am on a comcast business line in the
PACNW on a vista PC so no AOL or MAC related issues (not implying that
the MAC would be the issue though)

By the afternoon it appeared to be fine however.

I did note that the DNS record had been updated as of yesterday so
potentially there was a DNS change  or update that hadn't propagated
out to all the DNS servers yet.
Any changes in the registration or nameserver associations?
