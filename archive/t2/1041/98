One other thing to consider is the emergency brake cable. I have a the
later, larger booster in my '74 and the e-brake cable rubs up against
it when engaged and disengaged. It started to wear the cable. I had to
do some adjusting and ended up encasing it in a rubber tube to prevent
damage to the cable. it hasn't given me much trouble since.
