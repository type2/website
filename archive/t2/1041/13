I'd think that would be really heavy - those liners are thick, and made 
to stand up to bricks being tossed into the back of a truck.

I used a quality two-part boat (topside) paint, both primer and 
topcoat. It's intended use is much closer (on fiberglass, lengthy 
sun/weather exposure, etc.) to your poptop than bed liner. It's tough 
stuff, since it's made to put up with the wear associated with walking 
on it.
