The "Super Plus" appears to be Bosch's new name for their standard plugs,
so perhaps the number has changed.  The "copper core" is now "Yttrium
enhanced" which probably means that somewhere along the line someone waves
a sample of yttrium over the production line for the benefit of the
marketing department.

The thing to stay away from is small-electrode plugs made to operate with
high-energy ignition systems.  They do not work well with VW's Kettering
system.

Personally, I stopped buying Bosch plugs because their quality control
went to pot.  NGK B5HS is the replacement for short reach
applications.  Even VW de Mexico ships NGK plugs with their new engines
and vehicles.
