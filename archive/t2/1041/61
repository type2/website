Have you tried the carb cleaner test - squirt carb cleaner around any areas  
of suspected vacuum leaks and see if that affects engine speed.
 
How is your engine timed?  What crank pulley do you have and  where are the 
marks on it?  What distributor do you have?  What carb  are you using?  You 
probably already know that these things all interact,  but I'm bringing them up 
just in case.
