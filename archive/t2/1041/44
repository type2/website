Subject: Replacement key for ignition on a '74

I've misplaced my keys and the ignition key is different than the door  
locks.  I unscrewed the steering column from the dash to pull it back  
and have a look at the cylinder, but I was not able to find a code of  
any sort.  Since I can't use the code on the door locks to make a  
replacement, am I stuck with having a locksmith come out to form a  
key?  The quotes I have currently are all in the $200 range for such  
services.
