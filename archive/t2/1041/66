I had to open up my fuel tank to replace the sender o-ring, and it looked very clean on the inside with no sign of rust.  For that reason I didn't bother refinishing the tank (A PO had cut out an access hole in the rear deck). If you want reliability I would probably either open the sender hole up for an inspection, or maybe remove and crack open the fuel filter and look for signs of rust or other particles.
