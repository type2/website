Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Bosch W8AC Plug discontinued?

This is the hard, cold fact:  Bosch has discontinued manufacturing ALL Non
resistor automotive spark plugs this spring.  Whatever stocks are out there
are only what's available until they're GONE.  Airhead Parts has recently
bought up as much of the Non-Resistor Spark Plugs as we could find and I'm
sure outfits like Bug City and other are doing the same as the word trickles
down from the warehouses.  After that, it's resistor spark plugs from Bosch.

NGK still continues to market Non-Resistor Spark Plugs and they're a great
alternative (I've used them), but word from my sources is that these will be
discontinued at the manufacturer sometime soon as well.

W8AC:

I have used Resistor Spark Plugs in several of my VWs for the past decade
along with the Resistor Wires already in place.  Never noticed any
difference in power or mileage.
YMMV
