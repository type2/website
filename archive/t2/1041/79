I don't see why you couldn't.  I would pull the fan off and take a look 
at it to see if it's seated correctly.  If not, just use a large socket 
or something similar and tap it in place.  If it's still leaking, then 
maybe try using some Permatex aviation form-a-gasket or Gaskacinch - 
either should work fine.

Check also that one of the oil galley plugs hasn't popped out..
