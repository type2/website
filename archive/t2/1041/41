Subject: Bench test fuel pump?

I have just installed a rebuilt 1800 carburetted engine in my 74 westy and it won't start for want of gas.  Gas does not come from the pump if the hose to the carb is removed at the pump and engine is cranked.  Gas flows freely if the hose from the tank is removed.

Stupidest question first: larger pump nipple connects to tank and smaller connects to carb?

The fuel pump is off the engine and on the bench.  With pump primed, Should I be able to pump with my thumb?  There's no gas pumped when I try.  The "gas" I'm failing to pump on the bench is actually paint thinner.  Good idea?  Bad idea?

The pump push rod looks good to my non-mechanic's eyes.  It looks to be a uniform thickness with no visible mushrooming.

Have I proved that the pump is bad?  What haven't I checked?  Please help me move on and find out whether my rebuild even works.

Thanks,

Jim
