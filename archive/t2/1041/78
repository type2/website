Subject: fan (rear) seal

can I replace the rear-ish fan seal on my '74 pancake without removing the
engine?  I just reinstalled the seal with thengine out and don't want to
drop if I don't have to.  But, apparently, I failed to seat the seal
correctly because the engine fan is spraying oil inside the fan housing and
leakinginto my newly painted engine compartment!

Also, any tips on installing that seal?  I used a seal glazing liquid (a
glue? with an indian head on it?) as I am afraid I mis-seated the seal.

Thanks!
