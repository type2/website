I think a network outage is to blame. It was down earlier and now  
it's up again.

It's located on a virtual host so an ip address alone won't direct  
you to my site.

No. I moved the most popular content from .mac a few years ago when  
the traffic quotas threatened to shut the site down for 2 weeks at a  
time.

Most of the photos are stored on .mac still and I'm going to move  
them elsewhere when I get through my backlog of tasks. The whole site  
is overdue for a makeover anyway.

If anyone has any site feedback for me, please email me with your ideas.
