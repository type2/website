I used Interlux Epoxy Primekote and Perfection (polyurethane). A quart 
of each is more than enough to do a top which just needs refreshing. 
When I did mine, I think I used 2 quarts of each, but my top didn't 
have much gelcoat left - it was fuzzy. I had to build it up quite a 
bit, it took several coats with sanding in between just to get past the 
"nubs." I did mine myself, and used a mini-roller. Looks pretty good, 
IMO, but it's not glass smooth, it's got a texture.

Note that two part paints have special requirements, special thinners, 
special stuff you wipe the fiberglass down with to get rid of wax, etc. 
Interlux has technical details on their website.

You might do better letting the shop get a paint system they're 
familiar with. They may have used Imron or Awlgrip in the past. You 
might also consider going to a boat yard - they're more likely to be 
familiar with these paints.

You do NOT want to spray any of these yourself - they're dangerous that 
way, and you need a good airline respirator, if not a pressure suit. 
Brushing/rolling is relatively safe, as long as you have good 
ventilation (I did mine outside, there's only a couple of bugs stuck in 
the paint).
