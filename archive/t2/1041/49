property quickly.

fridge/closet/Queen bed) 
White
4 speed
Single dual-port carb

conditioning option>>
Good scissor pop top and vinyl
Good tires
EXTREMELY LOW
MILES - Only 38,000 actual miles on it with all repairs documented 
Originally
from Florida.
stored since 2001and located in Rochester New York area.
Clean
with NO RUST underneath - someone gave it some loving
THE BAD STUFF:
minor rust flake on driver's side panel - painted over 
Slight rust around the
window seal of the sliding door
Driver's seat needs to be repaired - the duct
tape is already shredded
Currently fixing the Ignition switch
May need some
exhaust components as well - which I may try and fix to get it on the road.
Asking $4000 or best offer.
If interested give me a shout and I will send you
pictures or take more detailed pictures.
