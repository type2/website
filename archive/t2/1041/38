Subject: re: oil cooler question

thanks martin.

i'm trying to source the leak. can't be the front main or the oil pump seal.

the cooler was over-torqued (seals squashed), so it was probably the cooler seals, but i hate to put a leaky cooler back in there.


anyway, thanks.

clark

even if it is not leaking?

Mine is clean as a whistle. You may be getting an oil leak onto the fan
which is then getting into the cooler.
