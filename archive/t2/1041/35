Subject: [Q] Restoration (Checklist)

Group-

I'm seeing the light at the end of the tunnel on restoration of my '71
Westie.  (O.K., there's a bunch left to do, but I'm trying to focus on
completion.)

My philosophical question is how far to take my inspection/replacement.
For example, should I pull the fuel tank and clean it just for grins and
giggles?  I'd rather not, as the bus was running alright in that department
before my project started.  What about axles, wheel bearings, etc.?  What
about wiring?  You see where this is headed...

When I'm done, I want to have confidence that the bus will take me anywhere
I want to go.  I'm even having a new engine built for her.  However, I
don't mind some minor adjustments that have to be corrected after I start
driving her again.

In general, "consumables" are being replaced (i.e. hoses, seals, gaskets,
wiring, etc.).  "Non-consumables" are not being replaced/refurbished (i.e.
transmission, wheels, axles, steering, etc.).  One exception is the engine,
which is being replaced.

Thoughts?

Looking for the balance...
