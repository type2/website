Subject: Re: [T2] Speedo cable replacement

There are two seperate sections of cable:

Hub to speedo gearbox.

Gearbox to speedo guage


The gearbox is behind the kick panel near the gas pedal. 

Three of the four cable-ends have screw-on fittings which can be disconnected instantly. 

If the gearbox is making the noise, disconnect the hub-to-gearbox cable at the gearbox. Easy fix.

If the gearbox-to-speedo cable is the problem, disconnect this cable at the gearbox. Easy fix.

The hub end has a different attachment. If the hub-to-gearbox cable is the problem, you might be able to disconnect this cable from the gearbox end and then pull it out...it is not clamped into the hub, it should slide out. I assume that it can be re-installed by pushing it back in but you will need to remove the small grease cap on the hub first, and then re-align the square hole in the greasecap with the square cable end after the cable is in. 

If you really needed to, you could remove the hub greasecap and drill out the square hole so that it is too big to engage the cable end.  You would need to replace the greasecap, or weld up the hole to restore the speedo later.
