Subject: Splash Panels wanted - 68 Baywindow

Hello to you all.

I'm looking for a pair of splash panels for a 68 Baywindow bus. Is there
anyone in this list selling a pair?
If so, let me know how much you want for them and please, send me pictures and
shipping fees to Lisbon, Portugal.
Thank you all and sorry if I'm bothering you with this message.
Regards from Portugal.

Joao.
