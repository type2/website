Subject: Speedo cable replacement

Hello All,

I intended to give notice earlier that I would be driving around Canada in
my 75 Westy
http://jamesgreatphotos.com/autos/westy/img.php?img=IMG_3533.jpg for a few
months, but it got put off and off.

We've done almost 2000 kms now in 5 days from Burlngton, ON to Moncton NB.
 Everything is going well except my speedocable has starting making
annoying noises...I assume it is coming apart inside.  The speedo still
works but it wobbles.  I thought I would just diconnect it at the wheel
but that doesn't look easy.  My Bentley has no mention of the speedo cable
(that I could find).  Muir's book has some instructions but they didn't
match what I found when I removed the hub cap?

Would appreciate some advice on removal and where I could perhaps buy a
cable in Nova Scotia.

TIA!
James & Mariana

Got lucky in Saranac Lake NY...very bad storm at the campground...a
sizeable tree fell and missed the westy by 5 ft!
