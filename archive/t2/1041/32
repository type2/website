Subject: hydraulic lifter stuck in bore

Greetings,

Does any one have any advice on how to get a stubborn lifter out. The engine
is a 2.0 in a '73 Westie with dual carbs.  I was getting valve train noise and
determined that I had a soft lifter (pushed in easy).  Pulled rockers and
tubes but the lifter will not come out.  I tried a magnet and a dental pic, in
the cir clip groove.  One came out with the magnet but two others will not
come out.  It moves about half an inch then stops.  I can get a pretty good
bite with the pic and seem to be pulling pretty hard.  Any advice is greatly
appreciated, even if it is pull the engine and split the cases.

Thanks,
Tom
