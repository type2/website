Subject: resistor plugs

Karl, you recently said:

Do not use any plug with a R in the number. That is a resister plug. Your
standard ignition system has the resistance already built in to the rotor and
the plug ends.

Karl, why should we not use these resistor type plugs?  What is the
potential damage, or loss of performance that might happen?
