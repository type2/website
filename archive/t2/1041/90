I had no problems earlier during this discussion but this morning cannot
access the site either.  NSLookups both locally and on the web seem to
timeout.

The odd thing for me is that our Volkswagen car club is having the exact same
problem with our website.

Makes me wonder if the problems maybe more Internet widespread related.
