Subject: 0.25% C) and 1118 HC -failed inspection - suggestions?

I failed inspection in NJ with a CO of 0.25% (acceptable with over 3.0 a 
fail) but a HC of 1118! (300 max allowed).  How can the CO be so low 
with the HC's so high? It runs OK but with some popping in the exhaust 
under high vacuum. The engine was rebuilt 9 months ago, with trips to 
Busses at Knoebel's, Salisbury Beach, Mass and Everybus/Savannah, and a 
week trip to Indiana Dunes.  (about 5K now) My milage of 16 I assumed 
was due to engine breaking in, but the rebuilder mentioned I had given 
him a faulty pressure regulator and he had to replace a "blown" 
injector- I suspect that others are leaking? When I had the blocked gas 
tank problem I kept a pressure gauge on the rail and it did seem to drop 
fast when stopped. Has anyone actually pulled the injectors but left 
them attached to see the spray pattern or checking leaks when closed? 
There doesn't seem to be enough slack in the connectors to allow this?
I have at least 8 others from parts engines I'd like to test in a 
homemade system using a boat gas tank.
