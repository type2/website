Dude,  since you will be removing the steering wheel key lock cyl
anyways, you might want to have the steering wheel key lock cyl
re-rest to match your other key.

Just be sure that you have a 'R' coded ignition lock if you have 'R'
coded late bay door cylinders. I mean, you get the idea.

I had a Beetle steering wheel key lock on my '78 bus, I think it was a
'G' code. MARK I in Maryland pulled a correct cylinder from one of his
buses and re-set the cylinder to match my door keys, so I wound up
with one key for all.
