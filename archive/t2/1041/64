Hello David....1971? Its been 37 years since anybody looked inside that 
fuel tank compartment.  At least look.
I chose to leave mine alone.... it is a 76... 5 years later (now) I regret 
not replacing the sender and filler pipes.
Consider visually inspecting the inside of the tank, and the filler hoses 
and fittings while the engine is out and everything is easily to see. Then 
do what is necessary to correct any corrosion/rust/sediment/deterioration 
that you observe in the system. And maybe even replace the sender on 
general principles.
