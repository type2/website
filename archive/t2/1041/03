Subject: 74 westy for sale

I am selling a real nice 74 westy for a friend
 
I just drove this more then 300 miles round trip to Natural bus campout and  
it handled high way and VERY winding roads.  It runs and drives great.  It has 
newer canopy and has very little rust, new windshield,tires,brake  lines  and 
more.
 
For $3500 I will fix the rust areas, this goes on Ebay soon.
email with any questions ,I have pictures
