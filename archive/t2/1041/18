Subject: Wiring harness 1972

I have a wiring harness from Bus-boys for my 72 (sun roof) van.  I have
a couple of questions:



1.	How do I get the harness routed from the engine compartment to
the front?  It goes through a void between the floor and a false bottom
under the floor.  Can I remove this lower plate?  Or just snake it
through with an electricians snake?
2.	Is there a better set of instructions than the wiring diagram in
the tech manual?  It gives me connections, but the colors are not always
matching up, so a "drawing" would help a lot more. None of the cabling
is actually marked with identifiers and the van has been "southern
engineered" throughout the entire electrical system.  Anything like this
exist?



Any hints would help, this is my first hobby vehicle of any type and
don't want to end up screwing it up and having to sell it in boxes!  I
have been reading the posts for a few days and it seems there are a lot
of people out there willing to share info, Thanks.
