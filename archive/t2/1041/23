Subject: Re: [T2] 009 in a '72 with 1700cc

Thanks Jules, but that was my question in the first place.  The T2 
archives do not specify if the 009 timing is for upright or pancake 
engine.  The article on the T2 archives sounds like what you need to do 
with an upright engine.  Maybe someone could write a T4 motor specific 
article?

But anyways, I am going to try what Jim said.  Thanks guys

Andrew
