Subject: Bosch W8AC Plug discontinued?

Hi,

According to the service people at my local Foreign FLAPS (BAP/GEON
Albany, NY) the Bosch W8AC spark plug is no longer available.  They
offered Bosch Super Plus 7902 as a relplacement. Oh, I just noticed
that the plugs are stamped WR8AC.

1) Is the W8AC going away?
2)  Is the Yttrium core Super Plus an OK plug to run in my 1600 air cooled?

peace
