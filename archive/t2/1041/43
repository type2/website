Tom said: Does any one have any advice on how to get a stubborn lifter out.
The engineis a 2.0 in a '73 Westie with dual carbs. I was getting valve train
noise anddetermined that I had a soft lifter (pushed in easy). Pulled rockers
andtubes but the lifter will not come out. I tried a magnet and a dental pic,
inthe cir clip groove. One came out with the magnet but two others will
notcome out. It moves about half an inch then stops. I can get a pretty
goodbite with the pic and seem to be pulling pretty hard. Any advice is
greatlyappreciated, even if it is pull the engine and split the cases.

Before you go any further.  Get a spray can of Berryman's B12 carb spray.

Available at most all auto parts stores.
And spray the lifter bore. 9 times out of 10, it is oil sludge on the bottom
egde of the lifter. The lifter moves in the bore but the cam end is exposed
for the oil film to attach to. Spray and work the lifter in and out. It should
then come right out.
