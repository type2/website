Subject: lifter woes

Hello oh  great informative list,
i got a 2.0L with hydraulic lifters, i found some soft ones ..so i replaced
them  with pumped new ones.
but now on the #4 intake/exhaust side the valve adjustment screws are way
out by comparison to the others.
i checked to be sure the pushrods are in correct on the lifter and the
rocker. i re-pulled the lifter and check it and they are hard, yet it sounds
like the rocker arm is smacking as if the lifter were soft and theres a
sucking sound.
please by all means ..make me look stupid and point out some obvious thing i
forgot.
