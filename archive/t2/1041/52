Subject: Need help IDing a ground wire

Hey Everyone,
I just got my bus back from the metal doctor and it now has a new nose!

I spent all last night hooking up the headlights and stuff, but I can't 
figure out a couple ground wires and I need some help from someone else 
with a 76-79 range bus, maybe earlier...

If you look under the dash, there's a ground spade cluster welded to the 
fresh air box, just below the windshield wiper moter assembly.  It looks 
like there is one ground that goes there from the wiper, one from the 
wiring harness, and then there's one that goes ??.  This mystery ground 
wire is about 1 foot long and has a large spade connector on one side 
and a small, narrow spade on the other.  I'm guessing it connects 
somewhere behind the dash but I don't know where.  I was hoping someone 
could look under their dash to see where it goes.

If you look at the bentley wiring diagram at the 77-78 models, I *think* 
it's the ground wire at the bottom that runs from track 13 to 15 and is 
brown.

Thanks!
Mike
