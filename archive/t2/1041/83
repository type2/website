CO is a combustion byproduct...if your CO is OK then your air/fuel ratio is probably OK.

Hydrocarbons can from several sources...

Combustion Byproducts.
Oil leaks into the cyclinder (unlikely with a new engine).
Excess Fuel..this produces LOT's of HC.

You didn't say what year your bus is...Does it have a catalytic converter, or is it supposed to have one?  Since you have FI you probably are. If you had a leaky injector in the past, that could have easily destroyed the cat by dumping raw fuel into it, causing overheating. If someone had removed the cat, it would have trouble passing smog if the pass threshold was based on the cat being there.  Any muffler shop can weld one on for a few hundred dollars.

You FI system could also have problems. The manual does say that you can pull the injectors, leave them connected, and check spray and leakage. It would be a tight fit. BE CAREFUL WITH FUEL SPRAYING IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.
