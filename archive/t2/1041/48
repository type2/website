It's always surprised me that you don't. In the UK finding a suitable venue 
to hold this sort of event isn't easy. There aren't that many large 
showgrounds. The price of petrol doesn't help either.

I wouldn't miss it though. Have a look at my pictures here:

Then start checking the web for cheap air fares !
