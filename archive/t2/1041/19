Without the rear mount the engine will still work fine for a bug or for a
splitty bus.

For considerable $$$ you might find a good welder who could weld up a boss
(the "female tube") for you, but you might be money ahead to just get
another set of cases or complete longblock.  You could also go with an oil
pump bracket, but I'm rather leery of those.
