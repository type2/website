Subject: 009 in a '72 with 1700cc

Hey Volks,

We just got the motor in my girlfriend's '72 Rivi the other day and I 
had a question about timing.  We are running a 1700cc motor that was 
pulled from a Porsche 914 with a 009 distributor.  We are planning to 
run the 009 for now until we can get some cash to buy a SVDA for the bus.

So my question is: in the T2 archives, there is an article about timing 
a 009.  Is this article about timing an upright 1600cc motor or does it 
also apply to the Type IV motors?  If not, how should I time a 009 in a 
T4 motor?  Total advance or idle?

Thanks,
Andrew
