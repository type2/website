The minimum I would do with the wiring is replace the fuses and clean up the
main connections where the ground joins to the body, the strap connects the
transmission to the body and the +ve battery terminal connects to the
solenoid. After cleaning, coat these connections with an anti corrosive
coating. These 2 tasks saved me from future grief by replacing several fuses
about to fail from cracked metal and several of the wrong amp rating and
gained about 0.5v measured at the front of the vehicle.

If you want to do more, reco the alternator by replacing the bearings and
brushes. It's surprisingly easy to do. In fact the hard bit is getting the
alternator out with the engine installed. (hint!).
