You do  not need to R&R the engine to remove a DP intake.  Just loosen  the
clamps on the boots, remove the carb, remove the left side intake end,  remove
the nut on the center support mount, then slide the center section  out to the
left.



you forgot about the heat risers!!   We just did 3 last week and  didn't 
remove the engines in any of them. be sure to get the correct boot clamps  as hose 
clamps are too wide and cause the boots to split. replace the intake  gaskets 
while you are in there  later  mark  d
