Subject: Bus curb weights?

I was reading on wikipedia and it said:
"In 1968, the second generation of the Type 2 was introduced. It was built in Germany until 1979, with production shifting to Mexico in 1980. Brazilian VW plant produces the Kombi since the 50's until today. Models before 1971 are often called the T2a, while models after 1972 are called the T2b.
This second-generation Type 2 lost its distinctive split front windshield, and was slightly larger and considerably heavier than its predecessor."

So, my question is: where it mentions that the later version is heavier than its predecessor, does it mean the '68 to '71 bays that have the turn lights down low and the doghouse fans hroud, or does it mean that the splitties ('67 and down) are lighter than the bays? 

The vintage bus list didn't have anything on "curb weight" or "net weight" to compare it to the approx 2700 lbs that I found for the bays. 
Thanks,
