Don, I know how you feel.  I had a beautiful '72 Monte Carlo when  I was married.  My wife had me running in so many directions that  I wasn't able to take care of her (the car) the way I was used  to.  Blew a head gasket and she made me sell it.  Didn't  think it was worth fixing.  That's just one of the many things  that (insert word here) cost me.  Cheers...KR
