Subject: Re: [T2] pinched oil filler vent tube

Just as Jason described, this is called a "Road Draft Boot".  It covers the
bottom end of the tube and had a slit cut into the pointed bottom.  In
California, the CARB (Smog Guys) called it a PCV Valve.  When California was
requiring the annual smog test for Buses up to 71 and Bugs up to 74, it was
part of the visual check list - if it was missing, you didn't pass (even if
the sniff test was good).

VW Part # 311 115 541

It is not unusual to have a drop or two of oil from there, but not a
constant drip.  If excessive oil appears there, you may be a victim of
potential excessive blow-by.
