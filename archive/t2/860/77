Phil,
If your 1971 is stock and the UK version is like the US version there
are two vacuum lines going from the carb to the dizzy. One advances
(up to ~2 degrees) and one retard (up to ~15 degrees). On the front of
the carb is the vacuum retard port. It retards the advance by ~15
degrees at idle. If you unplug it at idle and plug the carb port with
your hand, the engine will get 10 degrees of advance before TDC
instead of 5 degrees after TDC and the engine will rev faster. If that
does not happen, the ports are not right.

I never had the privilege to witness a fully stock 1971 bus, but I
believe the vacuum port in the left intake manifold was used for the
"throttle positioner" device.

Dizzy vacuum hooked up to the manifold sounds like a bad idea
