Subject: Empi Shifter Question

Hi Folks,
        One of my projects this weekend was to replace the front shift rod bushing. This of course required removing the shifter, an Empi short throw shifter I installed about a year ago. After getting it all back together, I go for a short test drive and all is well, until I come to stop and  when shifting from first to second I am hitting reverse. After limping home in first gear (luckily not far) I find the reverse lock out mechanism has fallen out of the shifter. It's a little bar that is held in place by an "M" shaped spring-can't get it back together. I tied for about an hour today with no luck-anyone have a similar experience with one of these shifters? Luckily I never throw anything away, and I now have the old stock shifter back in place.
