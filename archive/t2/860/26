The running on upon shutoff is caused by hot bits of carbon deposit 
in the combustion chambers. This will occur at normal temps. Best 
verify your mixture first. Read the plugs. If the mix is good and the 
plugs show carbon, you have either worn valve guides and/or 
rings/cylinders. Try a one shot treatment of Techron to see if it improves.
