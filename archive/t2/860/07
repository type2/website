Subject: Re: [T2] Outside the Bus Table

Nifty Idea, but I gave up on that stock table years ago- too heavy and
bulky.  Check (email me for URL as it crashes on too many hits in a 
week) for my inside flipup
table on the door and by window- I modified the 3rd bed design to have
the 1/2" ply accomodate  screw in 3/8" pipes (flush pipe flange for
screw in receivers) instead of the wood legs and thus can use it for a
table ouside- a 3.5' x 6' table!  It stores above the roofbed; the legs
go in our pod (or can go under bedseat or above the closet).
Target sells neat plastic tables which are rectangles and which store 
easily on rear mat.  My daughter uses one in a 75 bus, snapped to go 
behind front seat walls or along side wall or go outside.  She was 
sewing on it at High Country last year.
