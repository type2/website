Subject: ignition wire replacement

Hi list,



I bought some 12 gauge wire per a list member's advice and was set to
replace the ignition wire. (The wire that runs from the fuse box to the
coil) I popped the fuse box out of its bracket and was expecting to just
find wires at the bottom of it. Instead on fuse 10 and it looks like on
11, and 12 there is a silver metal box that attaches to the bottom. I
didn't know what to do so I did other bus work. Do I take the metal box
off and attach a new wire or is there another way to hook into the fuse
box. I am very inexperienced with electrical work so I probably am
missing the obvious. The archives don't turn much up on this replacement
procedure. It just states to replace the wire. This is 1600dp '71 Westy.
I have included my previous post regarding this issue below my
signature.


Thanks for any and all help,



Max

=========================================

My ignition wire, the one that runs from the bottom of fuse 10 on the
fuse block to the coil shorted out. What is the proper color and gauge
of this wire? Any tips for easily replacing it? This is a '71 bus. The
Bentley (wiring diagram D) shows it as one wire so I imagine replacement
will be easier. I will be putting the inline fuse back on this wire when
I replace it.
