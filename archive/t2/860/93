   Quite a few years ago, an older (80+) friend of mine gave me a '69
Ghia...Pretty beat, lots of rust, etc... Neighbor down the street from
me saw in in my backyard and went nuts over it...I told him it was his,
but no returns... ;-(
   We hooked a chain to it and lugged it to his backyard.
   The next day his wife saw me and said that although she was not all
that happy to see it in "her" backyard she was happy that her husband
had finally found his dream car...He'd wanted one ever since he saw
Eddie Murphy drive one in "48 Hours"
   I didn't say a word... ;-)
