Subject: Outside the Bus Table

Hello all,
 
Coming to a campout near you...an outside the Bus table! See the links
for pics.
 
Basically, on thesamba, we were just trying to figure out a way to put a
table outside the bus, and have it be stable. 
I took some ideas from that thread and sketched out some ideas. I gave
the drawings and specs to an experienced welder (and Bus owner) and he
hooked it up for me!
 
Bracket - note the angle - this part goes into the jack point. There is
also a 'foot' piece for added stability.

This table is a 2nd (spare) table I picked up out of a junker, it will
be refinished to match the rest of my interior:
