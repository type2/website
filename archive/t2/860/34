Some Japanese pickups had a nifty device that extended a cable or chain
down from a tiny winch.  You hooked the chain/cable to the center hole of
the wheel and winched the thing up with the jack crank until it contacted
the bottom of the car.

That would work a treat for an under-bus tire stowage arangement.
