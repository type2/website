Ok it was of course an April fools joke, but not well thought out. I 
realized last night that the day was upon me and had to do something fast. I 
usually work on this thing a while. Since I wrote it on March 31, I could 
not send it until this morning, so I saved it the out box. Later I thought I 
might worry some folks so maybe not a great idea. Well my computer is set to 
send messages on startup so as soon as I started the program this morning 
the phone started ringing. As luck would have it , it was sent right before 
the digest went out, so everyone got it a once. I got calls from IL, CA, SC, 
CT, VA, TN, AZ, PA. Seven in all in rapid succession.

The responders mostly laughed, but I did offend and confuse some. I would 
like to thank all that called before they realized what day it was, do not 
know my sick sense of humor, and had genuine concern. I owe you one down the 
road.
