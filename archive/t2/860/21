Subject: Faint cricket like noise

I shut my 76 bus down today, and there was a faint cricket like noise coming
from the engine compartment for a few minutes after I shut it down.  It
stopped before I could figure out where it was coming from.  I have never
heard this noise before I put a single vacuum advance distributor on it.
Could that be it???  By the way it beats an 009 up a hill, or off the line
anyday.

I don't know if it is a sign that something on it is going to blow up, or that
I should be worried about it.  It is bone stock fuel injected.

Any ideas?

Eric
