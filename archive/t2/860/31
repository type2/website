Subject: Air cleaners & thermostats

1971 1600cc Type 1 engine.

Question 1: What's the thread on the rod that goes into the top of the 
thermostat. The one attached to the cooling flaps. I've got the thermostat 
but it has the remains of a rod in there so I need to re-drill & tap the 
hole.

Question 2: Can the top half of an oil bath air filer be dismantled to 
remove and replace the gauzy stuff in there ?

Question 3: The two vacuum ports on top of the air filter. Which one (front 
or back) plugs in the vacuum line running across the top of the engine bay ? 
I know I should remember but I don't :-( 50/50 chance of getting this right 
I suppose but since I'm e-mailing.

Thanks

Phil
