Subject: pinched oil filler vent tube

I'm helping a friend track down an oil leak on a stock 1600 engine. 
As I was lying underneath just having a look, I noticed that the oil 
filler vent tube is pinched closed at the bottom. Not like any I've 
ever seen.

I've never seen one that was not a straight open pipe, but this one 
is so perfectly crimped that it is hard for me to believe that it was 
done by an amateur.

Any guidance on this one?

Thanks, Jack
