Dr. Tim,
You don't know me but I know you...
I have a question about mixture with a type 1 1600 dual port. 34Pict-3
brosol.

At freeway speed (55-60mph). It is correct that the mixture is only
driven by the main and air correction jets ?

In other words, is it right that the idle mixture (screw) and idle jet
do not matter at freeway speeds ?
