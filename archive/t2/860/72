I'm sorry to hear about your loss :-( but posting links to eBay is against the list charter.

FYI.

--Do not ever refrence an E-Bay auctions or other auctions (whether yours
or someone elses) on the list. We filter heavily for this. If we want to 
know what is for sale on eBay we will go there and look.  We submitted 
this subject to the list for a vote and the majority of listmembers did 
NOT want to see E-Bay posts, so that's the way it is.
