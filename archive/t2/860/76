Phil,
After spending time on your blog and reading about hard to start 1971
bus that starts well without air filter.

When is the last time you changed the oil in the oil bath air cleaner ?
When is the last time you soaked the filtering element in solvent to clean it
?

If it is all gummed up, it won't let air into the engine.
