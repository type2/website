I wonder if the rim is a standard rim or something meant to work with the
foldable?  Are the markings on the rim the same as the other wheels on the
bus?  I'd be very leery of using it unless it is identical to the other
rims.

The second valve might have been for a vacuum pump to draw out air so the
tire would fold more compactly.  That's just speculation, mind you.

The donut spares I get a chuckle out of are the spares that come with Jeep
Wranglers.  They are full-size (they have to be with 4WD and limited
slip), but labeled "temporary use only".  Cheap Chrysler won't even
spring for a full-size spare tire on a supposedly off-road capable
vehicle.
