 Your problem is that the lifter has worn off on the
cam side and taken the cam out too, you are in for a
complete tear down and will have to replace the cam
and lifters. Phil

The cam may be damaged, but I believe all his problems is just in the lifter.
Otherwise he would also have a valve adjusting problem on the other side.
Each lobe works an opposing lifter.
He may have to split the cam to get the lifter out.....
