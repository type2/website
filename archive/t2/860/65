Subject: Re: [T2] Foldable Spare

Right on the nose!!! Before we sold our "rusty" toyota truck i removed the
spare tire winch and that is what i would be planning on using. However -
the problem is not with the winch it is with the space for the spare rim...I
will look into some of the options for wheels that was mentioned earlier...
