Subject: John Brown's Buses campground Info

Greetings Folks,
         I know everyone is busy getting ready for Everybus, and it's hard to think about an event right now that is not until October, but if you want to attend this years JBB, it would be wise to send a deposit now, since it will coincide with "Railroad Days" in Brunswick, MD. The campground is The Brunswick Family Campground, and the rate per site w/electric & water is $26.00/night, but this campground will allow us to share sites, so buddy up and your rate will only be $13.00/night. So send in your deposit early, and PLEASE include a note that you are with John Brown's Buses, "the VW bus folks", or whatever so that the caretaker will put you in the right spot, as she is reserving one whole loop of the campground for us. The address is: The Brunswick Family Campground, 1 West Potomac Street, Brunswick Maryland 21716. Again, please note that you are with the VW Bus group. Any questions, please pmail me.    Thanks,   Jeff

PS- Would someone please post this to the Vanagon list?    Thanks!
