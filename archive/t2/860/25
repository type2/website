Subject: oil temp

Hi guys and gals.  I'm considering tapping out my oil drain plug  and putting the temp sender from BD in it.  Has anyone had trouble  with them leaking?  I haven't found anybody to do it so I'll  probably have to try it myself.  I'll need a 14mm drill bit and a  14 x 1.5 tap.  A machinist told me to dip the bit in grease, turn  it a couple of revolutions and wipe the grease off.  It picks up  the shavings.  Repeat as necessary and then do the tap the same  way.  One revolution at a time.  
  
  I drove it up Lookout Mountain yesterday afternoon to a gig.   Ambient temp was in the eighties.  About 5 miles of steep  climb.  I know I got the engine hot because it will diesel a  couple of turns when I turn it off.  When I got to the top and  shut it off, I opened the hatch.  I was amazed that it was quite  cool in the engine compartment.  Didn't feel a lot of heat coming  off of the engine, either.  The bus runs great.  Is this a  sign that I'm OK temperature-wise?  I would really like to have  that sender in but don't want oil leaks.  Please advise....KR
