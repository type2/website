George,

One adjusts the valves when both are away from the lobe. i.e. the
lifter touches the "round" part. Not when any lobe touches the lifter.

Did you measure #2 pushrods against other ones ? Is the pushrod fit in
the rocker ?

How many nuts did you torque when you "torqued the head" ? Torquing
heads properly need all 8, in sequence. That means engine drop.
