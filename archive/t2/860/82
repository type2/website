Subject: Auto Transmission Dilemma

Hello Listers, it's been a long time and I thank my good mechanical 
luck for that.

I have an 80 Vanagon Westfalia that is gutted out and used as a work 
van. It has that goofy 090 auto transmission. I have had a good time with 
this $700 van. 

I hauled an extremely heavy load of lumber last month and I felt the 
transmission slip a little while I was driving. This little slip turned 
into a pretty annoying high rev between gears. Starting out was slow, 
but once the gear caught everything was fine.

I sold the van last week to a good friend in need. The van didn't like 
that and decided it would not go backwards anymore. The friend didn't 
like that and I refunded his down payment. 

Now, the van shifts perfectly between 1,2 and 3. However, it goes 
forward in neutral and reverse. In park it idles fine, but jumps forward 
when you rev it up. 

I took her to a transmission guy last week and he said that is needs 
new clutch plates because a leakage caused the plates to bind.

I know nothing about this tranny. I don't know if those plates are in 
the gearbox or the final drive. I also don't know if a mortal human can 
make this repair or if I must call upon the VW gods whom I most likely 
can't afford.

Thanks in advance,

Herb.
