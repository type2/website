Karl - You are a star !

I do have a Ghia filter. The number checks out as 37 028 58 261 on the top
part. Nothing on the bottom. I've posted a pic in my blog:

I'm sure I can locate a new correct filter. Question is, what about the
vacum line coming from the manifold ? The dizy is plugged into the vacum
port from the carb at present. Should this be blocked off and the dizzy run
from the manifold ? What is the difference between the sources of vacuum ?

And if I plant the filter in the garden will a grow a Ghia ?

Thanks

Phil

If you have two vacuum ports on top of your "71 bus" air cleaner....... you
have a Ghia air cleaner!!

The bus air cleaner does not have vacuum ports.

Look at the part number on the air inlet:
71 Bus:
Knecht = 662/6 and on the top LB 662/1-504M1
Mann = 211 129 607 C and on the top 37 028 58 211

Late Ghia:
Knecht = 211 129 607 F
Mann = on top 37 028 58 261
