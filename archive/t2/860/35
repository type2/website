Ive had American cars that do the same. Most vans and SUVs are like

Some Japanese pickups had a nifty device that extended a cable or chain
down from a tiny winch.  You hooked the chain/cable to the center hole
of the wheel and winched the thing up with the jack crank until it
contacted the bottom of the car.
