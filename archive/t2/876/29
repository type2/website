Question for the list: Will any baywindow year 68-79 passenger glass
(right front) work with my 71 or only specific years?

Thanks for the support. I've been calling everywhere to try and find
some used glass. I'm confident I could figure out how to install it.
Unfortunately we don't have too many used VW shops here in upstate New
York. Only one with buses in the greater Albany, NY area and of course
he's closed on Monday.

Must be nice out in SF and elsewhere where you can find parts when and
where you need them. Where is the best place in the US to live and be
a bus owner? Perhaps that's a Friday topic...

I will say one nice thing about being a bus owner and living in NY -
parts from the bus depot get here FAST.
