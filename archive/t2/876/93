Hi Bill -

There are two short hoses in the compartment for the breather utilized on
68-71 Type 2s:

N 020 357 1  7mm ID x 82.5mm long (3.25") - Hose connects from Fuel Tank to
Metal Breather Tube. (You could substitute 1/4" ID Fuel Hose for this).

N 020 359 1  9mm ID x 127mm long (5") - Hose connects from 1 section of
breather tube to another section. (You could substitute 5/16" ID Fuel Hose
for this).

And that's it.

The tall vent tubing setup is in 72-later Type 2s
