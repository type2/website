In 1995 I bought an original paint '65 21-window for $1200 from a place in
western VA (the name Cash's rings a bell)....I drove it home to Lynchburg...

It had the plates 65 DLUX

I put tires and brakes on it and drove it for about two years....I then
traded it straight up for a '78 Auto Camper from a guy in Va Beach...

It has since disappeared....I even tried to find it....
