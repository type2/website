Subject: 77 Westy Inner seatbelt anchoring area nla??

To my dismay yesterday, I discovered that my driver side seatbelt anchor had rusted through on my Westy. This is on the door side, on top of the wheel well. The rest of the panel is solid, just where dirt collected I guess over the years around the welded nut/reinforced piece you bolt your seatbelt to. I cannot find this part anywhere, so I'm going to pop rivet and glue (Using body panel adhesive)a much larger piece of steel plate from the underneath side. What I really want though is that piece so I can have it welded in properly to do a nice job. Even though it's covered by the rubber mat, I still know it's there. :-)
Has anyone seen this piece for sale anywhere, or doesn anyone have a dead bus donor piece they would cut out for me? I can send pics of what size I need etc.

Would appreciate any feedback on this.
Thanks,
Courtney
