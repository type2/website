Subject: Burning oil, valve guides or oil control rings ?

Engine is burning oil in over-run conditions. That is a good blue
cloud when coasting down a hill with my foot off the throttle. When i
give is gas again, the smoke culminates and then goes away. I cannot
see smoke as long as I have my foot on it. Also at idle oil fumes come
out of the oil filler under the engine. It does not burn significant
amounts of oil.

How do I tell if I have bad valve guides or bad oil control rings ?

the P&C is new set. Da machinist had looked at the heads and redid two
valve guides. He said the rest was fine.

I did the recommended procedures for seating rings plenty times
1350 miles on rebuild

Thanks - Arnaud
