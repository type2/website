46mm, it's called a castellated nut.

3/4" Drive bar w/ correct socket (borrow from vwflaps?) is prefered method to
lame-o cheapy hammer tool sold by vw-mag suppliers.

I think 1-13/16" is closest American, check archives.

I prefer BFH brand.  Shouldn't need a puller, penetrant and hammer blows
should do it.
