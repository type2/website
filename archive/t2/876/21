Arnaud asked:


 List,
Wouldn't a mechanical+vacuum advance dizzy be a superior choice ? Why
stick to vacuum only dizzy ?
**maybe a stupid question, but it cannot be beaten to death since it
does not include 009 or load range**

I believe you are replying to Joe Bartoli's post?

"Here's my situation:

I've been driving my '69 Westy for a few weeks, and I've noticed that it just doesn't seem as
"powerful" as it should.  I hear others talk about being able to hit 65 MPH in 4th, but I can't
seem to get much past 3400 RPM (around 55 MPH) no matter what (even full throttle, stock 1600sp).

I was checking on a few things this afternoon to see if anything obvious stood out.  The dwell was
OK (51 degrees (-at-) 900 RPM), so I went to check the timing.  I pulled and plugged the vacuum line
and got out the timing gun.  At 900 RPM, the TDC marker was showing up about 1/2" to the right of
the crankcase parting line, so I reset it to the parting line.  I re-attached the vacuum line to
the carb (Brosol H30/31, using the fitting near the base at a 60 degree angle) and rev'd the
engine to check the advance.  Very little to nothing.  The TDC marker moved slightly to the left,
maybe 5 degrees or so.  I plumbed my MityVac into the vacuum canister and gave it a few pumps.
The distributor plate would move, but would spring right back (ie, not hold a vacuum).

I'm thinking this is my issue:  not enough spark advance.  Some searching in the archives leads me
to believe that's what I have, but I'd like some second opinions.

My distributor is 113-905-205T, which according to the list at oldvolkshome.com, is correct.  The
info for this distributor says vacuum can, Bosch p/n 07 024, is what I need.  A Google search
found this place, http://www.sherco-auto.com/bosch1, which has the part for $40 minus 25%.  Has
anyone dealt with these guys?  Would a local FLAPS be able to order parts by the Bosch number?"

If yes, he has a 69 bus. 68 to 70 buses were single port engines with a 30 pic whatever carb. This carbs
vacuum advance signal is mapped at a max of a little over 3" of vacuum. The large diameter of the vacuum unit
on the vacuum-only advance distributor is designed to give Vacuum (Advance Only): 17-19deg (-at-) 1.3 In. Hg,
32-35deg (-at-) 3.2 In. Hg.

The SVDA dist is designed for a 34 pict whatever carb. The amount of vacuum needed for the vacuum unit is
tremendous.

Double the degrees above for crankshaft figure.

On the large vacuum unit, 3.2" gives 32-35 degrees.
On the small vacuum unit, 3.5" gives 2!! degrees.
