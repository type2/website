Sorry to hear that Jules.

It happened to me during day time two days ago,  the guy try to steel my 
$100 cd player , he massacred the dash board and the cd player to 
extract it. he did not get it !!! Well  I wish he was a pro , take my CD 
player and did a clean job because its very ugly and damaged now. 
amazingly enough  , the CD player which look like ... a "camel" CD 
player is still working.

I had a used passenger windows for $10 from Tassi inc 
http://www.tassiinc.com (people from the bay area (CA) , again , go to 
this place , its like a giant junkyard for our bus), I did not install 
it yet , but it looks a little bit tricky.
