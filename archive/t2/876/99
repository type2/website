I wish I'd held on to the little green '83 diesel VW Rabbit that I had
years back.   If anything, for the motor and coveted transmission.  The
PO drove it back and forth from Florida to Alaska about 3x a year.
Little thing would cruise right along all day at 75mph.  

Fuel consumption was the best point.  It'd *easily* do ~50mpg on the
highway, and still about 40-45mpg in the city.  The body and suspension
were rotting away (road salt), but I'd give my left (whatever body part)
to have that engine and transmission.  

But, with all that said, the one that *didn't* get away is my '77 bay.
VW Busses grow on ya.  Sorta like a fungus, but a good one.
