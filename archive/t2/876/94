Subject: Turn Signal & Hazard Problems

Working on the new bus ("Speedy" the 78 Riviera) tonight trying to get
the turn signals to work.  I haven't had a Volkswagen for four years so
I'd like to talk through my process.

Symptoms:

Key on, Signal Switch on (Right or Left)
Indicator in dash lights up solid
No "clicky-clicky" sound from the relay
Turn signals don't light at all

also

Key on, Hazard Switch on
Indicator in dash lights up solid
No "clicky-clicky" sound from the relay
Turn signals don't light at all

So, I rooted around under that dash to make sure everything was
connected and it seemed to be.  I took out the relay wondering if there
was a way I could test it or the rest of the system.

Now I should be able to short the wires leading to the relay and light
up all for indicators on the bus, no?  If they don't light up - then
that means there's some other problem down the line, right?

I also should be able to send 12V through the relay and it'll start
"relaying" switching on and off like it's supposed to, right?

The other place I was going to look was the hazard switch, because
looking at the wiring diagram, I can see that all the wiring seems to go
through there as well.

Does anyone have any suggestions for me or problems with my methodology.

Thanks in advance!
