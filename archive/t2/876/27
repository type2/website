Hey, Chai.  Mine tended to diesel and even backfire when it got  hot.  I found out that the throttle wasn't closing all the way at  idle.  (Thanks again, Mark!)  What I did was turn the mixture  screw 1/4 turn CCW to idle it up.  Then the idle screw 1/4 turn  CCW to idle it back down.  I did that a few times and it got  progressively better until it completely stopped.  Problem was  that I was running too lean and had to have the throttle open too much  to maintain idle.  That allowed fuel to flow for a second or so  after shut-off.  Give it a try.
  
  As far as overheating, the finger on the dipstick test is great.   The main thing that I found was sealing the engine compartment.   If that is all done, you may have a problem with your oil cooler.   Partially clogged?  I don't know much about that as mine is fine  now.  I put a new engine seal in and did some patchwork with  aluminum foil and metal-ducting tape.  You know you can't trust  any guage made by VDO.  Good luck and keep us posted.  
  
  Cheers...KR

  or is the loss of power be contributed to the running hot....?
  just IMO nothing i know for sure but seems that when bus runs hot that  there is the loss of power then, but i cant say for sure if it is just  when its hot or all the time... but i do notice more when hot....?
   
  thanks for any info or anything that can help me better determine whats  wrong here with both voltage and very much so the heat... ..wasnt but  mid 80's today and on a very short drive she stuttered when cut off  cause she was hot as she always does only when hot ...and the oil temp  gauge shot way up little over 220 in no time at all... 5= minutes later  i mean and very abnormal for my temp gauge and bus...never gets that  high....
   
  also the engine has only 11,000 miles on it as of tonight....
