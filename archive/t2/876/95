Subject: Re: [T2] Turn Signal & Hazard Problems

Look at the back side of the hazard switch to see it the bakalite panel
has popped out away from the metal box portion of the switch.

This will break contact not only for the hazard light's , but the turn
signals as well.

You'll have nothing happening in either circuit.
