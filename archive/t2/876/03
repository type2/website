Verify good drainage such as no evidence of standing water in or 
about the units.
Take a look at the width between buildings. If someone brings in and 
parks a big
moving van, will there be enough room for you to get by??? Many will 
have a single
light fixture, no outlet to plug in a drill or vacuum or drop light 
or such. It's
a storage space, not a work shop.

Most have restricted access (coded gates) and limited hours, like 7am to 9pm.
