Subject: signal blinker relay

...is on the fritz, but intermittently. It will suddenly start a very rapid flashing. If I smack the relay (in the fuse baox), it usually straightens up and flies right for a while, but always does this again.
   
  Any ideas? I have looked (in vain) for a repl;acement. My Westy is a 1974.
   
  Any help appreciated, thanks!
