It is  not a big show, but we would love to
have some more busses show up. For  more info, check this link.




Hey Corbett     What you guys should do is have this  show on another weekend 
instead of the same weekend as  Naturalbus.    I went to the first flying 
show and it was a cool  place and really liked the airplanes, but somewhere the 
time was changed and now  it is competeing against the fastest growing campout 
on the east. When deceiding  on a time check the time of other shows by going 
to _www.fullmoonbusclub.com_ (http://www.fullmoonbusclub.com/) , 
_www.thesamba.com_ (http://www.thesamba.com/) , _www.sevwa.com_ (http://www.sevwa.com/) ,  
_www.kampenfoolz.com_ (http://www.kampenfoolz.com/)  .   there  will be times 
when campouts and shows will overlap, Moonie rule of thumb is for  them to be 
300 miles apart , When two shows are this close together in distance  it is 
best to have two weeks between them at least. I would like to come to this  show 
again but there is noway it can compare with Naturalbus.  Later and  have fun
