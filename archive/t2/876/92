I would start by flushing the system, starting at the
nearest bleeded, the left front... Bleed until totally
clear fluid comes out, got to right front, left
rear...
Be sure to keep replenishing.

If you find one that seems to have resistance, may be
a deteriorated hose breaking down inside creating a
flap acting like a check valve.

Vacuum line to brake booster has a check valve
(unrelated to above flap) In later models it's in
engine compartment (not sure '73)

I assume '73's had proportioning valves. On later
models it is about center bus, tucked inside left
frame rail. Follow lines from master cylinder and
you'll find it. They gum up inside. Simple to open and
clean - whatever you use to clean it make sure it's
totally evaporated before reassembling. Watch it
carefully when opening up to see how to reassemble!
Make new gasket... use the thinnest gasket material
your FLAPS sells.

Adjust rear brakes. Two adjusters on each wheel. Pull
the drum off first and clean up the adjusters, add
anti-seize compound to threads (NOT too much - don't
want it on the shoes!) and check which way is which,
make a diagram on a piece of paper to refer to when
you're lying underneath on the backside of the backing
plate! Hope this helps. -BaH
