Subject: Brake Booster

Question on a 73 Bus that the brakes seem very marginal on(doesn't want to 
stop very quickly).  Bus has been sitting for a couple of years.  With front 
wheels in the air I could verify that the brake calipers do actuate.  Any tips on 
systematically eliminating hydraulics, vacuum leaks, booster, etc?

Thanks

Ray
