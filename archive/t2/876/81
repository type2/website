Subject: Re: [T2] Need source for charcoal filter hoses

The correct hose to use is 12mm ID Breather Hose, fuel and oil resistant.
VW Part Number N 020 374 1, many vendors on the list carry it.  In a quick
fix, 1/2" PCV Hose is acceptable to use as it's oil and fuel resistant and
can be found at any FLAPS.
