The nut is 46mm, but you don't have to remove it to take your drum off.
It is a composite drum, so the hub stays put.

It might be a bit tough to get the drum off, but apply penetrating oil and
wiggle it back and forth and it will eventually come off.

Put a thin film of anti-sieze on the mating surfaces when you put it back
on to make the job easier next time.
