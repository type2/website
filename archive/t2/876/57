Flasher Relay is pretty easy to come by.  VW 111 953 227 D (Superseded to
newer # is 191 953 227 A).

If the Hazard Switch is bad like Dave Parisi mentioned, they are readily
available too (VWG/Airhead Parts makes a beauty of a repro of this formerly
hard-to-find switch [the correct one too - not a make-do bug one]).  VW 211
953 235 A
