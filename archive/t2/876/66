We would have had it the following weekend, but for some reason they changed
it. I will have to mention that to them for next year to try to plan it
better. I am sure that they do not even factor in Bus events since this is an
all VW event and we don't get many busses. I was hoping for more busses, but
finding out that Natural Bus is the same weekend kills that thought.

Heck, I would rather go to Natural Bus myself, but I have to support my local
club :)

For anyone not going to Natural Bus, please come out and show your VW!! Air
cooled and Water cooled.
