Subject: Re: [T2] Need source for charcoal filter hoses

Thanks Jim,

I'm also going to have the fuel tank compartment open and want to 
replace the hoses in there. I don't have the tall vent tubing in the 
side air intakes. As I recall, there is just some plumbing inside the 
fuel tank compartment that makes its way out to the canister. Do you 
know what the size or part number is for the hoses inside the fuel tank 
compartment?
