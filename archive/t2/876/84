Jest fer fun...What was the one vehicle (VW or other-
wise) that any of the list members wish they had 
held onto...?-(

A '67 splittie deluxe with a gas heater. Purchased in 1980 for $500.00,
sold in '82 for $500.00. I thought I made a smokin' deal cause I got back
what I paid for it! Who would've guessed?!   Jeff
