Right there are two places where hot engine heat can get
sucked back into the cooling fan.

I assume the holes for the heater boxes are the ones
in the engine compartment. Yes, plug those if you
don't have a fan (w/flaps) and a hose leading from the
holes to the fan.

I cut an aluminun soft drink can in half and crammed it on
there temporarily.
