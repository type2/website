Can't help with the paint, but buy the books.  Green Bentley is the one you
want.  Also check out www.ratwell.com for info.

After selling my 70 Westy named Armanda when I moved from Salt Lake to
Chicago 4 years ago, I have finally bought a new bus.  It's a 78 Riviera
that I intend to name "Speedy Gonzales."
