Subject: rear tent

Went camping again this past weekend in Kings Canyon Natl. park.  Westy did great . . .gettin' a little chilly up in the Mountains.  Looking to potentially invest in a rear hatch dome tent (that attaches sort of like the ones on the side).  We have a really nice and expensive awning, that I don't want to part with + I really like it.  We're thinking it would be useful also to be able to put our bikes and crap in the tent (concealed) when we want to drive to some other trail or site for the day or 1/2 day.  

 I can see it being non-practical unless you have a flat camp spot.  I'm using blocks or rocks to level the westy about 30% of the time. 

Anyone have camping experience with the rear hatch style tent?  Say the 10x10 version?  What are your thoughts?  Any thoughts or recos on brand to go with?
