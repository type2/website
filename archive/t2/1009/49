A remove and replace move would be the smartest to make.
Locate an engine of known quality--in good shape , park it next to the
dying Bus, & swap them out one, two, three.

Be one hell of a lot faster, and save a bunch of time and monetary
expenditure's in removing the old one, rebuiding the worn out engine
and then replacing it.

With a miniscule mechaical apptitude, low dollars in the pocket, and
some sort of time limit witht he parking situation, this is the path
that I would take for the shortest road to having the Bus operational,
and driving it again.
