Subject: Re: [T2] How many fuel filters?/proper hose

Hi Richard- think I told you and the list about my gas tank blockage 
woes. Not being able to locate proper hose (not even the MB dealer could 
supply it) I used FI rated 5/16" hose (0.9mm larger) between tank and 
fuel filter. It clamped down fine on tank outlet stubs? I hate braiding 
as it hides if rubber is cracking. Also I wonder why the stock pump has 
that large inlet and is not transparent- the replacement pump (Ford F250 
truck Bosch I had to use) works fine but requires standard size inlet so 
I got a clear filter. Easy to tell if it's rust silted or likely has 
some large piece blocking the inlet pipe at the top.

  Always use metric sized hose because the fittings are metric.
Not only is USA hose the wrong size the rubber compounds are poor and 
the rubber goes hard prematurely.
