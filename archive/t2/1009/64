All mine have been the same length AFAIK. That said, however, there is
enough tolerance in the design that a slightly shorter one *might*
work.

Maybe order one from BustedBus and while waiting for it to arrive, go
ahead and install the shorter one. Then you'll be ready with a
replacement in case the shorty starts to leak or something.
