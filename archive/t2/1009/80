Subject: RE: [T2] 6-rib transmission swap

OK...  I know I am new at this and once I figure it out I will be going duhhh,
but (for now) I am at a loss.

Referring to the illustrations provided by one of my kind helpers thus far...

I am still having problems removing the "Drive shaft rear" (#34).  I have
removed the circlip (#33) and pulled and turned to now avail.  When I turn all
that happens is all the gears turn.  When I pull, things don't move forward,
just 'wiggle'.

As my grandfather use to say, I must not be holding my mouth right.  Can
anyone help?  Which elbow has to go in which ear while which foot goes behind
my head?

Yours truly the one still trying to swap the 1972 3-rib trans with the 1976
6-rib,

Thanks,

Michael Martin
