I had a similar experience as Dan. I rebuilt a bug engine when I was 16 and
drove it all through high school. I bought it from a guy for $110. He had
taken the engine out and it was in pieces in milk crates. I rebuilt it in my
basement, and when I was finished, couldn't get it out. Had to take a bunch
of things off to fit up the stairs. I was surprised when it started, and it
was a lot of fun, and a great car. I have pulled my engine a couple of times
to fix various things on my bus, but when I had to do a complete rebuild I
got one from Boston Bob. It's been a great engine. I don't doubt I could
rebuild it, but they are a lot more complex than the old type 1s, and I
certainly don't have the time.
