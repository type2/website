Subject: Re: How many fuel filters?

I noticed the same thing last saturday while my bus was on the lift. There was
a fuel filter on the line that comes out of the tank, right near the starter,
so close in fact, that the line almost (but not quite) touched the back end of
the starter. I'm sorry I didnt get a picture of it. The filter looked pretty
good, a little amber, but no gunk, no crazing. I'm going to change it out,
along with new lines before it gets too cold....if it ever gets cold this
winter.
