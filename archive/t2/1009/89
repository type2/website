 Curiousity (only) --
When did VW stop putting redlines on the speedometer?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't remember if my split bus speedo's have max shift points on them....

Do any bay window speedo's have them?

I have seen them on some Vanagon speedometers.

Bay window Fuel Injection ECU's have the max engine RPM cut-out built in to
them. So, theoretically, you cannot go past the redline accelerating but you
can definitely over-rev going down a hill in too low a gear.
