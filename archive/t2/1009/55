<<You have to be careful of biodiesel it will eat certain types of
rubber and plastic! Could be "not good" on a heater>>

Don't leave the 2% low sulfer in your heater fuel tank too long either--

It absorb's -atrracts moisture big time.
You'll have jello in your fuel tank in short order.

The heater line's & burner nozzle will be garbage in short order.

Burn it all or dump what you didn't use somewhere.

At work there is 2 in ground diesel tanks--
Both are a couple years old only and monitered by the ILL. & local fire
marshall's.

The taxed fuel tank is only 3500 gallons, and it's OK.
The non-taxable tank holds 10.000 gallons and it has 2" of water in it
and the fuel is only 2 months old.

The fuel oil supplier sez--too bad.

A long article in one of the latest truck/ heavy equipment management
magazine's is saying that the oil companies are having big problems with
the bio separating in the tanks, won't take any winter fuel anti gelling
additives, and is attracting H2O while it sit's waiting to be used.
Besides the fact that any sulfer lubrication factor's are not there and
short living oil burner engines.

The EPA really screwed this deal up---
They acted too fast prior to having the oil companies test & prove the
end results of the product.

Anyway, f your thinking about using low sulfer bio--don't leave it in
the tank too long for your heater--or the Van if your running an oil
burner.
