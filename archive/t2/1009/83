The Australian company Penrite manufactures oils for older as well as
modern vehicles. Their take on zinc and phosphorous in oil is described
in the following article:

Interestingly though if you check the product information for the
recommended oil for bay windows (HPR 30) it has over 10% zinc in Oz but
not in the UK or USA!
