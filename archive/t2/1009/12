Subject: rear tent

I have had a Eureka "butt tent" since about 1986.  I bought it at L.L. 
Bean when we made a trip in Lurch up the east coast.  I have been very 
happy with it, but now it's about to give up the ghost.

I'm in the market for a new one, but cannot seem to find one.  Where 
can they be had?
