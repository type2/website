It can be mounted anywhere you can saw a 4.5" hole for the mounting 
plate and exhaust and combustion intake.  I have two batteries in my 
engine compartment, so that wasn't an option.

After playing with it for a day I'm glad I can't point the air flow 
directly at me.  It's way too hot.  The hot air tube is 2.5", so you 
could fit it in the main hot air tube under the bus easily.  It's really 
small and could go just about anywhere.  If I ever put one in Bessie my 
hardtop westfakia I'm going to install it all under the jumpseat.
