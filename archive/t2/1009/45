Janyce,

The first car I ever owned was a '64 Beetle.  My first 
trip involved almost making it home before throwing
a rod and seizing that engine.  Using nothing but the
Idiot Book and hand tools I bought at Sears, I did rebuild
it and it did run and it was still running when I sold
it for exactly what I paid for it four years later.
I even had parts left over after the rebuild that it
seemed to run well without.  This all probably qualifies
as a miracle, including that it was rebuilt over the
course of two months while parked on the street.

On the other hand, my current Bus engine is a Boston Bob
rebuild approaching the 75,000 mile mark (on the rebuild).
