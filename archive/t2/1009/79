 I'm surprised none of the major oil companies have marketed an oil  
 specifically for "classic cars without catalytic converters". Perhaps  
 they are afraid to show how their current oils do or don't cause  
 failures. :-)

If they did, they would probably have to put a big label on them:
"Legal for off road use only." in California.
