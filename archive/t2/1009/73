Subject: Re: [T2] How many fuel filters?

The one in the tank is just a wire mesh sock. Not a true filter. Its
sole purpose is to keep chunks crap from clogging the outlet. Things
like legos, chunks of filler neck, etc.

Nice thing about the carbed busses is that the outlet can be removed,
allowing access to the sock. Good, since most of the socks are damaged
or missing. New ones are available from the usual suspects.
