When it comes to fuel hose, Airhead Parts/VWG carries only Cohline from
Germany and all are marked on the hose itself with the Cohline number and
size.

Airhead has only just added these quality hoses in the past year and a
separate section on the website hasn't been uploaded yet (it will be this
week with a re-vamping going on right now).  For now, just go the Airhead
Parts website and type "n20" (without the quote marks) in the Search Box and
all available fuel and vapor hoses will come up on the screen and you can
further select from there.

CRP (Continental Rubber Products) has been an excellent quality brand of
hose, but not all CRP is coming out of Europe these days, some is coming out
of Mexico and/or Brazil.  The German CRP is marked as such on the hose.  CRP
hoses from elsewhere is not marked and looks rather cheep to begin with and
they are not usually stamped with the country of origin.

Another indicator is that some outfits are selling (what I suspect is
Far-East origin) aftermarket-made cloth braided hoses for ultra-cheep, so
this is an indicator of a suspect hose.  If the price per foot or meter is
too good to be true, you can bet it is.

I agree with Richard regarding American-made hoses in SAE sizes that won't
fit metric fittings properly.  However, I know from first-hand knowledge and
useage on my Vanagons the availability of excellent quality 7x13mm ID
Reinforced Fuel Injection rated hoses from brands such as Dorman, Gates or
Goodyear.  The size(s) and hose ratings are printed on the hoses, so make it
a point to ask your FLAPS for these brands if you can't locally find Cohline
or CRP.
