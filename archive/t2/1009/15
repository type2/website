Subject: the search for heat ends now  ..  Espar Airtronic D2

I wanted good, reliable 4 season camping kind of heat.  I didn't want 
something 20 or 30 or 40 years old.  The project is well photo 
documented, so I'll be brief in my descriptions here.  It was expensive, 
but not that much more than those shiny BN4s the heater guy sells on 
that one site.

My westy sink was non-functional, and the plumbing was all cracked.  In 
the bottom of the sink cabinet were the reaming holes from the PO's 
Southwind.  Out with the old and in with the new.  The project took 2 or 
3 days to complete.  The end result is HEAT.  Lots and lots and lots and 
lots and lots of heat.

I added a shelf between the tank and the heater, and I gained a bunch of 
space by removing the sink tank.  In the end I have lots more storage.

All in all I couldn't be happier.
