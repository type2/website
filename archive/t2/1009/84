Subject: Re: [T2] engine oil additive problems coming? ?

I wonder why not too many folks use Air Cooled Oil specifically?

Like Golden Spectro for instance.

99% of air cooled Bus people use oil indigenous to water cooled engines.

I'll bet that air cooled bike oils are not within the EPA's grasp, and
work a bunch better for viscosity longevity than the standard car/truck
oils.

DA Speed Sport, Torco, are some air cooled oils to name a couple more.

If I was worried about the current oil's lubrication efficiency , I'd be
buying oil at a bike shop.

Just thinking.
