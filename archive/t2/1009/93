They do! Castrol. I just found a link yesterday for a classic car 20W-50
Syntec. I have yet to find it in stores, but it is formulated for solid
lifters, tappets and different flow characteristics shared by classic cars,
and our VWs. It specifically has a high-zinc formula.

Karl's premonition was right about the emissions disclaimer, it says it
doesn't meet pre '83 cat requirements, but that doesn't apply to any of us.
Don't know about the California sale bit.

 If they did, they would probably have to put a big label on them:
"Legal for off road use only." in California.

All people see is 20-50!  They can't read fine-print no matter how big it
is.

I bet you a dollar to a donut, when that stuff hits the shelf at any Smucks,
Pep Boys, Auto Zone, Wal-Mart etc. it will get poured into ANY car in the
parking lot!
