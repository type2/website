<<Because it is dead unused space that could be put to great use - and
it could blow hot air right at your feet.>>

As Dan mentioned, and as I well know this heating unit if it was blowing
forward would create havoc on your lower extremities.

You'd be at the local burn unit in a short period of time seeking aid
for your feet, ankle's & lower leg's.

If it could be adapeted to fit into the heater tube somehow--this would
be the ultimate ticket, you could utilize the stock heater output vents
/ deffroster's.

I bet this would work out real neat.

Much better than dry roasting your tootsie's anyway--
