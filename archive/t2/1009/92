Jon asked:


 Last night in an attempt to get my walkthrough heat working, I broke the
heater cable at the dash side.


 What is the part number and is it still available?

 I might be able to rig something up, but the funky looped back wire at the
end is going to be tricky.

 Specifics: This is the cable on my '78 Westy that opens/closes the flap
that redirects hot air to the rear passengers via the vents on the
walkthrough. It is controlled by the left dash lever.

It is part number 221711605F and is 2515mm long. It fits from 2x6 2000 001
and up. It is still available from VW. This dealer has it in stock:
