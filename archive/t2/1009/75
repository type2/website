It would be interesting if someone has a parts manual for the modern
Expar heaters to see what the parts differences are between the Diesel and
Gasoline models.  I'll bet that it is simply a matter of different sized
orifices.

Here is a manual, but it does not mention gasoline models since it is
meant for the US/Canada market:

It is also interesting to note that the manual specifically prohibits use
with biodiesel in concentrations above 5% and has cautions against use
above 1500m altitude.  1500m is about 5000 feet, so some folks who live or
camp in the mountains might want to take a look at this.
