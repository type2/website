hello Janyce    I personally think you might be better off  getting a reman  
motor from somebody like AVP or seattle connecting rod, or  Boston Bob instead 
of trying to rebuild your old one.Stay away from GEX    You could always keep 
your old one and rebuild it for a spare or just to get the  experience of 
doing this job in your spare time . It isn't really a job for  someone with 
minimum auto skills, heck I have seen some that claimed they knew  what they were 
doing screw these things up. In things like this there is no  subsitute for 
experience and knowledge, plus it helps to have the right  tools/  later and good 
luck  mark dearing   Salem import  service  salem va
