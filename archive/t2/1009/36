Marcus et al,
Here is a link to the manual for the Espar Airtronic D2 (Diesel) heater;
http://www.espar.com/documents/airtronic.pdf
The dimensions are on page 6
One bad thing about this heater;
***AIRTRONIC D2 is not certified for use with bio-diesel.
Admixtures of bio-diesel up to a magnitude of approx. 5%, as
in some countries, are allowed.***
Well, not really BAD per se, but unfortunate.
It would be great if someone made a unit this small that was propane fired.

 Dan,
 
 What are the dimensions of that Espar heater? It looks pretty small -  
 I wonder whether it could be mounted in the dead space behind the  
 master cylinder or the corresponding space on the passenger side.
