Subject: Re: [T2] the search for heat ends now  ..  Espar Airtronic D2

Just because it is not certified doesn't mean it will not work.  It just 
means that it's not certified, which probably means that the 
manufacturer did not want to jump through all of the expensive hoops for 
a fuel that very few people would be using anyway (might not be true, 
but I bet that's what they think).  As heaters are much simpler devices 
than engines, I am confident that just about any diesel heater would 
work just fine on biodiesel.
