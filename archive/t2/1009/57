How do I get this $%^$$^^$## input shaft out?

I've got both trannies out and bellhousings off but can get the rear input
rods off.
I've checked-out my Muir and Service manuals and they don't give much info on
the input shaft just how to tear the whole thing apart.

If anyone could help that would be great.

Thanks,

>>Use the old input shaft. Combined with the old bell housing, the end will
sit properly in the gland nut.
