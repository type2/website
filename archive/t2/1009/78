No, it is many types of engines. I don't think engine in Coleen's car
counts, because it is overhead cam. It uses a "bucket and shim" style of
lifter, and the cam is not riding on the lifter at all, it rides on the
shim.

Most traditional American V-8 engines are flat tappet design, these are
pushrod engines with the cam in the centre of the engine. The components of
that V-8 valve train are exactly like an aircooled flat 4, and if you saw a
typical lifter from one of these engines, it looks very similar to a VW type
4 lifter. Anything that would affect the American V-8 would likely affect
our engines in a similar fashion.
