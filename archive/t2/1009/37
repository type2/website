the manual that came with mine said 10%.  i was disappointed.  then i 
thought exhausting french fry odors in bear country wouldn't be a good 
idea.  then i remembered they'd be hibernating during heater season and 
it was all back to disappointment.

i choose kerosene since it doesn't stink as much, but it is expensive at 
around $4.35 a gallon and not the easiest thing to find.  based on 
Espar's consumption rate i have 32 hours with the heater on high to the 
tankful.  i travel with a 10l wedco jerry can as reserve.
