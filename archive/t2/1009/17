hey jim  not much bus content here but get both, keep the 36hp for the  57.  
#6 hp motors have gotten costly to rebuild as parts are hard to  find.  Get 
yourself a 40 hp for the 61 as that would be what came in it. I  think that is 
the last year of the stale air heat system. If you want to make it  more 
streetable then stick a 1600 in it. Remember that on installing a 1600 it  will go 
in better if you remove the heater boxes first.   I think if  these were buses
