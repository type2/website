Hi Jamie,

I have noticed the same shortage this year... Canadian Tire usually  
only ever has it from Castrol and it's priced at a premium. Walmart  
has castrol 20W50 and also carries it in the Tech2000 house brand  
that is about 25% cheaper.

Is it only the aircooled engines that have flat tappets? The 1.8L  
engine in Colleen's Cabriolet has solid lifters, but I don't know if  
they are considered "flat" or not.

Happy Trails,
