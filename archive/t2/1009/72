I was with you until you said this.  I have a large group of friends 
that have experienced a statistically-unlikely engine failure rate when 
using Royal Purple.  My engine builder, who has been building race 
engines for 35 years also will not touch it.  Their bearing wear 
demonstration is impressive but in the real world I don't think their 
oils perform as claimed.  YMMV, DYODD etc. but the inside of MY engines 
will never see purple oil.
