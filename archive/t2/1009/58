I'll dig up the article, and see if it is possibly published on the
internet too.

It's been a big time problem here with the low or no sulphur fuel.

The state fire marshall was the first to announce this ongoing problem
within his territory.
The magazine article backed his findings, announcement up, a week or two
later.

His stance was the larger tank has to be pumped out and cleaned because
of the  oil algae, & bacteria in the mixture.

The magazine made mention it's hell on fuel systems, pumps, injector's
and the engines that it is powering.
