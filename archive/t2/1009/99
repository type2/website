Subject: Intake Gaskets, fuel injection

Hi all,

My 81 aircooled engine is out of the van and all over the garage. Man, do I
HATE the tin! :-)  This is my first time tearing the whole beast apart.

I contacted Busdepot for the gasket set, and they were happy to oblige for a
good price. The thing I want to mention/ask you guys about is the intake
gasket, where the manifold tube go into the head. There is something odd in
that when I took it apart, the gasket was this rather thick piece of
"plastic" maybe 1/4" or a bit more, thick. Not what I expected.

The kit that is listed for this engine, 81, 2.0l, FI, does not have that
gasket. I asked the salesman to look at it, and see what it was, and the kit
has the thinner, 'gasket material' type of gasket.

He went the extra mile, and looked around, talked to Ron, and it seems that
this much thicker gasket that my engine has, belongs on the 74-79 engines,
not the 81.

So, for those in the know, did VW just grab the wrong ones and put them on
my engine? I have owned this van since 1988, and have no reason to think
that the original owners had any major engine work done. Their papers and
receipts were meticulous, and gave no indication of such repairs.

Will I be able to use the thinner gasket, or will it have problems aligning
to the head because of the lack of thickness?

Any thoughts or experiences with this topic?

As always, much obliged for any insight.

John
