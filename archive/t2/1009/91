They do! Castrol. I just found a link yesterday for a classic car 20W-50
Syntec. I have yet to find it in stores, but it is formulated for solid
lifters, tappets and different flow characteristics shared by classic cars,
and our VWs. It specifically has a high-zinc formula.

Karl's premonition was right about the emissions disclaimer, it says it
doesn't meet pre '83 cat requirements, but that doesn't apply to any of us.
Don't know about the California sale bit.

I'm going to start running it in my '78 since it has a '76 solid motor (if I
can find it). It will most likely work in my '68 even though it is running
hydraulic lifters/cam.

 they are afraid to show how their current oils do or don't cause  
 failures. :-)

If they did, they would probably have to put a big label on them:
"Legal for off road use only." in California.
