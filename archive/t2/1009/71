Subject: Re: [T2] How many fuel filters?

I find it interesting that soooo many  1974 carb bus I have worked on have
had a filter at the outlet of the tank,, with a cable tie to the starter
solenoid. The cable tie and the filter have always been the same mfgr. or
very similar!

and of course as years go by.. many have added them like beetle owners..
just before the carb inside the engine compartment.

so... i goes to say,, did you clean the other 2 filters,, in the tank , and
in the pump ??

Carbed buses originally only had two fuel filters, the one in the fuel
pump and the one in the fuel tank.  Over
the years, people have added filters in many places.  Between the pump and
the carb(s) is the usual place, but some people put one between the fuel
tank and the pump.
