The cold start enjector does not come into play in the
summer time, unless it is leaking. If you think you
are having problems with the cold start valve, just
bypass it with a section of fuel line. The only time
the valve works is when it is cold, I think around 34
degrees, and then only as long as the starter is
engaged. Phil
