Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor check....

Meg:
You may not need to pull out anything for now. If your distributor does not
have the vacuum unit, then you already know that you don't have the right
one. The vacuum unit is silver, is about the size of a small computer mouse,
has one or two ports for vacuum lines (hopefully connected to vacuum hoses),
and is attached to the distributor body below the distributor cap. Is it
there?
