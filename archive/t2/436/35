maybe i am crazy but i am looking for an observer i guess LOL...
crazy question and quiz for the day can someone help me understand the leaks and the spots we see here...?

i have changed the valve cover gaskets
i have changed the push rod seals....
i have changed the dipstick boot.../
i have the oil  cooler seals and will try <LOL to do that this weekend...
i have also cleaned everything really good with carb spray and rag/s....

ok....
she sits overnight after a good cleaning and these are the spots from overnight...

cant figure out where it is coming from...?
hangs from mustache bar on the left bolt...?
and drips from the right front(front is front) heater box?
drips from off bottom of oil filter even after tighting a tad...

drips from the bottom of the fan housing there is a small hole in the metal there...?
surely thats not where it is coming from...?

OK now i drove my little on to school this morning so yes she got to ride the bus just not a cheese wagon LOL...

its about 2 miles at the most to her school and when the wife and i got back there was burning really bad on the exhaust and oil all over the dipstick at top and some laying as a puddle in the bottom of the fan houseing right there on the tin...?
it was also in the fan wheel bottom in the groove there ...

now here is a pic of just the 2 mile ride...

i am questioning this cause i want to make sure that there isn't something i have missed..
someone has mentioned the pressure switch boot which i will hopefully easily replace this weekend comes in tomorrow..

will replace oil cooler seals if i must *&^*&%*%$& argggggg!

and someone has mentioned It could also be the rear (RIR) main crankshaft seal ???? i haven't a clue what this is haven't looked it up yet...?

thanks for any help my questioning is for the reasons that i don't have alot of time this weekend and want to make sure i hit the nail on the head?
i am useing the bus as a daily driver and i must pick my daughter up every afternoon from kindergarden...

i have this weekend to stop the oil leak....

i checked the oil after we drove it as seen in pic 2 this morning and it seemed to be fine right on the line...
it was a tad over before we left...
i put oil in it before i cam home from work yesterday..
cant figure out if she is useing alot or dumping ,spitting,spraying alot...?

sorry for the long post but i really have to get as close as i can to getting this right and hit the right things,...

maybe what i need is inspector gadget
or sherlock holmes LOL...

either way the engine comes down after cooling friday night late...
will have through the night and to about till 1 PM the next day Saturday to have it fixed...
leaving for Charleston hopefully by 3 or 4...PM but will be able to finish up on the motor and reinstall on Sunday hopefully before the evening...?

any or all help is appreciated
