Subject: Re: [T2] 009... Why?

Okay, I have a new part on my wish list...  20HP would represent about 
a 30% gain on my 1600 at 7000 ft, plus I get to see the spark, and my 
engine begins to resemble an old iMac???  Sign me up!
But really...  FWIW I like my 009 well enough in my '71.  You have to 
blip the throttle off idle and keep the revs up to make power, but then 
the latter was true with the vac advance as well.  However, I do want 
to rebuild my old vacuum unit.  Does anyone do this, or are there 
rebuild kits available?  Do I need to spring for an SVDA?  My advance 
quit advancing, and the timing jumped around a lot as indicated by 
timing light.  Diagnosis: worn out.  Right?  Anyone do quality rebuilds 
out there for less than the cost of a new unit?  TIA

Hey don't forget those kewl translucent distributor caps that let you
actually see the spark jump. Those were good for about a 20 hp increase
;)
