Subject: Re: [T2] She doesn't want to go camping?!

One good
experience is the best motivator. I would suggest finding a camping
event and then it's much better with people. Plus seeing all the other
people "crazy" enough to do this helps.

i agree jason...
my wife wasnt really crazy at all about camping and i kept telling her persuadeing her that she would like it if she would only give it a chance....
well high country bus festival came....
we werent sure until the night we left if we were going or not....?
until the night i got off work the night we left for hcbf....

the wife gave in and said ok...
the reason we wasnt sure we were going was becuase the bus wasnt running corretly...
could have broken down at any time...

point to story... we went and got there late really late friday night like 1 in the morning...

the wife got sick on her stomach first thing saturday morn and again on sunday....
but all in all she had a great time.. 
she was the tv type and motel camping type...
guess what after one experience in the bus not knowing if it would break down or not and being sick both days we were there she still says she had a blast and is ready for any cmapout we are able to get to now..
we slept in the bus also...
won her over course wasnt all my doing or the camping had mostly to do with the folks there... like jason said about haveing other crazy folks there to and i agree....
the people can make the differnce ...
have fun and good luck but check out the events..
not sure where you are but there is a great cmapout happ n in virgina at james farm comeing up.... should be a good one wished i could make it... i gotta work..
also bus's on the river is this weekend and should be a good campout...
like i said peace and good luck...
