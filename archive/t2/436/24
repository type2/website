Subject: just a thought? on a pop top

well wife and i were talking and wondering?

well at first we have always talked about doing something to the top of the bus...?

never been sure so i want to ask a question>?

can we have the roof cut if we were to find a pop top and have it installed...
i mean thats all it is anyways right>? done like that from the factory in pop tops?

would also like a 1/4 rack or what ever size they actually are the one that is the smallest...

like i said just curious...?
just thought one day it would be nice to have a little more room up top...
that would be great for camping...
thanks for all ideas,,,...
