Subject: cold start injector

My bus (75 westy, 1800cc) has a very hard time starting, and it actually 
backfired the other day, scared the hell out of the neighbor he,he,he.  But 
anyway, once it fires up it seems to idle fine.  If I shut it off and restart it 
once again has a hard time starting.  If i put a load on the engine ie: bogg the 
engine it wants to stall out and again losses power and wants to backfire.  
So,  my question is,  should i replace my cold start injector? I have a spare 
one.   There is also fuel in my oil, wich i hear is a sign.
