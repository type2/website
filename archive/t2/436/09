Subject: sucking sound

I just had a tune up, but now I hear a sucking sound.  It sounds like a
vacuum hose might have come loose.  It's a 1977 Riviera.  Any tips on
how to find this and fix would be great.  The van starts, but then the
idle drops so low that it dies.  After the engine warms up it runs
okay...but idles really rough.
