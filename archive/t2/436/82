I had Philbin Group  http://philbingroup.com/rebuilt/distributors.htm
rebuild my stock dizzy a couple months ago. He did a great job and for a
reasonable price. Total was $85 for complete rebuild and setting the correct
advance curve. Everything was either replaced or sand blasted and painted.
Looked nice when done. The above price did not include shipping because I
live close to the shop.
