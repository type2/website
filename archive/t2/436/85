Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pump?

Ahhh.....
I like the easy ones. My guess without seeing it is the vent for behind the
diaphragm.
I have seen both styles also. Some just have a small hole in the casting to
vent behind the diaphragm (just like the type 1 pumps) and some had a hose
attached that went into the tin ware. As the location of the type 4 pump is
exposed, it gets quite dusty there, putting the vent into the tinware puts
it in the spent cooling air which is less dusty.
Don't block it as it will affect the performance of the pump!
