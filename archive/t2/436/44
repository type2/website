I happen to be one of those lucky ones. My first date with my girlfriend we
ended up making out in my new (to me) 71 westy. Then I went travelling
around for 2 months with my dog right after we (my girlfriend, not the dog)
started dating. Stacey came and flew out to meet me on my travels - the bus
blew an engine in seattle on the way to meet her at the airport in
portland...she rented a car and met me and we had a great time for a week
while I got a new engine...A few trips together in the bus and she loves it.
Now we are getting married in the fall (and considering a honeymoon/camping
trip to the Keys...if only we could take the time to drive there from New
Orleans..) Yeah... I got a keeper!

Wink in New Orleans
