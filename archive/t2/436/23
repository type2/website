Ahh, Bahia Honda.  I slept there 4 nights in my drive-away tent a few 
years ago.  Trouble was, at the time I didn't have a bus - but the tent 
looked good even next to a Pr*lude.  I had a site on the bay, facing 
the bridge; rolled out of bed every morning and stumbled a few yards 
into the water with my mask & snorkel to wake up to parrotfish.  Not 
exactly deep woods camping, but plenty of tropical foliage and big 
purple crabs in the bushes.

That or cruise north to the high dunes at Jonathan Dickinson, and 
day-trip over to Blowing Rocks or kayak the Loxahatchee.

Folk who camp there and don't want to do it again just ain't natural.

We've got a FL panhandle equivalent up here in Panama City - St. 
Andrews State Park.  Plenty of sites right on the Grand Lagoon, with 
grass flats  right offshore and tropicals in the rocks at the jetty.  
Tie your skiff up within 10 yards of the tent.
