a number of reasons.

the total advance has been mentioned, and this is a significant
discrepency.
  But also the 009 is a centrificul advance only and has a real lag when
you accelerate, the stock dizzy is a combination vacuum/centrifical
advance and will respond sooner to changes in throttle positiion.

when I got my 78 it had a 009 in it and I always thought the bus was
really sluggish, finally found a good working stock dizzzy and was shocked
at the difference, especially in mine which is an automatic.

later I put in a Pertronix points eliminator and that means I never have
to adjust the points, that was one of the best moves I made I think

Good luck
Bob
