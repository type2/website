Barry,

Had the same sort of trouble lately.  try sealing by wrapping saran wrap
around the base tightly and see if your rpm's improve.

EGR was off of mine, I just had a flat plate and gasket and it was still a 
bear to get it sealed up.  I tested by covering the whole area with
duct tape.

There *are* some tubes inside that feed the egr and I wondered after 
looking inside the plenum at them whether they just made it seem like 
their was a leak because they way that they are shaped, they might 
sound like a whistle.

Cheers, dave
