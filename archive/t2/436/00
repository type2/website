Subject: She doesn't want to go camping?!

Hi Folks,

You could have a romantic evening in your driveway or backyard, and have an 
"at home" campout to show her the joys of Westy living.  She doesn't have to 
worry about using a smelly pit toilet, and can even go inside to change in 
to pajamas.

Of course, if that doesn't work, you could always sell your Bus and save the 
cash to pay for a nice hotel on several vacations....

Good luck!
