Subject: Re: [T2] She doesn't want to go camping?!

Definitely.. I think I've been to that campground in Bahai Honda. Or was it
Knights key? I was dating an older woman at the time, (Denise : I was 19,
she was 35) and we camped out in an actual tent there for almost a week.. it
was VERY cool at night (like 60-65 from the breeze) and I believe it was
around this time of year too. 
 
I like going to the keys, but she (Erica), refuses to go camping. She kinda
takes the keys for granted because it's soo close to Fort Lauderdale. I told
her, the next time we go to Mardi Gras, I want to take the Bus too! For ALL
the road trips, I want to take the VW! 
 
I would totally go for a VW Camping trip in the Keys though.
 
I actually don't have a Westfalia, or a camper of sorts. It's just a
standard hard-top 73 VW Transporter. But there's no reason why I can't put
sleeping bags in there! Man.. I'd LOVE to get one of those side tents, a
colman lantern and grill.. and have a BBQ and then sleep in the VW.
