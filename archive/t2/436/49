you are correct ted... i am planning on ordering them myself not a bad deal at all ...
they are really nice looking pics..
glad you got yours ted....

another awesome memory on the wall...
you can see a numerous amount of the bus's that were there ...
175 bus's i think is what we ended up and had at High Country from what i understand one of the biggest camp outs volks have seen...
