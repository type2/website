Subject: Re: [T2] How do you set up your camp?

even though the lists look long most items turn out to be small and i buy small sizes 
of everything for the bus. i tuck them in all kinds of nooks and crannies. it would 
take me pages to list all my stuff and there is still floor space and bed space!  i 
use bins under my rear seat and 2 layers in my silverware drawer and big bins that i 
put in the passenger seat space for the pets to sit on instead of the stock camping 
cabinetry. i have my fridge/stove/silverware/spicerack cabinet with a table off of it 
and the zbed part of my bed but not the cover in front. everything is very accessible 
from standing outside the bus usually and when i am inside at a rest stop i can set 
up my lawn chair inside and put my feet up without advertising i am alone.  i hang 
things from my ceiling and have net bag(s) to hang on the driver's side window wall 
too.  so don't worry if you take your time and are consistent you can get a ton 
(literally) of stuff inside and still be comfy!! :-))
