Subject: Re: [T2] She doesn't want to go camping & what to take

Jumping in here-combining the thread on what to take:
   Addressing SO's concerns is the best way to get her camping- and make
sure to offer something if she goes, like fixing something you've been
bugged about, or doing all the cooking. - in our case the prime turnoff
is "biting bugs"- so in buggy areas we use the attachable stock tent
with a folding table and single burner stove.  The latter is invaluable;
in inclement blustery weather where you don't want to set up the tent,
one can cook inside the bus with it on the floor.   Secondly, have an
awning so one can get out of the sun or rain.  We made our own 
floorless quickie side tent for privacy at the beach or camping when not
buggy; it has screens and hangs from the awning.  See it and all the
mods at this website (too many hits per day will close it- so please
pick a day that, say matches your birthday day of the week).

     I modified our Westy to allow some amenities from home; a Sega and
TV was put on a shelf I made next to the center sink cabinet.  "Are we
there yet?" was seldom heard.  The front cot was replaced by a foamboard
(email me for plans/pics).  The glovebox was deepened to fit an entire
atlas flat.  The Spare tire well was cut down so its now hinged door was
flush with the cabinet doors; this allows the garbage stool/seat to fit
between it and the passenger seat for better access as a climing stool
to the top bunk.  Screens were made that fit to velcro around the front
windows.  A paka-potti is small enough to fit between rear bed and sink
cabinet; it allowed my daughter to rest her legs on it back when she was
4.  It has a cover sewn from matching fabric to the seatbed.  The rear 2
person seatbed was replaced by a 74 triple seatbed, allowing all 3 of us
to watch the TV.  A well insulated electric cooler replaced the fridge
and sits behind the passenger seat when traveling.  It makes a nice
extra seat.  The bulky heavy table was chucked, and I made one that
flips up from the sliding door. Outside there is a hom-made pod on the
roofrack and we have a shelf that hangs off the rear bumper to hold
firewood/cooking stuff.
   In 95 we took our then 9 yr old daughter on a round the country trip
from NJ- 6 wks and 10,000 mi.  To prevent camping burnout,  when too
late or in cities or rain we hit motels like comfort inn (looked for
those that offered free breakfast and a pool)- worth the price to keep
the family happy.  We did take bikes, but mailed them home when we hit
the LA area.   When I get around to it, I will make of list of what is
carried in our Westy.
