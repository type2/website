Subject: Re: [T2] How do you set up your camp?

Cha,
    I have a '78 westy and eventually will camp some, but for now I am
still working on various problems with the camper. My question is with
all of this equipment how do you pack the bus and is there any room left
for you? I have never camped in a vw so any help is appreciated.

 Thanks
 Ralph   '78 westy
