Most states and counties have specific restrictions regarding license
plate frames....most, if not all, tag frames that I've seen violate the
restrictions I'm familiar with.  Some areas, and sometimes some cops,
enforce these laws more then others.

Essentially the idea is that if any part of the tag is covered or obscured
(tag number, county of issue, state, year sticker, etc) then you're in
violation.

Ah well.
