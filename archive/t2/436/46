Subject: HCBF ariel photo

Hi Volks, just got my 11x17 ariel photo of HCBF. It is wonderful-the detail
is terrific and I can even see my bus and can point to where I am in the
"people VW".  If you want to save a great memory of this wonderful event, I
would recommend that you order one immediately. TBear
