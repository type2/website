Margaret,

The 009 was built for type 1(bug) engines and has a total advance
far less than distributors built for the t4 engines(yours).
Basically, you get more advance from a stock 77 distributor
which makes your bus feel like it has more power(it does/will).


without getting into a flame war, the 009 may not be a good choice
for even type 1 engines unless you know exactly why you want it.

Cheers, dave
