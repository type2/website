Subject: Re: [T2] How do you set up your camp?

FWIW, the square white pails that cat litter comes in  (Petsmart) are
great for parts.  I cut them down using 4 passes across a tablesaw so
they just fit under the rear seatbed.  You can line the garbagepail with
these also.   We carry those waffle blocks that interlock- so you can
level the camper.  Thes are good for "suck " problems like mud or sand.
