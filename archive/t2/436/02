For my birthday last year I talked the wife into camping w/ me at
Everybus. She was very reluctant, but did it anyway. She had such a
good time, we made it to HCBF and several this year. One good
experience is the best motivator. I would suggest finding a camping
event and then it's much better with people. Plus seeing all the other
people "crazy" enough to do this helps.
