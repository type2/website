Subject: Re: [T2] white stag tent still in biz?

ooph. so close, does this mean i'll have to hold it up myself? seriously,
i think i'm in a good place with 90% there. the four cross poles are fine
- two i can have straightened by my electrician bud with the conduit
bender. all i need is four elbow corners and the roofline "straights"
running parallel to the bus. can any white stag tent owners tell me: is
there a perpendicular rod across the top middle keeping the two main
pillars apart? not seen on the tent-site. also - are the roofline
"straights" one piece, or two each with their own connectors inbetween
...how's that work? TIA      - steve
