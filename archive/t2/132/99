Subject: Anyone comming through Abilene, TX to EVERYBUS

I was hoping someone might be comming through Abilene,
TX on the way to EVERYBUS and might be willing to pick
up an engine.  I need to get this engine but do not
have time to drive to TX but could easily meet someone
at Everybus.  I would be happy to make it worth
someone's time/effort!

TIA

Michael
