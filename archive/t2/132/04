Subject: VW Symbol Wanted for 73 Bus




Hello everybody,

I am searching for a VW symbol for the front of a 73 Bus.  I believe the
clips are installed already, so they shouldn't be necessary.

I have lots of non-vw stuff to offer for trade, such as computer hardware,
6x9 speakers or I can burn you lots of dead/bob marley/allman/mmw/neil
young/phish concerts on CD-R.

Please e-mail me at shawnagan(-at-)sympatico.ca if you can help me.

Thank you,
Shawn Luft
Montreal, Canada

'73 Bus imported from Baton Rouge LA to Canada, inspection still req'd.
