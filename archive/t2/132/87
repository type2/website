I wanted to reply to this in open forum because I feel strongly on the issue.

Jack
for changing tires, general maintenance, etc................
Get the really nice scissors jack sold by Bus Depot.
Just get it !!!
It works awesome and is a safe way to lift your bus !!
The original issue is a Maypole of insecurity.

Jack Stands.
I use a set of 3,000 lb jack stands that are sturdy and I feel very safe 
with them supporting the bus.
You being in Canada......
I saw some very nice 2,000 lb stands at Canadian Tire last Summer, and 
looked them over to just inspect their quality. They were quite nice.

Look for quality in locking and unlocking. You don't want some piece of 
junk under the bus that is over you.
