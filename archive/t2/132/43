Beth,

Theoretically probably not much difference<grin>.

Also theoretically, if some jbweld or similar was used on the parts that 
might be broken off<grin> before any dirt got in there, they would 
probably stay on fairly well.

J-B Weld can be purchased at almost any flaps and I'm certain that
you can get it somewhere in Houston!

As always, your mileage may vary.

Cheers, dave
