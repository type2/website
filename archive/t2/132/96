Subject: Re: [T2] STOCK DUAL CARBS TO PORSCHE 1700 L-JET FI CONVERSION QUESTIONS???

Hello List,

I would liket to thank every one for the time that
they put in replying to my Fuel Injection questions. I
think I am going to go for it. I am undecided as of
yet whether or not to go with the stock 2000cc L-Jet
stock bus fuel injection or go with the 1800cc L-Jet
stock Porsche 914 fuel injection. according to some
posts in the archives, they are almost identical. What
are your thought on that? I read that I can use the
stock 2000cc vw bus fuel injection on my 1700cc
engine. I read that it would make my bus run alittle
rich but it would still be a good settup. Any
thoughts?
I plan to buy the Bosh Fuel Injection book this week
some time. I will be reading up on it...

Thanks!

David Kelly
