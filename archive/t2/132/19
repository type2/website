Have you adjusted the rear drums nice and tight (Shoes seat and then back
off a bit so they turn freely).  This affects pedal height more than
anything else.
Are you still seeing air when you bleed or is it nice and bubble-free fluid?
Are you bleeding from the furthest wheel in (relative to the MC)?  If the
answer is yes to all of this, get a new (or rebuilt) MC.
