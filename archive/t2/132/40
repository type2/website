He says he installed it for towing. It does have three-way ball valves on it
to route coolant through it. This Bus also contains a 4.3-liter Vortec V-6;
it looks like he put it in there with a crowbar--that engine bay is TIGHT!

The worrisome part of this installation is the small lines he's got running
between the ends of the bus--IIRC, they're less than 1.5" which is smaller
than the hoses that were in the S-10 he got the engine from.
