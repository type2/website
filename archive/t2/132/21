George--

I didn't say it was stupid---it just looks that way--

I'll bet the type 2 with the radiator up front suffer's the same air
bleeding hassle's as the Vanagon's--

Later,

Well, if it works it can't be too stupid! 
I'm wondering how they handled the problem of bleeding air out of the
long cooling system. The Vanagon required considerable care in getting
the air out and I'm wondering if the Mexican bus was any better.
