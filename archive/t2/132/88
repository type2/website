good idea,   I suggest if you can

a floor type hydraulic jack that will lift 21 inches, these are sometimes
called SUV jacks, I have seen decent ones for $75 or so.  using the
smaller ones means you have to jack it all the way up, put a jack stand
in, lower the jack and put it on some wood blocks and then raise the bus
some more, especially in the rear there is a lot of travel in the
suspension.
  jack stands should be heavy metal and rated at an absolute minimum of
2.5tons, (5tons is better) While two of them is all you need, I have found
a third one to be very handy at times, these are cheap insurance get good
ones with a nice deep saddle on the top.

good luck
Bob
