Subject: how do you remove the slack in your heater lines?

Hello,

So my westy has heat, but only when I wire those boxes all the way open,
which means heat all the time.
Being from San Francisco where its 70 during the day and 40 in the evening,
I would like the option to turn them on and off as needed. Are there any
tricks to pulling up the slack on the lines so I can use the factory handles
in the dash?

thanks for any tips.. gonna try and tackle em this week if possible..
