No pics, but it is easy to describe.  The radiator is placed with it long
axis parallel to the bus' long axis.  The bottom of the radiator is
nestled back into the left side of the engine bay outboard of the
stiffening flange (early baywindow
bus).  The top of the radiator is tilted toward the middle of the bus and
ends near the top of the bay just inboard of the air duct from the intake
vent.
There was a light framework around the radiator that carried
rubber seals to the body that prevented recirculation.

I wish I could remember the origin of the Japanese radiator.  It was the
perfect shape and size for the opening, and a heck of a lot cheaper than
a custom radiator.
