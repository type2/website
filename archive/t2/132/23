Chuck,

Did one of mine a couple of weeks ago(78 stock) and had no problems.

I took the front end off and pulled it down under the car, clipped the 
rear off and then pulled it out the front just fine.  IIRC there are 
"clamps" in the rear for the outer part of the cable that must be loosened
to be able to pull it all out.

Check for any crimps in the tubing that could be holding it....

Cheers, dave
