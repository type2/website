Subject: phoenix listees, please pmail me!

well, we've found out that stephanie was accepted to the mayo clinic in
scottsdale, so we will be moving to phoenix in june, 2003.

 we would like to hear from phoenix-area residents regarding housing (and
any other subject near and dear to your hearts!);
stephanie will be making maybe 35K, so we need somewhere AFFORDABLE that
will also let us have our menagerie: the 70 bus, the 65 singlecab, a 50
chevy 1/2 ton and stephanie's 13-year-old  Bimmer beater. i do ALL my own
auto work, so need neighbors who don't piss and moan about it.
no areas with neighborhood associations need apply!



please PMAIL me; i bet very few folks on the lists want to hear about your
fave store or restaurant... unless its in a converted bus :)

thanks in advance,

Craig K
70 Neunsitzer
