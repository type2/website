Well, it's a T3 bus (Vanagon).  :)

 From another list I'm on:

http://www.schubertfahrzeugtechnik.de/sites-bus-t3-tdi6.html

The text on this page indicates that it uses a tiptronic auto transaxle, 
has a top speed of about 120mph and gets 19mpg while doing so!  Says it is 
also capable of 24mpg at slower speeds.  Whoo-ya, I'll take 
one!  Unfortunately it says it's not possible to install it in a 
Syncro.  Joel, I thought you might want to forward this to the Vanagon list.
