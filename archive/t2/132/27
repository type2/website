I have used this paint.  I put the silver POR20 on my exhaust.  You will
need to have an ultra clean as in grease free muffler for the paint to
stick.  Make sure you mix the paint well also as the substance of the paint
is on the bottom of the can.  I did not super clean the muffler.  Just wiped
it clean and sprayed it with ospho.  Then wiped it down again and painted
it.  It's been about 4 months and the silver is flaking off in places but
overall it is still on there.
