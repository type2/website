Subject: RE: STOCK DUAL CARBS TO PORSCHE 1700 L-JET FI CONVERSION QUESTIONS???

Hello List,

Thanks you for all the advice so far. As far as what
type of system it is, I will read the description:

"This is a complete working Porsche 914 L-Jet FI
system. EVERY part of the FI system just taken off a
working car - injectors, ECU, throttle body, intake
tubes, fuel pressure regulator, brackets, resistor
pack and everything else needed to convert your 914
1.7 or 1.8 back to factory specs if you have the stock
wiring, and get the most power out of your car!
Everything works, so save yourself THOUSANDS over the
cost of a new replacement system."

This is what I know about this system. How does it
sound?  Thanks!

David Kelly
