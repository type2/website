Subject: 1600DP question

Ok.. a question for the 1600 guru's... on  the bottom of the cylinders there
are some "rings" used for.... we are assuming shimming the cylinders to the
correct height.
How many rings should there be... we have three but, thinking there should
be four.  And, let me know if we are correct in assuming the usage of these
rings...
Thanks
Gail Doles
