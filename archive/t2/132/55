Volks,

Down where i live there was a vw shop that was in business about 40 years
until the owner passed away a year ago.  He made a living off of pulling the
thermostat and flaps off of every motor that ever came into that
place..............self-trained, and had a big clientele.

I have made a decent side income over the last year putting the flaps and
thermostats back in these cars :) .

On the type 4 the flaps are just a must..............the left side one
diverts air thru the oil cooler without it, you are running hot, period.  My
type 4 motor. with flaps and thermostat takes forever to warm up on a really
cold day.  I can only imagine the wear and tear vans take that have this
stuff removed in cold climates.
