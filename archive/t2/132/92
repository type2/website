The early Westy's had a 3 piece windshield cover. 2 permenant sliders along
the doors and then a snap-in windshield "only" curtain. I think the plaid 3
piece went from 67-70. And then the 71-73 had the plaid one piece curtain.
Of course 70 probably had some of both.

I have one of these original plaid windshield "only" curtains I am going to
raffle off at Everybus, all proceeds to go to the Jonothan Walker fund.

My 1970 Westy has original curtains.  The front curtains are indeed a one
piece with snaps.  This covers the front bay, driver and passenger window.
It uses stretch on top.
Not sure what your Westy used...
