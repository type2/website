Subject: how works a thermostat??!! (on a 76 Type IV)

hello,

i know that this is a simple concept but i cant seem
to grasp it. i have researched all the manuals that i
own( muir, bentley, and haynes) and cannot seem to
find any understanding. 

i know that the thermostat expands when hot and thus
operates the flap for incresed airflow at higher
operating temps. right?

what i cant get is this...

if the flap is closed when the piece that holds the
cable screw is pointed straight up towards the the top
of the engine bay. then how will an EXPANDING
thermostat PULL that arm down in order to open the
flap??? shouldnt it be shrinking??

unless i have this whole thing wrong and the flap is
actually closed when that little screw piece is down
and pointing towards the front of the bus, in which
case an expanding thermostat would in fact serve to
open the flap by releasing tension on the screw piece.

im so confused!!!!


anyone who could shed any light on this will be my
official hero.

as always thanks in advance. any and all answers,
opinions or insights will be greatly appreciated.
