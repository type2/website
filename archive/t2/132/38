I've put the silver POR-15 on freshly sandblasted steel and frankly, in
the midatlantic, it was junk, utter junk.  I think the VHT aerosol stuff we
used on Dolan's was far better, and I'm talking the difference of like OK
after one winter but not great (VHT) versus gone in a couple of fall months
(POR-15).

My experience at least, and I've tried it twice so as not to have just gotten
a bad batch.  A friend used on of the other brand's stuff, maybe Eastwoods
gray and it has lasted well, so who knows.
