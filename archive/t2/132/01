You will need to fabricate a return fuel line to the fuel tank from the 
fuel pressure regulator.

Nope, you will need to install relays, and to keep it close to stock, that 
means the Porsche relay board, and the Porsche FI wiring harness and 
complete induction system. You also must use the Porsche dizzy which is 
nothing like the VW. It has a spezial set of extra breaker points in the 
lower section of the dizzy which trigger the injectors.

You must deliver spec fuel pressure and volume. Why not just put the Ford 
pickup motor in there, then you know the Ford pump will do the job. You can 
test the pump to see if it fits the pressure/volume specs. The Porsche 
regulator on the eailier 914 was adjustable, a nice feature, but they 
stopped that when DIY'ers kept wanting to turn screws that they had no way 
of knowing how to set right.

I would definitely review the 914 Porsche factory manual FI section BEFORE 
I spent any other money on this project. It will give you an idea of what 
is required, and if you have the engineering skills to conduct this 
experiment, and the resource to see it through.

You still won't have the Porsche crank/cam/rods/pistons/heads........if you 
use a VW long block. If your thinking of doing this because you have some 
of the parts and it will be cheaper to do than a stock set-up, think again. 
Then study it out and think some more. I expect it will require 5 times the 
time/money to convert than setting up stock duals, that is, if functional 
reliability is a goal.

Sorry if this sounds harsh, but I can't put aside rational thought for the 
sake of being nice. Bottom line, it can be done but it won't be an easy swap.
