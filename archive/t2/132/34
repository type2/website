I can see why you are confused :-)

You are confused because it doesn't operate like you think it does.  When
that little tab is pointed straight up, the flaps are FULLY OPEN, not
closed.

The thermostat contracts when cold, pulling on the cable which pulls that
little tab down against spring tension to close the flaps (the spring is
wound around the rod near where the cable connects).  As the thermostat
warms, it expands and slackens the cable.  The slack is of course taken up
by the spring and the flaps open as the thermostat expands until they are
fully open with that little tab pointing straight up.

You answered your own question.  Just needed confirmation :-)
