Subject: Re: [T2] white stag tent still in biz?

As far as I know they are not, at least not in the same location.  I got the
address of the tent instructions on Joe's page and had a kind listee in Wa
look them up for me ... Not there anymore and they hadn't heard of the
company...  If you hear anything different let me know Please as I need
poles for one side.

PS White Stag tents came with Riviera campers.

Peace Brother,
