just a quickie...

I have a 69 bus and I am replacing the motor with a 71 dual port. My shif=
ter seems to have no ease of movement. It is very stiff. Haven't been und=
er to check it out yet. Has anyone else experienced this? Also over the w=
eekend, I picked up a 1970 transmission from a donor bus. I have heard th=
at the 69 is a one year only trans, and some parts are NLA. Would it be w=
orth my while to replace the 69 with the 70?     Thank You.....   BGGet m=
