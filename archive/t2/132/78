I am surprised that your numbers are this low with the original engine.  My
Corvair 6 cyl. powered bus does at least that well.  It gets a little over
20 on a good day, though that is mixed town/two lane highway driving.  It
gets way less on the interstate above 50mph or so, largely making the higher
power engine little advantage since I end up going slow to get better
mileage.  The gas tank in my '70 Westfalia just isn't big enough!  GW
