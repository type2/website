Subject: bus bumpers and brackets for sale!!!

Hello list,

I do not have much to offer at Everybus this year but
I do have a nice set of bumpers that came off my 74
bus. I will watter sand them, fix any small flaws that
might be present and respray them white before I come.
They have no dents in them that I can remember. The
back bumper comes with its bumper brackets. They
really are in good shape. I don't need them because I
am installing the 68-72 style bumpers in my bus. I
know, it is "imposible" to fit the 68-72 front bumber
on a later bus, but I cut off that hump that was
behind the bumper and welded the bottom portion of a
68-72 nose on my bus. So far so good. Any way, I would
like to get $25.00 a piece for them or both for
$40.00. Not a bad price considering a new ones cost at
least $79.00 a piece + shipping + bumper brackets.
Even then they still need to be painted. If you want
them, let me know and I will hold them for you if you
PROMISE to pick them up at Everybus. I am open to
reasonable offers or possible trade. Thanks
