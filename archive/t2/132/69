Subject: Re: [T2] white stag tent still in biz?

Nope. Fred Stoermer researched this a couple years ago.  White Stag was
bought by a large conglomerate and currently produces clothing in North
Carolina. No tents, no patterns, no poles and no knowledge of the tent
manufacturing history.  It took about six months of e-mails and phone
calls, but White Stag, the tent maker is no more.
