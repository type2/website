I didn't know about the secondary radiator.  Was it installed after the
primary to solve a heat problem?  If so, I'd definitely suspect a
recirculation problem, as the primary radiator is huge.  You pretty much
have to have a fan on the radiator in this sort of installation to keep
the air moving while stationary.

It's critical to have some sort of ducting to keep the hot air away from
the air intake.

That's why I like the radiator in the engine bay arrangement.  If you are
good about bleeding the system, a burp tank seems to work well.  I wonder
how they did it with the watercooled baywindows in Mexico?
