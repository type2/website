If you replace the rotors you will need the bearing races which are pressed
into the rotors. If you are careful and use a drift you an remove the
races, clean and inspect  them along with your bearings, re pack with
grease and reinstall. Provided the bearings are in good order and the races
are not damaged. You need to use caution installing the races. If you do
not have the tool to do this maybe try to borrow one. It is easy to score
the race when you install them into the rotor.

Wow,thanks for the fast replies on the mexican hatch seal. Rob is going
to let me check it out first hand. Nothing better that seeing with my
own eyes. Now another quick question while I have everyone's attention.
It's getting real close to leaving for everybus and I am starting to get
a little nervous. I put a rebuilt engine in,all new
hoses,injectors,heater boxes,exhuast and it's running real good. I am
going to check the brakes and bearing this weekend and replace the
rubber hoses. I also want to flush out all the brake fluid. My question
is on the bearings. I have new seals and plan on regreasing them. I've
never done it on a bus before and would like some suggestion on how.
Also do I have to replace the front bearings if I replace the front
rotors?( I do have a Bentley but I left at work).
