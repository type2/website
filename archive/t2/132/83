Nope, but a center pole from the inside of the bus or a self made pole would
be a good addition as this tent seems to really store the water on the roof
until it soaks thru and lands on the waterproof floor.

 not seen on the tent-site. also - are the roofline

from the corners there are 3 pieces in between each corner.  Two long ones
with the holes and one short one with a 165 degree bend with the little
button clip that slips into the straight poles.

Hope this helps..
