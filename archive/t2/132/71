I'm with Pops on this one.  The rubber boots where the carb base plate
connects to the manifolds are notorious for leaking.  Check the clamps as
I've seen problems with the clamps failing and they look good but don't
apply much pressure to seal the rubber.  Get it to idle as low as you can
and spray some carb cleaner on 'em.  If the RPMs increase, voila.  Get new
clamps (better yet, get new boots--their cheap).  This system is pretty
simple.  Should be easy to find the leak.

Good luck,
Bill
