Wow,thanks for the fast replies on the mexican hatch seal. Rob is going 
to let me check it out first hand. Nothing better that seeing with my 
own eyes. Now another quick question while I have everyone's attention. 
It's getting real close to leaving for everybus and I am starting to get
a little nervous. I put a rebuilt engine in,all new 
hoses,injectors,heater boxes,exhuast and it's running real good. I am 
going to check the brakes and bearing this weekend and replace the 
rubber hoses. I also want to flush out all the brake fluid. My question 
is on the bearings. I have new seals and plan on regreasing them. I've 
never done it on a bus before and would like some suggestion on how. 
Also do I have to replace the front bearings if I replace the front 
rotors?( I do have a Bentley but I left at work).
