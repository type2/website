Bill,

Just did this last weekend.

On a 78, the rotors and spindles are separate parts.  You can pull just 
the rotors off and put new ones on, or pull both off at one time and replace 
the bearings.

I took my rotors off first and found that they were out of spec.

Took the spindles off next and cleaned and painted them and then installed 
new bearings in them while I waited for the new rotors to show up.
Cleaned and por-15'd the backing plates while I was at it.


Not a big job unless you are going to paint them.


Cheers ,dave
