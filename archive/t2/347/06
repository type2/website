Joel,

I got all of mine from west coast metric, except for all of the 
front door seals and parts.

You can get them with or without the groove and with or without vent 
windows.  I have sliders.  There catalog doesn't make it very clear, so 
just call them and tell them what you want.  They were *very* helpfull and 
the guy just rattled of the numbers without even looking them up...got my 
new chrome moldings there too.

Cheers, dave
