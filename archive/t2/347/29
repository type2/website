Subject: CV Joint noise?

I'm just in the initial stages of getting an '80 Westy all set up.  Got
registered and inspected. New exhaust, new brakes, etc.  So today I
drove it around for the first time, just a few miles around town.  I was
getting a "horrible" sort if grinding trani sort of noise, mainly on
turns; but after a while it went away.   My guess is that the lubricants
in the CV joints had settled in the long time the van was sitting unused
and a bit of driving spread the grease around.  Maybe BS.  Anyway, does
this sound familiar to anyone.  I expect I'll be wanting to do an
servicing of the CV joints when the weather gets a  bit nicer.
