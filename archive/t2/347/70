Subject: centrifugal advance on combo dizzy

Hey it seems as though the vacuum advance on my 73  is actually working, 
but my acceleration is still way poopy,  so now I am wondering if the the
distributor itself is the problem.......
Leading to the question of how the heck do I check the centrifugal advance
portion of the distributor?
Everything else is on,  points, timing,  compression etc.

I do have another dizzy to try out but I would like to know for certain if
I need to do a swap!
