Subject: Re: [T2] Darn it, blinkers still not working.  Help?

my ex is an electrician... one day i saw a car with it's blinker going
nuts as you described and i mentioned it... he said it indicated that it
did not have a complete circuit. it could be the front bulb was burned
out, or it could be a short in THAT line, allowing it to ground out
instead of getting the proper current... or something like that... try
running a wire outside the car from the switch to the back light, see if
that helps... if not, run it to the front light, if that doesnt work, it
may be some other componant on THAT circuit (left side, includes the turn
switch in the steering column... ANYTHING on that circuit needs to be
checked of the list)

as far as your emergency flashers go, i would guess it was the hazard
switch itself, or the witing between it and the lights... but that is
ONLY a guess. if your flasher was bad, the turn signals wouldnt work
either.

anyway, good luck, electrical gremlins are NEVER fun to straighten out,
