Subject: Re:tire mounts- mine was in the roof rack

Karl, your rack looks homemade to me.   I like mine I did once-(when I
put a permanent bike rack in front attached to orig. wheel mount)- 2
eyebolts go throught the rack and roof, fender washers under the nut.
Nuts hidden above roof panel. Distance is based on the rim-bolt pattern.
Two open eyebolts go into the loops and face up- the tire sat angled in
the 78 well with the bolts going through the holes. This lets one put a
tire cover over it.  Then I put the tire on the front and used the
eyebolts to hold down the "maibox" pod on top, and put the bike rack in
back- see (link counts no of hits in a day and might shut
down)...http://www.geocities.com/mike_benthin
