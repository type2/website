All of this terminology varies widely depending upon the state in which
you live.  In California, a motorhome is a "housecar" and isn't subject to
truck weight fees.  In Oregon, IIRC, a "camper" is a completely separate
registration plate for pickup campers.

Unless you specify a particular state, any information is meaningless
