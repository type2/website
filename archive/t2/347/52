Yes, carefully file the roughness/sharpness off.

You need to feel around with your finger and decide when it's smooth enough to attempt it again. Use a lot of motor oil. I dip the seals in oil before putting them on the pushrod tube then use an oil can to apply more if needed. Seems like a lot but it's only oil.

If all is prepped correctly, you should be able to quickly tap them into place at the head with a coordinated pull on the tube.
