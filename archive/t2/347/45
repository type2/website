Anything out of adjustment will cause a problem.  Have you visually inspected
the wheel cylinders, shoes, drums, brake booster and hoses (if present) to 
verify
that they are serviceable?

John Muir's fine old book "How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive......"
is a wealth of information, presented in a folksy way, for the beginner.

I would also suggest that you replace the brake fluid and the rubber
brake lines, in that order.

Have you replaced all fuel lines and grommets?  Do a search in the Archives
for "engine fire," if you need convincing.
