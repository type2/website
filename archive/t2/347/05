Hi Paul,

I think those figures are the generaly accepted ones - certainly they have been 'kicking around' for the 12 years I have had a Type 2.

Do remember that cooling the engine of means driving slower (without changing down) so that the ratio of air moved to engine speed increases. In extreem circumstances eg just come up a long steep hill in hot conditions cooling the engine down may mean puling over to the side and letting it idle for a few minutes as cooling:heating ration is at a maximum when idling.

Good luck
