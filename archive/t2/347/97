true, but you sure get ALOT more praise when one person gripes!!!
keep up the great (from what i hear) service and i hope to buy something
from you in the future. i have two shops in town i get parts from,
because normally, i need them NOW. if they dont have it, there is a
repair shop that carries parts, too, and i only turn to them when i must
(long story, but they switched my engine once and i ended up with a 1300
in my bug).

anyway, maybe SOME day...
