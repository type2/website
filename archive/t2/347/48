They don't seem to be advertized in the US because Bosch actively sells it's lighting products outside the US. However you can get them from your vwflaps through their Bosch distributor. The archives only go up to Dec 02 but I posted this information back in Feb:

Bosch 7" Round H4s
0 301 600 118
Made in Sweden

That number is for an individual unit with no bulb. Better deals exist if you buy them in kits (2 units + 2 bulbs) but it's good to know the part number in case you get rock damage.

The best kit deals seem to be in Canada. Does anyone have a good link?

The kit number is 0 301 600 801 730 if you want to try your vwflaps.

They also come up ebay all the time. If you search on Bosch H4 you'll find some right now.

www.fastforward.ca have them (described as 180mm) but they include the euro parking lights you probably don't want. However, they can order the other kind the next time they make an order.
