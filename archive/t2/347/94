Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust manifold wrapping/DO IT!!!!!

If the metal exhaust cover is gone, rewrap it with Thermo-Tec header wrap. It 
keeps your exhaust temp up, emissions down, provides hotter temps to the 
heater boxes, and cooler exhaust valves. It also keeps your t-stat from 
opening too soon. And before I get flamed from the folks who think they know 
better, VW put those covers on there for the above listed reasons. Also, 
don't listen to the people who tell you that the wrap will cause your down 
pipes to rot out. The down pipes that were installed on '76-'78 2.0L engines 
were made of STAINLESS STEEL. So were the "afterburner Pipes", the "U" shaped 
tubes bolted to the down pipes. If their protective jacket is gone also, use 
the above header wrap. I can't even begin to tell you how many time I've had 
to correct people on this subject...But remember, this only goes for the 
'76-'79 exhaust system with the afterburner tubes. this is how VW managed to 
get away with not needing a cat converter for the Federal Mod.'s.
