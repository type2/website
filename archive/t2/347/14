 Let me know what I'm getting into.

a VERY COOL BUS+ACEAIQ-

a split window is a complete different vehicle as far as I am concerned. If
you want a raw bare essentials type bus a split is your bus. It might not
have a lot of creature comforts like late model busses and vanagons but what
it lacks in that area it better in others. For one thing the lines and style
of the bus is the  best made IMO. The reduction boxes make going up hills a
breeze. My 66 westy goes about 55-60 on the interstate about the same as my
68 westy. But will leave my 68 in the dust going up hills. Splits are cool
but getting rather expensive due to there recent popularity ( have you
notice you see them more and more on TV) Anyway I love both but my first bus
was a split so I am a little bias
