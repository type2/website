This has been bugging me for a few months and I finally found an answer:
there are two spare tire mounts available, one from EMPI and one from
BugPack...

The BugPack one has the mounting pattern that closely matches the mount on
my bus which was put on in 78. My mount is like every other one I've ever
seen.

A while back I asked a question about the correct way to orient the mount.
My old mount has TOP labeled by the single stud. It's rusty and I didn't
notice it was there before.
