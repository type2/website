Subject: 050 distributor and electronic ignition - da Bomb

I just installed a Bosch 050 distributor and Pertronix electronic 
ignition.  This is the best thing I have done since I bought the bus. 
 Kudos to the Bus Depot for excellent pricing and prompt shipping, PA to HI.

I have a '79 bus, the PO had put a '74 1800 cc engine with a Weber 
Progressive carburetor.  Electronic choke, no vacuum advance.

I chose the 050 over the 009 based on information found on-line.  My 
interpretation of the information is the 050 has a better advance curve 
for the bus, the 009 is better for bugs.  It's a weight thing.

It took a total of 30 minutes, with clean up time to remove the old 
distributor, a Bosch 009, and put the the 050 in.  Was  very simple - 
only goes in one way.  Perfect for the brain dead mechanic.  The 
magnetic ring that goes over the rotor shaft was very snug, I used a 
small rubber mallet and the old rotor to tap it into place.  I have the 
Bentley and it lays out the steps in half a page, with pictures too!

Timing was easy.  I choose 28 degrees as my end point for the high RPM 
and just backed off the distributor till I got it.  For my bus it ended 
up at 4 degrees advance, with acceleration advance at 28 degrees.

The result is awesome.  I know that some on the list advocate keeping 
things stock and all, but the ease of this, the cost, and never having 
to set my timing again made this a beneficial and judicial exchange.

My only regret is I waited till now to change it out.
