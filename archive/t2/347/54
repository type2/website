I had a car that behaved this way when one of the turn
signal bulbs had burned out (like one of the rear
ones) while the front one still worked. The faster
flashing was the indication to the operator that there
was a bulb out. I don't know if v-dubs do this though.
I would get out and do a thorough check just in case. 
Just my 2 cents.
