A final word. I was recently contacted by Bosch USA and they said they don't have a lighting catalog for the US like they do for Japan and Europe and the rest of the world. Pity. I'm sure their bulbs are here in US warehouses if you can locate the number.

I also came across this good lighting faq if you can wade through the HID info:

What I found interesting is that the Bosch H4 units say DOT (and motorcycle) on them yet they clearly exibit the ECE light pattern. This finally explains to me why they are so bright let don't seem to bother other drivers.
