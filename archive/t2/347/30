Not a good test.  Let the bus idle and disconnect the advance vacuum hose at the carb.  Have your timing light hooked up and aimed at the scale.  Suck on the vacuum hose while you watch the timing scale.  You should see the timing advance several degrees.  I suspect this will happen based on what you have said so far.

Next, you will need to buy/borrow a vacuum gauge.  Most FLAPS have them for about $20.  Start over and disconnect the vacuum advance hose at the distributor and attach it to the vacuum gauge with the bus idling.  Now "goose" the throttle a few times while watching the vacuum gauge.  You should see the vacuum gauge go up briefly.  You will not be able to maintain much, if any vacuum without a load on the engine, but you should see a brief spike, indicating that the port is functioning.

You only really need the vacuum signal from one carb.  It can be either the right or left carb - doesn't matter.  I believe busses came from the factory with advance hooked to the left carb and the right carb's advance port capped, but for all I know the port could have been non-functional.  I wouldn't worry about this - concentrate on getting the vacuum advance to work from the left carb.
