I was actually thinking it might be good if it was the Washington/Baltimore
area VW club...or something...'cause the neerest Clubs were in Southern PA,
down in VA, and over in Salisbury, MD...  Although I don't know if we'd go so
far as to say "Cheasapeake" though... thats a very big area... of
course...maybe that is what everyone will want ;)

The only trick with is with dual host cities is working out meetings,
etc....Could have separate meetings, then occationaly have one combined
meeting...  That way it's easier for people to make the meetings... :)

Of course if someone were interested in running a separate club, I'd be
willing to host the site...

But as much as I know everyone on the Type2 list is eagerly waiting to see
what happens next, this should probaly be descused further on the websites
forums....I'll go and post the topic now... :)

So Please anyone in the Washington, DC / Baltimore, MD (annapolis,md I know
there are some busses out there...) or surrounding are please stop by
www.dcvw.org and help us form the club (or clubs if need be...)
