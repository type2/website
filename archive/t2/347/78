260 is WAY past the polymer breakdown temp. If you are running 10-40 or 20-50, when the polymers go you are
left with the viscosity of the base oil: either 10 or 20.
Go here: http://www.vtr.org/maintain/lubricants-redline.html
and read the section on Viscosity Index Improvers. Polymer breakdown starts at 210....
More info here: http://www.eskimo.com/~dalus/bmw/all/misc/all_oilfaq.html
but he does not mention the temp.
