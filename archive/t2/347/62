Subject: One More Thing I forgot to Mention

Ok--this is an item for the guy who has it all--
Who thought he had every VW gizmo and Do-Dad--
Something to keep you entertained at a boring campout.


A Genuine

For Real

Honest to goodness

Direct from those who brought us the Schwimmerwagen

A VW YO-YO.


$8.00--plus.--

This is for real folks--often imitated--never
Duplicated
