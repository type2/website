If you have rear brakes far enough out of adjustment it could be that you 
are trying to stop with fronts only. Also (though i doubt this is the case 
this time) always looked for rock ding-ed brake lines that restrict the 
flow to the rear or the vehicle. I had a Fiat with that problem. Took 
FOREVER to figure that one out.

I adjust and bleed my brakes per Muir.

Seems like our Toyota way back in the early 80's had a bad proportion valve 
in the brakes. Do the 72's have proportioning valves?

Stuck caliper that is forcing you to push extra hard to make up for the 
lack of brakes?

Brake pads in backwards?

Grease on the rotors or drums?

Basically are you loosing the hydrualic pressure due to a ballooning rubber 
brake line or is the pressure restricted due to a bent or pinched metal 
line or is there a grease on the pads?
