> per the Bus Depot website:
Sliding Window, drivers side center (opposite sliding door),
Genuine VW (use 221 845 321A seal) $139.95  56631

 Sliding Window, fits in sliding door, 68-79 bus,
Genuine VW (use 221 845 321A seal) $139.95  56632

 Center Side Window Seal, no Vent Wing or Slider,
no Molding Groove, 68-79 Bus $19.95  221 845 321A

 now, i do notice that it says "no Vent Wing or Slider",
so can anyone clarify this for me? are the sliding window
seals actually NLA?

It is a little misleading if you go directly to the description of the A seal. But if you go to this section:
http://www.busdepot.com/bayseals.htm
and scroll down to 2 on the left side, it lists A twice. Either for slider or no vent.

What I think is strange is West Coast Metrics part number for the no-vent seal. WCM leaves out the middle 3
numbers on almost all the part numbers. So you would think the seal would be a 221 321A.... No, they show 221
321C. Not sure where the C comes from.... Only the A shows up in ETKA.
