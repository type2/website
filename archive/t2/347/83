Subject: Darn it, blinkers still not working.  Help?

Hi all:

I've been trying to get my blinkers working right and not having any luck.
Here's the situation.

Right turn signals work, blinking at "regular" speed.
Left turn signals work, blinking at "fast" speed.
Emergency flashers don't work.  Green turn signal indicator light in dash
comes on steady, external lights stay off, red emergency flasher light (in
the switch itself) doesn't light.

Here's what I've tried:

New bulbs front and rear.  No change.
Removed and reinstalled all the ground clips to the left and above the fuse
panel, removed and reinstalled the flasher unit, removed and reinstalled the
ground clip in the steering column.  No change.
Switched emergency flasher switch from one vehicle to the other.  No change.

I'm not good enough at reading wiring diagrams to really be able to figure
out what's going on here.  I suppose I could also swap flasher units from
one vehicle to the other, but I don't think that's really an issue.

Anybody have any other thoughts about what's at fault here?

TIA.
