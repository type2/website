Terry, I market a quality line of CA (cyanoacrylate) glues made by Bob Smith
Industries out in California.  A large number of hobby shops carry their
glue and epoxy lines.

BSI markets a product called "Un-Cure" for dissolving cured CA glues.  It's
not acetone-based that I can tell, though it still affects paint and some
plastics.  You'd need to test it on a non-visible piece of the seat fabric
before trying it on the glue spots.

It's also happens to be better at ungluing fingers without eating skin than
acetone is. :O)
