You just made my day.  No, my week.   It's so rare that people take the
trouble to comment when they get good service!

Over the course of the last 6-8 months we've made a real push toward
speedier service.  We're still quoting the standard 7-10 working days
for delivery just in case we have a crazy week, but we rarely need that
long nowadays. When I left the shop at 6 today, orders were getting
packed within half an hour of when they were taken.  And Cheri had all
of the day's email answered by 4.  Things still bog down a big on
Mondays (when there's a weekend's worth of orders and email waiting), or
when a big truckload comes in and has to be unloaded, but as a rule
we're shipping twice as fast as we did a year ago. 

The folks at the shop deserve all the credit, and will be glad to learn
that their extra effort has been noticed.  A copy of your email is
getting posted on the wall at the shop first thing Monday!
