Looking thru the adjustment hole, visualise each adjustment star
going clockwise towards the center (between each hole) to ad-

Passenger/left brake:
Front adjuster goes top to bottom.
Rear adjuster goes bottom to top.

Driver/left brake:
Front adjuster goes bottom to top.
Rear adjuster goes top to bottom.
