Subject: on the road...... loose head bolts..... advice, help please!!

My 78 is experiencing fits of depression this morning,
number one cylinder appears to be low on compression.
When cranking whithout ignition I can hear air
escaping rapidly from cylinder number one. I
 have limited tools right now but I was able to apply
a wrench to one of the head bolts which was in fact
slightly less tight than I thought it should have
been. I'm currently en-route to south carolina from
new york, any help or advice is very much welcome. I'm
on I-84 near port jervice.
