Subject: RE: [T2] List Policies and Sliding door question

I'm having the same problem. I can't tell if the back latch is not
releasing or just not popping out after releasing.

BUS CONTENT:  What is the part that kicks the back of the sliding door
out
when the handle is pushed down?  My sliding door doesn't pop out and I
have
to grab it and pull it out.  After looking at it I can't see what it is
that
kicks the door out on its own.
