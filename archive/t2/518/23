Hey Gang:

thanks to all the help and encouragement form the folks on the List, 
Leisl, my 78 Westy passed Smog and is ON THE ROAD!   I get my bus and 
my 19-year old gets the car to drive to college in the Fall!

IT took a year and a half but it HAPPENED!

Thanks guys!  Now on to Buses by the Bay!

BEN
