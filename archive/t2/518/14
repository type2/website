Subject: exhaust head studs

Does anyone know the size helicoil I would need to replace the stock size
exhaust manifold studs.  The part that the heater boxes connect to on a T4
engine.  And even better where I could purchase it....Mine is stripped out and
I need to redrill and install the helicoil.

Thanks in adcance,
Snoopy
