Subject: Chili Recipe

Listees,
    I had been to Everybus a couple of years ago and participated in chili
cookoff. I didn't win, but had fun tasting everyones chili.
    Now my church is having a chili cookoff and I would love to get some
award winning recipes to try.
    Feel free to pmail me.
Thanks,
Jim
