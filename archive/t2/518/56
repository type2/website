Subject: Sold my bus

I sold my 71 transporter Saturday morning.  A fellow saw it and followed me 
home and offered me cash for it.  I still have my 70 bug and 70 Ghia vert 
(under construction) so I am not leaving the airicooled scene.  Thanks to everyone 
who has given me good advice and taught me about busses.
