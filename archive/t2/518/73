Subject: '68 bus dash qs

Hello there,

I just joined the list, I have a '68 bus which I picked up in really bad shape
and that I am patiently bringing to its original state.
This is a question regarding the front dash. I have been to a junkyard just
yesterday and he is willing to give me one in really good shape for a fair
price ($30). I wonder how I can replace the one which I have now (which shows
consistent damage on the passenger side). Is it just a matter of unscrewing
the thing and get it off or should I have particular concern for wiring or
speedometer cables??
In short, what's the quickest and safest way to do the thing?
Thanks
Jacopo
