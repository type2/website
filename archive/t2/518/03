Subject: Looking for a FI Mechanic in Los Angeles area

Hi all,

I've got an older friend that has a 79 westy that isn't running quite 
right.  He asked me about someone to check it out the other night at a 
music gig.  I haven't seen it so I'm unsure of the true symptoms, but I 
believe it isn't idling correctly so it may be a vacuum leak or 
misadjusted AFM?  I'm not feeling confident enough on fuel injection to 
volunteer my services on someone else's rig, let alone his baby.  He 
lives in Simi Valley.

Can anyone recommend someone that is knowledgeable on FI versions of our 
busses in the Los Angeles area?  The way he talks about it, he's not 
afraid to pay the money for a top of the line shop.  I do all my own 
work (all type I engines) and don't have a clue who to recommend on this.

If you're interested in taking this on yourself (it may be minor), 
please contact me and I'll hook you two up.  I think you'll like him.  
He's a retired actor and a cowboy musician and a very nice guy.

Thanks in advance for any leads or volunteers.
