The ENTIRE episode takes place in a bay window Bus. The two of them get
stuck in the snow, and they spend the entire show talking inside the Bus.
It's her Bus apparently, and she's has the floor all done up with shag

It completes the stereotype...Her father being balding and ponytailed;
somewhat addled (or stoned, your choice), politically leftish and still
blaming most things on the Nixon administration and other conspira-
