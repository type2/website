I have the rear hatch seals from Ron as well. But, I have to put them in. 
On a related note, what do people use for adhesive to install the seals? I 
have tried the "weatherstrip adhesive" that comes from 3M and some others. 
They all seem to be a type of contact cement. They all seem to leave a 
yellow residue, will stick to everything but the inside of the groove, are 
impossible to adjust once installed and stick all over my fingers, any 
tools, dirt, etc.

Are there other adhesives like rubber cement or something else with a 
longer cure time so I could install the seal dry, clamp it into place with 
some clamps to get it all aligned, then pick up a small section at a time 
and run a bead of adhesive under it? I usually dont have anyone else to 
provide extra hands, so clamps are my friends. Things I have considered are 
rubber cement, adhesive silicone caulk, and gorilla glue (for woodworking, 
but dries waterproof).

Are there alternatives to the weatherstrip adhesive, or am I just doing it 
all wrong?
