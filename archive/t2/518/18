Subject: Wurth Exhaust paste

Does any of our fine listee venders carry Wurth Exhaust paste?  I did a google
for it and can't get it ordered and delivered for under $20 for one tube.
Last time I ordered it,someone came back on the list saying someplace had it
cheaper but I can't find it in the archives.  Any ideas....
I am in South Carolina, USA.

Thanks in advance,
Snoopy
