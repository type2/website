that's a good tip. i have been sick with the eugene crud all week, but when
i read your post i got a shirt on, went outside and compared my coupler
with your notes. i had replaced the coupler but not the cage (lazy lameass)
and guess who i found under the bus: lou c. cage. replaced cage, test
drove, found crispy crunching shifting. you da man. who let the dogs out
