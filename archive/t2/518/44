Subject: Shifter Coupling Failure

This message is being sent primarily to plant a seed in the archive for 
future reference.

Just got my bus back from the shop last Thursday after having a NW 
Connecting Rod rebuilt 2.0 engine installed.  This was a big decision for 
us; install an expense rebuilt engine or push the bus off a cliff.  I 
finally convinced my wife that the bus was part of the family and the engine 
replacement will allow us to enjoy the bus for many more years.

Anyway, driving home from the shop, the gear shift lever seemed looser than 
before, but I was able to get all gears.  The next day while driving the 
kids around, 3rd and 4th disappeared.  Did a little digging thru the Bentley 
and the type2 archive and determined that the shift linkage needs inspection 
and maybe the gear lever needs adjustment (since the shop also replaced the 
motor mounts).

The archived messages advised to check the shifter coupling, the set screws, 
and the front shift rod bushing.  If those items are OK, maybe it's the 
"hockey stick bearing" in the trans.

Checked the shift coupling - it looked OK (rubber was OK, etc.).  The set 
screws were all tight (my bus had factory installed hex-head set screws with 
no lock wire).  Checked the front shift rod bushing and found that the 
bushing was gone. So I drove the bus to Bow Wow (in 2nd gear all the way) 
and bought a new front rod bushing for $5.  After replacing the bushing, not 
only did I not have 3rd or 4th, now I also lost R.

Re-checked the shift coupling while my wife shifted thru the pattern and 
noticed something odd.  The shift coupling "cage" followed the rear shift 
rod exactly, but the set screw on the aft part of the coupling "sleeve" that 
mates with the trans did not move.  It appears that the sleeve has worked 
its way loose of the coupling cage.  This is a failure mode that I didn't 
find in the archives.

Moral of the story:  If you experience shifting problems (gears mysteriously 
disappearing), replace the cheap parts up front (front rod bushing, rear rod 
shifter coupling, gear lever adjustment, etc.) before even thinking that 
there is anything wrong with the trans.

Also, don't tell your wife about the latest bus problem.
