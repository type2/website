Yes, the 4 levers on the 68 to 72 bus have a hollow nylon pin that hold them in place. A major PITA to remove
and reinstall with the cluster in place.
But.... 73 was the last year to use that style of lever, 74 and are all plastic and slide on the metal.
If you can find 2 73 parts buses.... easy for me to say.... then you want to grab the lever retainers out of
them. You need more than one 73, because the 73 uses 2 reds and 1 blue so you will need the 4th retainer.
These retainers make the levers removable as easy as the 74-79 levers.
Another thing different about the 73 levers: the red ones have a raised rib on them like 74+. 72 and back are
smooth like the blue ones. I guess VW did this for the vision impaired drivers? Like braille on the drive-up
bank ATM.......
If anyone needs a visual aid on the lever retainers, let me know and I can take pics of them.
Maybe Richard can put them on his website?
