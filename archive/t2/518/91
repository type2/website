Subject: Standard Interiors...

Another interior question, this one about the standard model...

I have seen some with the middle seat facing the front, and some with the
middle seat facing the sliding door against the drivers side wall.  Is the
seat adjustable or is that a different option?

For my next bus, I'd like to get a non-camper with a sun roof.  Are those
sun roof's a PITA? (pain in the arse).
