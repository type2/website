Subject: Re: [T2] '69 and a '71 bus comparison !

Does anyone know if the front beam of a '71 will fit into a '68?  Is there
room for the servo?  I'm figuring it would probably be more trouble than
it's worth, but one never knows... it's incredible the ways people can screw
up these things (err... I mean busses...)

Have a good one,
