Some tips:

Buy a big pot (lobster sized), get some TSP, mix it up and boil it on 
the stove. Toss all the tin in there you can and boil it for ten 
minutes or so. Rinse and dry immediately. Clean up the remaining rust 
with 150 wet-or-dry, then 220, then 320. If any rust remains, prime 
with rusty metal primer (Rustoleum). Otherwise, ordinary primer is good 
enough. Paint with ordinary rattle-can paint.

Then bake it. If you are single, bake it in your oven at about 250 
degrees for a couple of hours. If you are married, go online and do a 
google search for solar ovens. You can make a simple solar oven from a 
cardboard box, some aluminum foil, and a big baggie that'll do a great 
job of baking the paint. Only thing is, the baggie has to be vented.
