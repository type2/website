I've lost count of how many people have said exactly that, usually when
getting out of their Chrysler minivan...

Every bus has 1-year-only items of one sort or another!

The '71 has a number of 1-year and 2-year parts.  The front engine tin is
1-year-only (only year for the doghouse cooler in a bus) and the front
spindles, calipers, discs, etc are 2-year only ('71-'72)

I like my '71, but there is no "best year"
