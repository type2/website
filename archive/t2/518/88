Subject: Door seal adhesive

I missed part of the thread on door seals the other day but I want to throw
this in. I didn't find it necessary to use adhesive on the entire door seal
because the channel holds the seal in pretty snugly over most of the
perimeter. The last time I installed a door seal, I put the whole thing in and
got it positioned the way I wanted it (no clamps were required). Then I went
back and pulled out the parts I wanted to use adhesive on. I only glued the
lower front portion where there is no channel and the upper rear corner area.
It's been like this for over 5 years now and the channel is still holding the
unglued part very snugly.

This is for a '71 now, so I don't know if the channels/seals are the same for
other years.

As far as getting glue on everything,  some latex gloves (POR15 sells good
ones) will keep it off of the hands, and 3M sells a "General Purpose Adhesive
Cleaner" (part# 051135-08984) which will remove even the Super Weatherstrip
Adhesive from metal.  Also, most hardware stores sell products like "Oops All
Purpose Remover" which might be a cheaper alternative.
