Subject: painting engine tin

Hey guys,

        Another quick question. The engine tin that I have is a little
rusty, and doesn't look all that great. Is there a particular paint I can
use? Or can I just use regular black engine block hi-temp paint? 

Also, for the heat exchanger holes in the tin, is there some sort of an
aluminum plug I can just stick in place?


Thanks!

Todd
