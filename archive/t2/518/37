Subject: VWs and Politics

I'd just like to point out, that not everyone here blindly agrees with
what you believe in. Sometimes when I'm at a bar with a bunch of people,
after work, I'll mention that I'm a Republican, and they'll say.. "You're
a Republican?!?!" As if it's some insane shock and that I'm a horrible
person. 

News flash.. there are LOTS of people on here, that are Democrats,
Republicans, and even Green, Independants, and NPAs. With that being
said, we are the way we are because of what we believe in. Sending out
political e-mails on the VW list isn't going to change anyone's opinion.
So, I'm going to refrain from e-mailing out political propoganda, and I'd
hope the rest of you do the same.  

On a similar note, I've never watched the TV show Dharma and Greg
before... but my TiVo happened to record it so I thought I'd watch it.
The ENTIRE episode takes place in a bay window Bus. The two of them get
stuck in the snow, and they spend the entire show talking inside the Bus.
It's her Bus apparently, and she's has the floor all done up with shag
carpet. Pretty cool!
