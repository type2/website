With the engine tight vacuum should be high.

That should cause it to stall. Vacuum should be 16-18".

Install the brake booster valve I gave you...

It was no more than 3 gallons. I watched the gas come out: it was clean but
two months old. You drove home 40 miles without incident...plus the filter
would show any blockage before the pump got contaminated. I'd feel
uncomfortable draining a bus gas tank and pouring the contents into another
bus if I had not POR-15's the tank and made it better than new.

The other car didn't even burp on the 4-5 gallons of that same old gas. I
even fired up the motorcycle and dumped 2 gallons of 6 month old gas into
the other car. It didn't care. The Chevron site says gas is good for a year.

It sounds like something is clogging the tank outlet.
