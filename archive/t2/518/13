Subject: Re: [T2] Subject: Kerry drove a VW

Since my error wasn't obvious, apparently, I'll
post a slightly longer retraction.  Note the
article is about Senator BOB Kerry from Kansas, a
Navy SEAL, and not Senator JOHN Kerry, from Mass
obviously, a Navy SEAL boat driver.  There is no
reason to think that John Kerry took part in
anything unethical.  

Comments withdrawn completely.  

Desparately attempting to change the subject:  I
hear that loaf buses with split window kits are
the new rage. Or... anybody know anything about
aircooled engines?  I hear they don't have
radiators....  Tires?  Distributors?  Type IV vs.
Type II?
