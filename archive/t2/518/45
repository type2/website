Not really. I let it dry like they say. But, then you have glue in the 
channel and glue on the seal. When you try to push the seal into the 
channel it grabs the glue on the edges of the channel, holds on tight and 
you never really get the seal down firmly in the bottom of the channel. Of 
course, if you are accidentally stretching or compressing the seal even a 
little bit you end up with a bulge somewhere in the door perimeter and 
can't adjust the fit to get it to match. Make a mistake and your $80 seal 
is toast.

Maybe the non-SUPER stuff is the trick. There are millions of good 
adhesives out there, many of the last a long time in extreme weather 
conditions. Why should this stuff be so hard to use?
