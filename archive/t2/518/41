Subject: 71 Westy for sale

Volks,
I need to sell my 71 Westy. The bus is in great shape, very little rust, the 
interior is all there, including the child's cot. Everything works. The engine 
was rebuilt by an experience VW mechanic about 2000 miles ago. Lots of extra 
parts, including an extra transmission.  The only thing it needs is new tires. 
I'm only selling because I live in military housing and can only have 3 
vehicles (I have 4 now). Asking price is $3000. I live at Fort Belvoir in northern 
Virginia, 15 miles fron D.C. 

Vic
