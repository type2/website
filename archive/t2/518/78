Sigh, I need more hours in the day :-)

I agree.  I didn't think it was the gas, but I wanted to double-check 
after the librarian's comment.  I watched that gas come out and go in, 
and it looked clean to me.

I'm not sure I'm worried about the pump being contaminated so much as 
the pump trying to suck gas through a clogged filter / line.

I agree.  *grumble*  So, what's my best course of action, here?  Drain 
the tank, pull the fuel line, and try to unclog it with a piece of 
wire?
