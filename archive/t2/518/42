> On a related note, what do people use for adhesive to install the seals? I 
 have tried the "weatherstrip adhesive" that comes from 3M and some others. 
 They all seem to be a type of contact cement. They all seem to leave a 
 yellow residue, will stick to everything but the inside of the groove, are 
 impossible to adjust once installed and stick all over my fingers, any 
 tools, dirt, etc.

I do not use the 3M Super Weatherstrip Adhesive on any thing. That yellow stuff
is horrible.

I use 3M Weatherstrip Adhesive..... no Super in the name. It is black and lets you 
work moving the seal where you want it to be :)
