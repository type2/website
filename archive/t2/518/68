So, on Sunday, I replaced my filter and pump.  I decided to just go 
ahead and do the pump (new Bosch unit from Bus Depot), because the old 
one was really howling, and I didn't particularly want to crawl under 
there and do it twice in case the filter didn't do the trick.  The 
filter is the white square "Made in Israel" filter from Bus Boys.

Fired up the Bus, to run it for a few minutes so I could check for 
leaks.  Pump made a nice quiet "whirrrr" for about 30 seconds, then 
started making a noise similar to the old pump :-( (although not NEARLY 
as bad...)

Now I'm a little worried that I do, in fact, have a clogged line 
between the tank and the filter (how aggravating -- I just replaced the 
lines back in August).

I have not tested the fuel pressure yet -- I ran out of time on Sunday, 
and out of daylight today.

The new filter/pump has made some difference, though.  When I mentioned 
about the stalling-at-stop-signs problem I described before to Marco (-at-) 
Buslab, he enriched the mixture a bit and asked me to give that a 
whirl.  Didn't seem to make much of a difference, but with the new 
filter/pump, the engine is now definitely running rich.

Unfortunately, I still can't get the RPMs up beyond 850 or so when I 
back out the idle air screw.  When revving, I did have the engine stall 
once while returning to idle.

I hooked up a vacuum gauge and measured 12'', but this engine doesn't 
even have 300 miles on it yet, and I thought low vacuum is normal when 
your engine is still breaking in.  For kicks, I pulled the gauge off 
with the engine still running, and the resulting vacuum leak did not 
seem to affect the running of the engine in the slightest.  Putting the 
vacuum cap back on the tee didn't change it, either.  Now I'm wondering 
if I have a vacuum leak ... there are new hoses all around, except for 
the brake booster.  I suppose I should pull that off the Y fitting, cap 
off the Y, and check vacuum again.

Hm.  "Sat for how long?"  When I was over at Richard's place helping 
him drop his engine, we needed some place to put the fuel that was 
drained from his tank.  We had a little left after filling up his 
wife's car, and so we dumped the rest into my tank.  I know he hadn't 
been doing much driving of his Bus ever since his clutch started 
slipping... but his best guess at the time was that the gas was maybe 2 
months old?  Anyway, it couldn't have been more than 3 or 4 gallons 
that we transfered into my half-full tank, and afterward, I topped it 
off with 89.
