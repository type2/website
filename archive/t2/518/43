Yo Karl--

The std. stuff comes only in Black---your right--

The Super stuff --you have a choice--

Yellar, and Black--

Either way--it'll get on your finger's if ya don't use the stuff right--

( I think it's part of the deal to get some stuck on your finger's-- )

In my experience the super stuff seems to bond better and hold longer--
some manual dexterity is a must here to avoid a big mess--:>/

I do not use the 3M Super Weatherstrip Adhesive on any thing. That
yellow stuff is horrible.
I use 3M Weatherstrip Adhesive..... no Super in the name. It is black
and lets you work moving the seal where you want it to be :)
