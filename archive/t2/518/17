Subject: Vanagon stalls after acceleration

Howdy y'all,
I was driving in pot-hole ridden Seattle yesterday and after running over one
of these craters, my engine within seconds began to die after releasing the
acceleration. I checked the engine compartment and could not find anything
dislodged.
My timing, dwell, and idle were still right on the money. Which makes think
that it's a fuel problem. Has anyone ever experienced this before, and where
should I focus on the troubleshooting?
Oh yeah,, I highly recommend everyone getting a AAA Plus card, or equivalent.
It saved me hundreds of dinero to have it towed back home. I talked to the tow
driver and he said AAA members get 4 tows a year, and the 5th tow would cost
less if you call a regular tow truck. Just F.Y.I.
One tow pays off the AAA membership and most likely will also save you a lot
of money.
Thanks in advance for any advice.

P.S. Does anybody know of any good VW surgeons in Southern Oregon?
