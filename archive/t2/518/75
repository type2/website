Subject: Fuel line plug

Hi All,
Let me add my 2 cents on this one.  For plugging the fuel line when
working on my bus I like to use a golf tee.  I don't know the first
thing about golf, so I have to beg, borrow or buy them.  Since I only
need a couple of them I've always done the beg or borrow thing.
