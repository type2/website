Tony,

Can we divide the choice into two classes?

Campers and standard?  Since I haven't been in a camper in quite awhile...

I surely do like my 78 Champagne edition just like it is...although
I really might like a little more subtle interior.

I can't think of anything that it is lacking in terms of improvements
over earlier years...wups! 

except it has earlier model heater boxes and exhaust...that is a definite 
plus!...sliding side windows, so no window rust.  Waste heat dumps
on the heater box flappers so that you don't fry your starter from the
waste heat.  


Cheers, dave
