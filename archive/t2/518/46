Subject: Injector cleaning

WRT the recent topic, I had my fuel injectors cleaned and tested. I really
didn't know what to expect since they spent 11 years sitting idle and I had
that problem with the sludge in the gas tank but I felt the bus drove well
and had a fair amount of pickup for a 2L engine despite the varnish I saw in
the fuel lines.

I thought I'd share the report. Basically, Bosch originally provided a well
matched set, the o-ring inside one injector failed and it seems no amount of
FI cleaner could restore the spray pattern compared to having them
professionally cleaned.

I haven't driven the bus with them back in yet but if you can't find NOS
injectors at bargain prices cleaning seems like a good deal for $11 each.
