Subject: Re: [T2] painting engine tin

Here's and easy, long lasting, engine tin painting solution--

Cleaning the tin with TSP is a good idea-- using lacquer thinner is a
faster and more thorough cleaner.

Then scratch the metal up with 180--220 paper--you can throw some primer
on the metal if you want--
Then--spray it with Morton's urethane bed liner--

It dries semi gloss--and is bullet proof--
It'll outlast any rattle can paint--and is impervious to heat, oil, and
any further rust--
One can for 7 bucks will do all the engine tin--

A quick easy solution--looks great--

Available at any finer automotive paint supply store--

Later,

Terry

question. The engine tin that I have is a little
rusty, and doesn't look all that great. Is there a particular paint I
can
use? Or can I just use regular black engine block hi-temp paint?
