As a member of many newsgroups and email lists, the policies that this list
has are similar to those of all of the others.  Many don't enforce their
policies and they rapidly degrade into being something totally useless as
you have to wade through tons of other stuff to get to what you are looking
for.

All of us joined this list in order to have an excellent technical resource
for our beloved buses.  Nobody joined this list to find out the political
views of others or whatever other off topic thing could be posted.  We all
care about our buses and let's keep the list that way.

I applaud the list moderators for their work (not trying to kiss up here) as
I'm frustrated with many of the technical lists that I belong to that don't
uphold their policies.  If you want to talk about off topic things go to
other lists.

BUS CONTENT:  What is the part that kicks the back of the sliding door out
when the handle is pushed down?  My sliding door doesn't pop out and I have
to grab it and pull it out.  After looking at it I can't see what it is that
kicks the door out on its own.
