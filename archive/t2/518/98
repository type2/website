> What is the part that kicks the back of the sliding door out when the
handle is pushed down?  My sliding door doesn't pop out and I have to grab
it and pull it out.  After looking at it I can't see what it is that kicks
the door out on its own.

I've administered a number of lists since the middle 90's, and all have had
the same sort of rules that this list has.  And I've been vilified,
victimized, ostracized, cauterized and vasectomized over my administration
of those lists, too.  (Yeah, I'm still a bit sensitive over at least one
incident where the disgruntled list member and friends went on an Internet
rampage to discredit me.  Nasty business.)

"Freedom of speech" doesn't exist for most listservs.  They're privately
owned and administered by individuals who founded them for a particular
purpose.  You either agree to abide by the rules, or you get axed.  Funny
(sad "funny") how many folk just don't get this concept.

BUS CONTENT: There's an internal spring in the widget that holds the door to
the bus on the rear edge.  As I discovered to my pain, it's a mess to get
the mechanism out for maintenance if you can't open the door.  Mine was
frozen shut because the PO's never lubricated this part and the "U" shaped
bar actually froze in the mech.

I had to get it out of the door in spite of the fact that the door wouldn't
open but a few inches.  Then I lubed the heck out of it with WD40 to no
avail, then heated it with a propane torch to get the thing to expand enough
to let the bar go.  Once I got it apart I could see how a little film of
rust had caused the problem.  I discovered the lube hole in the mech, too.
Not sure how to get the lube up and into the hole, but I lubed it up before
I reassembled it.

I used a short piece of 4"x4" to prop the door up until I got the mech back
in.
