Subject: Question regarding Aux. Air Regulator testing

Hi,
I was testing my aux. air valve today. First, I read 30 ohms across the
conncector, GOOD. Second, after warming up the vanagon, I blew through the
hose on the AFM (S tube) side of the air valve hose and I was capable of being
able to blow air through. It seemed to be some resistance, but it wasn't
completely closed like the manuals say they should. So ...I was wondering if
I'm just being too critical and everything is fine...My '80 Vanagon is
stalling almost as soon as the cold start is finished. Acts like it could be
flooding. Pressing on the throttle lever when it begins to putter out seems
like it's flooded. I've done checks on fuel pump and fuel pressure regulator
by moving the AFM lever with ignition on and they both sound like they are
working fine.
I have an appointment this Wednesday with the mechanic. Since taking the holey
EGR filter and it's parts off the engine, it ruined my fuel/air mixture
causing poor idle and performance. So I am having the mechanic check for
vacuum leaks and adjusting the air/fuel mix. Is there anything else that would
be relevant to my problems that I could pass onto the repair list? Thanks in
advance.
