Wellllll.......

Does your muffler have an EGR port on the left end? 

411-412 mufflers do. The drawback to the 411 muffler
is the center-to-center studs for the EGR filter. They
are closer together then on the bay 76-78 EGR filter. 

You would need to find a 411-412 EGR filter and the
411 muffler.
Or get this muffler:
