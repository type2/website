Subject: BD F.A.R.T.s

I've ordered and received dozens and dozens of parts from BD and have 
never had a problem with any of it. The way Ron and his crew pack for 
shipping can be a little weird sometimes, but I've decided that's 
charming.

But: I think the BD website ought to have a warning about the Dansk 
units. It used to, when Ron had some of the German 75-78 heat 
exchangers, although you had to look at that item to get the message 
that the Dansk HEs are inferior. He should also remove the "heavy duty" 
from the description of the Dansk (or "European made") HEs. "Heavy 
duty," I think, borders on false advertising?

Going back to an earlier thread from this week, and based on comments 
from people who have ordered and received the Dansk units, I think 
there is probably no fair price for these. Ron probably needs to get 
the $239 retail price to stock them, but to the buyer the price ought 
to be in the sub-$100 category.

If I understand Ron's business at all, he probably stocks these 
inferior HEs because he doesn't want the hole in his parts list that 
would exist if he didn't stock them. The catalog/website should state, 
however, that most alternatives are more satisfactory, including 
patching/welding badly worn OEM HEs.

None of my information about the replacement HEs is first hand, but it 
comes from credible sources (including Ron himself).

FWIW
