<< True stainless is rather brittle and considering the dissimilar
metals, heat, and vibration this would be a pretty tough task with thin
material. >>

 3 series stainless would be pretty a pretty tough nut to crack, and if
annealed properly would be durable, and crack free.

If you weld it up when it's evenly hot through and through it won't
fail.

Again, it's a time consuming process 

I do cast aluminum, and stainless repair work often.

<<Remember those "stainless" mufflers that turned out to be welded with
mild steel rod and have mild steel internals?>>>

A high nickel content rod / wire will connect  dissimilar metals--no
problem.
And stainless wire for the box would be no challenge.

I'm going to do some thinking on this, and some bench work to see what
the outcome will be.

Interesting concept---
