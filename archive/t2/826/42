They should have been made so the exhaust side is the outside,, and the 
heater tube is the inside.... the way they are now.. heat is robbed from the 
outside of the H.E. by air passing under the bus.
I saw a bus from WI that was fitted that way by the owner's custom 
fabrication. I guess the temps felt in the north give a bus driver 
motivation for innovation if they want to go ice fishing!
