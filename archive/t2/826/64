Hi Mike,

This strikes me as a very good idea. Pulling air from inside the van  
will improve heat through recirculation, and will also reduce the  
interior air pressure slightly, making it that much easier to pump  
warmed air back into the bus. It's a win/win scenario: even if the  
cold air return is only slightly warmer than ambient temp, you still  
improve air-flow.

That said, I haven't done this in my bus yet. If/when I eventually  
get around to it I will probably put the vent in the spare tire well,  
and simply run vinyl dryer ducting over to the squirrel-cage fan.



Happy trails,
