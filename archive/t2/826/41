Subject: need help with the front of my 78

Hi Mike,
         Sorry to read about crunching your 78 :-((  Have you done body work 
before?  It's rather different from mechanical... lots of mess with grinding 
and welding and painting.  Different skills involved.  Do you have a heated 
garage where you can lay-up the 78 for a couple of weeks of spare-time work?

If you have an easy way of posting an image, it would help.  At this point I 
cannot tell if the panel might be re-straightened.  Presumably if you have been 
driving the 78 for 6 months, you should not need a whole new front clip (well, 
that is a bit extreme, but you know what I mean).  Rust is a factor that you 
have not mentioned; ditto the over-all dollar picture including your budget.

Best of luck,
Glenn

Ok, so I got in an accident about half a year ago and dented in the 
front pretty badly.  My mechanic helped pull it out and did some bondo 
work, however, it's leaking and I'm not completely thrilled with the 
repair as it's still kinda pushed in and I'd really like a straighter 
front end.

So, I'm thinking of cutting off the front and putting on a new (better) 
panel.  I wanted to find out what other people think about doing this 
and how hard of a project it is.  Do I have to remove all the dash and 
steering wheel and electrical?  My friend has a bunch of tools and a 
welder and we're pretty descent at welding and wouldn't mind chopping 
off the front of the bus.

The other thing I'm trying to figure out is how to go about getting the 
front panel.  I can buy it new for about 150 bux and then it'll probably 
be another 100 bux or so to ship (guessing).  Or, does anyone have one 
out in the Los Angeles area?  I guess I could also make some visits to 
the junkyard to see what I can find...
