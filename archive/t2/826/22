Subject: Re: [T2] Last of the Aircooled Buses

1.4l water cooled in the bus ? Would I get shot in the head by the
listmembers if I installed a 1.4 watercooled engine in my '71 ? If the
1.4l was giving me more than th 17mpg the 1.6l aircooled gives me, I'd
really think about it. Oh also it would need to have cheap coolant
hoses.

Speed -of course- is an irrelevant topic
