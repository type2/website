Subject: Re: [T2] Heat Exchanger Quality (paint)

I'll second the German quality- I scrounged a Leistritz 
Muffler/heaterboxes combo off a 74 and though showing some rust, were in 
very good shape.  Thanks, Ron for cluing me in to that parts bus. The 
boxes/muffler are on Nyssa's bus now and give great heat.  I suppose I 
should be thinking about stockpiling future replacements?
     Anyone out there weld new boxes over the old cores if they are OK? 
  Also, can the connection trianles be replaces if virtually gone like a 
couple I have?
