Subject: starting/charging problems??

I am looking at a friends 78 federal bus, fuel injected 2 litre engine.  
He's not very experienced with mechanics (not that I'm Mr. Volkswrench :-).  
We thought in needed an alternator.  At rest, the battery put out about 12.3 
volts, and when running at idle around 13.5.  Is that enough to charge the 
battery?  The battery light does not come on in the dash.  He says it mostly 
just doesn't want to start in the cold.  He tries to start it, and he says 
it has to turn over quite allot before it actually catches.  So we were 
thinking maybe it was just all the cranking that was wearing the battery 
down, and not an alternator problem??  I found the little blue electrical 
connector to the... I think the cold idle jet, on the intake manifold was 
loose and didn't have the wire clip to hold it on.  Could that be all it 
was?  Maybe a fuel delivery issue of some kind???  It runs pretty well once 
it's started.

Can you give me a list of things to check or repair or try??

Thanks,
Jaybird
