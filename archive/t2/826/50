Hey Terry,
      Yeah, sounds like a great idea, just wrap the HEs.  Years ago I scrapped 
a Type 2 for body rust reasons; the Chicago owner had covered the HEs with a 
kind of asbestos blanketing.  Seemed a great concept, except (human safety 
considerations apart) the asbestos absorbed the water loaded with road salt, 
and the HEs were toast, to say it with a  bit of humor ;-))

<< heat is robbed from the outside of the H.E. by air passing under the
bus.>>

Right... And a real simple solution to this phenomena would be to wrap them up 
to keep them insulated to retain the heat.
