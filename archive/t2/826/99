Gary,

I brought my bus from Victoria to Austin. I had to do the following:

- legally import vehicle by taking form HS-7 to US Customs at Austin Bergstrom airport (lower level). Check box #1 only.

- make appointment with Austin PD for a home visit where they will inspect the VINs and perform a stolen vehicle search

- take all paperwork (customs, PD, title) to county tax assessor to acquire new title and registration

I owned the Canadian title before the transfer. I'm not sure what extra difficulties you will have.
