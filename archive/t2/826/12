The 72-74 filter has to bolt to the dual carb intake. (I think it should read 73-74 because I don't think 72 models had EGR).

The 75-78 filter connects to a pipe through the tin that runs to the throttle body.

I think you'll have to make modifications if you have an FI bus with a 72-74 exhaust setup. I'm not sure where the 73-74 filter breaches the engine tin.
