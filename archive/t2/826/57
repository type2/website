Subject: Re: [T2] hot air tube under the bus

<<I thought I would take off the long hot air tube that runs 3 or 4 feet
long under the bus and insulate it. The tube is pretty much shot and
needs replacing. Does I need to use some special tubing designed for
such applications>>

 I have heard/ seen guys use PVC tubing which  think would be the hot
set up---
