Subject: Oil Pressure T piece ..

After the Triumph I had with the clutch adjustment I am now attempting to
fit an Oil pressure guage ..

This one in Fact ...

It might not work for you .. item 8017895695

Now I'm not sure if that sensor will fit into the tapped hole where the oil
light sensor is now ..

What I would really like is a T piece , Does anyone know what size the
tapped hole is and if a tpiece will fit ?
