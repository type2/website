with that pump installed?

I would, but remember that airplanes either have gravity feed or a
mechanical pump.  The electric pump is a backup and only runs for short
periods.  It is tested every flight with a fuel pressure guage.

Years ago I had a Facet pump, ran it for years, and it was still working
well when I sold the vehicle.  Considering the simple nature of these
pumps, I wonder what causes them to fail?  Is it something VW-related?
