WOW.  I got some double-wall metal tube at my local loathes errr lowes 
that i put in place this morning.  What a big difference in the amount 
of air as well as the temperature.

I already had the foil covered bubble wrap stuff, so a couple of layers 
of that went on as well.  Aside from being a little discouraged about 
the condition of the right side of the heat delivery system I've very 
pleased with the results.  I got a very good look at things and the good 
news is that the HE is in pretty darned good shape.  The bad is that 
everything pretty much north of it to where it hits the asbestos covered 
Y connector that my new tube connects to is loooooose and rusty.

I'll be covering that hole with a little leftover bit of metal from the 
double-wall tube and some JB Weld later today.  It's about the size of a 
half dollar.  I'd bet that much of the hot air from the right side is 
escaping there.

Anyway once again thanks to all for the direction.
