13.5v is good, I'll bet it's the cold start injector.
It get's the temp from "a" water temp sender,=20
goes thru a time delay thingee (as I recall) and=20
that fires the 5th injector (for a short squirt-=20
that's what the time delay thingee is for) into=20
the intake. This gives the motor the gas it needs=20
to get started when it's cold outside (like 40=BA).
Just had a friend go thru this with his '80.
