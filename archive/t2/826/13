Subject: Re: [T2] Electric fuel pump with stock dual carbs??? 

here's my input, hope it helps

The squarish gold "Facet" (purolator, etc) pumps ARE JUNK. I have had to
walk many miles on 3 separate occasions before I learned to not trust them.

And webers will not work properly if you have more then 3.5psi. So you best
measure the output of the pump, because if it puts out 4psi you'll have
tuning difficulty (and most try to change jets, which is not the problem,
it's the excessive fuel pressure that is the problem).

A good electric pump is $70, it will work, be reliable, and will be self
regulated to the psi range I specified.
