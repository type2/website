<<Yes, but I don't want to have to re-adjust the torsion bars after I

Torsion Bar's?

I thought you guys were talking about D-8 Cat heater boxes---

Good one George---   ~: )

What about stainless heat exchanger's?

Now I'm really thinking----

Thin wall, light weight, no corrosion, no rust, no failure.

The only problem is with these units is; you will be needing a torsion
bar adjustment when you leave the bank from making the withdrawal---

I'll work on this concept before ole Ronnie copies another one of my
idea's.


Adios,
