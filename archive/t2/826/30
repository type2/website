Subject: Re: Electric fuel pump with stock dual carbs??? Possible???

Hello John,

I unfortunately have the famous gold pump. I had to add a regulator at the 
output.  I wish I new better at the time.  It is also super loud. Do you have 
some pump manufacture suggestions?  By the way, I got my dual carb setup from 
you guys. They're great.
Thanks

And webers will not work properly if you have more then 3.5psi. So you best
measure the output of the pump, because if it puts out 4psi you'll have
tuning difficulty (and most try to change jets, which is not the problem,
it's the excessive fuel pressure that is the problem).

A good electric pump is $70, it will work, be reliable, and will be self
regulated to the psi range I specified.
