Subject: Re: [T2] Electric fuel pumps

hey guys    All I see on here is everybody bashing these pumps. I have used 
them for years and have never seen one fail.  I have one on my 67 bug that has 
been there for 16 years ,  my 59 panel with the 1904cc duall 40 dells has been 
running for 6 years   no problems .   Maybe I am  just lucky , as for being 
loud I mount mine on the rubber blocks that held rabbit radiators in and when 
done so you cant even hear them.   I have also noticed that all that say these 
pumps are jumk are the same who praise the pertronix ingitions  which I think 
are pure junk . I use the Crane units of which I have only seen one fail 
caused by a shorted out tach and have seen a bunch of the pertronixs fail.   Now 
mine you I do carry in my travel bag a dizzy and another electric pump but 
havent had to use either . Just my $.02  but best of luck to all and use what you 
want.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
