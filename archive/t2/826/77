Subject: Re: [T2] starting/charging problems??

     Thanks to all who replied.  It turns out I just had to go back to 
basics.  It was at least %90 due to bad points.  We browsed the FI manual 
(thanks Benthin!), tested the cold start valve and temp sensor.  It still 
didn't seem to want to start at all.  It had nice fat sparks from the coil 
but the sparks at the plug wires looked a little weak.  I replaced the 
points and it started right up.  Double checked dwell, timing, and idle 
speed and now everything seems pretty good!
