Hi folks,

	With all the post about heat exchangers and hot air tubes lately, it
seems to me to be just about the right time for my yearly poem post.  For
those of you who are new to the list or for those who are having a "senior
moment" the following is a poem I wrote a number of years ago.  I offer it
up as humor for your enjoyment.

Winter in a VW Bus

Not a month before Christmas
and all cross the land,
bus owners are driving
with ice scrapers in hand.

They're scraping without
and they're scraping within,
to see where they're going
and where they've just been.

With a little warm air
that passes for heat,
we lose feeling in our fingers
our ears and our feet

So we put on our hats 
our gloves and more sox,
endure the cold weather
in our German icebox.

Winter is long 
and it's cold and it's dark,
but these buses we drive 
have a place in our heart

Without a complaint
or hardly a care,
we wait for warm weather
summer to bear.
