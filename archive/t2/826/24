Subject: Re: [T2] Electric fuel pumps

I'm seriously considering the Carter 4070 rotary  pump available from Summit Racing for $60.  I had to buy an  A**zone pump (lifetime warranty, yeah right) on a Sunday last  time.  When it goes belly up I'm springing for the Carter.   They've been making them for years and are popular with racers.   Here's a link:
  
  Well, for some reason it's not working.  Go to Summitracing.com and search for Carter 4070.  Cheers...KR


    After reading the "notes" today, I am confused as to what the best electric 
fuel pump is to use on my '74 Westy with twin Dellortos, all the other "work 
" has been done, and as far as pressure could I not use a fuel pressure 
setting device between the carbs and pump?  I have a new "square" purolator, 
but if they are junk, need new input. Thanks
Sid
