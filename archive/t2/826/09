Subject: Electric fuel pump with stock dual carbs??? Possible???

Howdy All,
I have a 72 bus with a 1700 engine I am working on. 
It currently has a weber progressive carb on it but I
am rebuilding a set of stock dual carbs to replace the
Weber.  What I want to know is:  Will the aftermarket
universal electric fuel pump (it is rated to give 3-4
psi of pressure) work with the stock dual carbs?? If
so, is it as easy as putting a "T" in the fuel line to
supply both sides??

Peace, John Baker
