Subject: Re: [T2] Heat Exchanger "wrapping"

<<I wonder if a "nearly intact" heat exzchanger can be wrapped with
layers of fiberglass dipped in a heat resistant (400 deg) epoxy? That
would never rust......I once did this on a much smaller scale with a
flapper box. >>

What the hay---why not?

The only long distance problem that I can think of is that sooner or
later Mike, the epoxy will dry out and crack pretty easy from the
repeated heat.

I was thinking about plain old fiberglass resin mixed into the
matting--same theory, but I think that after awhile if would chip, fade,
peel and crack too.

I'm still thinking that high temp PVC handles steam why not engine heat?

I need to talk to my pipe fitter buddy---he'll lay the truth and nothing
but the truth on me--

How not aluminum tubing?

I'm thinking pipe fitter--they used aluminium tubing to cool down the
reactor's at the power plant jobs he worked on-- 

Why not for the heat duct on a Bus??

It won't rot that's for sure--
