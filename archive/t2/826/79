Subject: Re: Electric fuel pump with stock dual carbs??? Possible???

Without Guesswork says that the stock mechanical pump has 5 PSI, max
delivery capacity 400 ccm/min (-at-) 3800 RPM. This is for a stock dual Solex
type 4 engine.

The requirements are closer to 5 psi. At some RPM the pump would seem
inadequate.
