I take exception to your characterization that old air
cooled VW bus owners are 60`s hippies.
     
Some of us in the antique VW Bus world are amused at
your outlook on the air-cooled VW Busses.  Both at
your opinion of the bus, as well as your bus owner
stereotype.  I'm 52, active, drive 3 cars, and bear no
resemblance to your 60`s hippy profile.  I am a member
of 4 different VW clubs, and find very few members in
those clubs who resemble 60's hippies.  I own and
drive a Volvo, a Porsche, and a 1978 VW Camper bus. 
The Volvo and Porsche are fun to drive.  But the bus
has attributes unavailable from any other vehicle
manufacturer.  Even after decades of production, no
other vehicle manufacturer in the world has been able
to approach the usefulness, practicality, and charm of
the VW Type twos.  Well, except Winnebago Fleetwood,
Monaco, Country Coach et cetera.  But they are huge
and costly--an entirely different class of vehicle. 
Further, Dailmer Chrysler claims they invented the
mini-van.  I see that statement as a delusion, and as
mis-informed as your assertion VW bus owners like me
are 60s hippies.  Yes, our vehicles had reduced power,
and were not point-and-shoot as the modern overpowered
nimble electronic monsters which are produced today. 
I own two of those monsters.  But for down-home
relaxation, I choose the old technology VW Bus.
    
I wonder why VW of Brazil was making air cooled busses
continuously from the fifties through 2005?
