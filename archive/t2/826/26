 Does your muffler have an EGR port on the left end? 
 You would need to find a 411-412 EGR filter and the
 411 muffler.
 Or get this muffler:

Yes - I have the EGR port on the left - and that's the
very same muffler I bought, from BD :-)  So am I
correct in my understanding that the bottom pipe on
the 411-412 EGR filter is 3" longer than the one on
the '78 VW filter? the vw filter lines up with the
muffler port perfectly; it's just too short.

Is there a specific year for the 411/412 filter I
should look for, or are they all the same?

Thanks!
