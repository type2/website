Good idea, but more than a notion to engineer.  True stainless is rather
brittle and considering the dissimlar metals, heat, and vibration this
would be a pretty tough task with thin material.

Not to say that it can't be done, but I'd hate to put a lot
of effort into it and then find that my nice rust-free heat exchangers are
developing lots of cracks.

Remember those "stainless" mufflers that turned out to be welded with mild
steel rod and have mild steel internals?  They sure looked pretty while
they rusted out inside!
