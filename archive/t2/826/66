   I mounted a Blazer three speed fan in the spare tire well of a 71
and capped off the engine fan at the doghouse. I used flexible
(some sort of composite aluminum/fabric) hose to recycle the
cabin air thru' the HE's...After ten minutes or so the Bus got
heat...After driving for a bit, eventually the heater ducts were
putting out HOT air...;-) The only drawback was the thing was
noisy as hell...But that's what radios are for...
