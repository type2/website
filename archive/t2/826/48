Subject: Re: [T2] Electric fuel pumps

Boy, you have been lucky.  I don't have a  Petronix ignition.  Standard 009 that seems to work great.   Maybe I need a spare, I don't know.  It's worked fine since I  bought it 6 years ago.  Changed points a couple of times.   But I've been through fuel pumps.  The other day, I ran a heavier  ground wire directly to the battery ground.  I originally had it  grounded to one of the bolts that holds the voltage regulator to the  firewall.  I'm thinking that may have been a problem.  This  A**Zone unit (lifetime warranty, ugh) is much quieter than any I've  used.  I'm anxious to see how long it lasts.  Only bought it  because it was a Sunday.  Cheers...KR

them for years and have never seen one fail.  I have one on my 67 bug that has 
been there for 16 years ,  my 59 panel with the 1904cc duall 40 dells has been 
running for 6 years   no problems .   Maybe I am  just lucky , as for being 
loud I mount mine on the rubber blocks that held rabbit radiators in and when 
done so you cant even hear them.   I have also noticed that all that say these 
pumps are jumk are the same who praise the pertronix ingitions  which I think 
are pure junk . I use the Crane units of which I have only seen one fail 
caused by a shorted out tach and have seen a bunch of the pertronixs fail.   Now 
mine you I do carry in my travel bag a dizzy and another electric pump but 
havent had to use either . Just my $.02  but best of luck to all and use what you 
want.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
