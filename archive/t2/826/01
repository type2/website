Subject: friday..in the Christmas Spirit!

Folks,

Ok, maybe I'm not quite in the Christmas spirit yet, but trying...

So, in the Christmas giving tradition of the T2 list I am going to start 
the Christmas giving early.

I will ship an original 81 Vanagon Mosquito net to whoever replies first.

Yes, I realize it is not strictly a bay window item, but still....

Oh, don't forget Christmas donations to the T2 list fund either!

Merry Christmas to all!, dave
