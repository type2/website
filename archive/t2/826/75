Found this on a boat site:

FACET Fuel Pump Failures

Judging by the street talk we overhear, there are apparently still quite a
few of the earlier FACET pumps (prior to the "E" series) being sold around
the country. You may recall that we had reported a failure rate on these
earlier pumps (prior to August of 2001) of slightly over 10%.

The obvious problem is that the manufacturer never issued a recall of the
older pumps when they converted to the E series. This means that until all
of the non-E series inventory in warehouses and dealer shelves is sold
out, non-E series pumps will continue to be sold.
---------------------------

So, if the part number ends in an "E" and the plastic part inside the
inlet and outlet are white in color it is likely to be a more reliable
pump.
