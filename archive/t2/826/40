Subject: Rear axle bearings needed?

My 75 bus has a bit of a bearing rumble coming from the rear. I'm sure it's
not the cv joints, I recently replaced those and things did get quieter. But,
the lack of cv joint noise reveals other noises. I suspect it's the rear axle
bearings but could be in the transmission.

Has anyone been down this road and returned with good advice on how to
identify if it's really the bearings without actually pulling them out for
inspection?

Thanks
