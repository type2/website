Subject: Re: [T2] hot air tube under the bus]

Hey Dan,
I *just* redid my pipes under my 78 and the heat is great.
I bought the expandable 4in (I think aluminum) pipe that
extends to something like 8 feet.  I pulled it so it was
about the same length as the original, then wrapped it
with that nasa bubble wrap stuff (bubble wrap with foil on
both sides - can be had at lowes or home depot).  I taped
it on there with aluminum tape.

We drove on our trip last week through freezing whether
(snowing) and still had great heat up front.  My next
project is to put another blower fan in that big pipe,
seal off the engine fan ducts (so cold air doesn't get
sucked in), and put a recirculating vent that willi suck
cabin air from the back of the bus and back through the
blower fan in the back.  I figure, if  I want fresh air, I
can just open the window ;)
