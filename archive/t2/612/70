Subject: Spray Guns was DIY Bus Painting

I am finally getting started on the bodywork and painting of my 78 westy. Am planning on doing the whole job myself and have some experience with paint and bodywork. I have some doors that are in better shape than the ones on the bus now and have started stripping them down. Biggest PITA so far is getting all the old weatherstrip adhesive out of the channels. I am going to be sandblasting some surface rust in some areas, cutting out and welding in a few repairs, hammer/dolly fixing a few dents. Then sealer, primer, paint. Windows and interior will come out. Specific paint brands to be decided later. I need to buy a decent spray gun for the sealer, primer and paint. The SATA guns seem to run about $500+. Did not really want to spend quite that much on a gun. Any suggestions for a good quality gun somewhere south of that price. I dont want some 29.99 harbor freight special but dont need a 500.00 gun either. I have a big compressor and most other air tools. Will get to the sealer,
 primer paint question next....
 
Sanding to bare metal in a lot of areas, sandblasting all surface rust, need to apply a sealer first, or at least thats what I have been told. Advice on sealers to use? Thinking of some sort of zinc, self etching yadayadayada..Plan to coat inside of door skins and inside rocker areas with POR 15. 
 
Primer: thinking of some sort of highbuild self leveling thick like a milkshake rust inhibiting high quality fill and sand primer... Thoughts here???
 
Paint: Most likely leaning towards an acrylic enamel but could be convinced to use Imron or other epoxy type. So much new stuff out there... Last bus painted 12 years ago used Centuari I think... Not too psyched to use a base coat clear coat system but could be talked into it...
 
Terry K where are you???
 
Thanks,
