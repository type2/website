Subject: Bus Paint Jobs

I enrolled in an Antique Auto Body class run by the Ocean County,NJ Vo-Tech
school. The class has everything including two paint booths, quality Sata
Paint Guns, and an instructor who is in the business. I was able to cut out
and replace about 10 spots on the body with fresh metal, remove and refinish
the Westy pop top, prime and repaint properly. When I asked the instructor how
much would the job have cost if I had a quality shop perform the work he said
about $7000.00. My total cost including the new panels,cost of the class,
primer and paint was under $1500.00. I have my Westy back on the road and have
signed up for the class for the 6th semester at $150.00 for 12, three hour
classes. I have also met a lot of new friends and many are Air Cooled VW fans.
Check with your county's Vo-Tech to see if they have this available because
fall classes start very soon.
