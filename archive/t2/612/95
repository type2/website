Subject: Windshield For a `71 bus

Hi,

I just bought my first bus, a 1971 camper, after a long love
unrequited affair with the vehicles. In addition to getting the engine
back up and running again I need to replace the front windshield.

My question is:

What model year bus windsheilds will fit my vehicle? This would be
helpful when calling around to junkyards.

Thanks in advance
Jules
