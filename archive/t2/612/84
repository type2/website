<Where did you do it?>

We get it ready on the day before the paint and then early the morning of the painting, we roll it outside already taped and ready and wipe it down 1 more time. We spray like crazy and then roll it back into the garage. 

By doing it in the morning, we minimize the bugs and don't have the alter the garage in anyway. We start at say 7:30 and by 10 or so it's drying with the tape and paper off.
