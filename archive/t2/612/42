Yeah, make sure the small brass nozzles for the accelerator pumps exist in 
the throats of the carbs.  If you don't know where they are, work the 
accelerator pumps and look down the throats of the carbs.  If you see fuel 
squirting from the brass tubes, you're in good shape.  If you see fuel 
pouring/sloshing down the side of the venturi from a little hole, you are 
missing the tubes and that's the source of your bogginess.  It's very common.
