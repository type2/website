Subject: Re: [T2] Westy upper cot weight limit?

Hi Jay,

I have owned a 72 and 73 westy with the single cot upstairs, and I 
managed to sleep upstairs.
It's narrow and restrictive, but if the canvas is in good shape it 
should be able to manage an adult of about 180 lbs or so.

For someone larger than 180 lbs  I would recommend the late westy 
(1974-79) double-bed.


Happy trails,
