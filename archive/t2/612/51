Subject: quality of rotors and calipers?

Well that's a very good question.
I replaced all of my brakes with new, and all genuine ATE (mostly German
made). I fitted new rotors, wheel bearings, pads, calliper seal kits and new
hoses.
They have functioned well, stop well and have not warped or anything, BUT
leave a lot to be desired over the original units.
The new rotor/pad combination constantly squeaks while driving and squeals
when braking. The dust it throws off also rapidly make the front tyres go
black. Both issues I never had with the original units.
One of the rear wheel cylinders also didn't return freely causing one shoe to
lock on and over head the drum!
Just my observations for you all to know.
