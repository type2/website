Subject: Bus paint jobs

Hey everyone,

I just bought my first VW! A 1973 transporter....with, what I think
are, a few Westy parts. It seems to be in pretty decent shape
mechanically (from what I can figure at least), but it's a little
rough in the paint and interior areas. Obviously priority one for me
is keeping the engine happy, but I also wanted to get a paint job in
the near future. Does anyone have any advice as to what type of place
I should be taking it? A car guy at my work suggested I just take it
to a maaco or some place like that. I wanted to have the top half one
color, and the bottom another. Is something like this too fancy for a
"cookie cutter" shop like that to handle? Anyone know of any good
places in or around Portland Oregon that have done bus work before?
Sorry for my complete ignorance in this area....I've never had a car
painted before.

Thanks,
Scott
