I have a question for the spray gun painters out there...

When you buy a spray gun and it says 15.2 cfm at 29 psi how do you match it up to minimum compressor requirements? The compressors are usually max rated, for example one model says SCFM Delivery At 40 psi 12.4 SCFM. How do you know it will reach 15.2 at 29 psi?
