Subject: vacuum equalizing line?????

I just picked up my dual Kads (EMPI kit).

The manifolds come predrilled with vacuum ports. The kit includes what they
are calling a "Equalizing line" that is connected to both vacuum ports, the
instructions say to "T" off this line the vac assist brake line.
So my question is: is this where I would also "T" off for my Vac dizzy
also?????

Thanks
