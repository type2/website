Subject: coil and tach

Hi all,

I just installed a new Pertronix Flame Thrower coil and discovered that 
it causes my VDO tach to read double the actual RPM.  I assume this is 
because of the difference in resistance between the stock Bosch coil 
and the Flame Thrower (3.0 ohms compared to 1.5 ohms).  Can I 
compensate for this with some configuration of the dip switches on the 
tach or must I add something in line?  Or...am in wrong in my 
assessment of the cause of RPM error?

Jeff
