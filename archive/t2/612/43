Subject: Dropped engine and tranny together-easy!

Well, the "motocycle jack" from Sears paid for itself; made the engine +
tranny drop of daughter's 75 easy.  This was needed as the trans was
whiny, poor in reverse, and there was a rattle when in low rpms. Love
the foot pedal for lowering the jack bit by bit, and the other pedal can
be pumped by hand or foot. We jacked up the rear with 2 jacks at once
and put jackstands on the outboard ends of the rear torsion bars tube.
The height was set at the max height of the two sided Sears jack plus a
board on the jack spanning the heater boxes.  The S-tube, air cleaner,
bumper and oil fill pipe top were removed.  Didn't even remove the tin
around the fan. My only concern were the body bolts holding the tranny
by the engine junction, but after pulling the starter first, they came
out with just some tweaking of the separate jack under the trans itself.
Didn't even need a ratchet extension. Put the gearshift into first and
separated the shift rod at the rear by removing the one squarehead bolt
and then shifting to second.  The engine bearer bar ends were separated
as well as the "grips" around the body tube, since I wanted to shift the
engine left as it was lowered to not hit the fuel injection rail on the
injectors.  The front tranny mount bar was removed and both jacks were
lowered, favoring the rear jack so the nise cone could lift up and pull
down above the middle of the torsion tube.  Piece of cake- came down
nicely and rolled right out, clearing the bus rear.  Tranny separation
was easy, and I see that reinstall will be an easy reversal of the
above. No engine muscling to join up the clutch disk!
   Well, Mark Dearing was right in listening to the engine- the rattle
was a loose pressure plate and one of the bell housing bolts had come
loose.  The mechanic who rebult the engine had switched the early
housing to the later 091 trans to allow the earlier starter, flywheel,
and clutch to be used.  We now had the choice of a 74 trans and a 77
one.  The 74 would have been the easiest, but she liked the milage she
had on the 091 (22mpg) and mountains are less of a concern.  Switching
the bell housings would have kept the older starter, but we had put in
the oil already, and tested the later starter with the early flywheel
and it was fine.  Only problem is that the engine studs and mounting
bolts need to be longer with the later bell housing, so they were taken
from a parter- but I still need the starter bolt. While the engine was
out I switched the fuel tank to a non-rusty one; the strap bolts were a
bear, even with PB Blaster. Daughter was very helpful!
