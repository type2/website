Subject: Re: [T2] Bus paint jobs

The last Beetle I had painted, I took it to a shop basically a shell with 
wheels and a tranny. I did the body work myself and some primer. But I 
talked to the shop about painting it before they new what I had already 
done. I wanted the deluxe package they had. Primer, sand, paint, sand, 
paint, sand, clear. I got a price of like $675. I asked why so much. Reply " 
All the taping and masking on a Punchbug is worth about $300". "Good," I 
said then it should only cost me $375 because there is no taping and masking 
needed." "So I'll take it." This was one of those Maco type of places by the 
name of Peaches Auto and Collision Center. After some hagling over the cost 
of covering the wheels for $50 and that being the extra price, I complained 
that they did not have to cover them.  It cost me about $425. I agreed to 
pay the extra $50 if he let me come in and see between steps. "You can't do 
that it will take you all day and you will miss work." "I will just take the 
day off." I told him. The funny thing is I only went in for a couple of the 
steps. It was cool to see. Better yet, when I got it back with the 
"warranty"  I ended up taking it back because of some inbedded sand in the 
paint in several spots. I found it once went back and they respayed the 
entire thing after fixing the sandy parts. I took it home again and I found 
more. It went back. What was going to be a good cheap job turned out to be a 
great cheap job.

If you go to the Cheapo Chain Shops know what you are getting. In my case I 
couldn't drive the car around and I was not going to tow it around for 
quotes. I think it worked out better that way, of course I didn't want any 
bodywork, just paint.

Good Luck,
