Subject: Which throwout bearing to use?

We decided to use a late tranny with its bell housing on the 75
requiring use of a later starter.  The earlier setup had an early bell
housing, a 215 clutch setup, and a new throwout bearing with a smaller
"set in" face that rotates.  The later tranny has a throwout with a
wider rotating face- can I use this on the earlier pressure plate? (I
assume one cannot use the early throwout bearing with the larger 228
clutch!)  Of the throwouts laying around, I noticed some allow the
bearing part to be pushed around with the fingers within its housing- is
that normal or undesireable?
