when I first got my bus I repainted it, with rattle cans, very high
quality rattle cans but still rattle cans.

when first painted it look quite sharp, now 12 years later it is in need
of a redo, and some new rust spots are taking hold..

used about $250 worth of rattle can paint. (I said it was quality paint,
about $6-8 a can or so)
