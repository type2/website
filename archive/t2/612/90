Subject: Another paint question

When I first got my bus, it was covered with a rusty patina. I assume 
that this is what's called "pinhole rust." I rubbed it down with 
compound and waxed. That was six years ago, and there is no sign that 
any of what I took to be little pinholes of rust have bloomed.

Even so, I've assumed that if I ever wanted to paint, I would have to 
take the whole bus down to bare metal. At the same time, I know that if 
it's at all possible, it's smart to keep the factory paint and work 
over it.

Someone on the list once advised treating each of the "pinholes," so 
that the bus would look like it has measles before painting. I wasn't 
so sure about that. I would say that there are 10 to 20 pinholes per 
square inch.

Anyone else have a similar deal? How did you handle it?
