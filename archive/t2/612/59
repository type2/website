Subject: Re: [T2] Re-movement in  bearing vs its housing

How much movement are you talking about. ALL of the bearings I have inspected have almost zero side to side movement. In fact we went through 3 throwout bearings in a 1970 Westy because the crossshaft was broken and flexing allowing the bearing to get just a little bit off center cooking it within 5 miles at normal rpms and loads. 

In my experience any continous noise is bad, momentary noise is acceptable (I have dealt with two old cars that would moan as the clutch was cycled).
