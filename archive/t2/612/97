Subject: Transmission metal

Hi, All.

Upon beginning the job of resealing (we're talking the rubber seals on all
the shafts, no paper gaskets) my '79 four speed, I drained the gear oil. The
magnetic plug had lots of metal shavings, probably a teaspoon or so,
obviously ferrous. This trans is of otherwise unknown condition, other than
the fact that it is relatively low mileage (under 100K).

Obviously, some metal is normal, hence the magnetic plug. Any ideas on how
much can be considered normal? I also have a known good trans. The only
reason I'm not using it is the high mileage (300K), so please, let's focus
on the metal shavings, not on which trans I should use  ;-)

Thanks,
