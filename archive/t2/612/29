Subject: Re: [T2] Oil cooler heater.....

NO The bypass relief on the cooler is to prevent start up oil pressure spikes
damaging the cooler/filter. It's not a thermostat. Some full flow external oil
cooler kits do have thermostats though, and as you mention will be necessary
to prevent over cooling.
As for time to heat up, I have to wait ~5-10 minutes for the stock heater to
give heat anyway, it's only another ~5min for the oil to heat up, not much
longer, and I would guess it would be hotter than the stock system (but I have
never tried it).

I'm thinking if you over cool the oil, the factory oil cooler would be
automatically take out of the loop - right? The built in cooler bypass spring
- or am I imagining things again?
