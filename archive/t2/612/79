Subject: Re: [T2] Weird Oil Pressure Light Issues

Troy,

1/2" past full is too much...something is going on that is adding 
volume to your oil....and it was way too much for heat expansion.

You are sure that you weren't on any kind of an incline in either place?

Oil pressure light response *is* weird.....something is going on.

Connect a VOM on the ohms setting to the oil pressure sender and to 
ground(without the original wire.  Should be on(a short to ground) before 
starting and off(no connection to ground) after starting...if it changes 
becasue of speed then it is *very* weird.

Make sure you find out what is going on with the oil soonest....didn't
smell like gas did it?

Cheers, dave
