$500 in supplies, $500 in labor (paid for the prep). Acrylic Enamel plus hardner. 

Looked very good at the time. Has sat outside since then. Going to need paint in the next couple years I think. Amounted to a scuff and shoot to a pro, a serious attempt on my part. I'm happy with it all the same. 

Next time I'll go with better materials and do all of it myself.
