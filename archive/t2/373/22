I have the exact same situation. I have a 71 bus with an engine out of a 70 
bus, so no port for the booster hose. The port should be on the intake 
manifold below the carb. You may be able to get a machine guy to make you a 
stem for it.

I was lucky and found a part that fixes this situation. I'm not sure what 
you call it but it fits between the carb and the manifold and give you a 
stem of the correct size. I've heard that they don't make this part anymore.

It's going to be hard to find a manifold with the stem, as it was one year 
only for the 71 bus with disk brakes. Sometimes you find smaller stems which 
i think are for a vacuum advance, but those are too small for the booster 
hose, but you may be able to rig it.

Good luck on this problem, your brakes need the vacuum to work correctly, 
hopefully your booster is still good, if not you can get it rebuilt for 
about 70 bucks.
