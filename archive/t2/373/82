Subject: Lost spark plug thread

My 75 bus decided it didn't want to hold onto the plug in number 3 cyl. 
The threads went away so I guess I need to install one of the thread 
repair kits. Does anyone have an opinion as to who makes the best kit or 
where to get the best? If I pull the head should I replace the head 
gasket. Only about 1500 miles since rebuild. Should have looked closer 
at those threads, !#*%!!!
Thanks,
Tom
