Subject: I need new carbs?

I had my bus clutch replaced by a air cooled vw repair shop.  I also asked
them to look into some popping that I have been hearing lately.  I wondered
if I had burned valve.  They tell me that I need to replace my carbs
(original solex 3/4 pdsit's).  Something about the throttle body and
butterfly not matching up anymore-problem on the left, popping on the right
- and that the right side is hardly working at all.  They suggested a center
mounted weber, I am guessing it is the weber progressive that one can get
form RMMW.  They say the compression is good - 150 everywhere.

I took my carbs out an looked at them.  There did seem to be a slight
mismatch on the right carb, but I could not say that it would have resulted
in an obvious problem, but what do I know?  Left looks fine.  The bus seems
to have plenty of power, runs good underway, starts right up, even when it
is very cold.  It just pops and pops at idle and during decel.

Any advice would be appreciated?  Is this guy right?  I suppose that he
checked for exhaust leaks, I have also - I do not think that I have any
leaks.  If I do replace the carbs, what is my best choice.  I have rebuilt
these once before.  They seem fine, floats not stuck, clean.
