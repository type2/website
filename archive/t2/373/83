Subject: Hippie Bashing

Back in Spokane from 1974 to 1976 I was "adopted" by a local group of
hippies and yippies who moved from Eugene, and Berkley to start anew in a
lower cost area.  They all banded together and bought an old church, and a
few adjoining properties in a part of town that no one wanted.  I was just
12 when I first met them and they taught me how important self reliance,
good friends, and charity to others is.  I also learned how to operate an
underground newspaper, how to run an illegal cable line from the power pole,
and how to listen for a wire tap on your line.
Some of my greatest memories were from those two years.  I drive a hippie
bus partially to honor them, and to show others that not all of the hippie
ideals are dead.  I get more smiles from the toys on my dash, and the big
peace symbol painted on my spare tire than I ever got driving anything else.
I was driving home from the Seattle VW swap meet in Puyallup and was able to
park on the side of the road in Duvall, and catch a glimpse of a rainbow
that seemed to flow from the Jerry bears on the side of my van and stream
upwards in the sky.  Thank god I had a camera with me that day, for when the
memory starts to fade in my mind I will always have the photo.
