Subject: Re:vw show anyone going??

Patrick,
    I'm planning on going to the show.  I'll have to work Saturday
morning, but I should show up in the early afternoon.  No matter what
time I get there it would be too late to enter our bus in the show,
I'm sure.  So I'll probably just drive over in the Subaru so I can get
there a little quicker.
