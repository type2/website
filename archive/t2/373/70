Good to know. I just took a look at mine and there is no rubber seal. Where
did you find one? Junkyard?

> I do a lot of short trips in my bus and have been able to reduce the
amount of sludge in the oel filler tube by using a rubber seal. There was a
lot of debate on the list about whether or not there was a seal put under
the cap at the factory and there was. It's very tight fitting and when I do
find one they are cracked from age. It's also a little difficult to install
because of the threads in the cap.
