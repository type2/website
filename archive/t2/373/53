Help!

    I am new to the VW scene and am having a tough
time with my '76 westy. I am searching for a double
relay and am having no luck at all. I have called
various parts dealers only to be told that the part
number is wrong. It is 0332514 104. Can anyone help me
out. I tested it using informaation obtained from this
mailing list's archives and found a short between
terminals 86a and 85.

 I would appreciate any help, thaks.
       John.
