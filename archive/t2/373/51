Subject: Here's a thought about grounding...

Volks,

We are all well aware of the need for good grounds on our beloved buses.
So how about this...

I have seen many trucks and some cars with ground straps that touch the
ground to release static from the vehicle. If we are grounding to our
chassis, would not this method improve the grounding we so drastically need
on our buses?

My apologies to all if this has already been discussed.

Ciao per addesso,
