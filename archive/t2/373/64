Subject: Steering Wheel nut

Hello all,
        Finally have my 78 Westy ready to take back on road after a few years
of rest. The trouble is that the nut that holds the steering wheel on is
missing.(yes thats the only thing & why is it so hard to find?) Someone at the
VW resting place/local junkyard must of had a use for it before I rescued
Pete. I tried one off of  an earlier bay window bus but it was different. If
anyone has one that would work and would be willing to part with it please let
me know.
Thanks
Greg Goforth
