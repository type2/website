Subject: Re: [T2] Breather Box

If you drive only short distances the breather can become clogged up with an
oil and water mixture.  Take the box off and check the inside to see if its
full of this tanish mayonaise looking sludge. Its caused by the engine not
being able to warm up long enough to evaporate the moisture in the oil. I
have to take mine off and check it every couple of weeks.
