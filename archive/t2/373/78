Check your Bentley manuals wiring diagram and locate all the connectors 
between the battery, the ignition switch, the relay and the starter 
solenoid. Even if they look clean go after them with a small wire brush, 
contact cleaner, burnisher, or emery cloth. make them shine. Any 
corrosion in a connection builds resistance. Resistance causes current 
to drop. Kind of like a kink in a garden hose. by the time the electrons 
travel from the battery, through corroded connections, through the 
ignition switch all the way back to the relay, they are so weak they 
cant hold the relay closed.

If the cleaning doesn't improve the situation, at least you have traced 
the length of the wires that need to be replaced. If it comes to 
replacing the wires, consider using a larger gauge wire than original.

Some folks like to install a starter button but I say no. Makes the bus 
all that much easier to steal. Not that the ignition switch is all that 
much of a deterrent to a knowledgeable thief.
Hope this helps,
Tom
