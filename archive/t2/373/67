Here is a link to a few things to think about...
http://www.globalserve.net/~jrivers/aux-batt.htm

The page isn't written too well.... but the point[s] that I was trying to make:
1  You shouldn't use large wire to connect an aux battery to the starter
battery/alternator
2 There is a couple of ways to wire the relay so it will work basically the same
3 The explanation of the Hella relay kit wiring for Aux battery installation

Hope that helps,,
