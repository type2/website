Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking Windshield

No, the windshield window frame was perfect, no rust at all. There was some
rusty water at the bottom where water had pooled, but I cleaned it off with
a rag. There was a small ity bity rust spot forming at the VERY bottom of
the windshield. but other than that, the rest of the windshield frame was
IMMACULATE. I would say.. there was no rust. And that one spot, it was
small... believe me, it was smaller than the size of a pencil eraser head.

The gasket is new.. well.. it was on the windshield for 3 years, but it was
new then, and the car drove less than 100 miles since then.

The bus I took the windshield off on the other hand though... ouch... I
pushed on the windshield a little, and tugged, it ended up ripping the
entire windshield window frame off with the window!!

NAPA and any glass shop can sell you urethane glass sealant in a caulking 
tube. $15 or so. Do not use silicone."

My .02-
I have used marine silicone ($5) with good results IE no leaking years
later. The question I have is why is it leaking? When you put the window
seal in was the metal all rotted? If using silicone, (and I am sure any
window sealant) make sure to clean the rubber and glass with alcohol to get
a good seal.
