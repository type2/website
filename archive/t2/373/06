Inverters make AC from DC. This thing makes DC from AC. It's a basic 
transformer.

When mine went out (voltage output went into the 20's) I replaced mine with 
a good modern battery charger that won't overcharge my battery.

That's all I am doing with it anyhow - that and running the fridge. I have 
a computer power supply to make a good 12 volts for 12 volt toys and a 300W 
inverter for AC toys.
