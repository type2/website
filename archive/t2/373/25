Subject: VDO Cyl. Head Guage Sender and Wiring Harness FS

I have a new (still in box)VDO cylinder head temp guage sender and the
wiring harness for this guage. I originally bought them separately because
I had the guage and just needed the sender and wiring. Bus Boys sells these
item separately. Then while trying to clean a spider web out of the guage I
broke it. So in trying to save some money I ordered the whole kit from Bus
Depot, just the guage from Bus Boys was only a few dollars less and cost
more when shipping to east coast. Now Bus Boys wants a 20% restocking fee
plus I will have to ship the parts back to CA from VA and pay shipping. The
sender was $12.10 and the wiring kit $14.26 thats the wire from the sender
to the guage with the correct plug on the sender end.

Anyway does anyone want this stuff? I would love to get a few bucks or
maybe something in trade for my efforts here. I have a 78' Westy. I will
gladly ship this stuff.
