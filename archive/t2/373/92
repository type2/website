Subject: Re: [T2] BB in vacuum line?

It didnt make much sense to me either. I didnt check to see if I still had
vacuum advance after I removed the BB. I did drive the bus and all seemed
OK. I will check tommorow.  What are the symptoms of a clogged charcoal
cannister if any? I guess that wouldnt have anything to do with the EEC
valve though right?

Thanks Karl
