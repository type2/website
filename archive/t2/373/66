Subject: BB in vacuum line?

I was replacing some of the vacuum lines in my 78 today. When I removed the
hose that goes from the distributor vac cannister to the air cleaner I noticed
something hard inside. I cut it open and there was what looked like a copper
BB shoved inside. Why would someone want to plug this hose? The bus doesnt
seem to idle any different with it removed. Im stumped. Anyone have any
ideas?
