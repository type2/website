different bolt pattern.  You either need a adapter or to modify your
manifold.

Personally, I'd go with a new 31PICT-3 carb over trying to adapt the 34.
Yes, it's more money, but it's a bolt-on and the carb works great.  Mine
ran great right out of the box (bought from Ronnie) and still does two
years later.
