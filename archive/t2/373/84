Just about any A/C load on an inverter will drain your battery overnight.  For a rough estimate, take the watts and divide by 10 to get amps drained from your battery.  For instance, a 100-watt lava lamp would draw approximately 10 amps.  That will drain most batteries in a few hours.

300 watt inverters are plentiful and cheap but they draw a little too much peak current to use in a silver socket.  About the largest inverter that would be safe for a silver socket would be ~150 watts.

Battery monitors - that's a bit tricky.  You should watch voltage and not drain the battery completely.  If it is a 50 amp-hour battery and you have been drawing 10 amps from it for 3 hours, you are nearly done.  If voltage at the battery drops below 12 volts, you are also nearly done.
