Sounds like your relay may be suffering from the same problem your starter
was...crappy wiring from the ignition switch.  My PO solved this by running
a pair of larger gauge wires from the relay to the cab, and installing a
heavy-duty pushbutton switch.  Power comes from the hot terminal on the
starter, to the pushbutton, back to the relay. Bypasses all the original,
small gauge, corroded wiring.

You could also try to use the bushbutton to trigger the starter directly
with no relay. This worked for me until my solenoid got old and tired.
