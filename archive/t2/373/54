I do a lot of short trips in my bus and have been able to reduce the amount of sludge in the oel filler tube by using a rubber seal. There was a lot of debate on the list about whether or not there was a seal put under the cap at the factory and there was. It's very tight fitting and when I do find one they are cracked from age. It's also a little difficult to install because of the threads in the cap.

Now that I have the seal I get less sludge.
