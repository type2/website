Remove armrest, crank handle, inner door latch handle, door panel, remove 
plastic moisture barrier, remove bolts as indicated in the Bentley manual. 
Slide the whole thing downward. It will bring the glass down somewhat where 
you can remove the two 10 mm bolts to disconnect the glass from the 
regulator. Eight 10mm bolts hold the regulator to the door I think.

Reinstall is reverse of that.

I think cables were once available from the dealer.

Grease and clean everything - MAKES A HUGE difference. Ask me how I know! 
<grin> My old passenger side window was crazy hard to move. Not after a bit 
of cleaning and grease.
