It might turn into a paste but I think unless it's had a chance to sit for
long time it would run out from the bottom. If activated charcoal can filter
water without solidifying, gasoline probably behaves the same. Don't quote
me.

The big hose is 12mm x 3.5mm. The little one is 13mm x 3.5mm.

I can vouch for the Bus Boys hose:

Hose - From Air Intake Elbow Boot to Aux Air Control Valve
N 20374.08  1975-1979  $2.00 (Hose Pre-Cut To Size)

Hose Elbow - Aux Air Control Valve to Hose above
022-129-637   1974-1979  $2.55

Hose - Aux Air Valve to Center Air Plenum
022-133-127   1974-1979   $2.75

The 12mm is just a little to small to use for the small piece. They figured
this out already for you.
