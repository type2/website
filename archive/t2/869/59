Hi Ronnie,

You are right on the mark here...  Why sell to the first person who  
comes along, esp. when the item hasn't been advertised??

Craig: It's YOUR bus. Sell for an amount that makes YOU happy. Not a  
dime less. If you do sell then don't let the hard-to-find accessories  
get away, they're unobtanium on the east coast. If you do want to  
sell it, then sell it right: Advertise on craigslist, thesamba, ebay  
or the local auto trader. Make out a bill of sale and keep a copy for  
your own records.


Happy trails,
