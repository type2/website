Subject: Tires: My tires are finally online

and for pricing

*http://tinyurl.com/gcdjm *(Discount Tire: $94 each)

The reason this came up was I'm getting the other two now before my trip. I
really don't want to spend the $$ but I really like these tires, and they do
great on the road or in the snow. And they'll save my Nokians for the
winter.

I bought two before my run from California to Colorado a year ago in the GWB
and were outstanding.
