Subject: Dash Color

Hey guys,

	I just got a new (used) PERFECT dash for my 73. I'd like to keep
my Bus STOCK looking, but I'd like to give it a little bit of character
too.

My 73 Bus is blue, with a white roof, white bumpers, and white wheels.
The inside of my Bus is also blue (same color as the outside), but I was
thinking about painting the steel part of my dash WHITE to match the
roof, bumpers and wheels. I'm worried about the possibility of creating
a glare on my windshield. Has anyone painted their dash, and can you
tell me if it creates a glare on the windshield, and.. if it does, how
bad is it?



Thanks,

Todd Jaspers
