these are probably very conservative numbers

have to agree, but then I don't follow advice very well, and well
sometimes circumstances force the issue,  I live in a city I have one off
street parking pad.  I rent a garage for storage. if I need electric I run
a long extension cord from the house or fire up the generator.  I have
done 99.9 % of the work on my bus myself.  and it is my daily driver.

that's the good news.

the other side of the coin.  I have to lock everything up if I so much as
have to run to the bathroom or risk it not being there when I get back.
 keeping the bus running and drivable while working on it means cutting
every job down to very small managable units. so you can finish and get
back on the road.  so if someone else tells you the job will take x number
of hours. if that X is more than twice what you have on any given day
triple the time it will take to get it done in setup and cleanup time.

  you have to make sure that every concievable part you may need is in
your hands before you start.  and your UPS bill will be double everyone
elses or more because you have to get everything "Next day air"  the
shipping on my front axle beam was dern near as much as the beam for
example... don't count on getting a vacation because you will use up your
vacation time on unplanned repairs that take too long.  count of folks
making fun of your raggy bus while part of it is red, part is blue, some
is primer and the rest is rust... while you do body work.

and loads more fun stuff like that.  and make a donation to keep this list
going because your gonna need it.

But, if you are willing or have no choice it can be done.. many have done
it, I being one of them.  when I rebuilt my engine I bought another
junkyard engine that had enough miles left in it to move the van while the
engine got rebuilt. some major parts you grab when you can get em because
you never know when you will need that (-at-)#G&!! part.  and you will work in
the rain, the heat the snow the cold because you gotta get it fixed to go
to work tommorrow morning...  an example, not too long ago coming home in
the rain the windshield wipers just "stopped" no noise nothing just
stopped. well I was almost home so I got home ok,. but since it was
calling for rain tommorrow I had to go out to the garage with a flashlight
(no lights in it either) and find my spare wiper assembly.  and with a
flashlight and in the rain swap out the assembly. couldn't trouble shoot
didn't have the time it could have been something simple but once a quick
check showed it wasn't a fuse that was it, pull the thing.

so yes it is possible to have a bus as your sole vehicle and daily driver
but make sure you know the bus routes to places you have to be and at
least two FLAPS because your gonna at least a few times be taking the big
bus to work or carrying a muffler home that way...

but I wouldn't trade my bus for any other vehicle..  now I gotta go out
and get the distributor fixed so I can get to church tommorrow
morning.....

good luck and enjoy
