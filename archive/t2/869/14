mine is a 78 daily driver..  didn't "restore" in the auto show sense of
the word, but am slowly getting it back to near normal "Newish" looking
and operating.

I did mine about 15 years ago and getting ready to do it again.  I did not
remove my glass.

I first divided the bus into 9 sections.

3 panels each side
front and rear.
roof.

I did each section one at a time.

this allowed me to take enough time over a single weekend to do each
section.  yes it took several months (some weekend it rained etc)

also rather than using a paint gun and the ensuing time to clean and prep
I used very high quality rattle can paint.  it has held up for 15 years
now and still looks passable.  I am repainting with the same paint in the
same colors (I like it)

doing it "right" is really the right way but sometimes there is no other
option.  Just take the time to really get all the rust

good luck
Bob
