    Check voltage across both terminals at the sending unit. If you have
10.5 volts (with the key on) then you have checked everything but the
sending unit! If you don't have 10.5 volts, E-mail me back off list and I
will walk you through the component test.
    To get to the sending unit, you have to pull the motor/tank, or cut the
body panel over the sender. There is a cutting template on line, but sorry I
can't remember where. Anyone?
