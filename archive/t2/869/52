Subject: Scamp Trailer Behind 78 Bay

Ok,  I have a 78 Bay Transporter (not camper) and im trying to decide
what trailer to get for camping.

I love the SRV from Sweden, but Im not having any luck getting it
here from EU.

I found the Scamp line to be right up my alley.....

So here's the questions:

    Has anyone had any experience towing a Scamp behind a bus?
    How big was the Scamp?
    Does anyone have a line on a 13' or 16' Scamp with the
toilet/shower option? (16' is approx 2000 lbs GVW and 140 lbs tongue)

Thanks a ton in advance.

Dave.
