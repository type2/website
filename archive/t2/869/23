Subject: New AMC heads - all the same?

Hello all again - sorry for the cross posting here...

Are all new AMC heads the same? I got 2 completely different prices and want
to go with the cheaper heads, but not sure what the difference is. BusDepot
- $413 or local vw flaps - $333...are there two different heads that you can
get - or does the BusDepot one come with better valves/valve seats?
the busdepot heads:
http://busdepot.com/view.jsp?model=42&category=15&group=9&prodgroup=61
doesnt say anything about different valves/seats

any ideas?

BTW update on moms engine - pulled it this morning, and is definately a
dropped seat - I also noticed that there was no thermostat only the
bracket...
