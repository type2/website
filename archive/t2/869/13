Subject: [Q] Restoring Daily Driver

Greetings,

I have a daily (weekday) driver '71 camper that I'm considering restoring.
Many tasks I'm sure can be performed in a weekend, so those won't be an
issue.  However, one that's bugging me as I think through my "plan" is what
about paint?

O.K., O.K., I could take off a Friday and Monday, mask and shoot the
camper.  However, I was hopin' to take the high road and "do it right".
Right now that means take out all glass, top, lights, etc.  Follow this by
prepping, priming and painting the entire stripped body at once -- interior
and exterior.  Then, put humpty dumpty back together again.

The problem is obviously that I can't do all of this in the span of a few
days -- or can I?  Just lookin' for feedback as to whether this will be
just a can of worms best left unopened, or whether I'll really appreciate
having done it "right"!

For those of you more familiar with painting a vehicle *without* removing
glass, etc. -- what would be the proper steps to do this?  With respect to
glass, I'm guessing that I would first need to remove windshield, etc.,
one-by-one, replacing brittle seals/gaskets first.  Then apply primer/paint
as the last step.  (Maybe this would be an O.K. approach if I sanded/primed
the perimeter of each glass item before installing the new seal/gasket?
Maybe I could even spot paint the area before putting in the new
seal/gasket?  Would it be hard to match color/thickness between the final
coat and what would be sticking out under the new seals/gaskets?)

O.K., I'm rambling now -- just looking for advice on plans that work and
plans that don't.

Maybe I should buy a cheap, but useful, Beetle to drive while I "do it
right"?

TIA and Regards,
David
If I cave in and mask/paint the traditional (and faster) way
