How do you sell cars??? You get the cash and give him the title. Fill the  
title out with your info completely. Then call DMV Monday and tell them you sold 
 it. Who cares what he does with it. You don't need insurance to sell a car. 
I  wouldn't buy it if someone wanted all my info and proof of insurance to get 
it.  Just get the money and give him the title. What kind of scam can they be 
doing  if they pay cash and take the car??? I worked for a car lot for 13 
years. What  is happening is they start off with the $1200 price. Then they bring 
the  father/uncle to make sure it's a good deal. They say well how about 
$800. Then  you say ok. They leave to come back tomorrow. Then they get there and 
say all I  have is $400. You take it or leave it. If you want $400 then take 
it if you  don't then don't take it. Were not talking about a real nice $6000 
bus. It's a  beater bus with lots of new parts. Either sell it or don't. I'd 
say the only  thing they are trying to do is get a bus for as cheap as possible. 
If you insist  on driver's license and insurance and all that other stuff you 
will have that  thing forever. Worst case have a neighbor witness the sale. 
Sounds like you  would be better off parting it out. $3000 dollars worth of 
parts on a $100 bus.  Show them the reciepts. If they don't get it try your luck 
on one of  the bus selling sites or post it on here. Don't be pressured to 
sell  it.
