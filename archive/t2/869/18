 Couple three years ago I was going to a job and happened 
to see a beautiful Bugeye sittin' outside a sandblaster's
shop. I stopped and started talkin' to the owner who turned
out to be the sandblaster...We exchanged lies about our re-
spective Bugeyes and then he said he had another LBC that
might interest me. There, hangin' from chains in one of the
blasting booths was a Triumph TR4...Or rather most of one.
The owner of the TR had trailered the body to the shop and
wanted the old paint blasted off prior to repainting the whole
thing. The sandblasting revealed that each corner of the TR
had been carefully molded out of Bondo... ;-(
