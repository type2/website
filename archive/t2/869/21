That's a good price, but I just got my Hankooks dropped off today from the
Busdepot.  Just need to get my battery working again to then drop them all
off at my mech's shop and get them installed along with a brake job and I
will be rolling.

Don't ask about the battery, I hate it.  Even had the place I bought it
charge it up again. Lasted a day.

I have a solar powered unit from the Battery Minder people that once I get
it all hooked up it will keep the main battery and the one with the inverter
(that I will install) all juiced up and going.  I am wanting to run the
internals off the 2nd battery.

This is on a 78 Riviera FI Bus..fyi

Boy, another good day.  I've been waiting on my local tire shop to  get in
some nice used tires for the rear of my Westy.  Today I hit  the jackpot.
Bridgestone RD-603s with nice, even tread wear that  look hardly used.  They
are the required 8 ply with 2 ply  sidewalls.  $26 apiece mounted and
balanced with a 30 day  warranty!  With my new Hancooks on the front, I'm
ready to  roll.  Should at least get me to Seveirville and back.  If I  can
work it out.  Cheers...KR
