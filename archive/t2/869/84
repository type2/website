Subject: Re: [T2] Don's Road Trip Update 3

Don, when I put my temp sensor in the sump, I filled it with oil and  drove it for a couple of days.  The first day I checked the taco  plate and it was still shiny and clean.  Didn't bother checking  the oil.  Next day I checked it.  Not a drop on the  dipstick.  I panicked!  Checked again to be sure.  This  time I turned around into the sunlight.  It was over-full by about  1/2 quart!  When the oil is clean it sure is hard to see on that  black dipstick.  Sounds like you're doing great.  Stay cool  and have fun.  Cheers...KR
  

And the oil is still clear and gold. Have to hold the dipstick at an angle
to the light to see the oil level. =)
