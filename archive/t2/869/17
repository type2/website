Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Restoring Daily Driver

 My bus is completely stripped.  I am in a great shop that is doing my welding and most of my fabricating and an old guy who restores old covettes across the street is coming over and helping out.   Shop has a giant sandblaster that I can push the bus into.  I have been working on it all week, and I still have much to do.  I have some rust repair going, only along the edges, the bottom parts (rockers, rear fenders) and the window edges.  As is usual, I am sure, there was much more rust than I could see.  There are spots where you cannot see until you blast and cut.  In particular, the volume down low behind the rockers just in front of the rear wheel.  That and under just about every window seal.

This is a big job, my friends.  Way bigger than it seems at first.  I cannot believe that I will ever get it all back together.

I cannot see this being done in less than a month, working on it every day.  I hope that I do not give up and call the junk man.  Mechanically, it was perfect, but I could not let is rust away so I stopped driving it about 2 years ago.

I seek daily driver level repair.  I am hoping to not see any rust for at least 5 years.  That is my goal.  5 years.  Then I will do this again, but better.

I am under some time pressure, I am moving to Toronto from Virginia in a month or so.  I am in a race.  Otherwise, I would just give it to the corvette repair guy and wait 3-4 years and pay $10K or so.  He is restoring a '54 corvette right now.  Those were all handmade.
