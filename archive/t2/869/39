Subject: water inlet

Well, I got lazy and decided to mow around the bus instead of moving  it.  Throttle cable caught the water inlet cover and wham!   No more water inlet cover.  Anybody got a used one they could  spare at a decent price.  I tried Busted Bus' site but it must be  down.  Hope they're still around.  Cheers...KR
