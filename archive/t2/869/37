Subject: Fw: [T2] [Q] Restoring Daily Driver

Howard is completly right..
.
Mine is an European (Portuguese) experience...maybe even third world...
Fortunately the father of my girlfriend has a good knowledge of working with 
metal, so he helped me in one of the most expensive part of a restauration.
This was in fact a great help...It cost almost nothing (less than 100 Euro).
The worse part was in fact painting it....(this is the third world part). It 
was always for tomorrow or for "next friday"...It tooked 4 months to paint 
it...and it's not all painted yet, It needs to be repainted in some 
places...
Till now i've spent a small fortune:

- metal work - priceless (0 Euro)
- seals - 500 Euro
- paint - 1250 Euro
Other parts (justkampers.com, thesamba, bustedbus...) - 1000 Euro

You can see it (if interested) at: 
http://forum.autohoje.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=29986&whichpage=5  (bottom 
page) and next...although the page is in portuguese, you can see the 
pictures..

And it's far, far from finish....
