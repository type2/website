A distributor (NEW) will set you back a cool $550 according to Bosch's
latest price (2 are available from Bosch's warehouse in California).  A
local rebuilt will probably run around $100 exchange, give or take.

The vacuum unit can be purchased separately, such as thru Bus Depot for $50
(Bosch # 07 060, VW # 021 905 271 F)
http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=021905271F

But you can probably source the vacuum unit locally at a
Kragens/Shucks/Checker/AutoZone/AdvanceAuto, etc., for most likely less
under a Wells Brand part number, of which escapes me at the moment (I failed
to enter the # in my database when I last saw it).  Richard Atwell has
mentioned it before, but I can't find it on his site at the moment.
