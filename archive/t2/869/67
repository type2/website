Certified/cashiers/money orders/etc. are just too easy to fake.  I used to
trust them, but the fact that banks will accept them and then take the
money back when the check proves to be be fake has made me more cautious.
If he wants to pay by cashier's check, take it to the issuing bank and
cash it before the title changes hands.  Cash in hand is the key.
