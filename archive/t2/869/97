Subject: RE:Filtering fuel

Phil,

Assuming that the fuel system in your '71 bus there in the UK is the same as
mine here in the USA let me make a suggestion.  Drain the tank empty ( yes
save the fuel ) and remove the filter that is in the tank outlet.  Remove
the fuel line from the tank outlet, unscrew the hex nut the outlet tube
extends through, take down the nut, then remove the filter.  I flushed out
my tank by using 2 buckets and several gallons of alcohol.  With an empty
bucket under the tank outlet pour the alcohol into the tank through the fuel
filler.  Once it all drains out remove the bucket and put the second empty
one in it's place.  Pour the alcohol through again to flush the tank a
second time. Swap buckets and go again.  Keep doing this until the alcohol
doesn't get any dirtier.  Now set the bucket of alcohol aside to evaporate,
make sure it's a well ventilated area.  Reinstall a new filter, and seals,
in the bottom of your tank, hook up the fuel line, replace any in-line fuel
filters and refuel your bus.

That's what I did when I had a problem similar to yours.
