Boy, another good day.  I've been waiting on my local tire shop to  get in some nice used tires for the rear of my Westy.  Today I hit  the jackpot.  Bridgestone RD-603s with nice, even tread wear that  look hardly used.  They are the required 8 ply with 2 ply  sidewalls.  $26 apiece mounted and balanced with a 30 day  warranty!  With my new Hancooks on the front, I'm ready to  roll.  Should at least get me to Seveirville and back.  If I  can work it out.  Cheers...KR
