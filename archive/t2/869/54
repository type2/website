This screams "Scam."   It *could* be legit, but doubtful. 

Insist on cash or secured funds (cashiers check, certified check, money 
orders, etc.).  Cash for title.  Notify the DMV that the vehicle has 
been sold, so you don't get the half billion parking tickets that you 
have to dispute.  Get copies of his driver's license, and preferably 
proof of his insurance also. Most insurance places will fax you a 
temporary card within minutes of getting the policy, and nearly every 
insurance agency will let you add a vehicle over the phone.

And most of all, if you aren't comfortable, don't sell.  Never let the 
buyer pressure you into a sale.  You're selling it, you control the sale.  

Just my $.02, but it agrees with what others here have said.
