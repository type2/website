Buy a scooter. Use this for warm weather transportation until you are
driveable again. I rode my Honda CD900 Custom year-round for a while
because of transportation issues. Homeward at 1AM in 25 degree weather
is not that bad if properly dressed (layers), decent gloves (snow mobile
mittens) and if you havd a windshield. Gives you extra time to complete
some tasks that involve vehicle immobility... <griN!>
