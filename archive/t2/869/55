These financial instruments aren't always as secure as you think. A
stop payment can be made on a cashiers check just like a personal
check. And there are plenty of counterfeit cashiers checks and postal
money orders going around, not to mention counterfeit bills. If paying
by any kind of check, or a postal money order, I'd make the buyer go
with me to the bank or post office to cash it to ensure it is legit
before turning over the title and the bus. In this scenario, even a
personal check is okay because the bank will be cashing it, but in
that case, why not just go to the bank with him to withdraw the money.
Then you know you are getting good bills.
