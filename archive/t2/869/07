I will be leaving with Ole Putt and "baby" trailer in tow from Southern
Calif to attend CYW tomorrow morning.  The last one I attended was in May
'99 and had a very good time., met a lot of list people (both Type 2 &
Vanagon).

Thanks (sarcastically) are extended to the oil companies to substantially
increasing the fuel costs for this cross country trip.  But it's been
7years, 2 heart attacks, 2 angioplasties and a 4-way open heart bypass since
I had a *real* vacation AWAY from California, so it will be worth it.

Extended weather.com forcast shows Friday (the 5th) and Saturday (the 6th)
to be a bit wet there in Sevierville, but I won't let that be a damper on it
(pun is intended).

So I'm packed and ready to go.  See any and all there.
