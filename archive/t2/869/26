Subject: best tire for a vanagon 83 !!!

Hi Volks ,
I am really sorry for this question which has been answered so many 
times I guess.... but I need a quick answer.
I went back from Death Valley (CA) last week end with a tire ....  I 
don't know how to say it  .... well we could see the steel inner tube 
sticking out. We were very fortunate that the tire did not blow it up 
during our 1100 Miles journey. Any way I need a serious wheel alignment 
on one of my front wheel.
My questions are:

1) What is  the spec for the front wheel alignment, I 've  been  to  a  
wheel specialized shop,   they told me  that they did  not have the spec 
to align my wheel. Which kind of b...... is that ?, are the vanagon know 
to be difficult for wheel alignment ?!
2) Which tire do you recommend me , hankook Ra08 185R14 or Michelin 
Agilis 185R14 or others ???!!!! I should mention that I am found of ski 
and use my vanagon camper in any condition including heavy snowy winter 
weather.

Thanks for any advises.

Chris, vanagon 83 , the latest vanagon air-cool engine species !
