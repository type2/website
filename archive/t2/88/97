Subject: T-IV vacuum distributor wanted

Greetings.  I'm in search of a vacuum distributor for a T-IV motor; time
to pitch the 009.  I've got a 1700, but from what I've learned on the
list a vacuum dizzy from any T-IV is a better solution than the 009
(please correct me if I'm wrong).

Anyway, if you have a vacuum distributor for sale (or a lead on one),
please p-mail me.

Many thanks
-Roger
