Subject: first time T4 engine pull q's

does the f.i. system need to be removed as specified in bentley? not
mentioned in haynes, nor bartnik write up in library. wondering if the
engine can be moved rearward on dollyjack enough to clear #3 injector and 3
&4 fuel rail.

also: cable from ECU - 12 inches out two disconnected wires with female
tabs split off the harness. any idea? note, vehicle is a january 75 bus
with quite possibly 77 or later fuel injection (7 prong AFM). not right off
finding thermo-time switch for cold-start valve. BIGthanks     - steve
