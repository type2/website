I was able to buy some stuff from a VW dealer that had shut down (I =
understand he originally had a buyer for his dealership but that VW =
didn't approve of the new owner so he had so close the dealership).  =
Anyway, I bought this vw block heater from him.  It consists of a plate, =
identical to an oil sump plate (is that what that thing is called?) that =
we take off with we change the oil except it never had a centre hole =
where an oil drain plug went, there is that metal tube about 6" long =
that passes through this plate it is sort of bent such that it is in the =
same plane as the plate itself, except for where it passes through the =
plate, where it is brazed or bronzed or something.  A cord and plug is =
on the outside part of the metal tube.  The metal tube is a heating =
element.  It's very cool but I'm not using it because these Ontario =
winters are too salty.  I'm sure it would be incredibly simple to make =
one of these. And I'm sure it would work very well.
