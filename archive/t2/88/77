Hi Volks,

When we took Adam's 68 westy's engine out we discovered the flex-pipes
connected to the flappers with asbestos gaskets.  UGH!!!   I carefully
bagged the wreckage while holding our breath, and resolved to replace that
component with something less dangerous.

I remember this fall that Denmeister showing me a rubber replacement for
this gasket; anyone know where one can be obtained?  I looked on
www.bustedbus.com and at busdepot but couldn't find the part listed. Adam
needs a pair for his westy and my westfakia also could use a set.

Thanks and Happy trails,

Greg Potts
