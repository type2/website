Does anyone know where I can get the linkage between my throttle and egr
valve? I have looked at a bunch of parts web sites and emailed
bustedvw.com - but no one seems to have it.

I am going to try to look in VW graveyards this weekend, but any leads =
would
be helpful.

It's a 1980 Westfalia. 2.0.

Thanks,
Bill
