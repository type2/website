That is sound sound advice.  The Bus system is pretty darn simple
actually as there isn't much to it, no auto adjuster system etc.  But
I recall years ago taking apart my uncles Chevy rears both at once
with like an elaborate auto adjuster mechanism, 8 springs, etc, etc.
Needless to say I didn't just remember how it went back together,
and had to go to the library and get a terrible little picture out of a
Chiltons.  Always helps to just leave one side together.  Also to
the original poster, I think it is wise sometimes to shy away from the
locally available Varga wheel cylinders, I've had spotty luck.  The
Italian ones Ron had were nicely done though, a bit odd form factor
but work well.  And regardless which way you go do both of the rears
and purge your fluid changing to Castrol GT/LMA DOT4, you will
be happy for having done it.

PS Of course I was redoing my tow dolly and took both sides right
apart.....  We never really learn 8-)
