Subject: maintenance log

Hello All, I'm just sitting at my computer tonight kinda bored and 
thinking of the maintenance that I need to do on the Vanagon and 
wondering if anyone had setup a spreadsheet or some time of list 
where you check your mileage and see what maint. is due. Any ideas?
Thanks, Tony
