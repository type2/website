Subject: oil leak on a 75

Hello all,
 i went down to pick up my new 75 westy butit was leaking oil so bad and
smoking so bad that i couldnt drive it.
It is leaking in a steady drip from the dipstick tube. when i removed the
stick from the tube it poured out. I dont have to much oil in it, the only
think I can thing is the case has to much back pressure. I am new to these
motors so I am learning, I am gonna refer to my manual as well.
Any ideas anyone?

Thanks----Bryan
