Subject: Re: [T2] why 1978?

Mike,
you reminded me of a vw show i went to when i lived in CA, the big event was 
the Engine Blow Raffle, where they put an upright motor in a metal cage, 
drained the oil, ran a fuel line over to a gas can, and took bets on how 
long it would run. my wife and i stood there, interested in the event, i had 
guessed about 12 minutes, and the thing went to about 18, then bang, wobble, 
wobble, clunk, clunk, thunk. I remember saying to my wife "oh wait, i have 
heard that happen before..."
(fond memories of the 71 sunroof bus).. please don't let it happen to the 77 
anytime soon...
-jeremy
