If I recall, they are around $50-$60 each.  But new is better than resurfaced.

Depends on who you trust more, yourself or the mechanic.  Do you know the 
mechanic that will be working on your bus?  Will he be a 20-year veteran of 
VW brake jobs or a college kid that just took the job to make some beer 
money?  I made my decision after one of the latter type left a vice-grip 
clamped onto my brake hose.  First time I stepped on the brake, instant 
lane change.  I had to learn how to do the work myself, but it's like most 
things in life - with patience, decent instruction manuals, and common 
sense an average person can do almost anything, including good, safe brake 
jobs.

Unless the drum won't come off.  :)  Back down adjusting stars, get out 
BF-screwdriver, etc..  Can be frustrating.  Remove the two small bolts 
(11mm?) to remove the drum - no need to remove the large castle nut on a 
late bay.

Yup.  Buy the brake spring removal tools - you won't be sorry.

Also use brake cleaner to clean metal parts.  Wear one of those 
filter-apparatus things so you don't inhale the fumes or brake dust, both 
of which are nasty.  Wear gloves.

What he said.  If you're the type who doesn't mind blowing an evening, 
getting dirty, possibly cutting yourself a couple of times and doing some 
physical labor, go for it.  If it's worth the $340 to simply make the 
problem go away, pay it but as was already mentioned make sure you trust 
who is doing the job.  If you're going to get another estimate, go to a VW 
specialist, or at least a European car specialist.
