Here is the list of plates I currently have at the moment.  The number two 
will indicate a set and the number one a single plate.  I also have a couple 
of special sets that were for a bug or a bus with a square style plate for 
the back and a normal long one for the front.  The price for the sets are 
$10.00 plus around $5.00-$7.50 for postage.  The prices for the singles are 
$5.00 plus (unfortuantely) $5.00-$7.50 for postage.  If you want something 
you see, email me to reserve and send a money order or cashiers check for the 
amount.  I will email you the address when you are ready.

SPECIALS these are custom fit for either a bug or a bus, one is special and 
you'll see why.
1.  HD XL 237   HEIDELBERG  x2  One plate is square 8"high by 13.5"long  and 
the other is standard length  $20.00
2.  HD VW 58   HEIDELBERG x2   One plate is 8"high by 11"wide and the other 
is standard long.  This one does indeed
                                                    say VW 58 and would look 
awesome on a bug or bus.  This plate is currently a 
                                                    display plate by my toys. 
I hate to do it but this set must fetch $35.00 plus shipping
