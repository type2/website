Subject: Help w/ vacuum lines on 74 dual carb

I've been messing with my engine and I need to
double check vacuum lines to the dizzy.  It's a
dual vac dizzy (off a 72) and stock dual carbs.  

I've searched Bentley page by page, but I cannot
find the diagram some mentioned when I asked this
question earlier.  Can anyone point me to the
diagram or perhaps describe how the vac lines are
routed.  

Thanks,
