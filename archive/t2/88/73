Subject: Oil filler gasket on a pancake engine

I figured out where my bus is leaking oil  From where the oil filler tube
connects to the engine.  Is there a replacement gasket available for this?
Also, it looks like 2 bolts to take it off and replace.  Am I correct or
will this be a big PITA?  Can it be done with the engine in?

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
