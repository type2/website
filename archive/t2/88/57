=========================>
If you are going to use the relay method for dual battery charge it is 
probably better to have the two batteries of the same size and age.

It is not ABSOLUTELY critical to do this, but you do want to try and stay 
away from overcharging the "best" battery as the "lesser" battery attempts 
to come up to full charge. To that degree, keeping the paralleled batteries 
similar will result in a more "balanced" dual battery system.
