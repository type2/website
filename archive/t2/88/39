..As I recall the headliner in a 78 (and, indeed, all factory equiped
westies) is not vinyl.  It should be some variation of wood. (sometimes
bare, sometimes painted, sometimes covered with a coating of some sort,
all depending on the year.)

Anyone want to confirm/deny this? (I admit i havent looked at the
headliner in a 78 in a long while.)
