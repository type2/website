Subject: NJ inspection woes

Hey folks- I've p-mailed a couple of you and thought I'd ask the list in 
general (at least the NJ residences).

My '77 just failed safety inspection due to the rust ("no sharp edges 
allowed") and because my front seat springs/frame is poking through.  Short 
of having the rust fixed and replacing my front seats, the bus will never 
pass inspection.

The only options I can think of is to find a more sympathetic garage 
(suggestions welcome) or to register it as an historic vehicle, which puts 
restrictions on how I can use it, and how many miles I can put on it per 
year.

Anybody in NJ (or other states) have any experience in this?  Talk about a 
royal PITA, especially since it is my only vehicle right now.

Thanks for any suggestions or ideas

Patrick
'77 Westy
Madison, NJ
