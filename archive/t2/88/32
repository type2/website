Ray,

Alas, the position of the various ports on various carbs is a very
carb-specific matter :-(  Since I have not owned a bus like yours, I can't
say for sure which port does what on your carbs.

Vacuum advance connects to ported vacuum.

Ray, I strongly suggest you do!  They have all sorts of uses on a bus.  At
this point in time, my recommendation is that you go out and buy a
mity-vac at your flaps.  They are less than $20 and include not only a
gauge, but a vacuum pump.  The vacuum pump is very useful for bleeding
your brakes, the gauge will let you tune and check your engine.  A very
useful all-'round tool!

The ideal solution!!!  Please, someone with stock dual carbs, go and have
a look!  I would go out to Springfield and take some pics of Barry's '72,
but I promised my boss I would come in to work today, even tho it is a
holiday.
