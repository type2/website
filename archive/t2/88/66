Check the idle circuit. Driving around may have gotten some junk into the 
fuel system which naturally headed straight for the idle circuit.

Have had this same problem with most of my VW carbs and other brands too.

Remove the jets - clean them and their holes - clean them, put them into 
your mouth and see if you can suck air through them. Usually a bit of 
sucking or blowing with clean them out.

Also verify the timing and dwell. Be sure you set your timing when the 
engine was idling very slowly to get the right initial timing. Also check 
the other stuff like linkage adjustment, etc.
