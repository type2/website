Steve and List Volks,

Ohhhh, now my head hurts.  I was feeling very
comfortable with the top port (on the right of
the carb) attaching to the advance on the dizzy. 
And the other vacuum port attaching to the lower
one (on the left of the carb).  

My concern all along is that there is this other
port, which appears to be vacuum and is currently
capped off, below the air cleaner assembly on the
thing that connects the two carbs.   Now I'm not
sure that even the advance vacuum line is
correct.   

Steve, I guesss first I need to know whether port
or manifold connects to the advance on the dizzy.
 I really do not want to buy a vacuum guage. 
Maybe I will have to.  

Anyone have a stock dual solex setup that can
take a look at there carbs and dizzy for me?  

Thanks,
