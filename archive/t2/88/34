I have a big assortment of license plates from different towns throughout 
Germany.  They mount really nice on the rear compartments of buses 71-79.  I 
was collecting them and am cleaning out the leftovers.  I'd say $10 a set 
plus shipping.  If you want drop me a line.  SORRY NO (WOB) plates. Also have 
a 76 Non-pop westy for sale, US spec here,  around 750-1000 $'s.....
