To get the ends of that link out from either the EGR valve or the
throttle valve, just use a screwdriver and pop either side of the link
off.  Comes off real easy if you pry at the correct angle.

hope this ascii art doesn't get mangled:


------------egr-link---------\
screwdriver blade here  ->   |
and just twist to pop      --o-------  <- throttle arm
link out                     |
