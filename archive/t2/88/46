Subject: Re: [T2] Headliner material

The headliner is indeed wood with a vinyl wallpaper-like covering.  I
removed the vinyl as it was peeling and partly missing.  Then I removed the
wood part and painted it white and reinstalled.  I left the old glue and
painted over it and got that textured original look.  YMMV, Jay
