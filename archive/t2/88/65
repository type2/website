Subject: it never fails...

Hello fellow T2'ers,
Just thought I'd offer a 77 progress report. Thought other people might 
identify with the constant chase of trying to keep the bus at 100%, hell 
even 90% would be fine! Spent the weekend working on the heating and exhaust 
system, finally got the heat working reasonably well and smelling tolerable 
(new heaterboxes are on!). Offered to drive my father in law to the airport 
last night, in the bus, take the dog along. You know, use the bus like a 
regular car in the winter kind-of-thing. Anyway, i am driving, grinning, we 
get about a mile down the road, i signal to turn and my signal lever sticks, 
then it wont come back, i wiggle it a little, and boom, no more signals, 
lever wobbles all over... dang it. i feel like i sold my soul to the local 
vw parts supplier..
TYhe beat goes on (i guess), someday the whole bus will be replacement 
parts... will it still be a 77?
-jeremy
