Subject: Re: [T2] Insulation Ideas

FYI: Just did some insulating this weekend.
Experimented a bit on this first run. used a
combination of reflectix and styrofoam board (that has
foil side) and carpet on the floor.

I thought the foam board would deaden sound better and
it was cheaper than reflectix. (especially because I
had a leftover piece in the shed.)

I cut the foamboard in long strips to fit between the
ribs on the rear walls and the door. (I've now got a
squeak that I think is the sliding door latch cables
rubbing agains the styrofoam.)

I put reflectix in the front doors and Under the rear
seat.

Reflextix under the front mat. (Although reflectix is
basically two layers of bubble wrap, it does NOT pop
much under my 190 lbs. and hiking boots.)

Stuffed reflectix and styrofoam odds and ends into the
 nose. Filled any gaps with fiberglass batting my
neighbor tossed.

Carpet and padding on the floors and the rear deck.

Wrapped the heater pipe with reflectix and foam tape.


1. The bus is noticably warmer inside.

2. I can no longer hear every clank and grind in the
engine.  but, truth be told, the noise level is still
HIGH on the freeway.

In round #2 (spring?), i plan to:

1. replace all the panels with fresh masonite,
suitably decorated with folk art. I'll put a layer of
reflectix under each panel in addition to the
foamboard.

2. foam board/plywood under the carpet.

3. Glue something sound obsorbing around and stuffed
in the front pedestals.

4. Squirt expando insulation foam in all the ribs and
voids.

5. glue/tape reflectix on the ceiling against the
sheet metal. Replace the headliner with soft fabric
(got some tiger strip stuff!).

6. Full ear-coverage headphones for the radio.
