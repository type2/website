Subject: 78' Front Seats for sale

I was able to locate a nice set of vanagon front seats to replace my worn
ones. I have the old seats if anyone is interested. They are the
green/brown plaid, no major holes or tears, just need new foam and
recovering to be perfect. I kept the passenger swivel for my new seat,
slides on perfectly. Anyhow p-mail me if interested, and make an offer. I
live in Arlington, VA . I would mail if you pay shipping....
