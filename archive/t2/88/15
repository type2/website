Nope the switch comes and goes and comes again.  Off the top of my
head from owning almost all of these is like.  '76 has switch, mid '77 no
switch, mid '78 reappears, '79? (never had one), then I think pretty much
all vanagons excepting some CA models possibly have the switch.

Definitely a lot of '77 is without the switch though, Bosch's first attempt
at using the rate of throttle opening for enrichment.  Problems end up
when different ECU's, AFM's, harnesses get mixed as most anything will
run on most anything to some extent if it physically plugs up.  There is
a page on the vanagon file archives that list proper Bosch numbers for
all parts year by year but alas the file archive seems kaput at this moment.
Karl knows most all these combinations by heart though, he is the man
to ask.
