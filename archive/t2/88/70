Hi all,
Back at the pc here from BBB.  Had a good time, too good Friday night.
Congratulations to all the raffle winners, especially "dirty butt" Joel
who won most the stuff.  He paid his dues.  Bring a chair next time
Joel.:)  Congratulations to Ronnie, John, Lou and all those that helped to
make it a very good show that did some real good for some folks that can
use a little help.
Trip home was uneventful except I passed the Buskatiers west of
Flagstaff.
Thanks to everyone.
John K.
