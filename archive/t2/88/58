SO PACK YOUR WINTER TOYS, AND PUT THE AAA CARD IN YOUR WALLET, 'CAUSE I SMELL A ROAD TRIP!!!!!  YEAH, I KNOW THIS IS SORT OF LAST MINUTE-ISH, BUT WHAT THE HELL?  ASK YOUR BUS BUDDIES ON THE LIST IF LAST YEAR'S SHIN-DIG WASN'T A GOOD TIME.  YOU BET IT WAS!  
 
THERE'S ELECTRIC FOR HEAT, etc. AT OTTER LAKE, AS WELL AS RUNNING WATER, AND OTHER COOL FEATURES... but who really wants an indoor pool or cable t.v. at every site, discount skiing, or jacuzzis?????  Winter camping is about being tough and getting cold!   NAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
