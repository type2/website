Subject: [T2] Weird thumping noise when driving

Hi,

I've been driving my bus around and I noticed a thumping noise that 
seems to come from the wheels/transmission on the right side (it 
get's faster with speed) - the noise isn't always present but 
sometimes it rises to a very distinct thump just like a drum. I also 
noticed that when I apply brakes it get's worst. Any of you guys 
has any ideas?
