Probably not.  It's possible that the mixture could lean out a little at 
high rpms with the 2-liter vs. the 1800 but I didn't find that to be the 
case when I made the same switch.  A smaller air correction jet would 
probably take care of that issue if it existed.

Might be, but it's not due to the effect of more displacement on the 
jetting.  By all means you need to verify what jets are actually in the 
carbs so that nice 2.0 engine can enjoy a full and productive life.
