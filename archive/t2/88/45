Try a product called Reflectix.  I'm living in Alberta, Canada & it's
freezing here.  Not like the pussy Tenessee/Southern US freezing (you'd all
perish here).  My whole bus is fitted with this product which is amazing as
its totally flexible, never rots and can be cut & made into any shape with
simple sissors.
Product is available at any Home Depot (yukkk)

Caio & good luck
