Re inspection in NJ-  You can cover (bridge) rusty areas with aluminum
body tape (it comes in 4" rolls) and touch up with the same color tape.
This worked for me in rocker areas.  Regarding seats, I never knew they
looked that close, but I use pile seat covers that feel great (warmer in
winter, won't get you singed when in the sun) that would likely hide any
seat imperfections.
