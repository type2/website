I don't have the Bentley manual in front of me so I can't tell you waht 
it connects to at the factory.

You could make a temporary change to the system (no cutting of wires).

When do you want to charge the battery? Only when the key is on. So you 
need something - anything - that is "hot" with the key on (which assumes 
the engine is running when the key is on). If you have a dead coach 
battery and the key is on then the cranking battery will be drained.

My EGR light only comes on every x-thousands of miles. If you connect it 
to the EGR light then it only charges the battery every x-thousands of 
miles. <grin!>

You could hook it to the coil (the key or + side) or to the same circuit 
that the radio is wired to if your radio is only on when the key is on. 
You could wire it to the lighting (tail light) which would only connect 
the coach battery to the cranking battery if the parking lights or 
headlights were on eliminating any drains on the cranking battery during 
cold starts. You could use a normally closed relay that is connected to 
the oil pressure light so that it only charged once the oil pressure 
light was off. I'd have to develop that circuit a bit more in my head.

You could even just put a switch on the dash so you could choose when 
the coach battery was charging.
