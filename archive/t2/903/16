Click and Clack (or was it Frick and Frack:)?
have closed up shop and gone to work for Hezbollah.
A Click from the solenoid is usually a good thing,
an audible indication the solenoid is trying
to do it's job as an electromagnet, and pull in a yoke
which throws the starter gear against the flywheel
engagement teeth (Clack).
If successful, the solenoid also makes a connection for
current to pass to the armature and the starter will turn.
All of this activity is subject to Murphy's Law.
Hence the term "Klunk", another no-starting non-sequitur.

The popular starter relay modification doesn't change any of this.
It serves to direct more current to the solenoid by using the
long path from battery through the ignition switch and back to the solenoid
as only the signal for the relay, and not for the current the solenoid requires,
which can be degraded by corrosion and resistance in several locations.
This is solenoid engagement current, not primary starter motor current.
The ignition switch itself is not up to the task of excessive cranking.
It can cause the small contacts in the switch to overheat and recede
into the switch body plastic material, and stop functioning.

Doesn't the clack and click mean that the starter is getting power via
the switch (ie the switch is good) but that the starter isn't doing the
right thing with the signal?
