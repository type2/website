Hi List,

    How about some Trivia, its Friday right?

Where did this whole Bon Ami ring/seal technique come from??? Anyone?








GET THE RIGHT ANSWER AND WIN A COOKIE!



see below: For the answer as per Mechanics Illustrated, circa spring 1956.





















Due to a conflict between the engine block and piston ring Nickel steel/cast
iron content causing a slow ring sealing problem. The newly designed 1955
Chevrolets 265 V8's, had an oil consumption problem until several months or
many thousand miles use, if at all.
    GM's factory recommended fix..............a rag filled with Bon Ami, the
engine idling at about 2000 RPM's, "Pat" the rag over the carburetor intake
several times. Change oil (no oil filter on 1955 Chevy 265 V8's) and drive
for several hundred miles, checking oil use. When oil use stabilized at an
acceptable amount, 1 quart per 1000 miles. Problem is declared fixed! This
would be done as many times as it took to seal the engine. What the final
outcome was, at say 50,000 miles is not clear! Although I have an idea.
    As a side note: Some un-excepted fix's were, block the airflow in front
of the radiator, and drive until the engine overheated several times,
causing the rings to "seat".
    Also tried, but rejected, was to pull the heads and "Hone" the cylinders
with a very rough stone, in a "flat" pattern. This was rejected due to cost.
WOW!

Got to love those 30 day warranty's of the fifty's.
