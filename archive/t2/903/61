Subject: VDO Tacho

Hi,

I've just managed to find myself an old VDO tachometer for my '71 Bus ;-).
It has what I think is a part number on the back: 230/98/1.  There are three
terminals on the back (and one "blank" terminal).  What do I connect them
to?  One must connect to the coil, one to ground, and one to a positive
supply I think.  From left to right, the terminals are labelled "-12", (the
blanked one is labelled "6"), "15" and "+".

Thanks,
Bruce
