I have had 5 engines, all hydraulic, each one wanted
different oil! On some I went to higher viscosity - up
to straight 60 (in summer!!!) and others required
thinner oil to quiet lifters. I think you're on the
right track with experimenting, but I also think you
are way too light and should use a straight 30 as a
starting point. 20/50 seemed to work well most of the
time. (for me - your situation may / will be
different)
