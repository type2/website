Mark-
When I built this compressor, I noticed the oil mist,
so I  broke it down and swapped pc from engine to pump.
The engine pc rings were  seated, good compression and
no visible emissions. Same result, oil through  the pump.
That was over three years ago, I use it a lot.
This leads me  to believe their hypothesis, and I don't see
a fix for that. Do you have  this problem?

hey Dave  yes mine kinda does the same.  I found that it would  gum up a Da 
sander ,so I only use it for sandblasting and blowing stuff.  I  wouldn't use 
it for painting at all  later  mark D
