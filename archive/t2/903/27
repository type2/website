I can vouch for the Weber too.  I've not found the incentive to  convert to FI when mine runs as good as it does with the Weber.   And a 009!  And it's so simple even I can understand it and work  on it.  I'vee had it for seven or eight years.  If I had FI,  I wouldn't change it.  But if I needed to get a bus on the road as  simply and reliably as possible, a single Weber is the way.  
  
  I am considering trying an SVDA distributor just to see what difference  there is.  But I've got no complaints as it is.  Might get me  another mile or two per gallon.  I wouldn't expect any more  power.  Cheers....KR


Some are for or against the FI setup and there have been about a million 
posts about the Weber carb you can get most anywhere so you can research it, 
but I have used the Weber on 3 different buses over 6 years and never had a 
problem with them, and you can get one NEW as opposed to a used set of carbs 
that are 33 years old. Just my thoughts.

Good luck,
