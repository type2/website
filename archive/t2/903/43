I took the bus to an auto electric place. they could not figure it out

bad because it was not closing consistently. is it possible that new relays
are often bad?


I am not a bus specialist, but is the dimmer relay in a metal case?  I looked 
at a 71 schematic and there isn't a ground wire running to it.  Based on that 
I am guessing there is a metal clip on the case of the relay that should clip 
into a hole where the relay mounts.  Be sure it is touching metal somewhere 
or the relay will not have a ground.
