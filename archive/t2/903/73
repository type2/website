     Now she starts right up and sound good until she warms up and then she just won't idle. 
   
  Sounds to me like the electromagnetic fuel shutoff valve may be clogged.  It's idling when cold because of the choke.  Back the fuel shutoff valve out a turn or 2 and see if it will idle.  If so, the valve is clogged or not working.  gt
