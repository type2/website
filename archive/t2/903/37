Subject: high beams '71 - dimmer relay?

Greetings:
I have had ongoing problems with my 71. For some time, the high beams had
been stuck on the high (bright) position. Previously, the problem had been
the turn signal switch. After disassembling, I noticed that the wire
controling the power to the relay was no longer attached. I resoldered the
wire back in its proper place. (I had another assembl'y that I could use as
a pattern.) Now I could hear the clicking that you should hear when pulling
on the turn signal lever to turn on the brights, which I didn't hear before.
The dimmer would work a few times, then intermittentaly the lights would
just go out.  Often you just hear the click. After a few brief tries, the
high beams stay on, or all lights go out.. The low beams will not come on.
After tracking all wires that I could (we all know its a mess down there),
including the turn signal switch, I decided to replace the dimmer relay. I
had heard that often water gets down through the windsheild or other areas
and shorts it out. I did this, with no change.
I took the bus to an auto electric place. they could not figure it out
either. They tested the relay and I believe he said he thought the relay was
bad because it was not closing consistently. is it possible that new relays
are often bad? I am not sure B-D will take it back, but I'll buy another one
to try, unless someone else has any other suggestions. My other option is to
bypass and put a floor switch on, which I don't really want to do. I can't
drive the car legally here because of vehicle inspection requires high beams
to work. Also, there are no longer VW folks here (New Orleans) since the
hurricane.
Any thoughts?
thanks
