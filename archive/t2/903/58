I have had this problem on my '78 for a long time.  It is pretty much  
constant now.  I have been all over the spectrum as far as oils, and I've  added 
some additives that claim to quiet lifters, but no go.
I have just resigned myself to hear it untill I have time to rebuid the  
engine/convert from FI to carbs and change the auto to a 4 speed, which,  
according to current projections, will be sometime in the year 2020--if nothing  else 
comes up.
