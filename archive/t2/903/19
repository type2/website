Subject: Camping Anyone?

Hey Folks,
       My plans this summer had included Buses Of The Corn, but for a variety of reasons (not the least of which is the price of gas!) I'm not going to make it. Instead, I'm going camping that weekend in Luray, Virginia, August 18-20. Anyone else out there interested in coming? There is at least one other bus, maybe two, coming along so far. The campground is kinda pricey at $38.00/night with water and electric, but it has 2 pools, water slide, and mini golf (all at extra cost though). The campground was voted "Camping Resort of the Year" in 2001, and "Facility of the Year" in 2003, for whatever that's worth. Here is the link to the campground:   http://www.campluray.com/

It's about 5 miles from Luray Caverns and close to Skyline Drive. Also, they DO NOT allow sharing sites. If you need any more info, please pmail me.    Thanks,    Jeff
