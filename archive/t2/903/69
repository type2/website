Subject: Troubles with idle

Hi list, 
I'm having troubles getting my 1970 bus to idle when warm. 
Here's a quick run down:
The engine is a 1600cc that only has approximately 10k miles on it after purchasing from BAP. 34Pict-3 carb, 009 dizzy.
Last fall she gave up on me and has been sitting ever since.  Recently I fiddled around and found that the points were busted. 
I dialed her in with new points, adjusted the valves and gave it a turn.  Now she starts right up and sound good until she warms up and then she just won't idle.  I pulled the carb and replaced the fuel filter thinking maybe it was gunked up after sitting for so long. Everything looked clean, but it still won't idle. 

Now I'm alittle out of tune myself with vw knowledge and limited on time to play, so any help will be much appreciated.

I'm hoping this is an easy fix since I feel pretty confident that the engine itself is in top shape except for this issue. 

Please help if you can or let me know if you more info is required to diagnose. 

Thanks for your time, -Chris
