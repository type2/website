Well, you're up against good old PV=NRT.

Anytime you compress air you will raise its temperature.  In a "normal"
compressor the air has a chance to radiate its heat from the storage tank
and air hose.  With a Volksair, the volume is so great that the air stays
hot.

So, get a 500 gallon ASME rated tank, immerse it in cold water, and you
can get cold air from your Volksair!  :)
