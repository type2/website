This clip is only used on 66-69 Type 2s, the clip is not utilized as a 
ground, but to secure the relay to an appropriate bracket (also used on 
66-71 Beetles & Ghias as well).  70-79 Type 2s are plugged directly into a 
Relay Plate, which is part of the Fusebox, thus not requiring the clip on 
the top.  In fact for a while, the relay supplied by VW (411 941 583 B or C) 
for the early 70s applications didn't even have the clip.  When the "411" 
relay was superseded many, many years ago to the 111 941 583, the clip was 
retained for use on the earlier models and could still be plugged into the 
Relay Plate as described above.

Headlight Relays are not grounded, except through the circuit(s) in use.

For proper wiring of the relay, see my PDF at:

At VWG/Airhead Parts, we only sell Genuine VW Headlight Relays.  They're 
made in Hungary and still a bit pricey, but they WORK.  Relays we've tried 
in the past from Mexico or Brazil (both in PLASTIC cases btw) tend to be 
"flaky" in quality.
