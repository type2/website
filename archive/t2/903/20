Mark-
When I built this compressor, I noticed the oil mist,
so I broke it down and swapped pc from engine to pump.
The engine pc rings were seated, good compression and
no visible emissions. Same result, oil through the pump.
That was over three years ago, I use it a lot.
This leads me to believe their hypothesis, and I don't see
a fix for that. Do you have this problem?
Dave

     I also have that problem of ring sealing, even with Total Seal gapless
     piston rings, and it still lets significant oil through the pump,
     which is of concern for pre-paint surface blasting contamination.
     They told me the seal is too good, and the compressor is pulling it
     through the intake valve guides. Maybe so. What do you think?

Hey Guys  I think the problem is that you can't seat them like you do in
a vehicle by putting a load on them and then creating back pressure.  I
would think that they will seat in time.  later  mark D
