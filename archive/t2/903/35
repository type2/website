Wasn't  there some procedure involving Bon Ami polishing compound for
seating  difficult rings?

For the valve guides, could valve guide seals be  added?

Or, would it be better to just make a big oil seperator and  leave

hey george   The bon ami or clorox  is a last gasp  thing.   valve seals 
might help. seperator would do wonders, what do  they cost?  later mark D
