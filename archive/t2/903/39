Subject: Redline/Weber Software Needed!

I misplaced my install CDs somewhere when I moved. The are for the
Redline/Weber EFI kit.

My DC is up and running, but now I have to tune it! Does anyone have or know
of someone who has this system? Would you be willing to email the install
file or ftp it to me?

Redline Weber has good customer service, but their downloads are corrupt and
they don't know how to fix it.

I would love to drive it to the Colorado Bug In this Sunday!

Thanks!

Jon
