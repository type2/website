While it's likely an electrical problem, you may also consider the starter
bushing.  

I once bought a beetle cheap from a mechanic who couldn't chase down the
"ground" problems.  It bump started and ran great but he couldn't get it to
start with the new starter, battery or bypassing the switch at the starter.

I put a $0.39 bushing in it and was off and running.

Just a thought,
