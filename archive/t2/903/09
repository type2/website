Subject: RE: [T2] Ign. Switch replaced, now starter failing

Check the voltage AT the solenoid.  If it's low, use a relay near the engine 
to sens  '12v' to the solenoid.  Many times it's the wiring, NOT the switch 
that causes many starting failures.

Dave,

Just replaced the ignition switch, battery about a year old, new
transmission ground a few years back, showed 12.5vdc at the ignition switch
terminal 30 when I was installing the switch.  Solenoid seems to be doing
it's thing, as I can hear it.

Since I can hear the solenoid, that means everything up to that point on the
circuit is functioning right?

So is it mildly probable that it is the starter motor?
