Subject: Hydraulic lifter tapping!

Hey guys,

    Well, I have ONE hydraulic lifter that taps. Sometimes, the tapping is
really really bad, but after a while, it smooths out and goes away after a
short drive. The lifter seems to lose it's prime after only no more than a
week of inactivity. Tonight I changed the oil, the filter, and that little
black cap thing that comes off and has that metal basket in it. I cleaned it
all and put 2 quarts of 5W-20 and 2 quarts of 5W-30 Synthetic and the motor
seemed to run a bit smoother and the rattling was far less noticable (to the
level that it's at where I would basically consider it normal).

The thing is though, I'm wonder if perhaps I need to do some sort of
adjusting. It seems to me that even with hydraulic lifters, there is some
degree of valve lash that needs to be taken into consideration.

I've never adjusted the valve lash on a Bus motor and have absolutely no clue.
I think I may get my Muir's book out, but I thought I'd ask you guys just the
same.

Any advice? Does that sound like it should fix my problem?


Thanks!

Todd
