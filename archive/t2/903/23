Doesn't the clack and click mean that the starter is getting power via 
the switch (ie the switch is good) 
Possibly.  If the switch has bad contacts(internally or where the wire slides 
on) though you could be sending a low voltage due to voltage drop at that bad 
contact point
but that the starter isn't doing the 
right thing with the signal?
Also, possible, but any bad connections, including that of the ground strap 
at the trans, will also cause a voltage drop such that you will not have enough 
to crank the starter over, just the solenoid will click.
