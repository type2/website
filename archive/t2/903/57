Subject: World's Worst Police Chases (Bus Sighting)

At least I think that's the show.

They had an incident where a crazed, gun-toting maniac had holed up in a 
service station.  While they tried to disarm him, he strutted around and a 
white-on-brown bay kept coming into the picture by the station's pumps.  It 
was sort of dirty, but nice to see anyway.

Was this a list member's ride?
