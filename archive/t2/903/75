Hi,

I should offer a small correction; the blanked terminal is labelled "-6".
So they are in fact:
-12
-6
15
+

The illuminating bulb has seperate terminals on a little plastic bulb holder
(same as speedo and other instuments).

I'm thinking that the "-12"/"-6" could be for 12v and 6v, and 15 could be
for terminal 15 on the coil....mmmm...and I thought this was going to be
easy ;-).

Thanks for the suggestions so far....will let you know how I get along...

Cheers,
Bruce.
