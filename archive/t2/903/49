Subject: Re: [T2] high beams '71 - dimmer relay?

This clip is only used on 66-69 Type 2s, the clip is not utilized as a
ground, but to secure the relay to an appropriate bracket (also used on
66-71 Beetles & Ghias as well).  70-79 Type 2s are plugged directly into a
Relay Plate, which is part of the Fusebox, thus not requiring the clip on
the top.  In fact for a while, the relay supplied by VW (411 941 583 B or C)
for the early 70s applications didn't even have the clip.  When the "411"
relay was superseded many, many years ago to the 111 941 583, the clip was
retained for use on the earlier models and could still be plugged into the
Relay Plate as described above.

Headlight Relays are not grounded, except through the circuit(s) in use.

For proper wiring of the relay, see my PDF at:

At VWG/Airhead Parts, we only sell Genuine VW Headlight Relays.  They're
made in Hungary and still a bit pricey, but they WORK.  Relays we've tried
in the past from Mexico or Brazil (both in PLASTIC cases btw) tend to be
"flaky" in quality.

I am not a bus specialist, but is the dimmer relay in a metal case?  I
looked
at a 71 schematic and there isn't a ground wire running to it.  Based on
that
I am guessing there is a metal clip on the case of the relay that should
clip
into a hole where the relay mounts.  Be sure it is touching metal somewhere
or the relay will not have a ground.
