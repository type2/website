Subject: RE: [T2] Ign. Switch replaced, now starter failing

That isnt always the case.When my bus had a starting problem this spring my
solenoid was clicking so I assumed the starter was bad.After roll starting
it all the way home to missouri from arkansas,I took the starter and
solenoid off and dropped it off at the local electric motor guy.He called me
up and said my starter looked great but the insides of the solenoid came
apart in pieces when he took it off.To my ears it sounded like the solenoid
was working fine,but apparently not.
