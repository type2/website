Subject: Parting out a 72 Westy-soon

Hello, I just bought a complete 72 westy. I will be
parting it out after August 11. I got it to run after
it had sat for a little over five years, but the motor
has a knock in it. Tranny seems to be good. It has a
coplete interior, upper cot looks good, has childs cot
that looks good. The frame is totally rusted out that
is why I am parting it. The front and sliding doors
seem good, the rear hatch and engine lid are good. The
ignition switch and all door locks work and uses the
same key( so if needed a matching set with key). 

If any one is interested in any Parts let me know and
as I am parting it I will take pictures and let you
know what is available. I am Located in POCATELLO,
IDAHO.

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
