Very nice work.

The only criticism I have is that you should have done the latching inside.
The way you have those latches mounted pulls the top sideways against he
hinge bolts that go through the thin body (roof) metal on the other side.

If you have them tight enough to keep the roof from rattling then the
vibration of driving around is slowly going to tear that metal over the
next 10 years or so. As the holes start to oval they will get worse faster.

You should look at it again and see if you can do the latches inside the
bus so they pull the "open" side straight down rather than sideways.

I see the slider track right below where you have the latches mounted.
Perhaps a Dzus fastener plate attached to the top and drill a hole up
through that rail to put a 1/4 turn D-ring Dzus fastener through. With the
rail right there as a handy place to store the fastener (with a short
lanyard attached) when the top is open.

needed to find a US dealer.
