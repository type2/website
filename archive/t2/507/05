Then Gerald said:

Probably a short run racer. Removed everything that scavenges power from
the engine. No fan, no generator. Pull the whole assembly to reduce weight
rather than just removing the belt.

That hanging fan is his ONLY cooling. But when the engine is run for under
10 minutes at a time...

Recharge is done at the wall socket.
