Your local auto paint store will be able to mix you up some but you are going to have to reduce it before you attempt to apply it with a brush so ask for instructions and get the approperiate reducer. Otherwise, it will be too thick and be hard to apply.

I bought a spray can of L54D for my super beetle before I sold it years ago. I had a very good experience with the color match (you have to remove the oxidation from the rest of the paint first to come close) and the price was good. I can't remember how far the can went...

You could try an online source like <http://www.paintscratch.com/> although I think it's too expensive. I've heard from a few folks many NAPA locations can mix paint and give you a spray can. I would try them first.

WW's catalog used to have L90D in the spary can. I've been watching their site for a long time but they haven't stocked it for about 2 years.
