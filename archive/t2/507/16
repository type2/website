Subject: Replace 75 F.I. with 78 Looking for parts

My 75 bus has a 78 engine but still using the 75 fuel injection. It
seems to run hot and the oil pressure goes down in relation to the temp.
When first started in 30 degree weather it will pump 65 psi oil pressure
but quickly warms to 180 deg. oil temp (sensor is in the sump plate
under the dip stick). Oil pressure will drop to 25 to 30 psi at this
temp. I suspect the engine is running lean because the Fuel injection
was designed for the smaller 1800 instead of the 2000 that's in there. I
have replaced all vacuum lines and find no leaks. I have installed a new
oil pump about 1000 miles ago with only a slight  improvement. After
removing the old pump I found only slight wear. The engine was rebuilt
2000 miles ago and hopefully I measured everything accurately.

I am considering upgrading to the 78 fuel injection to see if this
improves the oil temp. I have many of the parts from the 78 f.i. but am
missing the air flow meter and ECU. I also don't know if things like the
double relay and vapor recovery stuff will work with the 78 f.i.

Any suggestions or leads on good used parts would be most appreciated. I
have checked most of the parts suppliers recommended by the list and
find I cant afford new parts right now and am reluctant to spend a lot
more considering I am not sure this will fix the problem.

Thanks,
Tom
