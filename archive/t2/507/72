Sounds reasonable. I may be (okay, I almost certainly am) betraying my 
near-total ignorance of the ignition system, but is the CDI box something 
that would (could) be installed along with something like the Pertronix 
electronic ignition, or instead of it?

Does anyone know how good the documentation for these sorts of things are? 
(I remember my first carburator rebuild consisted of reading Muir -- who 
simply said "go get a rebuild kit and follow the instructions" -- only to 
discover that the "instructions" consisted of nothing more than an 
exploded view of the carb. Oh sure, I got it done okay, but it took three 
days.)
