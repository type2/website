I would strongly suspect the flexible lines connecting the wheel cylinders
to the body of the bus.  Over time these swell shut from the inside. This
has little effect on application of the brakes as the tons of force the
system generates will force the fluid past the blockage but much effect on
retraction of the pads which is effected by a set of rather weak springs.
