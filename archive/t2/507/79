Hiya Christopher,

Let me take the opportunity to back up Richard's comments.

Definitely try the NAPA store in your area.  Many have a paint matching 
service.  They can look up the formula for L90D and reproduce it on the spot.  Put 
it in spray cans too!  AND it's cheaper than the online guys.  The tech who 
mixed my paint (L620 Savannah Beige) actually went out into the parking lot to 
check it against the old stuff on the vehicle.  Great service and a good 
product.

Regarding Wolfsburg West............it has been my experience with WW that 
they have miscellaneous parts and products in their warehouse down in Corona 
that simply are not in their catalog.  Paint seems to be one of those items.  I 
could never find Gray-Black in their catalog but people kept on telling me they 
had it in spray cans.  So, I gave 'em a call.  Sure enough, it was there.  
You might try the same with Pastel White.
