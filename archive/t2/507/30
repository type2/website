> I didn't say it *couldn't* be done. I just said it would need
 maintenance to match the driving pattern. I'm pretty sure Karl knows
how to take care of that. If he's using a full tank of fuel to run 200
 miles, it's certainly not running lean.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, it is not lean at sea level.....a little too rich, but I believe that makes the engine run a little
cooler. At 3000-4000 feet, it runs a lot better. It cruises at 85-90 at the same throttle position.
When the #3 cyl head temp sensor starts to go bad it sends a leaner signal. My top end at sea level goes to 90
and I get 250 miles to a tank..... when this happens I know I am due for a new sensor.
