Subject: T2] brake line fittings anti-sieze 

The lube that is safe for the seals in brake parts is
castor oil based.  PBR make a good one.  If you are
concerned that you will contaminate the fluid use
this. That being said, the brake lines should be a
sealed system and and product used on the threads
should not be able to work its way past the flange
which seals against the bottom of the hole in the
master cylinder, wheel cyl, caliper etc.  If it can
you have more problems your way than contamination of
the fluid to worry about.

A good penetrator compound is worth its weight in
Kombi nose emblems when taking anything like this
apart too.........and a big hammer!
