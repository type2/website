I am certainly an advocate of matching the FI gear to the engine so I
cannot discourage you but I have some further comments.

First, is that 180 degress fahrenheit or celsuis? In fahrenheit degrees
180 degrees (82 celsius) as an operating temperature is not hot, it is
cold.  In celsius degrees 180 degrees (356 fahrenheit) is extremely hot
and you have a real problem. Ideally you would like your oil to be 100
degrees celsius, 210 degrees fahrenheit.

Second, 25-30psi is quite a good pressure at idle but low at speed,
especially at only 180 degrees oil temperature.  Come summer, you will
have a real problem with that as oil pressure and temperature are
inversely proportional as you mention.  Also, what weight oil are you
using?  If it is a standard multi-viscosity oil you might try a heavier
single weight oil if air temperatures where you live do not rule it out.

Third, have you checked the air/fuel mix with an EGR? While very few home
mechanics have one of these most shops will perform this check for a
minimal fee.  This will definitively answer the question of whether you
are running lean or not.  I suspect from your oil temps (presuming they
are in fahrenheit degrees) that you are not running lean.

Fourth, during your rebuild did you check the bearing clearances? with
plastigage? and when you say that you replaced the oil pump did you
replace it with a type4 pump or a type1 pump?  These two questions point
to where I suspect your problem lies.

                             OOK!
