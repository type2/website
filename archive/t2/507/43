What year is your Bus?  What is the location of the charcoal can 
bracket?  Do you have carbs or FI?

I personally like having the tank vent system hooked up, as it helps to 
reduce hydrocarbon emissions.  If you're not concerned about that, then 
you probably need to do something to plug / redirect the vent lines; 
it's probably not a good idea to have the vapor from the tank just 
floating around in your engine compartment.  I will let someone else 
comment on the specifics of doing this, though.

What page in Bentley describes this other sensor / switch?  (I'm not 
familiar with it, mostly because I haven't had to become close personal 
friends with my transmission yet.)  The wiring diagram in Bentley 
should show what the switch connects to.  Pretty sure there's no "Over 
Drive" light on the dash :-)

I'm not sure a high-output coil alone is going to really do much.  I 
guess a h-o coil might allow you to run wider plug gaps, but honestly, 
when properly tuned, my Bus runs *great* with the original 27 year-old 
Bosch black coil.  I think there are better ignition upgrades to be 
had, like installing an electronic ignition in the distributor such as 
Pertronix Ignitor (using the stock Bosch black coil or a Bosch blue 
coil of the correct resistance), or going all the way and installing a 
CDI.

I've heard that CDI can have a real emissions reduction effect, as can 
"second spark" type ignition supplementation systems.

If it were me, I'd certainly remove the fuel tank.  If you have the 
engine out anyway, you might as well pull the tank and repair anything 
tank-related that needs it (vent lines, filler neck, fuel gauge sender, 
etc.)
