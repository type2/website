James,

You are probably going to get a lot of horror stories back on this 
one...VW air cooled engines generally respond to advancing the timing in 
two ways(at the same time)....they do indeed run better and they run a 
*lot* hotter unless you have modified the heads to be ultra low 
compression.

The heads then respond with dropped valves, dropped valve seats, and 
cracks.

This is one place that you want to stick with a factory distributor
and factory advance unless you are drag racing or epect to only get 
20,000 miles out of an engine.

There are better ways to make more power.

This works for both T1 and T4 engines.

Cheers, dave
