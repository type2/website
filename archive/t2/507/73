      Volkswagen Syncro 1987 - 6275  
      1987 Volkswagen Vanagon Syncro All Wheel Drive, 3.4 liter Trans Am engine(1995), Conversion certified by California, AWD, all terrain tires (BFG's), runs great, lots of power, CD player, manual shift, email for more pics,  


Vanagon Syncros have a strong transaxle to begin with, but due to the power of this engine, further measures were taken to make sure that the power went to the road without causing harm to the rest of the parts. The transaxle was rebuilt by a Syncro specialist and he said that it has been reinforced to be strong enough for the engine. The kit used to mount the engine is by Kennedy Engineering Products, and the clutch is a racing clutch (if memory serves it is by LUK). The factory mounting system was modified for the new engine. The power going to the rear wheels comes via Porsche cv joints. A lot of money and care was taken in this conversion. $10,000 was spent to get this power to the wheels, as well as the original money to buy the van. 

Thank you,
