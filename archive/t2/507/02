Subject: rotary conversion

NW connecting Rod in Seattle used to do
this conversion. They might still I'm not sure.
I only saw one but it was nice as the mazda rotary
engine can run up to some pretty high RPM's with
no damage (as I am lead to believe). I remember when
they first started putting the Wankle rotary in
snowmobiles.. they were very competitive on the
track. Light reading on the rotary....
