Hi folks...

I just acquired an 80 Vanagon, so I'm back in the game after parting ways, 
some ways back, with my 77 bus. Said Vanagon didn't start this morning, 
but I'm not (yet) too worried about that as I haven't had time to rule out 
all the easy causes. (Later, perhaps, I will return screaming to the 
list...)

But anyway, I saw this thread and a bunch of unfamiliar acronyms and
product names, which I might have ignored had I not skimmed it and seen
the good Mr. Hayden talking about a 20-25% improvement in mileage and
beaucoup labor savings, at which point my ears perked up.

So what is a "CDI box" exactly?


Regards,
Eric
