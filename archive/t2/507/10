Hi Folks,

Another way to tell if your engine is 78, 79, Cal, or Fed is to check the 
engine number on the case.  For a while I thought I had a true 79 Fed 
engine, but it turns out that a 79 Fed fan shroud was put on a 78 engine 
somewhere in my Bus's life.  IIRC, the case number is forward (FIF) of the 
fan shroud, on the case, near the distributor, facing up (not back).  If the 
case number does not match the fan shroud number, go with the case number 
and make the necessary modifications to get it correct.

Good Luck!
