another thought is to put an o2 sensor on your bus.  While it is kinda a 
pain to install, it gives you instant verification if you're running on 
the lean side (note I didn't say *how* lean, just leaner than 14.7:1).

I have found that a bus that's tuned to pass smog here in cali runs 
waaaaay lean.  When I richened things up, made a whole world of 
difference... (I guess the new EFI helped a bit, too ;)
