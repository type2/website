You can unplug your AFM then hit the key, the engine will start, idle for
a bit then stall,, then won't restart

Least that is what mine does,, I was testing some components, forget to
reconnect the AFM, and started it,, idlesd for a minute,, or 30 seconds,
then it quit as it was out of fuel,, of course I was thinking this,, then
it wouldn't restart!!
Dam EFi,,,,, oppps.. I spotted the AFM plug ,,, LOL dam clumsy idiot
working on it!
