I have also used this method with good results but the
other day I built one of Hoover's bulkhead fittings
out of lamp parts, etc. It worked so incredably well
that it gives me a warm fuzzy feeling knowing that I'm
treating my Bus so good. Try it. It really works GOOD!
I soldered mine instead of using glue but it seems
either way would be equally great.
