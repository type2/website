Rob,

I wouldn't touch it if I were you. It sounds like they have no clear paperwork
(or at least not a title). And it doesn't sound like it's worth $500.00 (unless
both the tranny/motor really ARE in decent shape).

If you're close I would go have a look at it and see what's what. And you could
prolly negioate not to take it if it doesn't drive well.

my $0.02
