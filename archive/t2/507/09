Subject: Re: [T2] 79 Transporter FI having trouble starting and idling -

Hi Chris,

As a previous poster mentioned, it sounds like a vacuum leak.  The later FI 
engines are pretty finicky when it comes to vacuum leaks, and if any of the 
big hoses (brake booster, oil rebreather, etc.) the size of your pinky or 
bigger are loose, cracked, or missing, your engine will not idle well -- 
there's too much air leaning out the mixture.

That said, check your Auxiliary Air Regulator.  It's supposed to add a 
faster (or more normal) idle to a COLD engine, and if it's toast, your 
engine will not run well when cold but run fine when warm.  Check the 
Type2.com "Bartno-Tek" section under Fuel Injection. 
(http://www.type2.com/bartnik/tech.htm)  There's a good picture and 
explanation of what it is and what it does.  I had a similar problem on my 
79 and it turned out I had the Aux Air vacuum lines plumbed wrong.  Five 
minutes and a few reconnections later, and my Bus runs great!

As for the [initial start--wait 10 minutes--final start] problem, I defer to 
Bob Hoover who said, "VWs got a sense of humor..."

Good Luck!
