Subject: Re: Converting a 78 to a 74 type exhuast system

Ted,
I recently converted my 77 to a 74 exhaust. Besides the alternator bracket
you
will need 4 new pieces of lower tin and also the heat riser tubes from the
'74
boxes (my tubes came with my boxes).  The new altenator bracket attaches at
the lower side to a bolt on the rear outboard side of your heat box.  If it
is
a rusted blob like mine is you may want to try and get it removed prior to
installing the heat box.  I'm still looking for an altenator bracket myself,
I'll probably just fabricate one as all the ones that I've found in the
 wrecker yards are rusty POS.

 Good luck,
Drew
