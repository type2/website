Fella down in San Antonio had a stripped-down 914 with a rotary conversion
and that thing would absolutely scream!  That being said, bear in mind that
it was a 1500 pound car built for racing.  Put that same motor in a 4000 bus
with lots of wind-drag and you're going to have a real dog.  

Buses need lots of low-end torque to get the beasts moving and to keep them
moving against lots of wind resistance.  And while those rotary engines
don't mind high RPM (I think the 914 conversion saw nearly 8000 RPM fairly
regularly) they're not designed to run under heavy loads at high RPM for
extended periods of time.  Personally I think that conversion in a bus would
be a bad idea.
