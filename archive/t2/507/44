Subject: pushrod tube seals, torque spec on rocker arm nuts

10 ft-lbs seems awfully low.

I replaced the pushrod tube seals in my '72 1700 T-IV this weekend.  I checked the torque spec on the rocker arm mounting nuts and Muir says it is 10 ft-lbs on the T-IV.  This seems awfully low, infact, I could hardly notice the "click" on my torque wrench.

How will these not loosen?  What is the group tought on this?

Cheers,
