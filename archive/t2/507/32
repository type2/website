Subject: Westy Curtains

Calling all curtain-buffs!
I'm looking to put curtains in my 73 Westy.  I'm starting from nothing.  
Do they just use snaps or are there rods also?
How many curtains..some say 7, some say 10?
anywhere that has patterns or measurements if I want to sew my own?
Better to just get a full set from BD or Gowesty or is there more hardware I'll need?
thanks all in advance!  -Chris
