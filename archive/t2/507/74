Can't you get it at a local paintshop that sells
car-paint? I bought 2 litres of 'Velvet
green'/'Samtgr|n' L512 last year. I couldn't get it by
asking for the name, but the code 'L512' opened doors
:-)
The paintshop guys showed me a booklet with
VW-coloursamples sorted by L-code.

I got the version that can be rolled onto the vehicle,
but they also sold the real stuff to spray paint (2
component as I understood).
