I phoned Steve and Debbie at webcam a few months to ask some questions and
they had this to say:

- can you use solid lifters with a hydraulic cam?

yes.

- can you do the reverse?

no, the ramp at the bottom is designed for each application and the valve
train geometry for solid lifters expects the ramp of the solid cam

- what about pushrods?

The pushrods have to match the lifters. One reason is strength (hydraulic
rods are stronger), another is length (solid rods are longer), another is
compatibility (hydraulic rods have an oiling hole down the center), another
is composition (hydraulic rods are all steel and will expand differently
than the aluminum rods with the steel tips).

- harness of the grind?

not a problem. 

- general wisdom or using new lifters with an old cam?

new should go with new was all they would say.
