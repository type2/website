Hm, well, the way I *imagined* them working is basically:

	* Wires from Coil + moved to CDI +.

	* Ignition signal from [points, Hall sensor, etc.] in distributor
	  (that would normally go to Coil -) connected to trigger input
	  on CDI.

	* CDI output wired to Coil +.

...with the CDI giving a large jolt to the coil when the ignition 
triggers, rather than the normal +12.  Presumably you need a coil 
capable of handling the larger voltage on the primary side, and also 
need to widen your plug gap so you reap some benefit from the massive 
spark that is hopefully produced.

That then leaves other things that would normally be attached to the 
Coil -, such as FI trigger and a tachometer (if installed) ... and 
presumably those connect to a tach output lead from the CDI (because, 
well, you wouldn't want to fry those components with that big jolt when 
your ignition trigger completes the circuit :-)

Am I on the right track?
