Subject: Re: [T2] sliding roof replacement options?

Hi Harry,

I have heard of the entire hatch being replaced (badly) with a sheet of 
plexi, but not the skin of the original roof. That sounds like a great 
idea, esp. since the roof on mine is pretty rusty.  A sliding moon-roof 
hatch would be awesome.

A bit brittle in the winter though... you'd need to be careful with it 
if you lived in a cold climate. Other than that, i can't see why it 
wouldn't work fine. It wouldn't be much heavier than the stock 
sheetmetal, as long as the plexiglass isn't too thick.

Keep the list informed if you do go through with it.

Happy trails,
