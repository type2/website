You want "not done" <grin>

That's why I suggested Dzus fasteners. They only require enough room for
the pin. A hole in the track smaller than your pinky finger. The locking
plate for them is mostly flat and could be eithe welded or mounted with
very short nut/bolt sets to the roof. When closed the latching mechanism
would be almost invisible, just two or three small D rings hanging inside
the bus.

"Down" is sort of relative here. Most of the force from those latches is
exerted pulling the near edge of the slider (now popper) toward the near
edge of the opening. Yes, that's "down" because of the curve. But it's
"sideways" in relation to normal hinge motion/tension.

The hinge bolts passing through the roof, then a gap, then through the
bottom edge of the track/frame would actually be a minor detriment --
because of the gap. It gives the bolt a lower pivot point like a long
lever, slightly increasing any sideways forces exerted at the top. It would
only be a major benefit if the bolt were passing through solid metal top to
bottom without the gap.

It does have some benefit though because the extra mount point at the
bottom keeps sideways forces at the top form "rocking" the thin metal.
Sideways forces are "straight" sideways with no chance of the bottom of he
bolt swinging over and allowing the metal to warp and kink.

But you're right, If they don't have that much tension and the seal does
most of the work then it's a moot point.

Note the timeframe I gave. It's going to be a slow process.

I guess I was also looking at the "visibility" aspect. With the Dzus
fasteners it can be locked down from the inside with almost zero visibility
of the latching mechanism. Compression latches "stick out" all over the
place. I had to look at the site a few more times after reading this reply
to REALLY figure out what bugged me about the setup. It's the "lumps" on
the roof <grin>. More personal taste than functionality.

Hopefully we're giving others ideas to file away and investigate if they
need them.
