Actually, as far as I know, there's no *mechanical* difference it the
longblock itself between a California and Federal engines of the same year.
Everything that has to do with making an engine Fed or Cal relates to stuff
that hangs off the longblock and lives around the engine in the engine
compartment.  Things like exhaust components, FI elements, distributor and
supporting electronics and the wiring harness.  You pretty much have to look
at these elements to make an accurate determination.
