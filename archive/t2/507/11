Subject: sliding roof replacement options?

Hiya,

I'm tinkering with the idea of replacing the outer "skin" of my sliding roof
with a piece of tinted plexiglass (or similar).
I think it would be neat to be able to see out of the sliding roof while driving
around.
Has anyone done this before? Any comments, warnings, etc.?


Thanks,
Harry
