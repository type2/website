AFAIK Golde (owned now by ArvinMerritor) still makes sunroofs for Volvo
(at least they did up through '01.) and various other automakers.  (Ford
Explorers used Golde roofs for a period, for example)

The modern Golde units only share a few basic concepts with the units used
in our VWs though.

If someone wants to try to work up a contact with'm, give it a go:
