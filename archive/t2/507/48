Good to know, so what your saying is unless im driving all year in the 
winter that it's
not a good idea ;)

On the cold note, woke up to -31 celcius here (not including the windchill) 
and the van
powered up (a little stiff on the steering) good - had it plugged in over 
nite.  I can't

when
you feel sorry and guilty towards your van that your driving it in such 
extremes.

<it just seems to love it though>
