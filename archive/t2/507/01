Subject: Using Prolong Additive in the fuel system

Dear Type2,
 
I recently put the fuel additive by Prolong into a full tank of gas.
Now I am having trouble starting and idling and I wonder if the fuel
filter is clogged or if the additive damaged the fuel injectors somehow.
 
Has anyone used Prolong on their VW engine?
 
Thanks,
