Subject: Axle nuts removed but still a braking noise

Hey List,



Thanks for the info on the rear axle nut removal.  I bought the Harbor
Freight socket set, which seems to be a good deal.  Anyways, I have been
trying to track down a brake noise problem my bus is having ('70 Camper
with drum brakes on all four).  As I am driving along and then hit the
brakes the first couple of times I hear a grinding/metal on metal noise.
After that, no matter how many times I use the brakes the noise is gone.
If I let the bus sit for several hours (I think long enough for the
brakes to cool) the noise reappears with the first couple of stops. I
checked all the break pads and they look good (are only a couple of
years old).  I don't see any unusual wearing on the hubs and there are
no deep grooves where the pads hit the hub?  All four wheels were
tightened down as per Bentley and the Idiots Hand Guide (I don't have
the tool to measure the front wheel play). The breaks work well and
there is no trouble stopping.  Any ideas on what I should check or look
for next?



Thanks again.



Asaph
