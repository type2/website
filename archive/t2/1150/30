Subject: Rubber or Foam gasket for front fresh air duct needed, or part

Does anyone know a part number for the gasket that is pictured here:

I can't seem to come up with a part number and right now there isn't one in
the bus!  I would like to find one ASAP.

If anyone has one they are looking to sell please let me know as well.

Thank you!

Jeremy
