Subject: Diagram needed for heat exchange system 79 Bus

It's finally dry and sunny on a Saturday so I decided to try to put the 
heat system back together on the bus.  Right now it's a helpful bucket 
of parts, courtesy of a friend who did the clutch and got the engine 
back in but did not finish the job.

He swears he has all the parts, but I can't sort out how the left side 
hoses and duct work connects to the left heat exchanger, which is still 
installed..  I suspect parts are missing but without a diagram it's not 
apparent.  I know Richard Atwell had this on his site but the pictures 
don't show up.

Any assistance appreciated.  If you have a CA 78 Bus  in the Sacramento 
/ Davis area, I'd love to eyeball your system.  I want to make a parts 
order along with the replacement tent and need to know what I need.

Thanks,

BEN
