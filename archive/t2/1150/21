Subject: Re: [T2] Diagram needed for heat exchange system 78 Bus

Many thanks for the fine answers.  They verify that the left heat 
exchanger did indeed go missing.  Likely dates back to 8 years ago to 
the mechanic who helped me pull the Eber-boomer .  I was recovering 
from  my cancer treatment then and not carefully watching what happened 
and what went into the dumpster.

So, the diagrams clearly show I need a left heat exchanger.  Anyone have 
one they would like to sell?

Best,

BEN
