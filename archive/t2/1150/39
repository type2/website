This all brings the obvious point to such conversions to hand.  Installing a
tank inside a vehicle (in a passenger compartment) is illegal, and foolish. 
The reason that a commercial gas place won't let you take home say a bottle of
acetylene unless you have an open truck bed.  In the day (20+ years ago) a
good propane distributor in the US would not refill a common tank if you
brought the bottle in a car.  I guess grill tanks are legal to carry inside
now, perhaps it is just something that we all do, but I wouldn't install one
permanently.  Not that having it outside might be much better if it leaks, but
still better than inside if it gets ignited.  And on a bus doesn't leave a lot
of convenient mount locations (sitting on the roof...) which isn't convenient
for clearance issues, then there is the driving through tunnels and whatnot.

Now I thought down by Rob you just strapped them all over the vehicle when you
fired up "the last of the V8 interceptors" and used the tiny leaks as flame
throwers.  Sorry visions of mutant post apocalyptic humans firing things into
exploding vehicles just came to mind...

    Nearly all serious mishaps with either fuel begin with a tiny leak. 
Breaches of the tank or a directly connected pipe are rare.
