Subject: Re: [T2] Propane and what I've encountered

Real tough ain't the small of it. I have also asked a couple of companies if
they would produce them, and its sad to see all but one ran away, due to legal
reasons... sad state of affairs when a company is run by fears and lawyers
when it comes to something new or a little R & D. How does technology grow...
by control of a legal team ? Sorry, rant mode now turned off. I plan on
raising my westy floor on the inside to accommodate anywhere from a 8" to a
12" diameter tank. Including modifying the frame if needed. Worst comes to
worst, I'll buy one or two for the parts and fabricate my own ! But would pay
anything for two in aluminum or Fiberglas ! Please remember I am going to do a
duel fuel and want long range propane capability.

even existed to start importing Vanagon tanks, when the list was young, I
looked at getting Manchester tank to do some special increased size (length)
vanagon tanks.  At the time OPD was looming as well, and it was unclear if RV
places would still fill tanks 80% overflow tanks.  I looked extensively for
something about the diameter of the Bus/Westy tank, got catalogs sent to work
(being an engineer then helped a bunch, back in the just started internet
days, you had to ASK people to send you paper catalogs and they wouldn't to
normal people) and eventually talked to Manchester who has made most VW tanks.
They were happy to build custom FWIW but needed 50 confirmed orders, and
priced around $400 of 1994-5? money.  At the time I contacted/looked at every
manufacturer and could find no small diameter horizontal tank that would fit
under a Bus/Vanagon and leave reasonable ground clearance.  But is has been
nigh on 15+ years, so who knows.  Seems like most stock horizontal RV tanks
start about 2" diameter larger than the Bus/Vanagon size, which is the size
Manchester supplied for the EVC to Winnebago, with somewhat dismal under the
tank ground clearance...
