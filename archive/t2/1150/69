I think you have a charging problem that has stuffed the battery. Try
checking the battery voltage when the engine is running and there are no
lights or accessories on. You should be seeing at least 13.5V.

Assuming you do have a charging problem, start with the easy stuff. The
first thing is to clean up the points at which the earth strap from the
battery joins to the body and the point at which the +ve wire from the
alternator joins to the +ve wire from the battery. I am only familiar
with the T4 setup so I don't know where that is on your bus. If that
doesn't solve the problem you will have to delve deeper. There are
instructions somewhere on testing the alternator which could be dug up
if needs be.
