Subject: re:alternator charge light 1971 bus with alternator

Hey Chris to add to your statement on the alt/regulator light on the vintage
bus list. I believe that somewhere in the Bentley(I can't recall off the top
of my head) there is a mention of this, and possible ways to diagnose it,
and fix it. I believe Eric & Barb pointed this out. I had this problem in my
'65 for years, it would happen whenever I turned my headlights on. It was
never a real problem, just a perception of one. Since I changed to 12V I
have not had that problem. 

 

I just checked my Bentley - see page 14 section E2.
