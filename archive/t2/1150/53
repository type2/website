Hey Greg,

 

Nice to read a trip report. what exactly happened to your front beam? Did
you hit something? Or did it just rust out? How did you know when you welded
it back up, that it was in the right place? 

 

Reading this is getting me really itchy to take a trip myself and eat some
good food, hopefully I'll get  my bus ready for some summer trips.

 

Thanks for posting..
