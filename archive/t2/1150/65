A resting battery should read 12.5 volts.  A battery being charged by 
the alternator should read 13.4 or more, but not really less.  If your 
battery is 11 volts resting and your charger tells you it is fully 
charged I would bet on the battery being bad.  Do you have a voltage 
regulator?  I know all type4's are externally regulated, but I don't 
know crap about the t1's.
