Subject: Re: [T2] Propane conversion (maybe cng)

Steve, the guy who knew about propane conversions and making them work, and an
aircooled engine survive was Bob Donalds.  In the average bit of 60s-90s
American iron, this is easy to do, all the cooling capacity you could
want. The kits are available from everywhere, but the air cooled VW is not
particularly well suited.  Bob built them (T1s) with a lot of specific head
work, proper CR, etc for zamboni's.  He had a section in his musings (gone
alas I think) about it.  You could undouptedly get a system appropriately
sized (below), but I feel one would need to very carefully watch head temps,
and consider thermal barrier coatings, etc on heads.  Probably like so many
things, way more money into it than the gas you will actually save by the time
you blow $1000 on the conversion.
 
These guys:

claim they have "a great kit" for the 1600 T1, but I'd be a bit skeptic. 
Propane burns hotter I believe, with though I think higher equivalent "octane"
or antidetonation properties.  Like I said though Bob was the only guy I know
who built them regularly and reliably, and he is sadly, gone.

Gasoline is running $3.60+ plus in my area.  Propane is around $2 (and CNG is
$1) so obviously this is a subject that has spiked my interest lately.
There used to be a propane conversion post on the library but I couldn't find
it there today.  I think a tech college back east played around with this
subject.  Anyone have info on this subject?
