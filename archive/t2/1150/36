Put in appropriate data year/VW and look at what matches an original part of
your bus.  They have all the PPG chits for pretty much forever.  I'm not sure
of '72 oddly, it is one of the darker maroonish reds correct?   I've owned
those but never painted one.  The bright red of the '76ish years is African
red I know L-31A which is not yours likely (but is a very nice color I'm still
partial too as it was my first bus.)

I am wanting to repaint my '72 Riviera the color of red that was standard
that year.  Can anyone tell me what that color was called?
