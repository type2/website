Subject: Brake Improvements

The excellent Renault 8 & 10 had 4-wheel discs with no assist and 
certainly no need for any.  The only improvements I would want for 
the T2 braking schematic are:-

1.  Revive, and improve with better materials, the non-assist T2 hydraulics.

2.  Dump them drums; ordinary cast-iron discs will do for the rear, 
and need not be ventilated.

3.  A cable-operated handbrake mechanism worked fine over a decade 
for me, in a somewhat humid climate;  copy that R10 handbrake for a 
start.  sk the relevant French for friendly help based on Renault 
experience.  Surely the Germans can reciprocate in some suitable way 
8-) .

4.  Front discs might also be still OK unventilated; I look fw to 
word from those who have faster buses than my 50 bhp.

5.  If testing the prototype 4-discs system proves a need for power 
assist, where should the vac be taken?
