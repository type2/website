Subject: camper "tack": strip

Read on this site some time back about the best  place to order replacement 
tack strip from. I'm getting close to replacing the  canvas on our 1968 
Westfalia.  Think I also read about getting some type of  cove molding from 
Home Depot. Will someone give me  guidance ?
 
Thanks
