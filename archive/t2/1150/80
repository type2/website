Subject: RE: THE BUS - fundraising program

Hi John,

 

I do not know if this is real/legit. I do know that kickstarter is a
real/legit setup. I believe the idea behind the system is that if they do
not reach the fund goal they do not collect any money (i.e. your credit card
or paypal or whatever is not actually charged)
