Subject: alternator charge light 1971 bus with alternator

Good afternoon from sunny La Paz, BCS.  I'm new to VW and have been reading
the list for a several months now.  I have a 1971 Bus with 1600cc engine and
an alternator.  My charge light is acting funny.  A while ago it flickered,
off and on, but when I checked the belt, it was tight.  It deflects almost
3/4 of an inch with firm pressure.

When I start the Bus, the alt light comes on until I raise the revs and then
it goes mostly out.  Still very faint at night, but invisible in daylight.
Then when I start to drive, and the revs go up, the light brightens.  It
does not simply turn on, it slowly glows brighter.  I have read everything I
could find online, but have not been able to find a description of this
problem.  The batteries are not discharging, I just came back from hooking
up my battery charger to each battery individually, but it said that they
are both fully charged. On my analog voltmeter, they look like 11 or 12
volts.

 I'm stumped.  Does anyone have  any advice?

thanks,

Alvaro
