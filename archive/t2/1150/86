Well, I cleaned up all the grounds, checked all the fuses and still the alt
light glows with increasing revs.

I talked to one person at a VW repair shop, and he said it's probably the
internal voltage regulator and that they have to drop the engine to fix
it.   If it's an engine drop, I can't do it.  don't know enough.  I've done
remove and replace on other vehicles of mine over the years, but I've not
dropped an engine of any variety.  I guess I will have to bite the bullet
and take it in one of these days.  Thank goodness the batteries are not
discharging.

Thanks for all the suggestions, I will keep searching for the solution.
