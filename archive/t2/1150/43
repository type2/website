Subject: Propane and what I've encountered

From what I have been told:

1. Propane vehicles are not permitted in tunnels
2. They must be specially marked.
3. Firefighters will not extinguish them if they catch on fire. They clear a
perimeter and let them burn.

Regardless I'm still going forward with mine. BUT I NEED long horizontal
cylinders to mount underneath the floor. If you find a supplier please let me
know.
