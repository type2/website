Hi Kevin,

The beam cracked open due to rust, and the stress of low speed parking 
lot maneuvers. I was able to realign it by turning the steering wheel to 
the left as hard as I could, then tying the wheel in place. This clamped 
the crack tightly shut. When I released the wheel and drove the bus down 
the road, the steering wheel was right back at 9 and 3 where it was 
supposed to be.


Happy Trails,
