Hi all,

Next Sunday Inland Valley Volkswagens will be at the Pomona Swap
Meet!  We will have a special section just for us to promote the
club.  We get in for free and will have a space reserved in the show
area.  Meet at the Park and Ride north of the 10 freeway and the
Fairplex exit at 5:00 AM and we will ride in together.  If you come at
a later time, you will have to pay to get in.  Should be lots of fun!
Hope to see many of you there.

Rob Garretson b.
