There is no reason to drop the engine to replace/repair the alternator,
other than maybe convenience. You can just remove the belt and pulley,
loosen the metal strap holding it down, unscrew the tin piece from the
doghouse, and wiggle it out, fan and all. Its easier if you loosen the whole
doghouse and raise it up a bit too. There are two screws on the bottom of
either side that hold it to the rest of the tin.

Having that said, a shop would still likely pull the motor, only takes a few
minutes with the right tools and know-how.
