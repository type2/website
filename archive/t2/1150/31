Subject: Re: [T2] Propane conversion (maybe cng)

My first conversion would probably be one of my d jet  caddies.  The guy in
Canada successfully converted both an inline four and a waterboxer to a duel
fuel system.  From his pictures

 I am thinking it is probably the Impco 60 series in this web site,
http://www.propanecarbs.com/examples.html
 but I'd like a little more info before I order.  This dual system seems it
should also work with an L jet bus.  
As far as price it looks to me that you could do this for around $250 to $350
 using standardpropane tanks,  couple of hundred more for automotive tanks.  
I think you are going to see gas at around $4.50 by summer, then the economy
will crash again and it will drop back to the Threes.  We are looking for a
Rip Saw Decade as far as the economy and petro prices are concerned, each
spiking and crashing for the foreseeable future until we change our life
styles or someone invents cold fusion (or a better battery)

Payback here looks like a couple of months especially if I can get it to work
with  $1CNG but am going with propane first to check out the system as CNG
tanks are expensive.
