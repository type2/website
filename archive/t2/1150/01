Subject: Re: [T2] Cooling tin on bottom of heater boxes

I am an engineer (although not automotive) those pieces of tin do two 
major things, they force air over the thermostat to control cooling and 
they isolate the heater boxes and in effect insulate them from engine heat 
and vice versa, so if you have a header system with no heater boxes, and a 
malfunctioning thermostat they server no other function than to protect 
the pushrod tubes from rocks and debris.

in 15 years without them my engine has run cool and so far have not had 
anything hit my pushrod tubes,  I am merely repeating my experiences and 
not making any reccomendations
