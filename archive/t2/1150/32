Subject: Re: Propane conversion (maybe cng)

In 1997 the legendary Robert S. Hoover  experimented with propane as a fuel 
for his VW bus, Grendel. He designed and built and tested a conversion 
using hardware from propane-powered forklifts, and mentioned that propane 
was somewhat like 100 octane gasoline, permitting compression ratios of 12 
to 1, and very advanced timing. He added that direct injection of propane 
was a very interesting possibility. I have about a dozen of his essays on 
propane conversion. Each one is long and in my opinion brilliantly 
constructed in Hoover's unique fashion. Real jewels.
