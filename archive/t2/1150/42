I looked closely at converting to electric.  The problem is still the battery
and range as well as environmentally it just moves the tail pipe to the source
of the electric power.  It is the future but I'm still waiting for the battery
to evolve.
Right now, converting to propane is CHEAP.  Local Supplies are prevalent  and
half the cost of what gas is going to be.  It gets me half way to a CNG set up
where local price is a dollar per gallon (60 cents if you have a home
compressor).  You can do this without changing out your power train, and still
use gasoline as a back up.
Within 24 months you are going to see big changes out there in the area of
fuel and transportation.  Where we will end up is anyones guess.  VW has many
tricks up it's sleeve from a $600?? china

Right now I'm just looking for a bridge to get me through the next 24 months
of high fuel prices and economic ups and downs.
