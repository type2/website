Hi volks,

At over 6,000 words, this is the longest trip report I've ever written, 
so there's no point in trying to post it here.

If you really need to hear how I made out withlast week's trek to 
EveryBus went, you can read all the juicy details annotated with 
selected photos at this link:

If you prefer to skip the text and go straight to the pixels:

The trip report is long because a lot of cool stuff happened. If you 
need to know more, you'll just have to click on one of the links.


Synopsis:
1641 miles, 91 gallons of 87 Octane, and a good time was had by all.
Thanks to Ken Lewis and his cohort for keeping the dream alive!


Happy Trails,
