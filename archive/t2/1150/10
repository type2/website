Hi John,
   How/where did you plumb the plate oil cooler in?  Did you use an oil line
thermostat too?  Sounds like a useful mod for my "second worst application"
vanagon westfalia.
 Thanks. jon

 Vanagon) running a 96 plate cooler, thermostatic controlled fan, improved
head temps, real world WV
 driving (pulling the I68 grade from Morgantown,
east) by 40-50F on the grades.  This improvement did not obviously heat soak
saturate either, you kept pulling the next grade, it kept the improvement.
Now on the vanagon, the cooler set very nicely in front of the L tailight
with
a hole plasma cut through, wire mesh cover, and a little import 12V fan
blowing down on top for help when stationairy and not getting ram effect from
the scoops.  I've never installed one in a bus, but have thought about it in
a
bus Westy.  Same location (opposite the battery if you don't have an aux
battery or relocate a gel cell inside) would probably be nice.
