Subject: mechanical fuel pump

Hi All,



'68 Riviera, dual carb setup.



Brosal Mechanical fuel pump with press-fit(?) inlet/outlet pipes. I
can't find a part number.  Made in Brazil, rebuildable.



As I was replacing fuel lines, while pushing the fuel line onto the
outlet of the fuel pump the outlet pipe has became loose. It will wiggle
back and forth a couple of mm, but doesn't pull out. I see that the
previous owner/engine builder did punch the fuel pump casing to help
hold this pipe outlet in place.



Questions:

1.     Are the fuel inlet/outlet pipes just press fit into this style of
pump casing or threaded?  I've never seen one not installed.

2.     Is it common for the fuel pump case to be punched and is that
what actually holds the pipes in the casing? (seems like weak link in
fuel delivery if so...)

3.     Recommendations?  Re-punch the casing while installed on engine
to try and tighten up, remove and re-punch, replace?



Prior to removing the fuel lines, the outlet on the fuel pump had safety
wire running from pump to fuel line clamps as a safety precaution.
Seems like a good idea and will be re-installed if this pump is still
useable.



Looking at Bus Depot it looks like available mechanical fuel pump for an
upright engine(alternator) has the inlet/outlet now as part of the
casing.  Are these style of pumps recommended over the press-fit pipe
style?



Thanks,
Greg
