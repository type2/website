	Sorry to the List for confusion in haste. <:-|
	I have the good luck of a '73 with front discs but no assist, 
and have no experience with any brake assist.
	 In vain attempt to distract attention from my blunder :-[ , 
I draw across the thread Brake Improvements.
	Aside from the lesson for overworked me, may I suggest I'm 
not the only one to post too pronto from time to time.  My dozen y on 
email have led me to a few slogans; one is 'sleep on it if possible 
before sending'.  That is too extreme for most of the goodies we pass 
each other, but this careless mistake of mine, while not costing 
Jules, may serve as a reminder to pace ourselves.

Kia ora
