	I've not experienced the problem myself, but the advice on 
this thread has featured, to put it loosely, 'dud battery'.  From my 
position of lack of experience, I intuit that's the best bet.
	Can you borrow a known good battery  -  new, or better, 
working fine after months in a similar vehicle?  If that brief test 
banishes the anomaly, that's v strong evidence you had better invest 
in a much better battery than you have.
