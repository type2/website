The caloric heat is actually less, but you lose the benefit of liquid
mist cooling that you get from gasoline.

There are also some concerns about losing the additives that lubricate
the valves, so professional modern installations (sometimes?) include
an oil mister for the intake air stream. Not sure on the specific
properties of the oil they put in it.
