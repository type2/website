  Well, I said I was excited about electric conversions, I didn't say I 
would actually go ahead and do one!

On Ben's splittie he used 10 Lifeline batteries.  Total weight:  1350 
lbs.  That's absolutely crazy.  And where can you go with a range of 
50miles (that's with fresh batteries that only last about 4-5 years)   I 
guess if you had a high efficiency solar panel on the roof it would 
help.  But still...

As an aside, I've never heard of propane vehicles being banned in 
tunnels.  At least not in Canada or England.
