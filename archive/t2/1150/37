	Nearly all serious mishaps with either fuel begin with a tiny 
leak.  Breaches of the tank or a directly connected pipe are rare.
	Given a small leak, methane is buoyant in air, whereas LPG 
vapour denser and therefore collects in bilges etc.
	LPG is easier to explode, tho' some models of fuel-air 
explosive have used methane.
	The flammability range in air, tho' fairly narrow for both, 
is narrower for CNG.
	It's 3 decades since I was immersed in this, but those are 
the main reasons that come to mind.
