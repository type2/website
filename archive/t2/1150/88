Hey Alvaro,

This has been a problem of constant consternation for the vintage bus list. 
I've had my bus since 1972 and the light has not stopped glowing yet. Always 
a faint glow. The consensus has been that if the battery is charging 
properly its a non-issue. One of the solutions is to place a silicon diode 
in series with the lamp. The 0.7 volt drop of the diode may cure the 
problem. If you do this, make sure you have the polarity correct so the lamp 
will light in case of belt failure. Easy to check, the lamp should light up 
if the key is set in the on position, engine not running.

Well, I cleaned up all the grounds, checked all the fuses and still the alt
light glows with increasing revs.
