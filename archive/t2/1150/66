Subject: Re: [T2] alternator charge light 1971 bus with alternator

Hi Alvero,

Your charging system may be quite all right.   What you may have is a 
problem with a ground or some other function of the your generator light 
circuitry.

A stock 1971 has a generator and a regulator.  If you have an alternator 
some things may be different than stock.  Anyway, here is, in general 
principle, how your light works.

When you turn on your key, power flows to the light and (in a stock bus) 
flows to the regulator where it goes to ground.  That completes the circuit 
and your light is on.  When you start your engine, and the system charges, 
voltage at the regulator equals voltage from the battery.  There is no 
circuit and your light if off.

If you start you engine and increase your revs, and the light gets brighter, 
that suggests power from the regulator is flowing to the light and somehow 
to ground.  I would suspect a faulty wiring to your light through the 
ignition switch.

It may also be that your generator light itself is going to ground at the 
instrument panel.

If you have a Bentley you can trace  your wiring.

Cheers,

John R

When I start the Bus, the alt light comes on until I raise the revs and then
it goes mostly out.  Still very faint at night, but invisible in daylight.
Then when I start to drive, and the revs go up, the light brightens.  It
does not simply turn on, it slowly glows brighter. thanks,

Alvaro
