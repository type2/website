	Excess fuel in the cylinders will, when burnt as thoroughly 
as the motor can achieve, give black smoke, not white.
	White smoke is due to excess oil in 1 or more combustion 
chambers.  The usual routes for this illegitimate access are up past 
the piston rings or down between the valve stems and valve guides.
