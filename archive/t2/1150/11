Robert,

The white smoke wasn't coming from the exhaust, it was coming out of
the intake elbow where the brake vacuum line connects. Symptoms all
sound like a classic vacuum leak.

"After I shut down the
engine I was looking around with a flash light for loose/cracked fittings,
for obvious vacuum leaks and saw white smoke coming out of the elbow boot at
the base of the intake manifold that connects the brake booster line."

peace
