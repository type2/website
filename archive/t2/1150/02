Subject: white smoke

Upon getting my '73 2.0l dual solex bus out of storage and pumping up the
lifters at high idle it was running a little rough, popping and such at
idle.  It sounded like it was coming from the carbs.  After I shut down the
engine I was looking around with a flash light for loose/cracked fittings,
for obvious vacuum leaks and saw white smoke coming out of the elbow boot at
the base of the intake manifold that connects the brake booster line.

 

I am assuming the rough idle, runs great, pops at idle, could be due to the
vacuum leak and the white smoke is gas leaking out of the carb while the
engine is off and down into the hot cylinders creating the white smoke.

 

Is this a float bowl needle valve issue?  Any other suggestions or ideas
would be greatly appreciated.

 

Thanks in advance,

Tom
