An all electric Westy would be fun but I have dreams of camping further 
from home than even a really good battery would carry me on one charge.

With NiMH or Lithium you could have a normal bus with 60-80 miles of 
range but the battery is still going to be $10K. I see this on the 
electric bikes list. With lead you can get into the hobby for under 
$100. For Lithium which is about 1/4 the size or weight it's hundreds of 
dollars. It'll even last longer (more charges) but there is that initial 
cost that is tough to swallow.

My ideal electric bus would require about $15K worth of NiMH. I'd likely 
have 100 miles range which would be great for daily use. An onboard 
ginny would be pretty big and noisy too.

Gasoline or turbo diesel still wins for this application. As much as I 
adore the old aircooled engine, given the budget I'd go with a turbo 
diesel four and a six speed manual tranny for carefree highway cruising.
