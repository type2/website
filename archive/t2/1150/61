Subject: New UK Shows for the season - Classic Cabrio, Beetle, Camper

The British Commercial Vehicle Museum in Leyland (Lancashire UK) are
holding the following new shows. 

June 19th 10.00am-4.30pm
VW's Classic Cabrio, Beetle & Camper Van Show

June 26th 10.00am-4.30pm 
VW's Kharmann Ghia International Show

They are new to the show season so a bit of support from the VW scene
would be good.
Im sure if you contact them there may be availability for extra show
vehicles.

Heres a link to the website.

I have no connection to the museum, Ive just found out about the shows
from somebody else.
