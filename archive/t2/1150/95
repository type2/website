Subject: Re: re:alternator charge light 1971 bus with alternator

Hey Kevin,
I changed over to 12V in 1976 or 7. Problem never went away. Battery always
charges, only goes dead if I leave my modern radio connected. BTW I must
currently have a lucky battery in my bus. Its over 8 years old. Seems to be
just fine.

  Hey Chris to add to your statement on the alt/regulator light on the vintage
bus list. I believe that somewhere in the Bentley(I can't recall off the top
of my head) there is a mention of this, and possible ways to diagnose it, and
fix it. I believe Eric & Barb pointed this out. I had this problem in my '65
for years, it would happen whenever I turned my headlights on. It was never a
real problem, just a perception of one. Since I changed to 12V I have not had
that problem.



  I just checked my Bentley - see page 14 section E2.
