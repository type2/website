Subject: Who is/was that?

This is kind of a long shot, but I remember seeing messages a few
months ago -- maybe last fall even -- about someone who'd been hit by
a log truck in their yellow '77 Westy. But I don't remember who it
was, or even if it was on the Type2 list, WetWesties or TheSamba.

In any case, a friend is looking to get ahold of the owner(s) of that
rig to get some history/information about the mechanicals -- she and I
hauled the engine from that Bus out of the SE Foster Pick & Pull yard
in Portland yesterday.

Thanks!
