Subject: Propane conversion (maybe cng)

I'm an old lurker on this list so please excuse this post if there has been
recent traffic on this subject.
Gasoline is running $3.60+ plus in my area.  Propane is around $2 (and CNG is
$1) so obviously this is a subject that has spiked my interest lately.
There used to be a propane conversion post on the library but I couldn't find
it there today.  I think a tech college back east played around with this
subject.  Anyone have info on this subject?

I found the following on the web for  WBXR and inline four:
http://www.telusplanet.net/public/gary2a/rack/propane/propane.htm
and I emailed the guy for part numbers on the propane carb and mixer but he
didn't have the info anymore.
There is this old mother earth
article:http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Transportation/1972-05-01/Propan
e-Conversion.aspx
but it uses a jet in the carb instead of the propane carburetor.
it's the part number on the impco or century carburetor and mixer I'm looking
for.
Thanks
Steve
