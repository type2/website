I can't report too many numbers b/c it has been YEARS since I did this 
but it worked.

I have a '65 Beetle that back in 1994 I put a Type IV engine with a 
replica 911 cooling kit on from BAS Ahnendorp. It did not have any 
provisions for the stock oil cooler.

What I did was used the BAS Ahnendorp oil cooler adapter and relocated 
the stock cooler under the Beetle near the torsion bar. It caught the 
ram air effect when moving.

I added a 1.5 qt deep sump from CB Performance.

Then I added a MESA 96 plate (?) cooler with a 12V radiator style fan 
attached to it with a thermostat to cycle the fan as required. That item 
came from Pep Boys.

The oil would go through the stock cooler under the car and when it was 
hot enough (idling in traffic) it would be directed by a CB Performance 
oil thermostat. If it got hotter yet then the fan thermostat would 
switch on the fan.

I drove this car all summer with that configuration and the oil never 
got over 220F. That includes a 650 mi slog from VA to TN towing a 
Hyundai Excel in July.

It worked well. No hot oil pressure problems. I am considering this same 
design for my bus as well.

My inspiration was the Porsche 911 system which has a high oil system 
capacity, resistant to oil starvation in hard cornering and cools well. 
Admittedly the 911 is a dry sump system with oil squirters cooling the 
pistons but...
