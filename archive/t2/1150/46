Subject: Re: [T2] Propane and what I've encountered

I stopped by Bus Depot a few weeks ago. I saw the aftermarket propane tanks
that they sell. They are much longer than stock westy tanks. They appear to be
the same as the tanks that are used on 18 wheelers.  Ask Ron how much propane
they hold. They might be what you are looking for.
