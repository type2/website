A link that works (yours 404's)

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/busmovie/the-bus

Looks like it needs about:

480 people at the $25 pledge level OR
200 people at the $60 pledge level OR
120 people at he $100 pledge level

before Sunday evening. 

Somebody should have been posting about this every other "OT Friday".
