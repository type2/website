Jake certainly has more experience than VW. I'd say ask the engineers  
who designed the motor, but they're all dead. So they're not getting  
any more experience.

VW thought they were of enough value that they were installed on every  
air-cooled engine that left the factory. They were there on 25 hp  
motors and they were still there on air-cooled Vanagon motors. (I  
don't know about the pre-war motors. I've not fondled one of those.)  
They were installed on the industrial motors as well. Probably to  
protect the pushrod tubes from rocks. (Wish Bob Donalds was still with  
us. He could tell us about the Zamboni motors.)

You throw 'em away. I'll keep 'em.
