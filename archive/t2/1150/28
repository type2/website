Subject: Re: Propane conversion (maybe cng)

I have some sermons by the legendary Robert S. Hoover on propane 
conversion, from about 1997. Would you accept a personal email with an 
attachment? It is too long to publish here, and it might not even be 
ethical or legal. Robet is deceased.
You could read about Robert at
