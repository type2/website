Subject: Propane / LPG Conversion Info in the UK

Maybe since LPG is about half the price of petrol, conversions are fairly 
popular here.
Folks have converted just about anything here with large displacement vehicles 
and U.S. imports being popular.

Some firms specialize in air-cooled VW's and can crank out a professional, 
certified conversion on the same day:

(Check out the tordial / spare tire tank)

Some folks go the DIY route.  Here's a nice write up:

Since you're in the US a lot of this may not apply to you, but I wanted to point 
out that this can be done, is still done, and is safe and reliable.
