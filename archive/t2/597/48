Subject: RE: The Journey Film

I saw it and I agree it wasn't so great.  Didn't realize it came out years 
ago though.  I'd hoped there would be more about the bus (obsessed as I 
currently am - although must admit I'm not QUITE as obsessed as I was when I 
first found out I was getting the bus).  I liked the guy's: ideas and 
vision, courage, confidence, exploration and self-reflection, and 
determination, but I'm also aware his journey is only so original (not to 
sound too cynical/unappreciative of his own experience) and that it was 
pretty poorly made.  All that said, I've known a handful of people who've 
talked about making such a low-budget film or documentary - including myself 
(not on that topic - but have known others who have written out similar 
concepts about an inner & outer journey) - and not one of us has ever done a 
THING about it.  For that reason, coupled with this guy's resourcefulness 
with lack of experience, I was impressed and fascinated enough to keep 
watching it.  At times it was just painful to watch!

There's my 2 cents...

Still hoping to find other VW/bus documentaries, in case anyone else knows 
of any!
