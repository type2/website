I disagree.  There's nothing wrong at all with replacing a
broken used part with an unbroken used part.  I'd even prefer
that route in most cases.  And certainly so if the alternative
new part is a cheap repro from China.

Example (not a Bus, but a VW): When I damaged the fender of
my '87 Golf in an accident, I was overjoyed to find a 
replacement on a local junkyard -- with original paint in 
my car's color on it.  Not just because it was dirt cheap,
relatively speaking, but also because its condition (i.e.,
lots of little scratches but no rust and almost no real
damage to the paint) closely matched that of the rest of
the car, in a way that a new fender with new paint on it 
couldn't have.

Thus, the repair is absolutely invisible today.  And the
car is still 100% original Volkswagen.

On a related note, I think that the restoration to "as new"
condition is not always the way to go.  I actually like cars
that look their age, if they look merely used (as opposed to
used up, abused, or modified).  Keeping them like that is
definitely part of doing it right in my book.  You can never
make them unrestored again.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
