Subject: Hitch Prototype

Hi folks,
I spent the day designing and building a wooden model of a hitch.  I was pleased with the outcome (even though I did not have a 2X2
to represent the crossbar.  My question is:  do you think the receiver is to close to my exhaust?  It's maybe 1/2 inch.  I could go
with a 1 1/4 inch receiver and gain 3/4 inch.  Let me know.  Thanks!
