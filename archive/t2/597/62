Subject: NYC travel -- Friday chat

Hi Volks!
I'm driving my 71 Westy to NYC from Myrtle Beach --- anyone have any tips? I'm
thinking about avoiding I-95 completely and taking the more scenic 17,
bypassing DC. Does anyone have any particular suggestions regarding tolls?
Eateries? Photo opportunities?
I'm confident in my Bus, but I'm still getting my AIRS list together -- be on
alert! :-)
