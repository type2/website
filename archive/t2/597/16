Thanks all!

Will investigate Push rod tube seals and protective tin.
 
> ~Thermostat
I'll remove it then boil test it. The rod/arm that's attached to the
thottle mechanism via rusty spring seems to work, spring back, and
sound as if it's movin' something underneath when the time comes to
hook cables back up.

> ~Fuel pump
I'll pick up a fuel filter and extra hose + clamp for drainage nipple.
New small lines are good. Big lines coming from carb are thick and
hard to compress by hand (but do flex), but no cracks in sight.

Oil breather hole is open also.

More leverin' and watchin' needed.  +readin'
Sounds like they're heater control cables, and now have an idea what
to look for in emerg. brake cables.

FLAPS will have one in tomorow afternoon. My seal is ripped in two,
but see that's a $3 part so will add that to my now big parts order.

Thanks
