Subject: Carb identification?

Hello,

How do you tell the difference between a 72/73/74 stock dual carb? I have 
found numbers under the bowl, but I cannot interpret them. Are they the same 
for all years? They all used the dual carb system. I do know how to identify 
the left (2) and right (3) side carb.

Thanks in advance, Phil.
