Subject: Starting Problems

Happy Saturday Everyone,

Yesterday I'm out running errands and the bus is starting and running 
fine. At the end of the evening I stop by a friend's house to take the 
kids swimming. After about an hour of water, we go to leave and the bus 
won't start. I get no oil or battery light at the first click of the key 
on the ignition. If I leave the key at starting position, the lights 
warm up after a few seconds and then glow dimly. Fortunately my friend 
lives at the top of a hill and I can pop the clutch, get it started and 
runs fine all the way home.

This morning, the same thing. It won't start with the same symptoms.

I replaced the starter about two years ago so I don't think that's it. 
Could my battery have died that quickly? If not, where else should I 
start trouble shooting.

My wife has the other car, so I am waiting patiently for her return (so 
I can get the battery out to be checked) and your suggestions.

Thanks,

--kevin--
