Subject: Re: [T2] rear main seal

Jason's answer is correct...but I am just going to detail it a little more
since I just did this and you didn't find it in the archives....

Loosen the hex head bolt on the alternator and move the alternator so the
fan belt will come off. Remove your plastic fan protector if you still have
it. There are 3 bolts holding the actual fan on. Romove these and pull the
fan rearward and up to clear the fan housing. Now you will see the fan hub.
There should be an o-ring on the end of the crank (mine was missing) and it
just slides on the cone. You will have to get the hub off, possibly with a
puller. A cheap trick Michael Knight taught me is to start the fan bolts
back in with a heavy washer behing the hub (and fan bolts). Slowly tighten
the bolts and the hub should pop off. Now you can remove your main seal.
There isn't much room, but you can get a screwdriver in there, utilizing the
space in the fan shroud. Pry out the old one. Start the new one by hand and
make sure it is seating correctly. You may use a rubber mallet to bang it on
in, making sure it sits flush all around. It is good to find something
softer that is about the same diameter of the seal to hammer on instead of
banging all around the seal. After it's on there is a woodruff key that
aligns with a slot in the fan hub for orientation. Torque it down and bolt
the fan on and then the belt and you are done.

Front main seal is a different story!!
