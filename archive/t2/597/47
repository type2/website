Correct. You have a wiring problem.

There is enough fuel pressure under normal conditions to cause the excess to be returned to the tank. When you unplug the AFM and kill the pump the engine will continue to get fuel that will be trapped in the fuel rail (pressure regulator blocking it) until the engine eventually leans out and starves.

Yes.

No.

15-18" of vacuum.
