When you say weatherproofing rubber are you refering to the window seals? If
so:

This is a job you will want to do simultaneously, unless your seals are bad
to the point that they are letting moisture into the bus and a paint job is
in the distant future.

Seals are relatively cheap, but they add up. The optimal plan is to start
buying the seals when you can and have them ready when you go to paint.
Paint the bus and then put the new seals in. It is possible sometimes to
pull a new seal back out and reuse it, but it's not easy. Most cut the old
seals out with a razor, therefore destroying the seal.

I personally advocate replacing the vent wing window with a solid piece of
glass from a donor bus...the vent wing seal is expensive and is the most
prone to leaking water over the years. The seal listed for the passenger
side window and the window are interchangeable with the driver's side.

Hope this helps,
