Subject: Re: [T2] eltronic igniton problems

> Ok sorry about not giving the full story about the igniton and type of buss im working on so here it goes. i
just got done rebuilding my 83air cooled westy about a week ago and i go to start it and i have no spark.i
take the coil wire off the distrubutor and turn the key and no spark. so  i take the coil off of (84 saab)and
i have to sort of rig ti into the buss turn the key and i get spark. so  i go buy a new coil $70.00 at the
parts house. anyhoo i plug the new coil in and no spark. At this point im  so frustrated i have to take some
time to think.                                    so what i think happend is . when i put the coil from the
(saab) in the buss i got spark becouse the(saab)dosent have a hall sensour and the coil didnt need one to
spark.so when i put the new coil in it needs the hall seneour to spark thats  why the new coil dosnt spak and
the (saab)s did. thats why i think its the hall sensor. I hope im right becuse i had to ordered a new one and
it costed me $110.00
and its on order so i dont even have it yet what do you peopl think abut this problem?......thanks matty

Where are you?  What parts house charges you $70 for a coil? Even a Wells coil from Auto Zone is only $25 and
it works.... I know, I had to buy one in Flagstaff, AZ a few years back when my coil went out. I run the
Vanagon electronic ignition on my 77 Westy.

I do not believe the new coil you got is a good one. If the Saab coil worked, then the hall unit is good. I
have only seen them go bad when the rotating hall cut thru the wires. Have fun changing it.
I made a special puller to remove the hall piece. I would go back to troubleshooting and start with the coil
again......
