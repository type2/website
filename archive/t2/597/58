Subject: tuning air sensor on '77 bus

Hi All,

I replaced my intake air sensor (aka air flow meter) a while ago but my bus 
started running rich.  I failed my last smog certification with 4.5% CO at 
idle and 6.6% CO under load.  A local mechanic swapped my intake air sensor 
out with his "good" one, which reduced those numbers to 2% and 1.9% 
respectively, which led him to conclude that my problem is in the intake air 
sensor.  However, he seemed reluctant to calibrate mine, and instead gave me 
some instructionson how to tune the sensor myself.

I was advised to crack open the cover of the sensor, loosen an adjustment 
screw, and turn the black plastic block (the one that holds the copper arm 
that sweeps across the circuit board) to directly lean out the mixture.  He 
figured I should adjust this slowly until the van starts to backfire 
(indicating that the mixture is too lean) and then back it off a little.

This sounds like an extremely shoddy hack.  Can anyone point me to more 
detailed information about how to tune my air sensor to get the mixture 
right?

Thanks,

Sandy Martinuk
