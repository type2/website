Well Danny (the guy stuck) can't catch a break it sounds like. I drove
over to M'boro last night to see what we could find out. His bus
condition is that he now has 2 engines, both with mucho endplay. I
showed up with my dial indicator and showed him how to check/set the
endplay. This was mostly a procedure of futility just so he would know
how to set it. 

His old engine has about .075" endplay, and the new one is only
slightly better at .065". The new engine actually only had a small
amount of play if you don't account for the main bearing moving in the
case :( He is working on trying to decide what to do with what he has
right now. There is a chance he might just go for it to get back to
family in AZ. 

fortunately for him his spirits are still up. This is just one of
those things that happens when on the road. If he decides to chance it
I'll post again.
