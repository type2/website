Subject: listees in Albany,NY?

Hi,
Are there any listees  in or near Albany,N.Y.? I will be going there next Friday and will be there for about 5 days for a little league  nat. tounament. I`m sure that I will get bored and need something to do. Maybe junk yard hunting or something. Any nice campgrounds around that area?
Thanks,
Dave Parsons
