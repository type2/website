Chris,

Bill of sale and signed title should get you home just fine....

The $5.00 plate is probably worth it as it can go in the back window and 
prove you were trying to be "legal"....and give any cops the opportunity 
to see that it is a vehicle "in transit"...also, it's not like it's a 
$200,000 Lamborgini driving around without plates across state lines.

I did this last year with a Kansas car and we did just what you described.
Left the plates on and then I mailed them back when I got home.

Call your insurance agent before you leave and let them know what the deal 
is....they will probably want a VIN number.


Cheers, dave
