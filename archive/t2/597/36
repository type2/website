Hi Joe,

Quick fixes and rig jobs have their place. Not everyone has access to 
hundreds of spare parts or the luxury of time to wait for fedex. I like 
it when people on the list share quick-fixes... Especially when they 
detail the consequences. What people do with that information and their 
buses is up to them.

Face facts: Not every bus is destined to be preserved or restored. Some 
buses are going to be well loved and will be consumed in the process.  
There's nothing wrong with that, it's what they were built for. Maybe 
someday one of my yet-unborn grandchildren will want to restore my 
westfakia...it'll be up to them to repair the hack-job I did on the 
westy roof, and to pull the dash to uninstall the CHT, Oil pressure and 
voltmeter gauges under the radio. And to undo the "mess" I made 
installing the 12V inverter and dual-battery relay system. But why 
would they want to? These things work fine.

People apply quick fixes for lots of reasons, and some of them work 
better than others. Of course you probably get the worst of them... THE 
GOOD ONES ARE STILL ON THE ROAD!!!

Happy trails,
