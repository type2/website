some states and insurance companies allow you "X" number of days to make a
formal transfer of tags to a new vehicle.  can you take your current tags
with you, put them on the vehicle and drive it home...with your current
registration and a bill of sale dated within that time space you should be
ok....what you do when it is in your driveway is up to you.

my state allows 10 days I believe
