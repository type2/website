Subject: re: 1700 HEAD QUESTION

Darren; 

The extra ports on the heads, if I'm guessing right at what you're
describing, are indeed emissions-related - part of the EGR (exhaust gas
recirculation system that was present on some dual-carb T-IV engines of
the early 70's. 

Some motors have four EGR ports, some have three. My 1800 has three ports
(two on the 3/4 side, one on the 1/2 side). If you have removed all the
EGR components (air pump, filter, EGR valves, etc), those ports can be
plugged. Valve adjuster screws work nicely for this purpose. 

These holes MUST be plugged if you plan on running the motor without the
EGR components. I schmeered a bit of high-temp thread sealant and a touch
of JB-weld on the screws, and threaded them in about halfway (you can
check the depth of the EGR air injection tube that was originally in the
head as a reference). 

Hope this helps, 
Dan
