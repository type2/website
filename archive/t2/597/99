Subject: I hate my exhaust!!!

New nuts, new copper gaskets, and IT'S LEAKING AGAIN!!!

I hate that stupid design. If the gaskets, which have plenty of room
to be misaligned, are misaligned, no seal.

Grrr... Now I gotta pull it all apart again. Does anybody have a
better way to get those in there? Muir's just says to slob 'em up with
wheel bearing grease to get them to stay in the head. But no other
suggestions on how to make sure they're lined up properly. I lined
them up as best as I can tell by touch and eyeballing, but obviously
it was off by a bit. Sigh.

Not feeling the bus love coming from the exhaust. :-( 

But it runs sweet after adjusting the tight valves. ;-) Just noisy as
heck. Plus I plugged in the vaccum line from the dizzy to a nipple
right at the throttle plates. Big difference. Woot!

Just like a bus, isn't it? Half love, half hate? LoL!
