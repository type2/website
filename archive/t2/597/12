Subject: update on transporting. 

Ok, I finally got through to the different DMV's.

I had to get my proof of insurance faxed over to the NM DMV. They will give 
me a permit for 4 days to transport the vehicle back to my own state. This 
permit is only $5, or could be $5 for each 2 days, either way, not a bad 
price.

Now I just need to bring in the title, my own state ID and ask them to check 
for this fax, and im good to go.

thanks to everyone for the advise. I was a little freaked out this morning, 
trying to finish up my last day of work before I leave and only a few 
minutes here and there inbetween breaks to pull my head from the ass and get 
this taken care of. Sorry if I jumped and gun and freaked out before 
thinking it through, it was just a bit much to take in so close to the sale.

now, time to pick up a new antenna for my CB, print out the AIRS list for my 
route, pack up a few things and try and catch a few winks before 4:30AM 
rolls around.

when its all said and done, I am getting a bus again. =)
its been since last October that ive been busless, and really just far too 
long. I cant freakin wait.

thanks again,
cr
