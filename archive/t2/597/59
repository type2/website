Subject: Re: [T2] Bus camping fans?

I abore the heat!!! So I have 3 batteries in my bus and run 3 fans. I have
two of the WalMart $10 fans that run off the dual battery (I like the noise,
although they aren't that loud) and the third battery powers my upper vent
fan (among other things). I have installed a complete second Westfalia
charging system too so I can charge both the auxillary batteries
independently or together if I wish (using city power...neither is hooked to
my alternator). If you hook the marine battery to your alternator using the
available or stock relay you can charge it on a little tour of the city you
are camping in and have it ready for the evening. Oddly my vent fan will
drain the third battery faster than the 2 small fans. I can run all three of
them all night long and still have power, however the vent fan will show a
noticeable difference overnight. If you have a late Westy with the original
charging system you may also run the batteries on city power and not drain
your battery at all. I replaced my fridge for the ice cooler and run my two
fans from the wire that used to go to the fridge, so when I am at a campout,
etc. with power I run them on city power (which will also charge your
battery if you need it). In my opinion if you don't have the late Westy
charging system it's worth looking into retrofitting it into your bus. Here
are a few pics if you are interested:

List note: Some people don't like my bus because I have added these things
among others (propane heater, second stereo, high top...the list goes on). I
use my bus to camp in and I add these things for function. My bus is very
functional, but I realize there are a lot of hardcore purists on the list
and my apologies to those that had to read this.
