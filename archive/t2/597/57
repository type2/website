Subject: Re: [T2] Bus camping fans?

I bought one of these a couple years ago.
http://www.campingworld.com/browse/skus/index.cfm?skunum=21314&affiliateid=590
It uses 3 amps/hour on high and slightly less than one on low.Moves enough
air on low for me to sleep nice unless its real hot then I bump it to the
middle setting.They are a little expensive for a fan but its a lot less load
on the aux battery than a 120 volt fan with an inverter.Those little clip on
12 volt fans at walmart are way too loud for me.
