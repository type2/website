Subject: Painting and various rubber (also who's in Philly)

Hi All,

So my van needs both a paint job and most of the weatherproofing rubber 
replaced. Does it matter which is done first?
I'm guessing pull the rubber, paint, then replace it...

Thanks,
Harry

P.S.-> Just moved to West Philly... see lots of buses/vanagons but 
haven't see anyone on the list (other than cdavid). Are any of you here?
