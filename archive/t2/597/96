Subject: 71 rear brake parts

Sad times.  My clip failed on the parking brake pivot pin, thus allowing the
lever, etc to come loose inside the drum.  Before the problem was noticed both
return springs were ruined.  I can't find parts for the 71 since it's a
single-year design.  Can anybody direct me to a source for parts or suggest a
substitute ?  This is a daily driver so repairs are needed ASAP.  Thanks
