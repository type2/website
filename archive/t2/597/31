Subject: Re: [T2] '74 bus with 1800 and dual carbs stalls after warmup

My '74 was a bit of a pain until I determined I had the old reliable 
vacuum leaks. Mine have been at the elbow on both sides of the engine 
near the firewall and then the hose that runs to the brake vacuum 
chamber up front. This leak is just in front of the firewall on the 
left side.

Buy a small hand operated vacuum pump ($30) and figure out how to 
isolate possible leaks. After fixing the leaks be sure to reset the 
timing.

After eliminating the leaks my bus starts quickly, runs fine and 
NEVER needs to be restarted. It is getting about 20 mpg in 100% small 
town (never more than a mile in 4th gear) driving.

Good luck.
