Half an amen, Joe.

In logic, there is this thing called the bi-conditional: If ---> then.

If someone can afford to make a repair correctly, using quality parts 
and proper tools, then they should do so. They should do so not so much 
to please the bus gods, or because someone on this list says so, but 
because it is in a bus owner's long-term interest to ease their bus 
along a line of every-improving condition.

But what if there is not enough money? Or enough time? What if an 
original or replacement part is not available? This is where things get 
complicated.

Many of us on this list are ratcheting our buses ever upward, making 
decisions about what counts as a priority repair (and therefore 
justifies the expense of quality parts and work), and what counts as a 
luxury (fix it with wire for now, get to it next year). Given the 
conditions in which most of our buses start we  get them, this is the 
only reasonable thing to do. The average bus on the road today could 
_easily_ eat up $10,000 and still require some work.
