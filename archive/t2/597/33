Subject: slow down be carefull and do it right

People,

I have been amused, to say the least by several posts lately. Posts of alleged
quick fixes, and rig jobs. How are guys like us, parts, service, and
restoration shops, supposed do keep up with this stuff? Seriously, our job is
in preservation, and folk keep applying bad judgment and just plan bad ideas.

These buses are not getting any newer or easier to find. Will someone support
me on a movement towards conscious, rational, lucid, and holistic approaches
to solving problems?

Sorry to rant, I just get to many buses in here that have had problems that
only got worse because of a quick fixes, that don't take care of the bus, just
the persons problem in it. Just because you want to get home or to a show
doesn't mean your bus has to. Seriously if we were hiking up a mountains and I
broke my ankle and you just slapped some JB weld on there and said sheeeiiit
com'on Joe you can make it I too would probably do what ever I could to take
all your money and time then leave you with busted knuckles and a screaming
desire to drive an American car.

can't we all just..... do it right, isn't that what this list is all about,
can I get an amen brother,

-Joe
