I agree with Karl... If you got spark from the Saab coil, the rest of
the ignition is probably working...

Double check your connections to the new ($70?!?!?!) coil. Using a
voltmeter or a 12v light bulb to check for current at the + tab of the
coil with the ignition switch on.

While you were swapping coils, you disconnected the battery, right? If
so, double check the battery connections are solid. If not... Ummm...
Electronic ignition + computerized components + voltage surges = no
fun.
