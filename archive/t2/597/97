Subject: Valve Adjustments

Well, today was my 5th adjustment since Feb. I don't know how abused
the bus was, so I've been doing very frequent oil changes and valve
adjustments until I'm comfortable.

Up until this point, the valves had always been loose when I got in
there. A couple weeks ago I noticed that the drivers side had gotten
awfully quiet. So today I get in there and the #3 & #4 cylinder valves
were all less than .002 (my smallest feeler). Not tight enough to
compress the springs, but tighter than they should be. :(

I'm hoping this was just a fluke, like maybe I misadjusted them last
time. Looks like I'll have to check them in a week to see...

Has anybody noticed how you can HEAR the adjustment? I pull the covers
off, and move the rockers. The noise they make, and the amount of
movement is pretty obvious. I keep double-checking with the feeler,
but I can hear when they're right, loose, or tight before I put the
feeler in place.

Of course, I don't trust my ears to tell me the adjustment anymore
than I would trust my nose to tell me if my monitor color calibration
is correct. ;) But it was an interesting observation, and might be
handy in an emergency.
