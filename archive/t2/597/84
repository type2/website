Subject: rear main seal

Hi All,

I have a 76 bus with a 2000cc engine.  Is it possible to change the 
rear (back of the bus) main seal with the engine in or is it less work 
to remove the engine and change it?

I searched the archive and didn't find anything but it was the first 
time I have worked with the archive so....

Thanks!

Dave
