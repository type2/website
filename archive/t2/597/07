Um... with all due respect... are you guys nuts?  Putting a plate from one 
car onto another and getting caught would at a minimum get you a nice fat 
ticket, and may get you arrested.  I doubt your insurance company would be 
amused, either (but hey, call and ask.  Just call anonymously!).

I think the $5 temporary plate is a good solution, that or mailing the 
plates back (I don't think the previous owner can be held liable if he/she 
has a signed bill of sale).
