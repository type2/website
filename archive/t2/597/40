Subject: Documentary Re. Driving Bus Around Country

There's some new movie/documentary out in the video stores in which a young 
college student and a couple of his friends take a road trip around the 
country in their bus, interviewing famous, very wealthy and/or interesting 
people and asking what makes a person successful or oh happy.  I'm sorry to 
say I forgot the name but it's something like "Road Trip" or "Moving On" or 
something like that.  Anyone seen it?

Are there any other such films out there that feature buses?
