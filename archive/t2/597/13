Subject: aftermarket convertible tops for the vanagon?

Hi,

I've got a vanilla Vanagon L.  I know some Vanagons came with a large
sunroof cut in the middle but mine didn't.

I've got a disconnected/removed air conditioner compressor so the beat
up console on the ceiling of my van serves no real purpose that I can
see.  I also have a couple dents in the roof I'd like an easy way of
being rid of.

I'm considering putting something like one of these somewhere behind
the drivers area.

Anyone done anything like this?


Sincerely,
