You know what he meant... Any Bus on the road today is a unique vehicle 
... It's been ~25 years since the last Bus was made (not counting the 
ones made in Brazil for the South American market), and the ones still 
around have so much history in them, there's simply no two that are 
alike.

Let's be serious, here.  We've recently received news of a sad event 
that reminds us all that we need to pay attention to things like fuel 
lines and other sources of fire risk in our beloved Type 2s, and that 
we should be carrying reasonable fire fighting equipment with us in the 
event we are unlucky enough to experience a fire.

If you don't want to be a productive part of the discussion then
