My tank does not have the built in metal filter on the bottom of the
tank. ('77 bus, FI)  I was researching this awhile back because I 
could not locate the filter nut to clean it out. Maybe it has something
to do with the fuel injection system circulating the unused fuel back
into the tank. The late bay tanks have an inlet and outlet on the
bottom.
