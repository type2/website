Eh, I think a simple circuit that would illuminate an LED if the fuse 
was blown when you turn on the ignition switch shouldn't be that hard 
to rig up.

Yah, I wouldn't suggest a VOM... but rather get one capable of 30 amps 
or so from an electronics supply store ... the simple panel-mounted 
type.  I would go so far as to mount it permanently in the isolator 
circuit so I could monitor it by lifting the engine lid.  I don't have 
the faintest idea how much a meter like that would cost, though...
