1. What are my chances of finding another nice original '71 like the bus
that I have?  They aren't making these things any more!

2. Why go through the hassle of extracting my money from the insurance
company and then finding a replacement bus if you can simply replace a few
lines and prevent a fire.

Something about the "let the insurance pay for it" philosophy leaves a bad
taste in my mouth...
