very true. only problem is it won't indicate that the 2nd battery is
not charging, unless it completely kills any/all accessories that are
on that battery. Now that I have thought all about it again, and since
I have several things running off my 2nd battery I'm gonna bite the
bullet and get an isolator.

just fyi. unless it's a very good ammeter it will burn out any of the
vom style. these only will accept small current flow. not 90 amps.
