Subject: A focused question regarding chargingbatteries

Jamie, David:

My experience is as a designer for an electrical engineering firm.

The wire will do it's best to allow all that current to pass. The resistance of the wire (a constant in the equation related in ohms/ft) will generate heat as a by-product, melting the insulation of the wire and then possible arcing to other grounds.

Correct, current is determined by the load. Wire is sized based on expected loads, plus a safety factor.
It is NOT sized to limit current flow.

Well, it's really the other way around. Isulation is chosen based on operating temperatures, duty cycles, location of the wire, etc. etc.

>The impedance will choke any high current effectively

No, I think that's not true. As I said above, wire is sized (in the National Electrical Code, anyway) based on expected currents, plus a safety factor.

>Actually,, most utilities DO not use breakers,,, or >fuses... none! Well,, that isn't exactly true

Not it's not. There's a circuit breaker before a step-down transformer, before a switchboard, before a house service panel, and usually at sub-panels as well, and always on individual circuits.

>that fuse does NOT provide any protection to the >secondary single apt breaker panel.

Breakers are to protect wire, not equipment. A panel is nothing but a can full of breakers protecting more wire. Wire is the weak link in this chain, and electrical engineering is a lot about protecting and sizing your wire and wire protecting equipment.

>even then, the #6 or #3 wires don't burn up with 400 >amps fault current

According to the NEC table 310-16 allowable ampacities for #3 and 6 wire at 75 degrees C is 100 and 65 amps, respectively. You're armchair engineering saying that those wires won't burn at 4-6 times their load rating.

>My point is, it is normal practice to ensure the >wires are long enough to provide enough impedance to >effectively choke and reduce the available

I'm not familiar with this practice. I would assume that if you've seen cable coiled up in an enclosure, it's for future use/splicing/extention, whatever. That is a much more logical reason.
