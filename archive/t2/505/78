Grrrrrrrrr!

Darren, not just to you, but to all of those folks out there that keep 
ignoring my *several* posts about such a system that costs considerably 
less and looks to do such a great job that they use it in $$very$$$ 
expensive race cars.

I keep trying to lead a horse to water, but I sure as heck am failing a 
trying to get yall to take a drink....or look...

Somewhere in one of my original posts was a kit for this stuff for less 
than $500 that mounted partially in the engine compartment and just had
either a lever or push pull rod to set it off....you can then *refill*
the durn thing yourself!!!

If someone can find a place on the net that says this stuff is crap, then 
I will shut up and go away...but I think I probably looked at over 200 
references from all over the palce and couldn't find *anything* but
praise for this stuff.

It won't kill you(like halon), it won't blow away before it can smoother
the fire(like halon) and it won't destroy your engine or electronics(like 
foam).

and! if you get the fuel leak shut off, and get this stuff on the gas 
that *is* out there, it *won't* reignite!!

Cheers, dave...who is sick at home and whiney and crabby
