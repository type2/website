Subject: BBB VIII Burnt bus fund

   Here is an update on the burnt bus fund for Chris, who's bus went up in
flames on the way to BBB VIII.

The donations have reached the 2 k mark due to the generous donation of a
bus person in Florida who gave 1000 dollars and all the others that have
gave and the ones that still are. It started with SWATO doing a trivia
contest at BBB and donating the entry proceeds to the fund. Then there was
an action at BBB which raised even more money. Donations from around the
world have come in which shows that bus people do care about each other.

So, Chris lost a pretty nice 69 bay westy The major contributors and others
have agreed to try and replace what Chris lost so we are looking for a
running driving 69 to 71 bay westy to replace her lose. This bus can come
from anywhere in the country as I am sure it could be relayed back to her in
Oklahoma through the bus network.

  If anyone knows of or has one they want to sell please p-mail me

thanks  Ronnie   holding the burnt bus funds
