Perhaps a little Rube Goldberg but every bus needs a big red button on the
dash with a safety cover that read "Jettison Warp Core" in the event of a in
progress breech. The button activates a cable which is connected to a pair of
electric motors. The electic motors are secured to the wing nuts of two fuel
hose clamps wrapped around the fuel lines below the tank. When the wing nuts
have wound to the top they press release button that activates a pair of large
hose cutting pliers that are under the tension of a large spring. Once the
fuel supply has been secured the pliers close another switch which opens a
door on the side opposite the sliding door directly in line with the fuel
tank. As the door opens it pulls a string which closes an electrical contact
which activates an electric motor. The motor powers a set of rubber tracks
that the gas tank rests on that first raises an inch and then the tank is
conveyed out of the bus onto the roadside thus preventing a burn down. It's so
obviously simple it's a wonder VW didn't engineer into into the bus in the
first place.
