Hiya Matt,

I haven't tried this method but if you're really concered about rust I would
check out:
http://www.shagadelic.org/VW/info/gmbulley-soundproof/

This suggests using a product called KoolPatch. I'm now using this and can
attest that it would take a lot to remove this once it's dry.

HTH,
Harry
