Subject: Re: [T2] Spare tire rack?

I have that site bookmarked but what I'm looking into will be more custom
and most likely be incorporated into an "upgraded" bumper setup. There's
nothing really solid enough at the back of a bus to hang a pair of spares
from so the rack will have to be attached all the way down under at the
frame somewhere.
