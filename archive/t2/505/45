Hey Terry, is that the same stuff we used in the Navy that was sort of 
green and harder than a rock? Amazing stuff for the application. Literally 
had to chip it off (or use a grinder) if for some reason it needed to be 
removed.

Probably not good to use under paint but I'd use it on the underside of my 
bus in a second. I could of course topcoat it with a color.
