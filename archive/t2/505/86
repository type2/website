Actually, although I wrote the article myself (way back in '99), I have
had a couple of people question whether the '79 heat exchangers can be
replaced with '72-74 as I'd originally been led to believe by a couple
of '79 owners. I do know that you can use the '72-74 exhaust on '75-78,
and many people have done this. (Even though the exhaust port shape is
slightly different it is not different enough to matter.) Has anyone on
the list done it on a '79 who could confirm one way or the other?

Regardless of the '79 exhaust port question, one thing that is certain
is that the '72-74 exhaust will bolt right up to the non-California '79
heat exchangers. So you can, either way, connect a '72-74 exhaust to the
'79 heat exchangers on a non-California-emisisons '79 bus.

If your bus is California emissions, you'll need a left non-California
heat exchanger. (The rights are the same.) However, there is another
issue there. You presently have an oxygen sensor, and the '72-74 setup
does not allow for this (nor a cat). Your solution there is to buy a
left-side non-California '79 heat exchanger plus a modified version of
my '79 non-California exhaust system. The reason I say "modified" is
that while the stock non-California '79 exhaust setup accepts a cat, it
does not have an 02 sensor port. However, by subbing a watercooled
Vanagon cat and muffler for the aircooled one, you will gain such a port
(as the watercooled Vanagon cat has one). This will require no other
modification, as the cat and muffler are identical in size to the
aircooled ones. I can provide this for about $25 more than the price of
the stock '79 setup.

Another option would be just to keep what you have now and replace your
left California-only heat exchanger with a new one. (We do have them,
although at $349 they're not cheap.)  I'm not sure this is a great
option, however, because the California-only crossover pipe is no longer
available, so once that rusts out you'll be back to looking for an
unobtainable part. Better to just do away with it now, and avoid buying
the pricy $350 heat exchanger in the process.

Are you even more confused now? :-)
