Have you checked for vacuum leaks?  What it sounds like might be 
happening is when you start the car, the cold-start valve is giving 
extra gas.  But after about 15 seconds it turns off and now you're 
running stricly on the ECU.  However, if you have a vacuum leak that is 
somewhere after the airflow meter, it will allow the vane in the AFM to 
close and thus inject less fuel.  This would probably be more pronounced 
in colder weather because you need more fuel when it's cold out.

So, if you haven't already, change all your vacuum lines and/or make 
sure they're all nice and snug.  You can also check for vacuum leaks by 
spraying starting fluid around your hose joints.  If the RPMs go up 
momentarily when you spray, you've got a leak.

Hope that helps!
