Subject: [T2] Re:[T2] A focused question regarding charging batteries

Jaimie-

I stand corrected. I had no idea my suggestions could elicit such sarcasm
and passion! I love this list!

I am not an electrical engineer, nor do I play one on TV. I am merely a
marine engineer. My electrical experience comes from operating and
maintaining, and eventually designing and building AC and DC charging and
battery systems for shipboard use. My intention was not to offer an
electrical dissertation, but to offer practical and safe suggestions on
installing an isolator. As you suggest, the theory is difficult for a layman
to understand. I would also add that in the real world there are also other
factors that effect what is safe, such as vibration and corrosion. It was in
with this in mind that I made my suggestions.

I stand by my statement that using undersized wire for a battery isolator or
relay is not a good idea. Note that I did not say that you must use huge
wires, I just advised against using undersized ones. (To make it clear: Use
the correct wire. Not something too small, regardless of whether we are
talking about a bus, a boat, or your home.) Part of my daily job is
preventing electrical fires. Your point about a larger cable being able to
carry large current with the associated risks is well taken, but would you
seriously hire an electrician who was recommending using smaller than code
wire to prevent fire? I would suggest not.

Thanks for the discussion.

Cheers,
Matthew
