I dealt with the same symptoms.

Found my EGR valve was leaking (disabled it, removed it, bolted gasket and 
cover plate in it's place), injectors seals were leaking ($18 at the local 
FLAPS), had problems with dead and leaking vacuum lines such as the idle 
air control valve rubber elbow. Ran (runs) perfect now. While you are in 
there check the fuel lines and all the vent lines - especially the ones 
behind the firewall.

Good luck!

Chris
