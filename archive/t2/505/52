I'm not sure Chris if the Navy used it-
But I paint the frames and fuel tanks of trucks with it, and the stuff
doesn't come off, and shines like no tomorrow--
It fill's rust pits like I laid a coat of bondo over them first.
Pretty impressive stuff.
BUT--You need a primer gun to blow it on--it's thick like glue, and it's
not supposed to reduced.
A primer gun has a larger orfice for thicker products to pass through
it--

I have a bunch of trucks I've done with this stuff running down te
road---some for at least 8 years--no further rust--and they all still
shine. 

See Ya--

Hey Terry, is that the same stuff we used in the Navy that was sort of
green and harder than a rock? Amazing stuff for the application.
Literally had to chip it off (or use a grinder) if for some reason it
needed to be removed. 
Probably not good to use under paint but I'd use it on the underside of
my bus in a second. I could of course topcoat it with a color. 
Ciao!
