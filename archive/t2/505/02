I have two in my upstairs storeroom. Blanket on floor. Old pillows between
glass/wall to keep glass from touching wall. One pillow between the two
pieces of glass. Pillow against outside glass with a set of OEM bumper
overriders (still in VW part numbered box) against that pillow to make sure
they don't fall over.

You can never have too many Bay windshields. Sneeze while installing and
you'll break one.
