Well,
All I know is I bought it from a local VW supplier trying to reduce the
number of dead VW's due to fire.
http://www.mickmotors.com.au/
Brand is : Airod who make fuel and LPG equipment.
It's a simple normally close solenoid with a valve and straight through line
for the fuel.
I mounted it near the tank outlet and ran a wire to it from the coil, so
it's only open when the motor's running.
It cost me ~$A50 and was an easy do it yourself install.
An added benefit is I ran the wire through a hidden switch as theft
protection. Even if they hot wire the bus, they only get as far as the fuel
in the carbs.
Richard,
