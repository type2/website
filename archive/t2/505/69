On classic or unique vehicles, the point is generally to protect yourself,
monetarily, in the event that you hit someone else.  This is why US law
requires a certian minimum of Liability insurance coverage.


If I run into someone, and it's deemed my fault (except for no-fault
insurance..), my insurance company will pay up to (for example..I don't
recall the actual numbers at the moment) $25,000 in medical bills for /the
other vehicle's occupants/.  It will also pay up to $25,000 toward
repairing or replacing the /other vehicle/.


There also are wide variety of insurances to cover your own vehicle and
medical bills.  Most are woefully inadequate with regards to older cars,
though....and it's not just a matter of paying more, either.  The
insurance companies will be happy to take your money...but the policies
they have still don't generally work out to help replace unique vehicles.
