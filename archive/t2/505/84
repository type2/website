Subject: Re: [T2] fire talk

OK, call me stupid, but what causes a bus to catch on fire?  It seems to
always involve a ruptured or loose gas line, but gas needs something to
ignite it.  Are these fires being caused by sparks?  What surface
temperature must something be at to ignite gasoline without a spark?  I'm
just trying to understand.
