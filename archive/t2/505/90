The primary culprit is the rubber line that goes from the fuel tank to the
front tin, and the metal line that passes through the front tin.

Both of these are directly above the #3 exhaust pipe, which can run red
hot, plenty hot to ignite fuel.

This is aggrevated by the fact that the rubber line above the pipe is
heated by the pipe after shutdown, meaning that it deteriorates and cracks
first.  It is also out of sight, making it hard to inspect.

The metal line is subject to cutting by the tin if the rubber grommet
deteriorates.  I replace mine with a strip of heavy inner tube rubber
wrapped around the metal line and pushed through the hole.  Much tougher
and failsafe.

The bad thing about the metal line being cut is that the fuel dribbles on
both sides of the tin, so you can't put the fire out.  You can put one
side out, but the other side will reignite it.

I put all of the lines on a "replace every two years" basis.
