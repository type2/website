Subject: Re: [T2] Re fuel screen in late tanks?

> Whoa- when I had severe rust silt blockage of a fuel filter (78 camper)
 I let it run free (no more silt) but also decided to blow air up the
 outlet pipe (empty tank)- heard a distinct clunk of something popping
 free and rolling along the bottom- I assumed it was the screen that was
 there?????

More than likely, you dislodged the fuel bowl ring that is around the outlet pipe. It is there to keep fuel
centralized so you don't starve for fuel when the tank is very low and you make a right turn.
There is no filter in the tank.
