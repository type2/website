I asked my mechanic to pop the plate to see why I had run over from the fuel
tank when I filled it up to the top.  Up to now I've only been adding
10-gallons to the tank when it was nearly empty.  Had a real scare the first
time I filled it up, then noticed fuel spilling out on the ground!

Turns out that someone had been in there and left off ALL of the vent lines.
Nada, nothing there but the tubes that they mount on!  Needless to say,
they've been replaced.
