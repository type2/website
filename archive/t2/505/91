Hiya Rus,

After finding out on the list that the felt seal is designed to keep dirt/debris
out and not water I have replaced with original seal with a weatherstrip felt
seal from my local hardware store.

I had to cut it to fit (it was to wide) and use a good bit of adhesive to adhere
it to the roof but it works well and shows no signs of peeling off.

It's a lot cheaper (~$20.00 felt/adhesive/etc.) then the stock VW seal.

HTH,
Harry
