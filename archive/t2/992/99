Find your local gas supplier.
They will list their options for own/rent and refill/exchange.
And find an alternate supplier who will swap/refill their tanks.
Generally, you purchase small tanks and rent the big ones.
You will trade off convenience and price. Small tanks are portable,
large tanks are cheaper on refill per cu.ft.

Refer to the mig machine manufacturer instructions.
Local welding material suppliers can help with that too.

Don't buy any tank made in China.
Check the inspection date stamped on the tank, especially if you swap refills.
