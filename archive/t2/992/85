you need to rent or purchase an empty tank, and then take it to any
compressed gas place (Robert's is a big one)and they swap it for a
full tank. I use an 80cuft tank (mid size, maybe 3ft high) and it was
about $40 for an Argon/CO2 "welding mix", which seems to work best.

$79 depending on the size may or may not be a good buy. I don't think you
want much less than an 80cuft tank (I have 2) unless you don't hardly do
any welding at all.

you also still need a regulator for the gas tank. need one specifically
for Mig welding gas or an adjustable one.

I use solid .030 wire.

and get a good mask. the electronic ones are fantastic, pricy, but you
only get one set of eyeballs.
