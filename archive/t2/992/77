here  before I got here (I'm in AK now) only thing left is 3 bay bodies and 
6-7 bugs  not worth touching and there is an amazingly straight rust free 
splitty pan,  and I mean pan only, that had the body strategically peeled off at 
some  point.  Unfortunately the pan was then partially crushed.  BUT it  does 
have a tranny (with several corrosion holes through the case) and axles  and 
reduction boxes.  Sitting on a pallet beside it is another tranny,  clutch 
housing down, with the tailhousing off collecting water but intact  otherwise, with 
another set of boxes.  Both are "small nut" I believe but  I'm no split guy.  
Is there any value in me cutting them off and carting  them away (they are 
free.)  Whole dumpster of other stuff, several fair  bay heater boxes, and 
somewhat sadly about 50 T1, and T4 cranks, all greased  carefully, in cloth wrapped 
around them, had been sitting in
plastic  containers, set out about two weeks ago, now all under water.    
Anyway I digress, should I waste my time on the boxes.

Thanks
John



hey john If you have a storage place then yes get them. Also the cranks  
might still have a core valve  later  mark  d
