Subject: clank from behind right front wheel

I drove my bus over to my parents this weekend. I was checking the tire
pressure on the passenger side front wheel. When I push inward on the top of
the wheel I hear a clank. it sounds like something metal attached to the
wheel is hitting something else that is metal. I can do it over and
over....push push push...clank clank clank. It feels almost like the wheel
is loose, but it definitely is not.

Does this sound like a bad ball joint?

Neither of their boots are torn. I tried holding each of them while i pushed
the wheel but couldn't determine where it was coming from. Somewhere in the
vicinity of the upper ball joint I suspect though.

Maybe my front end refresh will have to come sooner than planned.
