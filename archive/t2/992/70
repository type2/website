Subject: Bus cover!

Hey guys,

     I have a 73, non-camper with the spare inside the car (not mounted to the
front). I keep my Bus garaged all the time, but with everything that goes on
in a garage; occasional spray paint, popcorn ceilings dropping crap on my Bus,
dust, and the off chance I accidentally bang into it... I figure the best
protection would be a car cover. Does anyone know what would be the best thing
to get? It doesn't need to be water proof as my Bus will never be stored
outside.


Thanks!!!

Todd
