No Don, that is not the difference.  NB sensors are almost digital, they 
know when you are at stoic (14:7), and when you are not, and which side 
, rich or lean you are on.  In effect the voltage bounces back and forth 
and SW interprets whether the average reading is rich or lean, and 
instructs your system to fix it.  As bad as it sounds, it works fairly 
well if you only want to be at stoic.  However, max power is somewhat 
richer (say 12.5:1), and engines with good cooling systems (not ours) 
can stand leaner (say 16:1)conditions for maximum economy when lightly 
loaded.

A WB sensor gives you linear response between the two extremes of rich 
and lean and everywhere in between.  Thus you can set your system to 
attain a richer mixture when heavily loaded in higher rpms, which is 
desirable for our air-cooleds as most listees will recognize.  You have 
WAAAAY more control with WB. Unfortunately it costs more too because of 
extra HW needed to manipulate the sensor reading.  However, this guy

is communicating with the MS crowd and is producing a cheaper mousetrap.
