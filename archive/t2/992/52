Subject: LOUD Engine (?) Noise

Pumpkin II has startled me twice in the last few weeks
with a VERY load noise...sounds like a very loud and
fast hammering.  It happened while on the road, once
(today) going downhill on the freeway at high speed.

It only lasted a few seconds, and I couldn't correlate
it to any throttle seeting.  Actually I'm not even
certain it was the engine, which is an AVP rebuild
with 11,000 miles (installed by me).  There are no
power problems, all indications are normal.

Two things come to mind...

1) Igntion or valve problem resulting in mis-timed
combustion, or combustion in the exhaust system.

2) Loose rod.  Since the engine's pretty new and the
noise only occured twice I think this is unlikely.

Thoughts?
