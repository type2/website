You should be able to burn a hole through
 practice metal if you pool molten metal at max amperage
and sustainable arc slower feed rate settings.
With body guage metal, it's easier to burn a hole than not
You might as well start with that guage.

Do not use an extension cord. Verify your welder
tip matches the spool wire size. Remove any oxidation
from the immediate weld area with a grinder.
Same for the ground clamp connection.
Tune for the sound of frying bacon,
an audible indicator of proper weld arc.
