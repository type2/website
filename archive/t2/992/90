Yep on 51 or 52 or whatever the old 4 lane up into the southeast side of Pittsburg is from Uniontown.  He was more of a rabbit guy, and perhaps also a home appliance repair guy, or that is what it became.  He has been gone for well over 10 years, even as an appliance place, just a falling over shed the last time I saw.
