Subject: Interior Painting

Hey All,

I'm cleaning up and painting some interior surfaces in
the cab.  I've ground the rust and glue off the
pedestals, and will use a converter on the rust.

The question is this:  I have a lot of clean bare
metal that needs priming but also a lot of surface
where the original paint or primer is still
there...I'm assuming I can prime over pre-existing
primer or paint as well as metal.  Or does it need to
be all bare metal for the primer? I'm using hardware
store paint and primer.

Thanks!
