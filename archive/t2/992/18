you can use either a narrowband or wideband o2 sensor.  The WB sensor 
will give you more information (exact AFR), but the NB will easily pass 
smog.

If you have one MAP sensor, then altitude is compensated for when you 
turn the engine on and off (resamples barometric pressure).  With two 
MAP sensors (additional 15 bux), you can have realtime adjustment.

However, there are many improvements to the code in the MSII 
implementation, problem is, I can't the MSII get it to read a good tach 
signal off my coil.  I'm just going to mount a trigger wheel and VR 
sensor to the back of the fan housing and use that instead.  Much 
steadier tach, anyways.
