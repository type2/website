My suggestion to Greg, take the heads apart for inspection.. at the very 
least lap the valves.. install rings, hone the cylinders,, lap them into the 
heads, to get rid of the gaskets.. install cylinder base gaskets..
double check all the specs and re-assemble 

I would CC the heads too... then he will know the specs of that engine,, not 
just what a book says about it. 

What is a set of rings worth anyway.... my guess was less than $100.00
