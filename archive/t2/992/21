I use a low profile Hyd transmission jack... it is a little easier to use
(My opinion) and it also tilts and pans which the ATV jacks do not.
little bit more expensive but a lot less hassle.  Harbor Freight has one
for right about $100 when you find a sale.  their manual one is functional
but really needs some umph to get it started.
