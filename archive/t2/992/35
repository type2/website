Subject: Bosch injectors

I have 4 Bosch injectors, just back from www.cruzinperformance.com with the complete overhaul, that I need to sell.

I am going to put them on that auction site but thought I would give first shot to somebody on here for what would be my lowest asking price.

They are for Bosch D-Jetronic, I will only sell all 4 together, here is a list of cars that used these injectors http://www.retro.co.za/efi/d-jet.html

Email me directly if you are interested.

Thanks,
James in Portland, Oregon
