Subject: 411 Engine dissection begins...

Hi Volks,

Tonight I put on some gloves to keep my fingers clean (I have a job  
interview tomorrow afternoon; wish me luck) and set into pulling the  
1-2 head off the engine that failed on me back on Thursday. We did a  
compression check on this engine and got 0,27,125,100.  A leakdown  
test indicated the valves were good, and the rings were the culprit.  
(or a holed piston, but luckily that was not the case).

I can't say I've ever seen a cylinder head as clean inside as the one  
I removed.  But then again I haven't pulled engines with only 1000  
miles on them before.

Have a look at the pics here:

 From what I see I think the head is OK. So is a new set of rings and  
a re-hone of the jugs all I need before I put this back in the bus???

Or should I repair this engine and trade it off to someone with a 914  
or 411 for an engine (or monetary equivalent) more bus-appropriate??

Happy Trails,
