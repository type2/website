Hi Brad,

That's not mushrooming, it's a deformed gasket. I will remove the  
gasket and take some more pics later tonight.

The head bolts were not loose and there is no sign of blowby on the  
head.


Happy Trails,

It somewhat looks like in the picture that the cylider head is beat  
(some
mushrooming of the metal)  where the cylinder contacts it, especially on
the right side.  The left side sure appears that it wasn't sealed as
indicated by the soot path.

I suspect that head was loose.
