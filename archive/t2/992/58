Hi Volks,

I pulled the engine a bit further apart tonight, and got some pics of  
the 3-4 side combustion chambers.

It looks to me like the #3 piston wasn't getting any water when it  
was water injected. Or perhaps I have a problem with the fuel  
injector on that cylinder. That may also explain why #3 never showed  
high temps on the CHT gauge.

I have begun to make a to-do list for this engine, and so far it  
reads as follows:

1. 	A.  Remove the valves and springs.
     	B.  Check the guides and seats.
	C.  Lap the valves.
	D.  Reassemble valve train.

2. Check the piston and cylinder dimensions to confirm that they are  
not distorted.

3. Lap the jugs into the heads, and use base gaskets below the jugs  
instead.

4. CC the heads to determine the exact compression ratio of this engine.

5.  Get a set of fuel injectors inspected and flow-tested.

6. Install new rings, and reassemble the engine.

7. Replace the CHT sender, and recess it in the spark plug hole as  
per the GermanSupply tech bulletin.

8. Install engine and set the timing to 27 degrees at 3500 rpm.

9. Run nothing but high-octane fuel,

10. Forget about using water injection for the next 5,000 miles.


Comments greatly appreciated.


Happy Trails,
