Its obvious that a lot of people selling "survivors" aren't familiar with
the VW bus market.
$14,000 for a '75 bus with 68K miles is a bit steep.

I've seen older original mustangs go for less and they are far more sought
after than our buses (don't get mad, it makes our lives easier!)

I live in Massachusetts. Me, I'd offer $8000 sight unseen if I were in the
market for something like that. If I were looking (and had the money) I'd
focus my search on a later model, probably a '78-'79 because of the better
camper layout and hydraulic lifters, which I'd offer more for.

Original, non rusted out buses are hard to come by here. I would imagine in
Arizona the offers would be less as they are more plentiful.
A good driver with rust and lots of miles (usually unknown) goes for
$2500-$4000 here (sometimes with serious rust!).

A bus is only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it.
