Subject: 411 Engine dissection... 0,27,125,100

Greg,
        Based on your compression figs, 0,27,125,100,  I wonder about the 
piston ring diagnosis.  Of course something could have gone wrong in one 
cylinder, but then you would probably see scoring on the piston wall [since you 
say there is no burned crown].  Why do you say, "A leakdown test indicated the 
valves were good..."??  Before you commit to rings, why not pull the valves and 
examine their contact area with respect to their seats?

Good luck!
Glenn

========== REF ==============
Tonight I put on some gloves to keep my fingers clean (I have a job  
interview tomorrow afternoon; wish me luck) and set into pulling the  
1-2 head off the engine that failed on me back on Thursday. We did a  
compression check on this engine and got 0,27,125,100.  A leakdown  
test indicated the valves were good, and the rings were the culprit.  
(or a holed piston, but luckily that was not the case).

I can't say I've ever seen a cylinder head as clean inside as the one  
I removed.  But then again I haven't pulled engines with only 1000  
miles on them before.
