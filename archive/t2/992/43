Hi Bob,

I think it has to do with a number of factors, but loose head bolts  
were not among them.

1. The engine sat for a LONG time. I think that explains the pitting  
on the pistons, and perhaps it could have affected the rings as well.

2. It wasn't broken in properly.

3. Timing. I had timed the bus to run at 7.5 BTDC (-at-) 900RPM with the  
single-vac ditributor from my previous engine. It's a 205P with  
pertronix from a 2L engine.

Subsequent research has shown me that the timing spec for this (high- 
compression) engine using the original distributor is 27 degrees at  
3500 rpm.

I will have to wait until I can compare the timing specs on the  
engine... I don't yet know if there is a significant difference  
between 7.5(-at-)900 and 27(-at-)3500.


Happy Trails,

or possibly escaping between the head and the top of the cyl???

the sudden loss of compression on two cyl is the mystery.  I could maybe
understand one, but both on one side would lead me to think it is
something else, probably in the head rather than the cyl??

rings usually fail over a period of time, not usually all the
sudden....unless something physical is present in which case it would be
one cyl not two...??

this sounds almost exactly like my bad head where there were no gaskets
when there should have been.  I guess you did check the torque on the  
head
bolts...maybe one or two pulled loose??? just grabbing at ideas here
