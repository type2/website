Subject: Redux boxes value?

Well really a VB issue, but I'm not there and I am here.  Oldtime VW place was auctioned a few weeks ago here before I got here (I'm in AK now) only thing left is 3 bay bodies and 6-7 bugs not worth touching and there is an amazingly straight rust free splitty pan, and I mean pan only, that had the body strategically peeled off at some point.  Unfortunately the pan was then partially crushed.  BUT it does have a tranny (with several corrosion holes through the case) and axles and reduction boxes.  Sitting on a pallet beside it is another tranny, clutch housing down, with the tailhousing off collecting water but intact otherwise, with another set of boxes.  Both are "small nut" I believe but I'm no split guy.  Is there any value in me cutting them off and carting them away (they are free.)  Whole dumpster of other stuff, several fair bay heater boxes, and somewhat sadly about 50 T1, and T4 cranks, all greased carefully, in cloth wrapped around them, had been sitting in
 plastic containers, set out about two weeks ago, now all under water.   Anyway I digress, should I waste my time on the boxes.
   
  Thanks
  John
