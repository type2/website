Jason,

It is conventional to rent one's tanks from the
welding supply house and buy the gas that is in
them.  I do annual rentals as would most in a
"shop" setting.

You might want to, as I once did, enroll in a
night course at a voke-ed high school, though 
in my limited experience what makes good welders
is a boatload of practice critiqued by experts
from time to time.
