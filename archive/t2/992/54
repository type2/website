Jason,

DO NOT WELD GALVANIZED! It produces toxic burn off that can damage your
lungs and poison you. It also welds poorly and weakens at the weld area.

I have a big piece of what I believe is galvanized metal that used to sit
under my washer and drier. Can galvanized metal be welded to regular steel?
If not, what resources would y'all suggest for getting pieces of steel to
use for light body work and welding practice?
