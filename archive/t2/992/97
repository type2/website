Hey Rick,

You can paint over existing paint with primer, just make sure you knock down
the gloss with sandpaper so the primer has something to adhere to. They also
make a prep spray called "No Sand" (I believe that is the name) that preps
the area to hold new paint. Do a little research to find which hardware
store paint has the best online reputation, as there is a large differential
in quality.
