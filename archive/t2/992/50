Hi Jamie,

That sounds like a good idea to me.

It sounds like an awesome opportunity for a tech seminar at BOTC. Now  
all I need (nudge nudge) is someone to lead it...

BTW, they have digital micrometers on sale at crappy tire this week;  
somehow I think this would be a good time to pick one up... Product  
#58-6800-4

Happy Trails,
