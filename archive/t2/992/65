Hi Marcus,

DO NOT ignore that hose. It's as prone to leaks as any other  
pressurized hose on the bus, maybe more so.

When I replace these lines I cut the crimps off with a dremel tool  
and replaced them with a fi hose clamp. If you take the injectors to  
a rebuilder you can get new lines crimped onto them.


Happy Trails,
