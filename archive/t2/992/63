Subject: replacing fuel lines and lifter noise

I am about to replace the fuel lines on myonnie's '78. Everything looks
straightforward EXCEPT the last piece of hose between the injectors and the
rail: hose clamp on the fuel rail side, but a crimped connection on the
injector side. What do folks usually do about this? Simply ignore this last
stretch of hose?

Noisy lifters: in the past i have used ATF before an oil change to clean
engines internally. Any advice against this? The idea is to add a quart to the
crankcase, idle the engine for a while, and then do an oil change. The
detergents in the ATF are supposed to do a good job of cleaning gunk out of
lifters and other parts.
