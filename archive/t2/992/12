Subject: Re: [T2] please help with coil?

I keep remembering John Muir "Timing is when the match is lit; dwell is 
how long it stays lit"........and if you have a degreed crank pulley, it 
can be measured directly with a voltmeter or even a continuity tester 
across the points......

.                         V (-) Coil terminal
So the Dwell =  90 (-) ---------------------- (X)90
.                         V (+) Coil terminal

Gee, use for high school algebra- hope we all remember to multiply 
before doing subtractions.
