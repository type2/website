This place is about ~15-20 miles south of Uniontown right on 119, but I 
have heard of another place on route 51 (in Elizabeth, maybe?) right on 
the route from Uniontown to Pittsburgh.  Never been there though, and the 
person I talked to hadn't been there in ... 4-5 years, so I don't know the 
status of it.

(I've google'd for the place on route 51, but not been able to find any 
info on it...)
