I'm interested in trying to the WI as well.  I have the megasquirt and 
I'm pretty sure it will support it natively.  I know there is a bug guy 
that uses it.  Here is more info:

Very interesting reading - especially the part on pairing of the 
injectors.  Here is an excerpt from the 3rd page:

"Some rather amazing improvements have been made since the last post!

Most importantly, I got around to reading the old service manual for 
stock fuel injection that came on ACVWs in the 60s and 70s. It paired 
injector firings, just like MegaSquirt on alternating squirts. The 
factory had paired injectors 1+4 and 2+3. Mine were paired 1+3 and 2+4. 
I got to thinking about that. Paired 1+4 and 2+3, there would be 180 
degrees between each injection event and the respective intake valve 
opening. Paired the way I had it, it was actually uneven.

I swapped injector connectors 3 and 4 ... and every single tuning 
problem I have had since beginning my MegaSquirt project disappeared. No 
more hunting idle; idle was smooth and steady at 1000 RPM, with a 
rocksteady pulsewidth of 2.0. No hesitation off-idle. No bucking on the 
low end."
