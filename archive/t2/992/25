To me, without the lambda there's no point. I'll just keep using the
stock system. I like the idea of 2 MAPs too. I frequently go from 5k
to 3k to 8k in a single drive here in Colorado.

From what I've read, using a WB sensor just provides faster
correction, is that right? If so, I'll save the $80 and buy a NB
sensor. ;)

I'm not financially ready to buy one, but I'm laying things out. Over
the years I've noticed things I'd like to have automated, and MS with
O2 and MAPs would do just what I want.
