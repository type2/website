Subject: Re: [T2] airidZona bus sale

This looks like a very nice mostly original bus with low miles.  I see
a lot of information posted wrong and not enough pictures of the
interior and engine.  I dislike this type of ad that has too much hype
and information, which appears to be a third party account of it's
history.

The ad says "everything on this vehicle is original. I can see quite
a few things that are not original including the curtains and the spare
mounted on front.  Who knows what items are missing and with no pics of
the engine anything goes.

Quite a few years back there was a '74 Westy at the Auburn Hills VW
show with 15K on it.  That was the most original Bay Westy I've ever
seen.

There has been recent discussion regarding bus pricing.  Is this bus
really worth the $14K asking price.  I own one almost identical ('74
Westy), but I have an extra 100K on the odometer, and lot of non
original parts.
