Subject: Re: [T2] 76 broke down.........ideas?

Here is what i found so far.  Plugged fuel filter. Seriously plugged.  So
the lesson is if your van sits for awhile, you need to run it and change the
filter a few times.
  I changed it and the oil, and it runs about 90% as good as ever...still is
smoking a little white so i may have plugged an injector.will look more
tomorrow.

Dwell was 44 so i did not do anything to that.

No more missing or popping but a little sluggish under load now.

More to come tomorrow.  I am going to look at injectors, pressure,
