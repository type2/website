Subject: Re: [T2] VW Undercoating. Recovering it possible?

Beware of undercoating that separates from the metal it is covering... Will form a pocket that holds water and causes rust through. I have 2 VW's with this very problem. 

I would reccomend Waxoyl or one of the MANY homemade recipes found on the web...
