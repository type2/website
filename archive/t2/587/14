Here is what happened. Van has been running great.
Started losing power and backfiring.............had to "limp" about 5 more
miles to a friends house to get off the interstate.
All vacuum attached.................oil level about 2" high, so i suspect
leaky or constant injector. I unplugged cold start valve and same symptoms.
Distributor did not come loose, either.
I have to get back over there and fix it after lunch...............any
ideas?

There is a possibility that you didn't mention: Take off the "S" pipe at 
the firewall and check its lower bend for a crack. Grip the pipe with both 
hands and try to flex it, and look for the crack on the inner aspect of the 
bend. 25+ years of flexing may have caused a materials failure. Mine did.
