Yeah, re-reading my original post, I guess it wasn't too clear what I'm 
after...

I have a 1978 US bus.  I know the injectors that came with it are the 
proper part.  That part number is:

VW 022 906 031D / Bosch 0 280 150 114

I recently acquired 4 used injectors, presumably from a Type-IV powered 
Bus.  In addition to having gray-ish white connectors instead of blue, 
they are marked as such:

VW 022 906 031B / Bosch 0 280 150 100

A quick Google of the Bosch number yields pages like this:

...that indicate the flow rate of the 100 is the same as the 114.

The questions:

Should the 100 be considered a direct replacement for the 114's?  For 
example, if one of my 114's tested bad, could I just put in a 
known-good 100?

What was the original application of the 100?  Did it come as stock on 
a VW model, or was it sold as a replacement through dealers?


Richard's page doesn't mention the 100's


Thanks for any efforts to help clear up this minor mystery.
