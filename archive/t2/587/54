Subject: Newly rebuilt engine wont run right

Hey list-

Im new here, and very excited to finally have someone to ask questions!

Ok, so here's the deal.  I have a 1973 Westfalia with a 1700, centermounted 
Weber carb, but otherwise stock.  I rebuilt it last summer, and have slowly 
been getting it going.  It runs now, but far from right.

The engine will start, and rev up a bit, then fall off and try to stall a 
few seconds later.  If I give it a little gas, it'll come back up and 
eventually stay running, but rough.  I put a timing light on the ignition 
wires, and each causes a flash every time like it should, so I know the 
ignition is ok.  Another thing, when it does finally idle, it'll only run 
about 2 minutes and then just fall off and stall.  I still cant find the 
timing mark, so I dont know where the timing is, but its close enough now to 
run at least.

I have dual exhaust, and the driver side exhaust comes out hot and loud.  
The passenger side comes out relatively cold and quiet.  I figure this means 
one of the cylinders isnt firing.  But is the cold side not firing, thats 
why its cold, or is the hot side not firing, and the extra gas is making it 
hot and loud?

Im really lost here.  Any suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated.  Thanks!
