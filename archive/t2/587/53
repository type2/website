Subject: brush on bedliner brand?

Terry/et.al.

What was the brand name of the brush on bedliner that everyone 
liked...couldn't find it in the archives...from the discussion several 
weeks ago.

I need some to go on some fiberglass...hopefully in sort of a spotty 
black and grey...might have to be spray on for that I guess....

Cheers, dave
