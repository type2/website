Subject: long bolts, tight space

I'm trying to remove my gas tank, but I see that the bolts holding the
straps down in in a very tight space inside a cavity under the van (1977
Riveria).  What do you folks use to get to the nuts??  A standard socket is
too short, so I can't even fit one to see what size I need.
