    Suspect the rubber boots that connect your center section of the
manifold to the runners. Severe vaccum leak there will cause poor idle
perhaps not even running.

    I would verify that rough timing and firing order is absolutely right
before moving on. Find TDC #1 on power stroke (using pencil in sparkplug
hole as described in this list earlier in the month and look at rocker
arms/valve movement to assure you are on power stroke) once you have assured
you are at top dead center on power stroke, verify rotor is pointing to the
position on the distributor cap that is connected to #1 cylinder. This will
give you ball park idea that #1 will receive spark on its power stroke. From
there verify firing order.(I have seen these engine run better that you
would think with mixed up firing order)

       If you are still having problems after these two things, go back to
the real basics ..... Compression, Vacuum (check for leaks-Is your brake
booster hooked up and leaking vacuum?), Fuel (look at the plugs, are they
fouled or perfectly clean?), Spark- Are you getting a good hot spark at the
coil? At the plugs?, Timing (While you were establishing TDC #1 you may want
to make some basic marks for timing.)  and so on.  Hope this helps - Jeff
