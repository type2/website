I envy your freedom, if it is true that no one will hassle you
about your project bus. Be very polite to your new neighbors.

I had my bus parked under a nice shade tree, on the concrete
driveway, in front of the garage door, in front of my detached
garage in the alley.

I mean, where else would you work on your car.

I got hassled. The Aesthetic Gestapo (health department goons)
sent me a letter stating that they would tow away my bus in 10
days if I did not hide it from public view.

Okay, I admit, it did not have current license plates on it. But
it looked exactly like a vehicle. It would look exactly the same
with current license plates. So, luckily, it was over 25 years
old, so I could get "historic vehicle" plates via mail order to
the State Division of Motor Vehicles. This may be a solution
to solve some problems with busy body neighbors.

I put on the "historic plates" and I thwarted the Aesthetic
Gestapo.

I still worry about it. Especially now that it is running. The
Aesthetic Gestapo can put a 24 hour tow away ticket on any vehicle
parked on the public streets. It doesn't matter if you have your
own vehicle parked in front of your own house and you have current
plates and current inspection and current insurance you are still
in danger. If the Aesthetic Gestapo come after you, you are toast,
and your vehicle will be towed away with a huge exorbitant towing
fee and storage fee and release fee, etc..

I live in Columbia, Missouri.  I have heard worse horror stories
about other places.
