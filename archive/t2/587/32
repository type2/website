Subject: once again a bus owner!!! on the list again, just cant wait to

bussers,

Ive been busless for 7 months and 8 days now, and happy to say im back. 
Found a nice 81 aircooled westfalia in New Mexico and am in the middle of 
setting up a time to fly in and drive it back here to Minneapolis, MN. Ill 
be sure to bring my airs list copy along with me just in case, seeing how 
its an unfamiliar vehicle to me. Ive owned a 75 as well as a 76 so far and 
from what I remember, an 81 should pretty much be the exact same thing I had 
before under the hood. (just more room in the above-motor hole I guess.)

With that being said, and since I always thought I would get another 
baywindow, I have some baywindow only items that I will be putting up for 
sale here tonight. This list has always been good to me, so everything will 
be at pretty fair prices, and if not, let me know and ill see what we can 
work out.

anyone with a Chrome yellow westy out there will find some pretty neat 
stuff, or anyone with a 76 specific model.

dont email, just check the site a bit later tonight.

ill have things like a clock, some white vw logo mudflaps, a 76 chrome 
liscene frame, suicide knob for the shifter, shifter extension (or can I use 
that on a vanagon?), knobs, switches, door rubber, just lots of this and 
that.

alright, well, wish me luck!

best,

aircooled chris
81 Vanagon westy (soon)
76 westy (gone)
75 transporter (gone)
and a few watercoolers.
anyone in the market for a 98 GTI with 75k miles?
(in Minneapolis)





glad to be part of the community again. what are people flaming about today?


my guesses include :

customer #5 (out of the thousands) bought something from Busdepot and its 
not there yet, RON is to blame!   (im sure ill find myself making a visit to 
the depot shortly)

to synthetic or not to synthetic?

anyone know how/where I can lower/insulate/get custom wheels/pimp out my 
bus?
