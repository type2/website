Honestly I think that if the flow rates are the same and the body dimensions 
are the same, I would say same. Yes go ahead and use them. If I am wrong and 
somebody out there knows it they will probably pipe up here. I am only 
speaking with logics though. I am definately not a Bosch Tech. Historian, 
nor do I play one on TV. They could have been an exact match and mated with 
different external part colors to aid with the color match to a different 
vehicles harness. All the plugs on my harness are basically color 
coordinated with there respective part recepticle. It seems feasible that it 
could be the same part but for a different colored recpticle.

Good Luck,
