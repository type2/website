Subject: How to Read Dipstick (for Compleat Idiot)?

This question is almost too stupid to ask...but ow do you read your 
dipstick?

Back in the day I learned to 1) Pull, 2) Read, 3) Wipe, 4) Repeat. 
Supposedly the second reading was most accurate. PROBLEM IS that when I 
do this with the bus, flat edge of the stick pointing down (DOWN means 
DOWN), the first pull seems to dribble some oil in the tube that sort 
of smears all over the stick when I read the second time.

BUT, if I take a reading with the flat edge of the stick facing up (you 
know) I don't seem to get the same reading as with the stick facing 
down. Maybe as much as a pint's difference.

Does anyone know which is the most correct reading, up or down...or am 
I just imagining that there's a difference?

Pictures here if I'm not making myself clear:
