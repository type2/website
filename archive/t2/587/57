You forgot the part about wipe an inch off the stick before you show it to
your customer then pinch them for a quart of oil.

Phil,

Back in the days that I worked at a "service" station when the "attendant"
did all of that for you, here is how it worked.

Grip handle, pull stick out while at the same time holding your "red rag"
around it tightly down as you pulled it out.

Reinsert, wait  1/2 second and pull and read.

Always read VW's with flat side down cause you are at an angle...you will
get false reading with the flat side up.

Cheers, dave
