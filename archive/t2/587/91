Great, that sounds MUCH more like it.  That means I can pick up 2 more 
degrees advance.  (strangely, when I first fired it up, it was at like 15 to 
20 degrees and still didnt ping... guess thats an advantage of super low CR) 
Im going to hook up the advance as soon as I get to the parts store to buy a 
peice of hose.  Just one of those things I figured I could wait on until I 
could get it above idle. :)

This makes perfect sense.  Thanks a lot, I never really did understand the 
whole 009 thing.
Looks like Im fresh outta questions on this topic for now.  Thanks to all of 
you who helped.
