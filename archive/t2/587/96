Subject: Re: [T2] Locking Gas Cap

I picked up a cap this week from my local VW parts house (VeeVillage 
Kansas City, Missouri) for about $12.  It might be worth calling them 
and having one shipped.  Pmail me if you want the number.  A Google 
serach for Vee Village will provide the number.  Ask for Mike and tell 
him I sent you.
