Subject: Timing Issues

Hey guys-

Ive got the engine running a bit better, and I found the timing mark for 
sure this time.  However, the book says the timing should be about retarded 
5 degrees, but as I get down to about 4 to 6 degrees advanced, I start 
getting carb backfire.  I dont think it will make it to the other side of 
TDC.  Any ideas?  Also, how do I know if I have a stock distributor or an 
.009?  The guy I bought this from said he had put in an 009 and could never 
get the timing right.  I got the impression he'd taken it out and put back 
the old one, but I dont know for sure now that I think about it.  All I can 
say about the distributor is its one with a round hole, not square, where 
the points connect to the condenser.

Oh yeah, 1973 with a 1700 centermounted weber.

If its an 009, is the timing supposed to be different?  Im so used to 
American cars with 8-12 degrees advanced...

Thanks all
-Tom
