Chris and bus vans of both camps...

Having owned and driven both for more than a few years....

Driver height...6'4"....gotta hump over in the splitty to see out well
and see stoplights turn green.

Bad as we think the bay seats are, "I" think the splits are worse for big 
guys....and believe me, I spent a lot of time in my 67 as it was my daily 
driver for almost 5 years or so.  I spent a lot of time on the road in it 
and with my left foot parked on the under dash tray trying to keep from 
getting terminal dead bu** syndrome.

Better brakes and cross wind control in a bay(at least I think so) and 
more power...yes, I had a big engine in my 67 too, but ended up throwing a 
rod thru the top of it because of all the rpm's.  Ya just haven't had any 
fun at all untill you have been stopped at midnight by a cop because you 
were weaving and he thought you were drunk....he didn't realize there was 
a 30-40mph cross wind and a blizzard that had anything to do with it.

But!  I surely did love it!

Just my opinion....

Cheers, dave
