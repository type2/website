Subject: Re: [T2] VW Undercoating. Recovering it possible? 

Chris,

Someone once claimes they had good luck with a "steam shark"...sold at 
your better hardware/dept stores.  I tried one, but it didn't work as well 
as I thought it would...most of my undercoating is no longer soft, but 
hard and brittle.

Really wanted it off easy so I could por-15 it.

One of the vw mags had a whole article on how to remove it several months 
ago, and all of the stuff they tried...and what worked best and 
easiest...which IIRC was the sponge rubber looking wheels that chuck into 
your drill motor.


Cheers, dave
