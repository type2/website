Subject: Starter Dead

I guess that I have a dead starter now - Today I go out to do some house
keeping items - clamps - and a new throttle return spring etc. nothing
electrical - I take the bus for a ride - new spring feels much better - So I
am all happy - then - I get back in - no start - no clicking nothing
Checked battery - 12.8 volts - power to coil power at the starter - cleaned
everything tightened everything still nothing - it is as thought the key was
never turned
power everywhere else - lights dim slightly when I try to turn it over
I put a jumper wire to the starter from the battery ( ignition terminal )
still nothing
Anybody with any more ideas to try - or does it sound like it has had it

Thanks
