i am working on it, but it won't be easy, as the new style thermostat does
not fit into the original TIV bracket. i will have to use the replacement
cantilever style t-stat bracket, i think.

in the meantime we are selling T1 bellows thermostats for use in tIV, and we
have a tech article on the installation which will be posted to our site
next week. the conversion is easy.
