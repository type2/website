Subject: Re: [T2] Timing Issues

I think you may have missed my second reply on this topic; you'll note
that I said:

"And the idle timing ultimately determines the *max advance* allowed for
that engine, given it's the correct distributor for that engine model."

However, when I answered with the 10 atdc, I didn't repeat the "correct
distributor clause" because I had mentioned it already.  My bad for
leaving that out because you caught me on that one ;)

Obviously if you are using a non-stock distributor, your settings are
going to change, like you have written.  I have never had an issue about
that at all.  However when people get these random distributors and drop
them in their engines blindly thinking they can all time them to 7.5
btdc regardless of their engine model, I think that's not smart.

Now, if it so happens that if I drop a spiffy new svda distributor that
I bought from aircooled in any model engine bus and it just so happens
that timing it to 7.5 btdc gives it the same advance as using the stock
distributor on that engine, then that's awesome and it's a great
coincidence.  I haven't done the math, but I also haven't been in the
habit of giving out numbers, either - except for this last email, which
I had still said in a previous email "assuming it's the correct
distributor".

If my thinking is still flawed, please let me know.

thanks,
mike
