Subject: engine pulled how does the engine stand work

Got my engine pulled today.  Went really well thanks to the archives and the
list.  I got engine stand for  a present ( I think from bus depot) and it
doesn't seem to match the bolts out of the bottom of the engine.  I was able
drill it out to fit but the bolts are not threaded all the way.  How do I get
the engine stand tight.
