Subject: VW Undercoating. Recovering it possible? 

Hey hey, my bus has that thick tar like undercoating on it. It's done
the job well! But it's soft and gushy where deisel and other road oils
have hotten to it. My question is, after removing the bad parts, can new
undercoating be put on OVER the old undercoating? Or would I have to
remove ALL the old undercoating first? 
 
Also, what have ya'll found to be good ways of taking off old
undercoating. I've tried soaking in Deisel before, and that was a stinky
mess I don't wanna experience again. I've heard heat works good, but
I've never tried it. Any other ideas? 
 
TIA
