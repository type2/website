As you know, the distributor drive shaft - that piece that slides into the
top of the engine and engages the big gear on the cam - has an offset slot
at its top end.  The distributor drive dog at the bottom of the distributor
is similarly offset.  So, it's really only possible to have the distributor
and distributor drive shaft engage one way, when both offsets are oriented
the same.

If you've ever inserted a distributor drive shaft in an engine, or read
about it, then you know the drill as to how to get the drive shaft inserted
correctly; you bring #1 to TDC on the IGNITION stroke, and then slide the
drive shaft home, making sure the offset in the drive shaft is "properly"
oriented in comparison to the centerline of the engine.  (What's the
"proper" orientation depends on the particular engine.)  Once you've got the
drive shaft seated in the engine correctly you slide the distributor into
place and find that the rotor is pointing to the #1 plug wire.  So how can
you get the distributor "180 degrees" off if the distributor can only be
inserted one way?

The "180 degrees" off issue can only occur if instead of having #1 on TDC of
the IGNITION stroke when you insert the drive shaft you mess up and have #1
on TDC of the EXHAUST stroke.  Now, when you slide the drive shaft into
position with its offset in the "proper" position (i.e., so many degrees
offset from the engine center line) and slide the distributor into place,
you'd find that the rotor is still pointing at the #1 plug wire, ready to
fire #1 even though the cylinder itself ISN'T ready to fire.

There's 2 ways to fix this:  either pull out the distributor drive shaft and
re-seat it correctly, or move the plug wires at the distributor 180 degrees
from their proper positions.  (When #1 is at TDC of the exhaust stroke #3 is
at TDC of the ignition stroke, so you move the #3 wire to the #1 spot on the
distributor, and so on.)
