Subject: Exhaust Leak Mystery Solved....

Hey Everyone,

I wanted to share what $400 lesson I learned this week.  I had a huge exhaust
leak after pulling my engine. I dropped the heater boxes twice thinking they
were leaking where the heater boxes mate up to the heads...

After many hours of frustration I had the bus towed to a local VW shop.  They
also suspected the heater boxes and put 3.2 hours in pulling, re-sealing,
stripping studs etc...
After all this, we still had an exhaust leak.  Turns out I removed a couple of
strange looking plugs going into the heads, right next to the intake
manifolds.  I thought these were supports for some linkage on the dual carbs
or something.


These ports were originally an attempt to make the VW enviromentally
friendly?


Anyways, I have two ports on either side.  The front ports seem slightly
larger than the rear.  Both of my fronts are now plugged with new weird
looking bolts.  The driver's rear is completely open! and the passenger rear
looks like the original tube, pinched together, but not making a good seal.
I still have a much smaller exhaust tick... Should the rear ports be plugged
tightly as well?

Thanks guys,

Tom
