Subject: 73 Westy Foam for Upholstery Size

I have a 73 Westy in need of some reupholstery work in the back. Zbed, way-back 
cushion and the jumpseat and jumpseat back all need to be redone, both foam and 
covers. What thickness of foam is suggested? I seem to remember that thickness changed
with the 74's, but mebbe not. My memory has wandered off again. If you see it, please
tell it to come home. All is forgiven. Thanks!
