Subject: Brake light on the dash

Hi all,
Question about the brake light on the dash of a 71 bus.

I was moving  my cars around the driveway last night. When I moved the 
bus, the brake light on the dash came on. The light lit up only when I 
had the lights on, and  when my foot was not pressing the brake pedal. 
After a few minutes, as the engine warmed up (it had been sitting for 
about 5 hours ebfore I started it), the brake light went out. During my 
drive to work earlier in the day, the light did not come on, even when 
the lights were on.  I have had recent (two weeks ago recent) brake work 
done.The rear brakes were replaced, the front brakes were checked out as 
being ok. Should I be concerned?
