Also, don't assume it's the normal distributor.  Make sure it is!  And 
if it is the correct distributor, the vacuum line won't make much 
difference while you're timing around idle.  It will affect your max 
advance, though.  Without the hose, it's pretty much like an 009, if you 
want to see what everyone is "raving" about.. hahaha
