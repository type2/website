Subject: West River Westies Campout on Bald Mtn, VT

Don't remember seeing a plug for this campout spotted on the LIMBO site-
Hello other NJ/NY Westy campers and bus owners-anyone in the area
aware/going to the campout (Bald Mtn Campground) in a week by Townsend,
Vt?  It replaces Transporters by the Tunnel, saw it on the LIMBO
website.
We will take Nyssa's 75 bus; she's been working on the interior and
designs for the anime to be painted on it.
   Went to BusFusion a few weeks ago in Ontario; nice campout on the
Canadian Mississippi river, but the US was sorely under-represented-only
saw about 2 other busses from the States!
Border had lines coming back to US; glad we took the passports.
