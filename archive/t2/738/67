I haven't made it to fusion yet, but I do *burn* the stuff.  There's really
plenty of room to store hydrogen in a Bus if you're creative!

My primary hydrogen storage is in two long cylinders that I've mounted in
place of the old front and rear bumpers.  I also keep a reserve supply in all
four of my tires, though I haven't figured out how to connect them to the fuel
system yet.  Or how to solve the issue of the tires going flat when I access
their contents.

Since there are times I need extra power, I keep a premixed supply of hydrogen
and pure oxygen in a third tank that I've custom-mounted in the unused space
in the engine compartment -- you know, directly above the engine.  This "turbo
boost tank" is ported directly to the intake manifold, so when I need to pass
a Ferrari or whatever, I can just pull a knob on the console to open the
valve, and then hold on tight.  At least that's the theory!  I'll be testing
it out tonight.

Cheers!
