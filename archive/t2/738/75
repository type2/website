Thanks all for the great info guys!
Sorry to sound silly, but am I correct in assuming "oil pressure relief" 
just bypasses the cooler, and the "oil control" bleeds excess oil to the 
sump? (I don't have my Bentley handy).
I'm just looking into some low oil pressure issues for a friend, and the 
reliefs are the next step in the elimination process, nothing obvious yet. 
At least I am armed with the right info now.

As for the fan, BusBosss Pierre would a pic of each be possible? (you can 
p-mail me), and would they be interchangeable? It's an ongoing debate we've 
had that the vanagon fan pushes more air than the T2 fan.

Cheers,
Richard
