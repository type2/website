Subject: Re: [T2] Boge Shocks for $18 Each!

I have now put about a hunded miles on the Bus Depot Closeout IP
shocks at 17.95$ each. The ride is soft and the damping is good. I
like soft and would never stop playing with the adjustment if I had
Konis. At a quarter of the Koni price it is a fair deal.

IP should have targetted the computer geeks like me. Slogans like :
"With IP your route is more stable"  would have amused.

Has anyone tried Cofap shocks for their Bus.  Supposedly Cofap is
OEM for VW.  I can get them for $16 a piece.  I currently have
KYB's front and rear, but ride is a little harsh.  Could not afford to
get into KONI deal :(
