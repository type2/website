Subject: Re: [T2] Dirty engine pics

Hi Greg,

You said, "If anyone wants to take a look at the engine pics and 
confirm that the pattern of the oil originates at the oik cooler seals 
it would help ease my mind."

Mine (my previous T4 longblock) looked very similar about a year ago.  
The rear (crank/fan) seal had failed because the internal spring had 
broken.  Since the oil leaks out at RPM right at the cooling fan, it 
goes everywhere.  The seal can be replaced without removing the engine.

Good Luck,
Jeff
