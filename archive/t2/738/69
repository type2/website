Subject: Old gas

Greetings,
     I am in the process of reviving my '72 weekender.  The bus has been
sitting inside my un-heated or cooled shop building.  It was parked with gas
in the tank.  Today, I opened the C-clamp that I used to close up the fuel
hose to drain the tank.  The gas came out looking and smelling like gas
should.  Since the gas seems OK, should I anticipate having to pull the tank
and clean it, or will I be OK just draining the tank and using new gas?

Take care,
Stuart
