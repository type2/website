Subject: RE: [T2] still problems starting

Zach - do you have a battery charger? I simply couldn't drive my Westy 
without one. I've found that a battery that isn't about 75% charged won't 
start either of my 71s. And with my generator on the fritz I've been 
charging my battery every morning and it has prevented the starting problems 
I used to have.

Even a brand new battery won't be fully charged, the longer it sits on the 
shelf the more juice it looses.

You starter may be too wore out. Charge up your battery 100% and see how the 
starter spins. Your charging system like mine might not be up to par....or 
you could have a short in the system. Definately do this before you pull the 
starter.
