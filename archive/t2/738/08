Some bits I don't need that were in my 71:

Type 4 (76-81?) starter: 001 211 221 (Core since it looks pretty
tired) -

(Missing parts, it will be removed from doghouse. I want an alt, not genny.)

Beatup and spraypainted silver Type 1 Doghouse cooler, upper cyl tins,
a few other odds and ends.

I'll ship for cost everything except the tinwork. I don't have any
boxes big enough.

I haven't really determined what bits I need yet besides an engine. ;)
