.... "take to a pro for paint".

Consider the possibility that final color/clear is only
color and shine- all the quality of professional paint
is entirely in the prep work, and begins at the metal surface.
Professional paint systems have fairly specific requirements.
I suggest that compatibility issues will require your questions
to be directed to the shop, and before prep work begins.
