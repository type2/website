Subject: Re: [T2] folding seat

We did this for Nyssa's 75 hardtop bus, using a 74 bedseat.  No problems 
if you have the dogs that go into the floor slots.  You will have to 
drill into the wheel wells for the sides that bolts over this.  If you 
keep the wall panels, you may have to lightly grind the sides of the bed 
seat front to have it fit.
   If your rear seat was the folding kind or you can find one, consider 
using it to make the bed-good if you want to keep the stock look, even 
with the middle seat in.  What we did was to create a strap loop at the 
bottom of the seat frame that one could loop another strap through and 
up over the headrest mount. Our strap was webbing to which 2" velcro was 
sewn to, about 8" of overlap. This allows you to keep the seat flat by 
pulling it down to level.  Then we cut a board (1/8" birch panel) that 
spanned over the 4" or so gap between rear engine deck and seatback. 
The board can be stored under the rear mat or as we did, under the 
carpet.  Then we cut 2" foam the width of the bed (narrowed by the spare 
tire) and sewed a custom flannel cover for it.  The is kept behind the 
bedseat folded in half or kept in a rolled form.  Worked very well until 
we found the bedseat, which allows all that great storage under it.  My 
daughter took out the middle seat and left out any jumpseat, and with a 
mat, a 5.5 foot person can sleep on the floor diagonally.
