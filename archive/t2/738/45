Subject: folding seat

Will i have any problems installing a folding bed seat in the back of my 75
Microbus (8 seater) which is currently stripped bare inside? as in do you
think it will fit the original holes for the bolts etc

secondly for those in Oz, especially Sydney anyone know where i could start
to look for one?


Cheers all,

Jason
