The one by the oil filter is the oil pressure relief valve. The one on the
other side of the case is the oil control valve:

Looking at the picture you gave in reference, I now know what this big plug
is for (would never or hardly find without your posting).  Thanks.

I'm not sure if the hub is different but the castings of the fan are
different.

I can tell that fan housing is different on a Vanagon because there is no
air outlets for the heat boxes.  All air to the heat boxes is supplied by
the fan attached to the alternator.  About the fan itself I do not think
there is a difference.  I do not know when you say "casting of the fan" if
you refer at the fan housing or at a part of the fan.  I will compare the
two tonight so I can better understand (fan from a transporter 1976 to a fan
from a vanagon 83, both air-cooled).
