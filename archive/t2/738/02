Subject: Re: [T2] part number needed

From bill moon:

Thanks very much Karl. I want to see if I can get one of these from a
dealer. I've found that the dealer parts dept is more cooperative if I
 have a part number in advance. For future reference, how does one get
 from an item on the figure (in the fiche) to a part number?

-------------------------------------------------------------------

To get a part number, you need parts books and the ETKA disc.

Between the early books and the disc, part numbers were superceded and some were deleted  because they were
NLA. That is the sad part, when they became NLA, the part number vaporizes...

Let me know if you can't find the bolt.
