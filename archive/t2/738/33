Bob, thanks, I've studied that drawing.  What it
doesn't show is the bracket that bolts to the front of
the transmission that the flexible tube mounts to.  I
think my bracket is too far rearward.  When I look at
ETKA, it appears there is a spacer or something that
looks as if it is missing on mine.  thanks again, Greg
