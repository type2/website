Subject: Busses and Saabs at the Farm....

I'm still totally blown away by these pics...

I find this totally fascinating.  Some of these pictures would even look cool in B&W and framed!


Greg, do you know the story behind it? What was the purpose for that guy collecting all of those SAABs and those Busses?


I know how it can be when you get a little crazy and start buying up a bunch of cars... at one point I had 4 Fieros.... but 30?! 

Was the guy running some kind of parts business back in the day?


I'm curious to hear about the story behind these cars...
