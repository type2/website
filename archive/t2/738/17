I've had several Fords and have not had serious trouble with any of them.  Last I had was a Taurus SHO.  Now that was a hot-rod!  I was sitting waiting to turn and got rear-ended by an 18 year old on a cell phone.  I love that new 500.  Fords just require regular maintenance.  Tauri are hard on transmissions.  But I had mine flushed every 30,000 miles and never lost one.  They also don't like to be run hot.  I lost a head gasket on one years ago and regularly check my water levels.   But I'll never own another GM product again.  Multiple problems over the years.  
 
I've owned three VW's and have run the wheels off of all of them.  A GTI saved my life once, though it was totalled.  VW's don't have creature comforts, but they have character and reliability.  I really prefer German cars over any other.  My Jaguars have character but no reliability.  
 
Overall, I'm as happy with my bus as a daily driver than any of the 26 cars I've owned.  Rust not withstanding.  Thanks...KR


 

What can I say though. I drive vintage VWs which may need major engine service at 65K (heads).
