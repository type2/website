Volkswagen has just announced that the Volkswagen
Microbus, which captured the imagination of the media
and car designers worldwide when it was shown in
concept form at the Detroit Auto Show in January 2001,
is to go into production.

By deciding to build the Microbus, Volkswagen has set
its sights on a new segment - a MPV combining striking
design and high functionality with the comfort of a
limousine. 50 years ago the first Volkswagen bus left
the production line and it is now returning to
Hanover. The Volkswagen bus was never just a means of
transport, it has always been an emotive cult object.
The public's reaction at motor shows combined with the
findings of market studies already shows that the
Microbus design has a spontaneous appeal, and that the
vehicle will follow in the footsteps of its successful
predecessor.

happy driving sam
