Maybe find a new mechanic. 

Have the wiring inspected - all of it by a competent mechanic and then check things like pulley alignment, belt tension, regulator, etc. This shouldn't be hard for a decent mechanic. Are the pulley in good condition? Are they OEM VW or aftermarket Taiwanese stuff? How tight is the belt when it is put on? There should be a LITTLE slack in the belt. If too tight, as the motor heats and expands there will be additional stress put on the belt beyond the setup tension. I'm thinking the books aid 1/4" deflection when cold? 

I think you've got bad wires or switched wires also. 

BE SURE you fix the burning smell so you don't burn the bus down! This CAN happen easily!
