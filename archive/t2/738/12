Subject: Re: [T2] Air Compressor / Blasting

See what the continuous CFM rating is at 90 PSI. If your compressor can push more air than your sandblaster, you are able to blast continuously. If your compressor is close to matching or bettering the sand blaster you'll have to blast, stop, wait for the compressor to catch up and then start again. I have do LOTS of blasting with a too small blaster. Requires patience. On the other hand I have used a diesel powered jack hammer compressor and it is WONDERFUL. Price a rental! Might be worth it! Your bus can pull it. Mine did. 

I usually put a box fan next to my compressor to help it stay cool. Seems to help the amount of moisture that it generates. 

Use a GOOD respirator. You can RUIN your lungs that way!

Also price around. A local monument company does it cheap enough it makes it worth it to let them do the work.
