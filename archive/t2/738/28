Hi all,

The Wonderbus just got some ignition systems upgrades. Compufire points
replacement and Tiger CDI. I'm sticking with the Bosch blue coil as there
does not seem to be any reason I can find to change it. I pulled the
plugs to open the gaps to the recommended .040''. The Wonderbus now
starts instantly and runs noticeably smoother. I like it.

I have a couple of questions maybe someone could help with:

1. This is a new Mexi long block 1600 DP. The plugs that came with it are
long-reach NGK BP5ES-A. I should pick up a spare set of something good.
Anyone have a strong recommendation?

2. Also, I noticed that #4's plug had some chalky powder on it. #1 had some
powdery soot. #3 and #2 were smooth, light-brown. I run California's 87
octane [(R+M)/2] Mystery Gasoline, and have a 34-PICT 3 carb. Normal 
variations?
