Greg,

When my engine was fresh I was still using the '74 tranny. I could make it
scratch (on pavement ...) when shifting into second gear. Lots of fun ..
Now, if I could only get my carbs dialed in right to regain at least some of
that performance.

Hi Marcus,

In 1986 I owned a 72 westy which underwent a porsche 914 transplant.
A huge improvement that even a 22 year old living at home could afford.

The bus would do 60MPH at the top of third gear and I could
powerslide through corners on logging roads.
