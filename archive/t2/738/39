I did a quickie Google on BP5ES-A .. most results weren't in English, but I was able to glean that the BP5ES-A is being sold by btlmex.com (http://www.btlmex.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=168), and that nobody seems to know what the -A means.  I would *guess* that the BP5ES would be just fine, but can't say for sure.  I'm gonna hit the send button and do some more research .. just 'cuz now I'm curious. :-D
