My mother has a '91 Explorer that she's driven more than 300K on the original,
never-rebuilt engine/transmission and is still running strong.  QC may be an
issue, but I think the real key is proper maintenance, plus how the vehicle is
driven.  My mother somehow always ends up with jobs that involve long,
uncongested highway commutes of at least 30 minutes each way, and she drives
*very* gently... very gradual acceleration and deceleration, slow on curves,
etc.  Not only has her engine lasted far longer than anyone expects of a Ford,
but her tires also seem to last for many more miles than advertised.

Bus content: my Bus might or might not have more mileage than my mother's
Explorer, but I know for sure that it's used up multiple 1600DP engines along
the way.  I have no way of knowing whether it's been driven 140K, 240K, or
340K miles... :-P

Cheers,
