Subject: rock pits nose repair & paint

Not to beat the horse on the rust issue, but my instinct is to use a filler
with a spatula (I've been restoring a lot of wood flooring of late).  But
the pits definitely have a little rust in them.  POR-15 then primer then
filler?  I want to POR-15 the whole DC (after patching rockers, floor, new
jackpoint etc., but reading back a ways in the archives I see that some
folks don't dig the results, you get brush marks etc. and primer doesn't
stick well.  My own limited experience with POR-15 actually gave me pretty
smooth results but that was on parts I could lay flat.  Maybe it can be
thinned and applied in lighter coats.  My tentative plan of attack is to
coat the entire vehicle (outside and in where I can get to it) with 2 coats
of POR-15 with a brush, sand it smooth, primer (probably the POR stuff) and
then take to a pro for paint.  Does POR-15 sand smooth? Thanks a lot
everyone.
