Subject: auto tranny accelerator cable linkage picture needed.

I'm now desparate.  I will gladly pay someone 5$
(five) U.S. American dollars if they have a 76-79
automatic bus and will take a picture of the linkage
at the transmission where the accelerator cable
connects and email the picture to me.  there is a
bracket thingy that the flexible tube fits in and the
the cable exits the flexible tube and connects to the
relay arm (for the lack of a better term) which then
connects to a rod that runs into the engine
compartment and connects to the throttle body.  I need
a picture of the bracket that bolts to the front of
the transmission that the rear of the flexible tube
rests in.  When I move my accelerator linkage at the
transmission from underneath the bus, I only have
about 1" of movement with the arm disconnected from
the throttle body. When I disconnect the accelerator
cable from the relay arm, I get 2-3 inches of movement
on the arm and can hear the kickdown click inside the
transmission.  The kickdown used to work but I think
the shop that reinstalled the engine after replacing
the torque converter seal left a piece off at the
accelerator linkage.  Many, Many thanks!  Greg
