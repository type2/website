Greg, I'm voting for the fan seal. You have too much oil inside the
fan shroud that has been picked up and thrown over the cylinders as
well as inside the heat exchangers.

I just pulled the motor from my 72 that leaked from the oil cooler. It
was so bad it cost me a quart of oil to drive it 30 miles to the shop.
I had no where near the mess you have there. Mine would drip onto the
exhaust and onto the TOP of the heat exchanger - no internal fouling
like you have.

In the past I've gotten minor amounts of oil inside the heat exchanger
from leaks at the valve cover gaskets when it finds holes in the heat
exchanger.

Anyway, I just cleaned up the oily crust from my heat exchangers and
the outside of my engine with hand-spayed purple degreaser (remember
the thread on this a few months ago?). Came out really clean and I
painted my heat exchangers too afterwards!

Best of luck,

John
