Check your engine bay vacuum with a long piece of clear aquarium tubing and
a glass of water held by the person riding shot-gun.

If you show any vacuum in the engine bay while climbing that hill, that is
causing you to run hotter than it should.

Also be aware that oil temps and head temps are seperate and not all that
related.
