Subject: 71 westy for sale albany, ny

the snow's melted and my westy needs a home. No engine but have everything 
but block, jugs, pistons, rings. 

Tranny, cv joints, brakes are all good. There's rust in all the usual places 
but the sliding door works well, this has been an east coast bus since 1987, 
that's how long I've had it.

Restore, throw an engine in or part out.

I have pictures if needed.

Make me an offer I can't refuse and it's yours, will consider trades of 
instruments, motorcycles and.....?
