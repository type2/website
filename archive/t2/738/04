Subject: Air Compressor / Blasting

Hey guys,

     I hope this isn't too off topic. There are a few bus parts that I'd like to sand blast... I was curious what I need in order to be able to accomplish this. I have a 60 gallon, 7hp (peak) Air Compressor. It's a single stage with a max PSI of 135. I've got the typical stuff.. water seperator and regulator. 

Is this all that i need to be able to power a sand / material blaster? 

I know that I'll need one of those "containers" or whatever they're called.. they've got the gloves, the window and keeps all the particles enclosed. Anyway I just wanted to make sure that that was sufficient before I acutally bought anything for it.


Thanks!

Todd
