Subject: Parting out a bus, worth the work? was- Re: [T2] 71 westy for

Hi,

I went and looked at this bus. I'm sure i could make back the price of
the bus from salvaging just a few parts. I dont know what I'd do with
what's left though. Give parts away, maybe sell a few used parts to
make it worth the effort and cover vehicle transporting (towing). Then
what, send it off to the junkyard? The though of what would happen
next insn't pleasant. [<crunch>]

There must be a lot of you out there who have taken the time and
effort. Is it worth it?

peace!
