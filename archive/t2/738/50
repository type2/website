Subject: Re: [T2] About Plugs

Hi Jason,

The fellow who is Akela in the local Cub Pack of our Scout group  
works for NGK. I brought this up with him the last time this thread  
came around. He searched high and low and could not come up with a  
reference to that plug here either.

His guess is that they did a special run for the mexican factory, and  
that code isn't available to domestic customers.


Happy trails,
