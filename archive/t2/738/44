Subject: Type 4 engine questions

Hi all, a few questions I'm having trouble finding info on.

All the type 4 case's I've seen only have ONE relief in the oil gallery, the
one which is next to the oil filter (AP and CJ motors). The Bentley shows in
the oil circuit two relief's. So, is it common to have two reliefs in the
circuit? In the case's I have with one relief, which relief is the one next to
the oil filter? (the relief to bypass cooler, or the relief from the oil
gallery to the sump). Or is the circuit for the single relief case different
all together?

Next is the cooling fan on the end of the crank. Is the fan and maybe even the
fan housing different on the vanagon air cooled motors? I've never seen one so
don't know.
