Subject: Re: [T2] 3 Liter Type IV

I tried to stay away from this thread, but here we go ...

110 hp is easy and can be achieved with all genuine VW parts. And the
drivetrain can well handle it (65,000 miles experience here ...). All you
need are some 914 2.0 ingredients (which is a bone stock T4 with 100 hp). My
engine did not cost more than a rebuild with stock bus parts. Up to approx.
125 hp and 2.2 L can be had on a budget. Beyond that you are getting into
expensive parts and expert machining.

200 hp out of a 3L type 4 is not impressive at all. When I picked up my
engine 10 years ago, my engine builder just had a street-legel bug in for
service: 2.7 L type 4 with approx 260 hp. That was an expensive drivetrain
(everything built to handle the power), but still less expensive than a 911
Carrera which it could keep up with on the Autobahn and this car looked
almost stock. Just slightly lowered with an exhaust that looked like a pea
shooter with larger ends. Best thing was the rear window decal "Jetzt um 5
PS starker" (now with addtional 5 hp). This sticker was used by VW when they
introduced the 40 hp engines.

The stock T4 engine had 65-80hp, so 150 hp would
be roughly double the amount of hp for which the
other components were designed.  A 100 hp 2.0
would itself be a hot engine with very
significant modifications.
