Use an independent hauler. I ususally pay around $0.65 - $0.75 per loaded
miles for long haules. Check out: http://www.ytmag.com/cgi-bin/haulquery.pl
and www.findahauler.com.

Good thing about these indepent haulers are price and the fact that they
will not shift your bus from one truck to another which large professional
haulers do. However, these guys are not always good at keeping a schedule.
So, if timing is not an issue - try an independent hauler. Most of these
guys are fellow car nuts who have decided to turn their addiction into a
business. They operate on a very tight margin - take that into account with
respect to the level of service you can expect.

If possible use PayPal for the downpayment. So far, I have only had one deal
to turn sour, but thanks to the use of PayPal I could press charges for
internet fraud (federal offense that the FBI does take serious).

I can p-mail you contact information for haulers I had good experiences
with.
