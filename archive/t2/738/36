Subject: picture needed clarification

I'm sorry to be such a pest.  In the following fiche:

http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Microfiche/t206100.gif

I need to know if # 24 is bolted directly to the
transmission or if #25 is a spacer that offsets #24
away from the transmission more toward the front of
the bus. I also need a guesstimate of the length of
#25 if it is a spacer.  I'm not sure what #25 does
from the fiche.  I am missing #25 on my bus and do not
get enough travel of the accelerator cable for
kickdown to operate.  tx, Greg
