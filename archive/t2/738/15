Are you Fuel Injected?
    
(1)  For whatever it's worth, the color of the engine
exhaust smoke is telling.  Blue=oil burning. 
Black=Likely too rich, fuel problem.  
   
(2)  I too have sooty looking plugs after 1500 to 2500
miles.  All 4 look the same.  I have a 78 GE engine
with Federal FI.  It has been suggested that I
consider an upgrade to a newer FI system; 79-83
California wiring harness, brain, and add the needed
oxygen sensor.  With the oxygen sensor feedback loop,
a feature my '78 does not have, the brain can more
closely adjust the mixture to reduce or eliminate the
soot problem on the plugs.
     
(3)  If you are Fuel Injected, I would pay attention
to the rail pressure at idle, and at RPM's as
suggested by Bentleys.
    
(4)  FI anomaly observed in years past:  If the air
flow sensor is stuck open either partially or fully,
then the system will run (barely), but will run very
rich.  Rich running would lead to fouled plugs.
