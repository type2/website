Well there in lie's the million dollar question.
My old CJ motor was removed for that very reason, once oil is hot, pressure 
is boarder line. I have not pulled it down to investigate.
My "new" motor with everything new I could source, now with ~25kmiles on it 
is quickly going the same way, but not critical yet.
A friend with a new purchase (his 3rd bus) is going through getting this bus 
up to daily use standard, and has the same symptoms, but bad enough to 
require immediate action (oil light comes on at hot idle). We have checked 
all the easy things so far and have found nothing obvious yet.
The common theme though is oil temp. Oil pressure does not become an issue 
until above ~85C (I think ~185F). Having to keep oil temps below this seems 
a bit much to ask for (and hard to achieve), so we are going through the 
whole system to find any issues.

So in short, no idea, but we need to find it!!
If it is bearing clearance, then that means my "new" motor was not machined 
to correct tolerances which is not good.
