Subject: Dirty engine pics

Hi Volks,

Allow me to point your browser window at what might possibly be the  
dirtiest images ever to get past a spam filter:

If anyone wants to take a look at the engine pics and confirm that  
the pattern of the oil originates at the oik cooler seals it would  
help ease my mind.

I know  it didn't come from the distributor or the oil pressure  
switch, or from the push-rod tubes... I can't think of too many other  
places thatb could make this much of a mess.

The silver lining is that the back of my bus sure won't be rusting  
any time soon.


Happy trails,
