Hey.. Just another "Axis of Evil" country. We've got German VW's (x3), Japanese Honda (x1), and lust for an Italian Fiat 500... There MUST be something wrong with me... <griN!> I try my best not to attend any WWII veteran gatherings... <bad humor I know>. Local friend is a WWII South Pacific veteran. Never said anything to me about my "fleet" but he did tell me he wouldn't TOUCH an Asian vehicle (he's a very good tranny specialist). I respect that!

Anyone hear the domestic auto makers are having problems again selling cars? Imports are killing 'em. Surprising to me b/c I think the current run of domestics are the best ever. Prob related to the domestics offering 101 different SUVs and 3 or 4 efficient cars that happen to be too bland compared to the imports (same old story). That said I really like the Ford 500. Looks like a Passat - a future car we hope to add to the family fleet - the VW 1st or maybe the 500 but I worry about the Ford quality after spending time in my sister-in-law's 65K mile Taurus this weekend... All the Fords and Chryslers in the extended family had serious issues before 135K miles. 

What can I say though. I drive vintage VWs which may need major engine service at 65K (heads). <griN!>
