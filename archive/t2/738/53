Did you verify that your oil filter is tight? I replaced oil-cooler seals,
oil pressure switch, and rear main seal on a 79 once only to find out that
my oil filter was a contributing - if not the main - problem ... I had
plenty of oil in the fan housing, too. I tightened the filter and everything
was good - but that was after a weekend of pulling the fan housing with the
engine installed.

Greg, I'm voting for the fan seal. You have too much oil inside the fan
shroud that has been picked up and thrown over the cylinders as well as
inside the heat exchangers.
