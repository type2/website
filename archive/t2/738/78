not sure why, I rebuilt my 2 liter engine about 6 years ago, have about
70k on this rebuild and still worry more about high oil presure than low.
  routinely get 70psi at startup and it rarely goes below 50psi even when
hot (220F-230F) and at idle.   I run Mobil 1  15W-50 synthetic in her.
now when rebuilding I put in a new cam, bearings of course. and a new
Melling oil pump that was honed in to perfect spec.

so far so good, I want 150k out of this engine at least.....

have no clue as to what your problem is, but a type 4 engine can get aand
keep good oil presure, unless I just have an odd one...??
