Subject: Oil Leak problem fixed

My "CV" engine installed in my '72 Bus sprung a leak.  It was dripping from
the fan housing.  I thought it was the shaft seal behind the fan.  After
ordering some parts from Bus Depot and Bus Boys, I took it apart.  It turned
out not to be the shaft seal.  Two things had happened.  The o-ring under
the oil fill spout had disappeared and the hose that went from the PCV valve
to the Aircleaner had collapsed.  I must have been blowing oil vapor out the
oil fill spout connection.  From there it entered the fan and made a mess.
With everything put back together, it seems to work fine now.  The final
proof will be tomorrow when I drive it to work.
