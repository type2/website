I'm doing this right now on my '75. Hundreds of small rust spots covering the
nose. I'm doing one section at a time, sanding it all down to bare metal. You
are then left with small black spots where the rust spots had been. I think
this is where some people make mistakes-those black spots are rust. I then
take my Dremel with a grinding stone and grind those spots down to clean
metal, which does leave gouges,of course, in the sheet metal. I then cover the
area with a thin skim of high quality filler ( Eagle Claw Glass, NOT Bondo).
This brings up another pet peeve of mine, most people refer to this type of
rust as "surface rust" (usually those selling a bus) - it's not, it's down
into the metal. If I can scratch it down to clean metal with my fingernail,
that's surface rust.   Jeff
