Subject: Corvair Powered Bus (Transvair)

Hello List-
I just realized that I no longer own a VW engine. I moved and my old westy
and
engine went to a list member who needed it for parts.  I am left with my 72
Bus
with a Corvair engine and transmission that I installed.  I have now covered
over 3k miles and need to change a few things.
Does anyone know another transvair owner?  I need some ideas and suggestions.
Please let me know. We could start a tranvair list.
