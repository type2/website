Subject: Re: [T2] Generator light/electrical problem

Ev,

Keep in mind that these "new" generators aren't really new.  I had very
similar problems with my '71 -- after my first generator failed
(understandably given its age?) I had three Bosch-remanufactured generator
failures in rapid succession, in the space of something like 3-5K miles.  I
finally gave up on the generators and installed an alternator, and have had no
electrical problems since.

Although the consensus of the list was that I just got unlucky with my series
of defective "rebuilt by Bosch" generators, I still will never, ever, ever
recommend that anyone replace a Bus generator with anything except a brand-new
alternator.

The alternator conversion eliminates the separate regulator and therefore also
eliminates any potential problems with wiring between the generator and
regulator.  You end up with a cleaner engine compartment with fewer wires, and
a much, much, much more reliable charging system.  (Note, however, that there
are some installation issues: you have to adjust your carburetor's accelerator
pump linkage to clear the alternator [I have pics], and some people have
reported needing to change to a lower-profile fuel pump as well.)

It also might be a good idea to replace your gen/alt pulley, just in case it's
somehow contributing to the failures (out of balance?).

Cheers,

- Miles
