Where are the Type IV engines most likely to have problems if the oil pressure is low? Wanting to build a 2nd GE block 2.0 for my Beetle this winter. 

In my case I had a 2.0 GE engine in our bus (pre-Corvair implant) with hydraulic lifters and while startup pressure was good, the hot pressure was sorry. 

Is that typically a crank/bearing clearance problem or a cam/bearing clearance problem? Is there a typical answer here? 

Had just enough pressure to keep the idiot light off at hot idle but I really think I could hear the rods rattling a little. 

I still have the engine, unrebuilt and standing by for reinstall if I ever tire of the Corvair implant. Making an effort to be able to go back to stock IF I ever want to. Engine/tranny swapped but bus unaltered. 

Chris
