Guys,

It was probably me and it **WASN"T** don't run Bosch plugs.

It was don't run Bosch PLATINUM plugs in your air cooled engines
at it makes them run hotter.

Not yelling, just want to make sure that we get it right.<grin>

I run Bosch plugs in my bus, but NGK's in some of my bug engines.
I have had mixed results with NGK's, but not the plug manuf, just the guys 
at the parts store selling me the wrong plugs in a mix of 12 at a time.

Cheers, dave
