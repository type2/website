Subject: Fw: [T2] About Plugs

Ever since someone posted that a Bosch rep told him to never use Bosch plugs
in aircooled engines, I've been using NGK's, since that's the way Bosch 
seems to want
it.  Seem to run fine. Tom

Gee, I use NGK's in six cars including my 70 bus, 1990 Nissan 300ZX Twin
Turbo, a $16,000 engine in an old 356 Porsche vintage race car, etc.

I also would be interested in something "good" to replace the NGK's I have
been using all these years.
