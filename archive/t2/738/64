LOL!!!

Tony, I can always count on you for a laugh!

I could tell a story about the first VW at the Texas Instruments office in 
Dallas....and his buddies who got tired of listening to him brag about the 
gas mileage and started adding 1/2 gallon of gas to his tank every day at 
lunch....this went on for several weeks and the guy was just gushing about 
it....untill they then started removing a 1/2 gallon every day at lunch!

My Mom worked there and knew all of them!

Cheers, dave
