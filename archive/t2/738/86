Subject: I found the picture I needed

Hey folks, at:

http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/pix/537570.jpg

this picture shows exactly what I'm looking for.  At
the far right of the picture (toward front of bus)  ((
you must imagine a bus is sitting over this
transmission))  You can see the remnants of the
flexible tube that the accelerator tube attaches to
which is close to the "Z" lever thingy on the side of
the transmission.  Clearly there is a tubular spacer
there that offsets the flexible cable tube mount
toward the front of the bus.  Now if only I knew how
long that spacer was!!  Thanks to everyone for your
emails trying to help me.  Greg
