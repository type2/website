Subject: Pre-76 front seats into a 78??????

I just recently purchased a set of front seats for my bus.  One problem.  My 
bus is a 78 sunroof champagne addition.  I love the orange plaid and plan to 
paint the bus to match.  I was wonder if anyone has installed earlier seats 
into their bus??  can it be done without welding??  It almost appears that the 
track width is close to the same dimension with the exception that it uses only 
the outside of the track. (where the 76 and newer use both inside and outside 
of the track...please help before i mess up the seats or my bus.

thanks for you help
