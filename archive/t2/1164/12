thanks,.
I'm thinking I quit posting when I was about a year into the Engine Ceramics
company, that would be about late 2003.
I spent lots of time tracking potential Ceramics coatings business and then
sold my 83 Air Cooled Westy.
From the Westy I moved on to a Porsche 76' 912e.
Seems the road gets longer every-time I start listing favorite cars / busses.
From the 912e, I had a 62' 356c, 98' 911 cab and most recently a 93' 928GTS.
I recently came close to buying a 78' Westy with very low miles but the price
kept climbing and being an experienced Bay owner I knew the purchase price was
just the beginning of a long relationship involving me on my back.

I still get a P MAIL once in a while from Terry K and I must express my
regrets about Boston Bob passing.

For anyone interested in tracking the adventures on THE CAT, I can only offer
a substitute of the light sided story of Gadget Guy Goes Mobile that I
published to the list in episodes back in about 2001.
I recently published the book Gadget Guy Goes Mobile on Amazon and it sells a
few copies once in a while.
Most people that have some remembrance of the cat episodes enjoyed the stories
very much.
The book is available in Kindel and Print Additions.
