Subject: Re: [T2] Should Say 1.5 Millionth Bay Window Made in Brazil!

Jim dad bought our '89 for $16,500 in September '90, and it had been on the
lot since very early in '89, perhaps late in '88.  Jump seat interior, power
windows, locks, mirrors, etc.  I have the sticker somewhere, and you are
probably correct in that it was at the time pushing $18k as optioned, but that
was a vehicle by then far more (by arcane VW standards) advanced than a
baywindow.   And it was of course woefully overpriced at the time as well,
which is why VW was having such a hard time passing them, and dropped out of
the US market for the bulk of the 90's unable to price a EV at a price anyone
but us VW nuts would even look at.

Anyway when they are asking $2-3k more
than a similar Transit, which has been refined probably 5? times over the same
time period (basically even more times than a comparable top line VW
transporter) I don't see how they can possibly still sell them frankly.  I've
ridden in a bay with a 1.6 or 1.8 inline nearly 10 years ago and aside for
heat really didn't see it any better than a 2.0 '78-79.  Which would be fine
if it was still '78 or even '85 or so.  I guess their indestructible
reputations and reasonable offroad/bad road ability keeps them chugging out.
 
With the plethora of small van choices worldwide today off from our isolated
shores, I just can't really imagine they sell them.  I also can't imagine they
need to sell them for that.  I mean tooling for all of the thing was paid for
decades ago aside from the powerplant, which is just lifted right out of
something else I'm sure.  I simply wonder what sort of profit margin on these
things.

The top of the line Bays were listed at 30,000 USD 
10-12 years ago in Mexico.  That would translate to a stripped 7 seater by US
standards.  The Mexican base model was like 20,000 USD and was little more
than a shell.  Plain Jane US spec Vanagons were listed for around $18,000 in
1990-1991 IIRC, while Campers were around $24,000.
