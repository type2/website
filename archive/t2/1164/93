The thing that astounds me there, is that they still even have 3% market share
at a base price of $25k.
 
I mean really, $24,142 for a new bus?  Makes even
the most ludicrously priced bays on samba seem like veritable bargains.  I'm
certainly not knocking our favorite transportation, but I don't see that I'd
pay much more than $18-20k for one new today.  I mean even with trendy
upholstery I don't think creature comforts are much more than they were in
1968 save for a better heater, the bit more power out of that 1.4 though that
probably doesn't do much more than a 2.0 flat Type 4 in real driving.  Bet it
gets better mileage though.
 
YMMV on this of course.
