Subject: Re: [T2] Helicoil time

I hear this same comment all the time John,, and it is definitly opposite my
findings too.. in fact , a lot of racers will helicoil engine parts before
they machine them... because the alum parts that get taken apart and back
togther a lot will wear.. etc etc etc..
but I have found ,  the coils that are not seated properly, ie, the top end
of the thread is above the surface, then they may come out with the
fastener..  i see this in spark plug repairs all the time,  and as soon as
you install the coil with that tail end just below the surface the plug
seats on, then you'd never know there was a helicoil in there..
I like them,   if that matters at all.. lol
me, I'd install a helicoil in that application... next time you go to work
on it, you won't have to hassle with the repair issues ,,ie drilling out the
new hub, or whatever.
