Subject: Power windows for my '74 Westy

Hi, Canada calling!  I had a 'post' from this list, or "Samba", about using
'86 BMW sedan 325e, rear door power window mechanisms for a '74 Westy, but
have since ..'lost' that post, and was thinking ..are there other more
recent..'other' brands, that 'listers' have used,..that will do the same
job..power up the front windows in a "Bay" using existing 'stuff' from other
brands?
Cheers
Scoggy
