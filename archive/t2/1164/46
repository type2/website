Greg -

211 905 853 is the lock cylinder where the key goes into.  They either
work or do not work out of the box. They do not wear down with time,
at least not six months, not even 6 years.  More like 30+ years.

What I (and others) are talking about is the Electric part which is
where the problems probably lie, Part Number 311 905 865 A.

Bus Depot appears to sell the quality Euromax switch.

Airhead/VWG sells this same switch too:

Regular tools, steering wheel puller and having a Bentley Repair
manual are the usual things to have when replacing either one.
Steering Wheel and Steering Lock w/housing have got to come off to
access to do the job with either 68-70 or 71 onwards.
