Subject: Peregrine starts!!!

Thanks to motivation from the list, I completed the repair to  
Peregrine fille today and started her up. She's been out of commission  
since early March. I had a classic double-stupid as I started up (I  
pumped up the oil first). The engine cranked, but wouldn't catch, so I  
went back to the engine compartment to see what I'd forgotten to do.  
Sure enough, I hadn't plugged in the AFM. I did and then tried to  
start again. Nothing. I went back and looked at everything.

And then I remembered: when I drained the old gas, I put a clamp on  
the fuel hose. Once I took that off, she started right up.

The tappets are loud, and the exhaust is steamy. It's dark now, so I  
didn't drive around to let the tappets pump up. Tomorrow is good enough.

Mark
