Subject: Re: [T2] Crane XR700 ignition system question

I have an ancient capacitive discharge system that recommends .035 with a 
standard coil. Remember that due to the electronics, the coil  output 
voltages are much higher than with a standard 12V ignition, therefore the 
spark can jump  a larger gap and put more energy into the ignition process.
