Subject: 81 air cooled into earlier van

BTDT

the 81 has a different blower housing (heater blower works off of the
alternator versus the blower hanging down from above like earlier loaf
vans). your existing one should work
also, the breather housing is different, but will work. as far as the
injection, as long as you have the correct intake you should be fine. I
have put a 1.7 in an 81, and an 82 into a 75
after changing the heads to the oval ports. if the engine is a 2.0 from a
car/Porsche, it will have higher compression pistons and run warmer. as
with all of these engines in vans keep the tin
tight and make sure the thermostat is working. there may be a dipstick
issue, but I have not had a loaf in so long I forgot how there's is handled
