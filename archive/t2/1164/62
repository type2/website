do you have a garage door that raises or double doors that open out. the 
double doors give you more overhead clearance.

however letting enough air out to get into the garage as long as you are 
not down on the rims, and moving "Dead slow" will probably not destroy or 
damage your tires.

of course in all things like this YMMV.

my suggestion is if you are going to work on your engine pull it in nose 
first.  and will you have enough overhead room to remove the engine once 
inside.

good luck (I refused to live where there are HOA but sometimes you have no 
choice I guess)
