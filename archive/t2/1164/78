Subject: Re: [T2] 81 2.0L with 79 square port heads

The '79 (same as all bus) filler will bolt right on, the oil filler is still
there in a Vanagon unlike a 411/412 or 914 block where you have to bore the
hole (not an on the engine job.)  I'd leave both, easiest.  But I guess if you
wanted to plug one the vanagon would be the one.  I've never done it but
figure with an assembled engine one could pound in a steel taper pin sized
appropriately (which you'd need to figure by trial and error.)  But the
vanagon dipstick is quite unobtrusive, no reason not to leave it.  Perhaps
with the quality of available dipstick boots for the bus one, the vanagon
makes more sense actually (seal is higher above the oil level) but blocking
the bus style one would take a bit of smashing and brazing or something as
well.  And really, I've never trusted the Vanagon style one quite as much. 
I'd look at the fuel lines carefully though, consider replacing the ones on
the ring unless they are really only 2-3 years old at
 most but maybe not do the injectors since they are more of a pain if they are
under 7-10 years.  I mean in reality a lot of people (me included) have fuel
lines much older on their daily drivers than on their buses.
 
YMMV.

Thanks everyone! My injectors/ lines are only
a couple years old but I'll inspect them; I'll get new seals across the board.
John - so then the 79 dipstick assembly bolts right on, and I can choose to
block one off or keep both?
