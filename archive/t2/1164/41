I am of the mind that it is the ignition switch myself.

There are three repros of this switch out there:

1.  KMM manufactured, usually in a grey colored box with "KMM" on it.
Quality of these are shoddy, the internals generally fall apart after
a few months. Most likely Chinese made.

2. Meyle Chinese made.  When I pulled them out of the box (3 of them),
they popped/fell apart in my hands, not very well put together.  Might
be the same maker for KMM.

3.  Euromax manufactured.  I know, some of you out there don't much
care for items with a Euromax label, but they do make stuff that is
quality.  I know this because I use Euromax items on my own vehicles
and those here at KGPR/Airhead/VWG as "guinea pigs" for the past
several years.  Same switch I have installed on a friend's 68 Bug
(actually 2 of them), the boss' 69 Ghia Convertible and more for the
past 3 years.  Not a problem with these so far.

Just my nickel's worth....
