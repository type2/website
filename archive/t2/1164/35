I'm not eliminating the ignition switch, but it is relatively new (6
months old).  Although, it was installed by someone with questionable
skills, it worked perfectly for 6 months.

In retrospect, it always felt like there was a lot of resistance when
starting; like the batter wasn't strong enough.  But once it started
cranking it fired right up. So it was only an issue in the first 2
seconds after turning the key to the start position.
