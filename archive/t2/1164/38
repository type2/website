Subject: Re: [T2] Helicoil time

Mark, not as critical as you think actually here.  The taper does all the
work, the bolt (and even the key) are largely superfluous once the taper is
well seated, so do as good a job as you can, but fan balance and drive aren't
going to be effected once seated.  The bolt assembly just needs to be strong
enough to pull that taper down, it doesn't fit that closely inside the hub
after all.  Might consider a bit of loctite on the taper as well in this case
just so it doesn't even have to pull down as much and gets a quick sort of
immediate set without waiting for time/corrosion to lock solid.  Just get the
helicoil in solidly and relatively straight but worry more about not
overdrilling and having good thread engagement on OD of the helicoil.

Problem: hub to crankshaft bolt broke, drilled out, ez-out broke, dremeled
out, big mess.

Condition: engine in Vanagon

Next step: use hub as a guide to
drill for helicoil. I may add a bushing to the hub, in a jig held down by the
three fan bolts.

Any words of wisdom?
