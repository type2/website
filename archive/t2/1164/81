Subject: Cheap air compressor update, on sale tomorrow (well today for

FWIW folks, I note that the cheapo Husky compressor I mentioned a few months
ago from Home Depot is on sale again for $79 tomorrow as a Black Friday item. 
Down from the whopping $99 it normally is.  Again, this is what it is, a
cheapo small compressor, but I've been beating one senseless daily for about
6-8 months now up in my 3rd floor loft for general construction with it still
running fine.  For an apartment dweller without a lot of room not a bad deal. 
Will run pneumatic nailers, 1/2" impact wrench, fine, probably won't run a
spray gun.  If you go in with realistic (low) expectations of it, you won't be
dissapointed.
