Subject: Trade early for late bay key blanks (also have T1 blanks)

So, I have a pile of the late split/early bay key blanks, although not OEM,
these are vintage US made blanks (Taylor V78G) that came with a key machine my
dad purchased in about 1975.  Should fit '66-67? to '70 or so, but don't quote
me on that.  This is compatible with an L profile.  I would like to trade even
up for generic R profile blanks or a couple for a NOS VW R profile blank.

I
actually have a slew of others I'd do the same trade on but I'm not 100% sure
what they are, all VW compatible Curtis or Taylor blanks.
They bear the V9,
V10, V11, V12 codes.  I'm pretty sure the V9 are SC compatible ('61-'66 T1), I
think the V12 are SV compatible ('61-'66 T1), the V11 is a mirror of the V12
which is I think an SU key ('61-'66 T1), and the V10 is apparently a T1
glovebox key, and perhaps fits A1 FWD cars (entire car? I need to try that as
I will likely keep them in that case.)

Anyway if anyone wants to trade, shoot
me an email.

John
