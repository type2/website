Subject: Re: [T2] Bicycle Handlebar Tape for Steering Wheel

Google "cork bicycle handlbar tape" and you have choices of color; it's 
self adhesive and I've used it on 10-speeds, insulates and is 
absorptive.   There is also foam/vinyl handlebar tape out there- usually 
it is in 2 pieces though and you likely need both to do the wheel?  You 
can find in "van shops" foam wrap for steering wheels that I've used, it 
is a one piece cover you wrap with lanyard material.
