Hi Gregory,

Have you checked to see if there isn't a short in the line that
runs from the starter switch to the solenoid?

I'm having a strange
problem with my 1968 bus.  When I turn the key to
the acc position, the two
dash lights go on as they should and the
fuel pump (I have an electric fuel
pump) kicks on.  When I turn the
key to start the engine I get one click an
all power goes out.
