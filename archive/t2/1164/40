Subject: Odd Electrical Problem

I would say you may have a grounding problem where the battery  
grounds to the frame or engine.  A redundant ground (extra ground)  
from the battery negative to the engine might solve the problem  A  
jumper cable can be used make this extra ground as a test.  What I  
have found in some of my older cars is that when the ground corrodes  
it becomes a semi-conductor, it can carry enough current to make the  
headlights go on along with all the accessories but as soon as you  
turn the key to start the car the added current breaks the circuit  
and it all goes dead.  The corroded cable can't carry that much  
current.   Also the starter is grounded to the engine and the engine  
to the frame, you might have to ground the engine to the frame,  
rubber engine mounts don't conduct electricity.  The power will find  
its way back to the frame and battery if it can.  If the only  
connection is the throttle cable or clutch cable they could melt  
under the current. (Extra grounds won't cause any problems. )
Hope this helps,

John I.
