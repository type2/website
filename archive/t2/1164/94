The top of the line Bays were listed at 30,000 USD  10-12 years ago in 
Mexico.  That would translate to a stripped 7 seater by US standards.  
The Mexican base model was like 20,000 USD and was little more than a 
shell.  Plain Jane US spec Vanagons were listed for around $18,000 in 
1990-1991 IIRC, while Campers were around $24,000.
