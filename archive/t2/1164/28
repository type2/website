Subject: Re: [T2] but was the quality OK?

Actually the quality of VW do Brazil parts on the average (but not
all) is quite good, at least in my personal experience for the past 35
years.  It's the Brazil AFTERMARKET produced items that suffer in
quality control, something that parts purchasing people like myself
have to deal with everyday.

VW's Mexico plant operates in the same way since the 80s which
accounts for poorly painted yellow fender assemblies on the New Beetle
in 1998 and had to be recalled back then.

This same manufacturing system is utlized in VW's Chinese Factory for
the past several years as well.
