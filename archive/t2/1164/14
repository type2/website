Subject: re:Wiper hoses

Well.the pressure in the hoses lasted a day or two. I guess I will replace
the rest of the hoses. I figure the leak has to be between the tank and the
switch-as the hoses between the switch and the nozzles is only under
pressure when you push the button. 

 

I'll try to replace those hoses this weekend, and report back.
