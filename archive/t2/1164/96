Subject: Re: [T2] Should Say 1.5 Millionth Bay Window Made in Brazil!

Having looked at other SUV's and minivans at the time we acquired our 
'91 Multi, I don't thing Vanagons were overpriced, I would argue to the 
contrary.  What killed them was the lack of power and a horrid 
reputation for frequent break downs (just think Vanagon syndrome, which 
VW never correctly in the 5 years of Digifant production and so little 
grease in the CV's that many were damage within 15,000 miles, etc) and 
the need for major engine work on almost 100% of the vehicles before 
they reached the 90,000 mile mark.  Their parts network down right 
s*&ked as well.

I think a lot of the cost for the Brazilian Bay probably comes from the 
amount of hand assembly.  We are talking about a vehicle that had its 
last major redesign in the 1960's.

I mean tooling for all of the thing was paid for decades ago aside from 
the powerplant, which is just lifted right out of something else I'm sure.
