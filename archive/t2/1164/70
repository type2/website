Subject: Re: [T2] Tire deflation question

  1.5" is not that much compared to total drop possible.
You can deflate enough so that the rim is not resting/pressing the tire 
as it rolls.
Can you reinflate the tires once it is in the garage with the door shut? 
You should have more height clearance after the door is closed than when 
open- ie it is usually the door frame that is the limiting factor.
Sometimes the frame can have trim rewmoved to give more clearance but 
then the door may not seal against it at the top.
