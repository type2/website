Subject: Bicycle Handlebar Tape for Steering Wheel

Has anyone wrapped their steering wheel with handlebar tape?
I ask because by
steering wheel is coming apart in my hands during these damp mornings.
Also, I
don't want to pay the +$40.00 for a Wheelskins cover.

I'm looking at using
something like this tape:

If so, then how is it working out for you?
Any photos of your
setup would be great.  Especially of the area around the steering wheel
spokes.
