Subject: re:Bicycle Handlebar Tape for Steering Wheel

I got a steering wheel cover thing from my FLAPS. I remember it was sort of
a foam back  thing, that was supposed to look like a leather wrapped wheel.
It stretched around the wheel, then you wrapped it with this plastic rope
sort of thing. Works pretty good, more comfortable than the skinny wheel. I
think it was less than $20.

 

It has held up for more than a few years now.
