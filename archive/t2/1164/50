I have mine hooked up to the positive side of the battery mostly because I 
have dual starting batteries and can isolate one or the other or both. 
also VERY IMPORTANT, make sure any switch that can be used with more than 
one battery is a "make before break" switch otherwise you can fry your 
voltage regulator.

also never use a battery cutout to stop the engine while running except in 
an emergency since it can also damage the voltage regulator (in alternator 
equiped buses)

it has been a great time and work saver while working on the bus, I just 
stall the engine by pulling a vacuum hose before shutting off the switch 
in my 78 bus.  I have also hooked up a rear start switch on the same panel 
right next to the cut out switch. and the rear start switch bypasses the 
cold start relay in case something happens to the relay.
