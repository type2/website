Subject: Put Bus away for the winter

Well, I'm, going to be Busless for the next four or five months.
Put my '78 Westfalia in the garage today for Winter storage while I had the
time.
Earlier this fall I went over the heating system and put a new exhaust on the
BA6, and it was working great, but I just can't bring myself to subject it to
the extremely corrosive salt and the rocker panel sandblasting cinders that
they spread on the roads around here.  Too many cheap Geo Prisms out there
that can be sacrificed instead
The only storage that I have makes it too hard to get to on the days with no
salt or cinders.
I sure am going to miss it!
