Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel injectors

As always I'd mention that you fortunate scum in the lower 48 can get a new
injector at
Advance Auto (if you are near) for a whopping $41 each.  I've
bought countless sets of
these over the years with very good luck.  So
consider carefully that vs having existing
rebuilt.  The new style tips are
supposed to provide better pattern and longetivity as well.
Probably made in
India, but WTF.

I know someone gave me the name and address of
someone in the mid-west,
Ohio, I think that cleans fuel injectors and replaces
the hoses too. If
anyone has this info, please let me know.

Thanks and have a
great Thanksgiving!
