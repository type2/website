Subject: Re: [T2] Reupholstering a 1968 Bus seat

When I purchased my 71 Westfalia I removed the covers to replace my pads and
repair a few springs.
I purchased my padding at Jo Anne's Fabrics which is just another craft and
fabric store.
However I actually used a strapping wire to re-attach broken springs and metal
webbing. This worked fine and have been supportive and working for a couple of
years now.
As for the padding I did not use foam rubber padding I used a 2 inch thick
batting. I used a spray adhesive to spray the frame and placed the batting so
it rolled over the edges and recovered the seats.
It is comfortable and looks like original.
