Subject: 81 2.0L with 79 square port heads

Hi All,

My poorly rebuilt T4 2.0L FI is finally in meltdown mode. Whilst
considering my options, I've run across a fellow who states he has an 81
2.0L with 79 square port heads. Are there compatibility issues with my
stock 79 FI system and other computer-run ancillaries that would confound
an easy swap?

Thank you for the help, Mike
