Subject: Re: Crane XR700 ignition system question

Having run many XR700 systems on all of my original point-style VWs
since 1971 - before Crane bought what was then Allison in Duarte, CA
(I grew up near the plant), they've always said and I have always
continued to run my spark plug gap(s) at .028".

Hand one of these installed on a 73 Toyota PU, where the standard gap was .035".

Getting ready to install one on my 914 this winter.  Best ignition system IMHO.
