Thanks for the opinions folks.

2car garage, overhead door - even if I recess it as far as possible, the
top edge of the door frame is still too low. I think I can get it in
without getting down to the rims.

My house (rented since marriage) isn't HOA... unfortunately my wife's is.
She wasn't really planning on working on vehicles when considering a
purchase, so I can't blame her there...!

Cheers, Mike



If it's just a few feet, there won't be any damage
