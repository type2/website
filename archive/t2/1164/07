Courtney,

Roughly, and VERY roughly speaking a gallon is sufficient.  Some
idiot on here once kept claiming he could paint a bus in 2.5 qts or something,
I've painted a lot of Buses/Vanagons and never done it in under 3 even just to
the beltline when doing reasonable amount of jambs, etc.  3 qts usually means
you buy the gallon as it is almost always cheaper or a wash.  AND, even a
gallon can run short if doing a lot of underside, a lot of interior, on a
camper where you are painting solid color all the way to the driprail.  Now
that is my Delstar rule of thumb BTW, which is why I caution to look closely
at how things mix.  Delstar mixes 2 parts paint to 1 part clear stuff (reducer
and hardener, actually 8:3:1 but that means 2:1 color to clear stuff.) So what
I'm saying is that it will be a solid  5-6 quarts of mixed sprayable material
to do 3 full coats of Delstar on a bus.  You need to look closely at whatever
you are buying to achieve that much mixed
 paint as different manufacturers and lines vary greatly.  You will not cover
with anything in 2 coats unless you are really good, and likely not even then,
or will polish through it in a year or two.  3 should be sufficient for
enamel/urethane, lacquer could take a solid 4 (it is still out there again,
and not a bad driveway choice, Duracryl will last in solid color, even red or
yellow for 5-10 years of even daily use if kept waxed up) and as I've
mentioned 5-6 coats can happen with some things.
 
I'm not knocking the Omni
again there BTW, like I said, I've covered with Arctic White in 2 (left over
in a can, shot a beater Golf), and one would surmise white wouldn't cover as
well as beige, but I swear that damn Ivory Beige took 6 coats of Omni AE to
cover spot repairs done in light gray primer.  Same painter, same gun, same
technique.   Anyway a gallon of most paint presuming it mixes to 6 qts of
sprayable product should do you.  If you are doing a lot of underneath, oddly
I'd say consider shooting that last (not what I'd usually do) so if you do run
short and need a quart you are not shooting the exterior with a different
match.  It actually is an OK way to go, cause you can hit the edges a bit when
shooting the top, then just mask it all off with like some 6" wide paper taped
to the pinchweld seam along the bottom and shoot from underneath without
overspray.  Buses generally speaking are fun and easy to shoot, all flat
panels, very little
 overspray problems, and pretty much by the time you get around the vehicle
you are shooting the next coat, so it is just sort of 1 hour of continuous
spraying and then done.  Shooting the roof sucks if a hardtop, just from a
logistics POV, if you need to, start there first, and good scafold style
planking stably arranged on both sides of the van.  Personally BTW as a tip,
the way I was taught (and I laugh every time I see some yokel on powerblock or
some idiot in my Hemmings Classic Cars doing it otherwise) is that you paint
all panels on the car.  I shoot jambs and the backs of doors and panels off
the car, hang them, mask the jambs backtaping or using foam rod, then shoot
the topcoat so all panels are shot at the same time in the same orientation. 
Not too important in single stage solid color, but still worth the effort. 
And goes without saying, pull all the glass if you haven't obviously for the
paint.

John

Thanks John, VERY informative. I will see who our local dealers are. I only
went into one place this year so far, and that was a Sherwin Williams dealer.
Appreciate your time and thoughts on this. I'm in B.C., so paint season is
about the same as yours up there. :-) One last question, how much paint for a
van assuming it's going to take 3 coats? Any idea?
