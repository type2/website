Subject: Re: [T2] Helicoil time

OK at best?  Gee that is interesting, in the aerospace field we used helicoils
all the time.  For both high heat, and high stress, we sank them into new
parts made of aluminum or titanium to reinforce certain areas.  Now certainly
we used other insert styles as well, but used helicoils with regularity. 
Nothing wrong if properly inserted to spec.
 
As a personal point I don't like
helicoils as much as solid inserts but solid inserts are always much thicker.
 
But Jon does have a real good point in simply overdrilling and using a
larger fastener.  Would be a hell of a lot easier than bothering with an
insert.  As I mentioned previously this is not actually at all a critical
area, and in actuality, this fastener is probably nearly always massively
overtorqued by people using it to spin the engine against compression
pressure.  It is just there to pull that taper on down, once that taper is
locked, it doesn't do much of anything.  Everyone has felt the force required
to break a well set fan hub with that bolt removed, the clamping work it does
is minimal at best.

I would avoid the helicoil in that
application. Helicoils are OK at best
and really don't work well on high heat
and stress areas that need specific
torque settings.
