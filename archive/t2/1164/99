Subject: A little bit of emphasis

I happen to be thinking about buses, Westfalia campers in particular,  
and what it is about them that distinguishes them from other campers.

The answer, the most important distinguishing feature, is light. VW  
Westfalias - especially baywindows and Vanagons - have an openness, a  
sense of transparency, that no other camper has. That's partly the  
windows and partly the layouts, all of which are open and airy.

When the curtains are open and tied back, there's nothing threatening  
or menacing about a Westfalia.
