Great tips, thank you all. Gerald does win the "You Didn't Think Of That!"
Award tho - I do plan to remove the engine soon and will have to get the
Bus into the garage again - didn't think about potentially having to
compensate for the weight loss to squeeze the beast back in.

I thought about the wheel dollies, but I think it's too risky for me -
controlling the weight of the Bus with no pointed steering would require a
lot of people, and have a high chance something bouncing off something
somewhere.

Hope everyone has a relaxing holiday. mike
